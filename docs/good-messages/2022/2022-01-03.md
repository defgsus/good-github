PEP 570 -- Python Positional-Only Parameters.

This commit adds full-blown support for [PEP 570 -- Python
Positional-Only Parameters](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0570).
Given the triviality, the rear view mirror of regret suggests we kinda
should've implemented this sooner. Better late than never, best

Do not allow focus to drift from fullscreen client via focusstack()

It generally doesn't make much sense to allow focusstack() to navigate
away from the selected fullscreen client, as you can't even see which
client you're selecting behind it.

I have had this up for a while on the wiki as a separate patch[0], but
it seems reasonable to avoid this behaviour in dwm mainline, since I'm
struggling to think of any reason to navigate away from a fullscreen
client other than a mistake.

Ditch PagingDataAdapter when displaying saved news from DB

- PagingDataAdapter sucks when displaying data that needs to be deleted via swiping, as you'd need to call PagingSource.invalidate and other stuff, it's a pain. As we're not really using a PagingSource for displaying items from the DB, we'lll just use a normal ListAdapter

2nd Birthday for STE + Shortcut Icon Updates + Maskable Exports

Announcements: -- first time for this category? :0 --
- Smart Text Editor turned 2 years old on the 24th!!! This has been a crazy journey, and I never saw it coming. I'd say this is my first full programming project, aside from my Minecraft resource packs (this seems more programming-y to me, hehe). I love this project just as much as 2 years ago, and I may have less updates to it as time goes on, but that's because it's getting even closer to what I imagine it to be! I have a few more ideas to be named that I'd love to see in the app, and I will continue towards adding those as I go. I am about to start my next set of programming classes at my college this coming semester, and I can't wait! I started Smart Text Editor during my first proper programming class in high school, and it has been steadily improving all the way to now! I am actually using STE on my Chromebook to write this right now, and push this update through the Git CLI using Crostini Linux. Crazy to think that is possible now. PWA functionality from the modern browsers have certainly helped with that. On that note, off to the regular changelog, haha! Thanks for reading this and having interest in the project, whoever you are. Maybe you are in the future, mysterious...

Additions:
- Expanded the Maskable App Icon images to include all three standard resolutions. Usually this includes 192x, 512x, and 1024x (The last one is a standard I am adding for myself, might as well have an ultra-clear one just in case. It looks nice too :) Commonly 192x and 512x will do just fine for a PWA). In the case of the App Maskable Icons, I hadn't made a 192x version, only 512x and 1024x. Might as well add consistency there if I am doing it for the other icons too!

Changes:
- Adjusted the size and scale of the sprites used in the Shortcut Icon images. They weren't quite the same size as the icon canvas, so I made them a little larger using Figma. Much easier than when I made them using Google Draw a year ago, haha!
- Updated the sprites fill colors, as they were using the old #aaaaaa text color for STE. Modern STE text uses #cccccc now, it's a little brighter. Must've been an oversite I missed during The Big Refactor last year when the app color palette changed a little bit.
- Fixed the clipping issue that was occurring on Chrome OS for the PWA shortcuts icons, as Chrome OS appears to prefer to use a maskable image for the shortcut option. Originally I thought the shortcut icons didn't need the same icon-type variations as the app icons require, but they do. Makes sense!
- Alongside the last note, each of these icons now have all 3 scale types, 192x, 512x, 1024x. Before I only used the base SVG shortcut icon and a 192x export, and now I use the base SVG, 192x, 512x, 1024x, and maskable variants of those with the same export sizes. So, from 2 icons to 7 for each shortcut. Maybe overboard, but why not! Figma makes things really easy for me :]

Removals:
- Removed the SVG Smart Text Editor logo image, as it requires the use of an `@import` CSS call to load the logo font, and these don't work unless the image is running in the direct source of the page, as inline SVG. I have the option to keep the image, and save the logo words as SVG `<path>` tags instead of plain text, but I haven't used the image for anything yet, so might as well work on something else more needed for my fixing.

Happy 2nd Birthday Smart Text Editor, can't wait to see where you go over more years to come!

Update index.html

I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Let's do that again. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. In life you need colors. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.  We can fix anything. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. There we go. Look at them little rascals.

wrote initial "markdown" rules; added console app

today, brave souls, we battle a most devious foe: _regular expressions._ if you can withstand their powers of confusion, great is the reward.

i am pleased to tell you that i do _not_ need to teach you how to use them. i'll happily tell you _about_ them, though.

`PoemdownConvert.cs:19`: here begins the code block (until line 26) where you'll find the fantastic tangle of symbols that are named "regular expressions". the `Replace()` function takes (text-to-search, pattern-to-match, replacement-text-for-matches) input parameters, and returns (text-with-all-matches-replaced). regular expressions represent a _pattern_ or _key_, used for finding matches within any given text.

if you wish to take a peek behind their curtain, search for a regular expression _interpreter_. copy all the symbols within the `"` quotes. for example: the pattern part of `@"(_[^_\n]+_)"`  starts and ends at the `(` and `)` parentheses. paste that pattern into the interpreter and behold the absolute wonders of this tiny piece of text.

for those that dare to learn, regular expressions are an incredibly compact, incredibly powerful tool to wield upon text. in the space of a few delicately-selected keystrokes, you can immediately scan _any_ passage of text for matches to your pattern, snip _out_ the text of each match, and splice _in_ a per-match-customizable replacement texts.

and of course, _text_ is not limited to _sentences, etc._ for regular expressions and computers, _text_ (a.k.a. `string`) does not have any meaning beyond a simple a list of characters. each character, one little event after another, arranged forever in this order, awaiting the RegExp ReadHead.

and what is a character to a computer? it is simply a number. and what is that number? it is simply a list of bits. the `0` and the `1`. a lovely image of the duality of all things. the computer knows them only as _off_ and _on_, _resist_ or _flow_. _although:_ it knows those things at untold billions of times per second, and will execute our every instruction with an unimaginable capacity for precision.

_tangent:_ when you get angry at the supercomputer in your pocket for freezing up during your nineteenth game of _whatever_, you probably curse the machine. don't be foolish. the machine is doing _exactly_ what it has been told to do. by us. it's just that we're not always very good at the _telling_. or, we _are_ pretty good at it, _but_, your pocket supercomputer is executing so very many things all the time, and conflicts arise. one particularly pernicious conflict that can cause a freeze is called a _deadlock_: at the same time, two different tasks both request exclusive access to some data, and upon hearing of the other, each politely await their turn until the end of time (or until they are `kill`ed by their fleshy, unfathomably biological god).

_recursion up:_ and probably up again, there must have been another tangent in there at some point. so, _regular expressions:_ a function which takes (your-careful-keystrokes) as an input parameter and returns (a-million-years-of-search-and-replace-by-hand-with-zero-mistakes-in-fraction-of-a-second).

computers are fantastically powerful _tools._ use them. for _good._

**stop letting them use _you._**

feat(glue): support partition index on tables (#17998)

This PR adds support for creating partition indexes on tables via custom resources.
It offers two different ways to create indexes:

```ts
// via table definition
const table = new glue.Table(this, 'Table', {
  database,
  bucket,
  tableName: 'table',
  columns,
  partitionKeys,
  partitionIndexes: [{
    indexName: 'my-index',
    keyNames: ['month'],
  }],
  dataFormat: glue.DataFormat.CSV,
});
```

```ts
// or as a function
table.AddPartitionIndex([{
  indexName: 'my-other-index',
  keyNames: ['month', 'year'],
});
```

I also refactored the format of some tests, which is what accounts for the large diff in `test.table.ts`. 

Motivation: 
Creating partition indexes on a table is something you can do via the console, but is not an exposed property in cloudformation. In this case, I think it makes sense to support this feature via custom resources as it will significantly reduce the customer pain of either provisioning a custom resource with correct permissions or manually going into the console after resource creation. Supporting this feature allows for synth-time checks and dependency chaining for multiple indexes (reason detailed in the FAQ) which removes a rather sharp edge for users provisioning custom resource indexes themselves.

FAQ:

Why do we need to chain dependencies between different Partition Index Custom Resources? 
  - Because Glue only allows 1 index to be created or deleted simultaneously per table. Without dependencies the resources will try to create partition indexes simultaneously and the second sdk call with be dropped.

Why is it called `partitionIndexes`? Is that really how you pluralize index?
  - [Yesish](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/indexes-or-indices-whats-the-deal-2016-05-12). If you hate it it can be `partitionIndices`.

Why is `keyNames` of type `string[]` and not `Column[]`? `PartitionKey` is of type `Column[]` and partition indexes must be a subset of partition keys...
  - This could be a debate. But my argument is that the pattern I see for defining a Table is to define partition keys inline and not declare them each as variables. It would be pretty clunky from a UX perspective:
    ```ts
    const key1 = { name: 'mykey', type: glue.Schema.STRING };
    const key2 = { name: 'mykey2', type: glue.Schema.STRING };
    const key3 = { name: 'mykey3', type: glue.Schema.STRING };
    new glue.Table(this, 'table', {
      database,
      bucket,
      tableName: 'table',
      columns,
      partitionKeys: [key1, key2, key3],
      partitionIndexes: [key1, key2],
      dataFormat: glue.DataFormat.CSV,
    });
    ```

Why are there 2 different checks for having > 3 partition indexes?
  - It's possible someone decides to define 3 indexes in the definition and then try to add another with `table.addPartitionIndex()`. This would be a nasty deploy time error, its better if it is synth time. It's also possible someone decides to define 4 indexes in the definition. It's better to fast-fail here before we create 3 custom resources.

What if I deploy a table, manually add 3 partition indexes, and then try to call `table.addPartitionIndex()` and update the stack? Will that still be a synth time failure?
  - Sorry, no. 

Why do we need to generate names?
  - We don't. I just thought it would be helpful.

Why is `grantToUnderlyingResources` public?
  - I thought it would be helpful. Some permissions need to be added to the table, the database, and the catalog.

Closes #17589.

Working sleep and other niceties!

Thanks to @thewhoyouare and @OCD0711 and many others, and a whole heap of luck, I've stumbled across a combination of SSDTs that work for my XPS 9700 4K.

I've added some SSDTs to the repo including SSDT-PS2K.aml which toggles the touchpad when you press PrtSc (F10), but retains touchscreen function. This is very useful if you find you get phantom mouse movements with the touchpad while typing.

@thewhoyouare Repo solved my ridiculous power management settings which was chewing through my battery. I've used CPUfriend with a very low TDP-down of 800Mhz now, you can adjust it to your preference.

Now, to sleep! I was getting the Dell logo on wake up and had to reboot with hard power down. Then I found that by turning off the Logo/Early Signs of Life option in the BIOS, I was able to get proper sleep. Only 1-2% battery drain over night, checked with this Terminal command: 

pmset -g log|grep -e " Sleep  " -e " Wake  "

Issues still unresolved:
- Audio through internal speakers not working
- Microphone (internal) not working
- USB working intermittently, especially through the Thunderbolt Dock (Dell TB15).
- Ethernet working through USB-C dongle but not through Thunderbolt Dock
- HDMI out not working (purple haze, or no signal at all) when going through TB->HDMI but works fine USBC-HDMI. The framebuffer connector type has been adjusted but I think it's to do with TB vs USB-C (alt mode) conversions.

Finally, I'm using rEFInd as my initial boot loader to dual boot Windows / Mac so that's what you'll find in the Boot.zip.

I added some changes to make the generated classes compile properly without having to be manually reordered.

Summary:

* When the 'generate' button is clicked, each class is added to a Class Dependency Graph, and each class that class references is added as a depenedency.
* There are two dependency types - POINTER and INSTANCE.
    * POINTER references can be solved with a forward declaration.  However, a simple reordering can solve that dependency and limit the forward declaration spam at the top of the generated file.
    * INSTANCE references can only be solved with reordering.  If class B contains an instance of class A, A must come before B in the generated file, no way around it.
* The graph is then recursively traversed - starting at nodes with no dependencies - with classes being added to the 'ordered' class collection.
* Circular dependencies (A points to B points to C points to A) are solved with forward declarations (C comes before B comes before A, with A being forward declared)
* The result is the output has fewer forward declarations and classes don't need to be manually reordered.  In my DayZ Reclass file (which inspired this work, because it takes me a lot of time manually reordering every time I generate the output) there are only 5 forward declarations with 356 classes.

Details:

The graph class itself is pretty simple.  It maintains a mapping of CNodeClass pointers to DependencyNodes.  Each node knows what class it represents, and has two vectors of edges - incoming edges (another class depends on this one) and outgoing edges (this class depends on another).  Each edge knows what node it points to, as well as whether the dependency is of POINTER or INSTANCE type.

Edges are generated by walking each node in a class and adding a dependency edge for each pointer, instance, instance array, and pointer array.  Parallel edges (duplicates) are not added, nor are simple recursive edges (a class has a pointer to an instance of that same class).  Other types (function ptrs?  Can we prototype those in ReClass?) may be necessary here, but these were all I could figure out without asking someone.

ClassDependencyGraph            depGraph;
    // Add each class as a node to the graph before adding dependency edges
    for (auto cNode : this->m_Classes) {
        depGraph.AddNode(cNode);
    }
    for (auto cNode : this->m_Classes) {
        for (size_t n = 0; n < cNode->NodeCount(); n++)
        {
            CNodeBase* pNode = (CNodeBase*)cNode->GetNode(n);
            NodeType Type = pNode->GetType();
            switch (Type) {
            case(nt_pointer):
            {
                CNodePtr* pPointer = (CNodePtr*)pNode;
                CNodeClass* pointerClass = pPointer->GetClass();
                depGraph.AddEdge(cNode, pointerClass, DependencyType::POINTER);
                break;
            }
            case(nt_instance):
            {
                CNodeClassInstance* pClassInstance = (CNodeClassInstance*)pNode;
                CNodeClass* instanceClass = pClassInstance->GetClass();
                depGraph.AddEdge(cNode, instanceClass, DependencyType::INSTANCE);
                break;
            }

            case(nt_array):
            {
                CNodeArray* pArray = (CNodeArray*)pNode;
                CNodeClass* instanceClass = pArray->GetClass();
                depGraph.AddEdge(cNode, instanceClass, DependencyType::INSTANCE);
                break;
            }

            case(nt_ptrarray):
            {
                CNodePtrArray* pArray = (CNodePtrArray*)pNode;
                CNodeClass* pointerClass = pArray->GetClass();
                depGraph.AddEdge(cNode, pointerClass, DependencyType::POINTER);
                break;
            }
            }
        }
    }

Ordering dependencies in the graph is simple in naive cases.  Just start at nodes that have no dependencies (leaf nodes) and recursively visit dependencies, adding them to an ordered class vector as you go.  This works great until you hit circular dependencies - you'd recurse until death.  That's where forward declarations are needed.  If you hit a node that is already being processed, you know you've thrown that ass in a circle.  So that's when you throw your hands up and forward declare - but you can only do that for a POINTER dependency, not an INSTANCE one.

You can see in this graph that DayZPlayer instances Entity which points to physicsObject which points to DayZPlayer.  And if that's the order you hit the nodes in, you're fine - just forward declare DayZPlayer.  However, there exists a path from gpWorld -> World -> N0000120E -> Entity -> PhysicsObject -> DayZPlayer -> Entity.  In that case, when you realize you're in a cycle you're at an INSTANCE dependency and you can't solve it with a forward declaration.

I wasn't sure what the correct way to handle this was, so I kind of improvised a solution.  At the beginning of graph solving, all nodes which have incoming INSTANCE type dependencies are marked.  Then, when they're visited during recursion, if they're being visited across a POINTER dependency edge, they're forward declared and not processed further.  So when you hit gpWorld -> World -> N0000120E -> Entity, it knows Entity has incoming INSTANCE dependencies, so instead of recursing and ending up in DayZPlayer, it adds a forward declaration for Entity and bails out.  Then, later (and along a different path that doesn't go through Entity), DayZPlayer is visited normally and it recurses into Entity, and all is well.

With forward declarations generated and the classes in dependency order, output goes on as normal, except instead of iterating of m_Classes, it iterates over the set of forward declarations and the in-order vector of classes instead.

To generate the visualized graph, I put a ToDot method in the DependencyGraph, which generates a GraphViz Dot representation of the graph.  I left it in as it may end up being useful in troubleshooting in the future.

Voting automatization and democracy are beautiful but DAOs are bullshit. You must be either naive or idiotic to believe that DAOs and flat organizations will ever work. Let the kids find this by themselves.

wrapper.c: add x{un,}setenv(), and use xsetenv() in environment.c

Add fatal wrappers for setenv() and unsetenv(). In d7ac12b25d3 (Add
set_git_dir() function, 2007-08-01) we started checking its return
value, and since 48988c4d0c3 (set_git_dir: die when setenv() fails,
2018-03-30) we've had set_git_dir_1() die if we couldn't set it.

Let's provide a wrapper for both, this will be useful in many other
places, a subsequent patch will make another use of xsetenv().

The checking of the return value here is over-eager according to
setenv(3) and POSIX. It's documented as returning just -1 or 0, so
perhaps we should be checking -1 explicitly.

Let's just instead die on any non-zero, if our C library is so broken
as to return something else than -1 on error (and perhaps not set
errno?) the worst we'll do is die with a nonsensical errno value, but
we'll want to die in either case.

Let's make these return "void" instead of "int". As far as I can tell
there's no other x*() wrappers that needed to make the decision of
deviating from the signature in the C library, but since their return
value is only used to indicate errors (so we'd die here), we can catch
unreachable code such as

    if (xsetenv(...) < 0)
        [...];

I think it would be OK skip the NULL check of the "name" here for the
calls to die_errno(). Almost all of our setenv() callers are taking a
constant string hardcoded in the source as the first argument, and for
the rest we can probably assume they've done the NULL check
themselves. Even if they didn't, modern C libraries are forgiving
about it (e.g. glibc formatting it as "(null)"), on those that aren't,
well, we were about to die anyway. But let's include the check anyway
for good measure.

Implement LRUCache and use it

Since the lru-cache in version 4 (the last compatible with IE11) needs
specific setup when used with Webpack 5 (process polyfills), it makes
GoodData.UI unusable with create-react-app 5 that migrated to Webpack 5
and makes it impossible to alter these settings out of the box.

As a workaround, we wanted to migrate to another LRU implementation,
however none of the reasonably used existing implementations were good
for our particular use cases (IE11 support and maxAge):

* quick-lru: does not support IE11 because it uses generators.
  Older versions do not have maxAge which we need
* tiny-lru: does not work with cache size 1 (I sent a PR to fix that
  but I do not expect that to be merged, the package is quite stale)
* hashlru: does not have maxAge

So I ended up implementing a LRU cache in our code base. The code uses
the hashlru algorithm and is heavily inspired by quick-lru (which we
should migrate to once IE11 is dropped and get rid of the version
added in this commit).

One particular caveat of the hashlru algorithm (that is not that
important in my opinion) is that the maxSize is not precise:
the cache can hold more keys than the maxSize, but not by much (it very
much depends on the particular sequence of inserts and evicts). It will,
however, never be more than twice the maxSize. Since we use the maxSize
as more of a "do not cache millions of items here" kind of mechanism,
I think this caveat is ok for us given the performance gains
and relative code simplicity.

disp: msm: Handle dim for udfps

* Apparently, los fod impl is better than udfps cuz it
  has onShow/HideFodView hook, which allows us to toggle
  dimlayer seamlessly.

  Since udfps only partially supports the former one,
  we'd better kill dim in kernel. This is kinda a hack
  but it works well, bringing perfect fod experience
  back to us.

WIP: Attempt #3 (?) to deal with feedback not associated with an internship payment

The questions I put into the new intern and mentor feedback model are
pretty solid.

Ugh, I *hate* the names of these new feedback classes. I think they
should be something like 'Feedback2FromMentor' and 'Feedback2FromIntern'

The fact that we have class names like 'InitialMentorFeedbackv2' is
super confusing.

So, here's the new plan:

MVP
---

x Rename
  Initial{Mentor,Intern}Feedbackv2
  to
  Feedback1From{Mentor,Intern}

x Use Feedback2From{Mentor,Intern} instead of
  Second{Mentor,Intern}Feedback

- Make sure tests pass - tests don't currently pass for the intern
  feedback (which is expected because I didn't update that test yet to
  use the new Feedback2FromIntern fields)

x Manually test that interns and mentors can fill out forms

x Manually test that intern, mentor, and staff views of feedback work

- Move older feedback models to the end of home/models.py and comment
  that they are deprecated

Longer term
---

- Write an export function that exports all prior feedback collected
  - CSV export is probably the easiest format for quick checks
  - JSON export might be nice for preserving data types for data science
  - explore Django management dumpdata command
- Export feedback from all cohorts that are not currently active
- Stop relying on the final payment authorization data to determine if
  an internship is inactive. (See detailed plan below)
- Delete all feedback objects from the website production database

Active contacts changes
---

We need to show all "active" contacts. Active contacts are people who
should be subscribe to the mentor mailing list and/or the Outreachy
Zulip chat. Who an active contact is changes during the year.

When an internship cohort is almost finished, and the community CFP is
open for communities to sign up, the active contact list includes:
 - coordinators from communities approved to participate
 - approved mentors with approved projects from approved communities
 - approved new mentors for internships that are almost over

(The last case is a bit of a corner case that we can handle manually. It
does rarely happen that a mentor gets sick or is otherwise unable to
complete their mentor duties, and we find a replacement mentor. But
usually these cases are something Outreachy organizers are aware of and
can manually add the new mentor to the mailing list and Zulip chat.)

Once internships from the last cohort end, some mentors may choose to
unsubscribe from the mentor mailing list. So we don't want to
re-subscribe a mentor for an internship that has ended.

Once the internships for the new cohort begin, we don't want to
subscribe mentors who didn't select an intern for their project. Some
first-time mentors don't find an intern, decide they don't want to
participate in Outreachy again, and they unsubscribe themselves from the
mentor mailing list. Re-subscribing them causes annoyance.

  - Revise intern review page:
    - make the URL take a cohort
    - Put links to each cohort in a staff dashboard section
    - make sure the intern review page
      displays any details the 'active internships' page currently displays
    - Make intern review page list internships at the top by most recent end
      date (and show feedback status)

  - Put the list of contacts for the current cohort on a different page
    - have the contact list take a RoundPage slug
    - move the instructions about mailman from the staff dashboard here
    - list approved coordinators for all communities
    - list approved coordinators for all communities approved to
      participate in this cohort
    - list all approved mentors with an approved project in a community
      approved to participate in this cohort
    - list all approved mentors for approved projects in approved
      communities with interns who are approved by the Outreachy
      organizers and in good standing
    - list interns approved by Outreachy organizers and in good standing

Adding links to talk by Javier Maestro and David Pope of Facebook that
was missing from 2016 hbasecon operations track at Javier's request...
see below:

From: "J. Javier Maestro" <jjmaestro@ieee.org>
Date: Fri, 3 Dec 2021 13:38:12 +0000
Message-ID: <CABvji04C66wr4niSCEEc9gNib_ah9j995nw1EOEnwnpAmhXVuA@mail.gmail.com>
Subject: An email from time past!
To: stack@duboce.net

Hi Michael!

We briefly met at HBaseCon West 2016, I used to work as a Production
Engineer in the HBase Facebook team with Elliot Clark, Mikhail Antonov,
etc. I'm writing out of the blue with a weird request for some help to mend
the HBaseCon pages =F0=9F=98=85

I (together with another co-worker) presented a talk on containerizing
HBase. I don't particularly enjoy presenting in conferences, so I've only
done it two times in my professional career. However, that HBase talk went
quite well and I was happy with it. So, fast-forward a few years, I went to
refresh my LinkedIn and... when I went looking in the HBaseCon website /
archive page for the record of the talk, there was nothing to be found. It
was gone, as if we never gave the talk.

I remember that, at the time, we were told that some talks would not be
recorded because they had some issues / complaints from Facebook in the
past... and that's my best guess as to what happened to the talk. Not being
recorded, I guess someone just removed the entry from the table thinking
that it might have never happened.

I feel a bit silly asking for some help about this, since it's something
pretty small and insignificant, but at the same time, since I've never done
many public talks, it did make me feel a bit sad that the only official
record of it is now gone like tears in the rain XXD

I tried a couple years ago to send an email to dev@hbase.apache.org but I
never heard back. Since you have been so involved with the HBase project
and the community, I thought you might know someone I could talk to
directly and see if they could add the record of the talk to the HBaseCon
and Archives pages (http://hbase.apache.org/www.hbasecon.com/ and
https://hbase.apache.org/hbasecon-archives.html). The slides from the talk
are here:
https://speakerdeck.com/jjmaestro/hbasecon-2016-west-containerizing-apache-
hbase-clusters

Again, sorry for the cold-email and thanks a ton in advance for your time
and help!

Cheers,

Javier

"10:50am. I am up.

11am. Focus me, let me start. Yesterday I finished Solo Leveling. I think it was a 3-4 month hiatus since I last read it, and now that I am on this path I am thinking about art more critically. It definitely makes great use of 3d, at least for the backgrounds. Coloring and drawing all those city buildings, with such a level of precision would be impossible on a weekly schedule otherwise.

Let me resume the Mantaflow tutorials.

11:50am. https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=2021

I should cover the animation tutorials at some point as well. The sooner the better I guess.

12:10pm. https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=2981

Hmmmm, this might be of interest to me. I thought I would be doing the scene of Luna jumping out of the pool with dynamic paint, but I could use this as well.

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=3069

This upwards splash is what I am looking for.

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=3591

What is he doing here?

Ah, he is keying it to the surface emission.

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=3922

He is recing the introduction series to animation for how to use the graph editor.

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=4066

I wonder if it would be possible to speed up these simulation through novel hardware.

12:45pm. 20m more to go and I am getting distracted like a monkey. Got this message.

///

Hi. I am interested what you post about Spiral, thus I keep up your history from time to time. Recently it seems like you are going through hard times financially, so I thought I would be able to give some advice as someone who also struggled this same way a few years ago.

A few disclaimers before that. First, I am not a "senior guy", nor product manager, nor a manager, or anything like that; never been. I have always coded for a living - what you'd call a "wage slave". Second, I of course do not know you, so take the following for what it's worth.

It feels like the biggest problem for you is that no one is going to hire someone who seems difficult to work with. It does not matter how knowledgeable or eloquent you are if you seem like a PITA to deal with, specially given that you do not seem to have experience in working with other people. From a recruiter's perspective (I assume) it does not make a sense to push for a candidate which might not be mature and "workable" enough for a role. So unless you make an effort to look approachable, serious and sane, or otherwise said as "someone who doesn't have their head up their ass", you'll continue to give off this unpleasant vibe for some.

If you're aware of this to some extent, then this impression will help you in future endeavors, even outside of getting a job. The general idea is that no one will want to collaborate with someone who seems difficult to work with. This is definitely not about changing who you are, it's about how your behavior and presentation affects the impression others have of you.

In case you feel like this is all true to some extent and want to start changing your life, I'd also recommend looking for other provinces or countries nearby. Sometimes the problem is lack of offers around where you live, but it might be better somewhere else.

///

I'll reply to this later. Very rarely, I get 'advice' from 'concerned' parties and it should all be sent into the trash. Lol'd at the part in the end where he recommends I move out (to different countries) and start doing random shit for random people to 'get my life together.'

Right now, I have my parents providing shelter, food, laundry and what else. If I yield to the impulse to go on meaningless adventures I'd lose all those benefits and won't be able to do things like study art. If I'd become a professional programmer back in 2015, I'd have made money, sure, but I'd have only cultivated shallow, if broad selection of skills. In order to ignite the Singularity you need to dive deep into the right direction.

Let me get back to the video.

People do not get it - having a comfort zone is a good thing, not a bad thing! People telling you to spread out and do things outside your interest are your enemies!

Imagine a scene from 100k years ago: 'Yes Ooog, you might have women, food, shelter and family, but you are still a failure.' Points to the jungle. 'You should consider going to that wild beast infested place, that is the only way to get your life in order. Go get the shinny trinkets.'

Totally not an enemy or a guilible moron.

Actually as a matter of principle, I won't reply to the people sending me this shit anymore, two times was enough. It can just stand as it is in this journal as an example to others.

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=4437

Hmmm, really. I thought that shader was only for shading...

His explanation does not make sense, I'd expect the displacement modifier would be what I need to actually displace the mesh. But using adaptive subdivision feels like a good idea. I should keep it in mind.

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=4500

My god, he really had to play around to figure this out. The programmer in me really hates this kind of thing. But still it would just result in slight visual differences so it is not that important. Just doing the basics would look fine. People have a tendency to nitpick too much.

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=4720

Wait what is he doing here?

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=4726

Why did the gold splotches appear here? What is going on? I think he probably cut off the video and moved to a different segment.

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=4766

I'll have to figure out how he is isolating a model. It should not be hard to find now that I know this feature exists.

https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=5160

It is really cool of him to explain everything he did. He is a true artist.

Chapter 5 - Mantaflow Rain / Blender

Let me have breakfast here. I am long overdue on that.

3:25pm. That was a good rest, let me go for chapter 5. These tutorials aren't too hard. Nothing in Blender is, but there is a lot of ground to cover. It is not hard to go from A to B once you know how to walk, but before that, you first need a map.

https://youtu.be/4XJHc5xUFoM?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=375

This is a really interesting way of doing it. I wouldn't have thought of doing it like this.

https://youtu.be/4XJHc5xUFoM?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=641

I wouldn't have known to bake the particles.

https://youtu.be/4XJHc5xUFoM?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=861

Let me just pause this so I can ask an obvious question - just how am I going to use this to simulate Luna jumping out of the pool?

It took him an entire hour just to simulate a puddle. Just how much would it require for an entire pool?

Hmmmm...

I'll have to think about how I am going to do that.

https://youtu.be/4XJHc5xUFoM?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=1093

What happened to the container?

https://youtu.be/4XJHc5xUFoM?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=1376

What is this effect on the can? It is as it is drawing dust into itself.

Chapter 6 - Mantaflow Foam Particles / Blender

This tutorial is on pouring liquid into a glass.

As tedious as going through these tutorials is at times, I'd be a lot worse off without them. So I need to keep going forward. Let me do it.

https://youtu.be/9MD56F-aVcQ?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=620

What is this?

4:25pm. > Select and object and press: SHIFT+H: “Isolate” the selected object. It hides everything but the selected objects. ALT+H: Exit “isolate” mode.

Easy enough. I am surprised he could even isolate the foam particles.

I need to focus, I seem to be lurking the SW thread on the side.

https://youtu.be/9MD56F-aVcQ?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=995

He did the same trick in the previous video. Can you really just multiply the env textures like this? How does that work?

Chapter 7- Mantaflow Explosions / Blender

Now it is finally time for explosions.

4:45pm. I am just taking a break, I'll start soon.

Holy, Princess Principal has a second movie? I just keep downloading movies recently. This is crazy. Now if only somebody would compress Gup to something reasonable. 5gb is too much.

4:50pm. Let me leave it for later. Time for explosions. Then it will be splash's turn. After that I am done with the playlist. Though I am not sure I'll have the will to do the slash today. Just the explosion one is 75m long.

Let me do it.

I need to do it.

https://youtu.be/E4kk1vGDmNU?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=644

He mentions that Houdini gives a lot of stuff ahead of time including explosions. I keep hearing about Houdini over and over. It might be worth getting.

https://youtu.be/E4kk1vGDmNU?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=789

I am surprised he is putting all those force fields everywhere. He is kind of chaotic when it comes to the more programmatic aspects of setting up a scene, but I guess it works for him since the stuff in the previews always looks amazing.

I think when it comes to particles he should have just randomized and he'd get what he wanted anyway.

https://youtu.be/E4kk1vGDmNU?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=1261

What is going on, the burst is too brief for me to study it.

https://youtu.be/E4kk1vGDmNU?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=1441

I'll really want to figure out how to render animations. Isn't there a setting for that? Yeah, Render Animation as opposed to Render Image. I am guessing it would render all the frames start to finish. I'll have to try it out at some point.

Right now I am just watching vids.

5:45pm. Focus me, stop reading Twitter thread on Research In Motion. Let me finish this video. Only half of it left to go.

https://youtu.be/E4kk1vGDmNU?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=2811

I am not sure I am following at this point. Where are these ripples coming from?

These tutorials have a curve. At first they are fun, but now they are extremely tedious. I just want to get them over with so I can get to the more interesting stuff.

Hrmmm, when did he do the ground smoke? I thought it was just a flat plane?

https://youtu.be/E4kk1vGDmNU?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=2745

I had to rewatch in order to understand it.

I think graph based computational capabilities of AI chips would be really good for physics simulations, but it would take a lot of work to integrate that. Maybe I'll end up working on it at some point. Who knows where life will lead me.

https://youtu.be/E4kk1vGDmNU?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=3313

More node abuse.

https://youtu.be/E4kk1vGDmNU?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=3482

Let me stop this, I can't stand this anymore. When it comes to doing explosions I'll revisit this. I wouldn't remember anything even if I watched this, and my boredom meter has been maxed out. I got the gist of using particles to emit flames.

Let me take a look at the splash video.

I want to know how to do the pool splash. Explosions are a secondary concern for the time being.

6:30pm. That video is just a rehash of an earlier one. Ok, it is fine. Let me skip it then.

Blender user tries Houdini for the FIRST time!

Let me watch this.

...What a waste of time. Let me go get lunch.

7:10pm. I am back. Well, it was not entirely useless. At least I got my first look at Houdini.

Now what is next?

This thing. Thankfully these videos are rather small. I've really been hoping to cover all of the physics simulations rather than just the fluid.

The trouble is that he keps jumping back and forth rather than getting it done; he could have cut down on the video size significantly.

I need to keep going. Before I start my own stuff, I want to go over all the phyisics stuff. It will be important in the future.

I'll want to cover the clothing as well.

I think after I deal with physics, I will have made a large stride in understanding Blender and will have closed a major gap in my knowledge. It would be great if one day I could just work on what I want without being hindered by my tools. That day will soon come.

Right now, let me take a rest. No way do I have anymore mental energy for studying."

GEODE-9872: Make test framework code assign ports (#7176)

* GEODE-9872: Make test framework code assign ports

PROBLEM

`DistTXPersistentDebugDUnitTest ` failed in CI because it accidentally
connected to a locator from another test
(`ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest`).

CAUSE

`ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest` attempts to restart a
locator on a port in the ephemeral port range.

Here is the sequence of events:
1. `ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest ` started a locator on an
   ephemeral port. In this CI run it got port 37877.
2. `ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest` stopped the locator on port
   37877.
3. `DistTXPersistentDebugDUnitTest` started a locator on an ephemeral
   port. In this CI run it got 37877.
4. `ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest ` attempted to restart the
   locator on port 37877. That port was already in use in
   `DistTXPersistentDebugDUnitTest`'s locator, and as a result the two
   tests became entangled.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS

`DistTXPersistentDebugDUnitTest` uses `DUnitLauncher` to start its
locator. By default, `DUnitLauncher` starts its locator on an ephemeral
port.

`ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest` uses `ClusterStartupRule` to
start several locators. By default, `ClusterStartupRule` starts each
locator on an ephemeral port.

SOLUTION

Change `DUnitLauncher` and `ClusterStartupRule` to assign locator ports
via `AvailablePortHelper` if the test does not specify a particular
port.

I considered changing only `ClusterConfigLogatorRestartDUnitTest` to
assign the port that it intends to reuse. But:
- That would fix only this one test, though an unknown number of tests
  similarly attempt to reuse ports assigned by framework code. Numerous
  of those tests have already been changed to assign ports explicitly,
  but an unknown number remain.
- It is quite reasonable for this test and others to assume that, if the
  test framework assigns a port on the test's behalf, then the test will
  enjoy exclusive use of that port for the entire life of the test. I
  think the key problem is not that tests make this assumption, but that
  the framework code violates it.

Changing the test framework classes that tacitly assign ports
(`DUnitLauncher` and `ClusterStartupRule`) makes them behave in a way
that tests expect.

Python tracer for profiler (#67407)

Summary:
This PR instruments the CPython interpreter and integrates the resulting trace into the PyTorch profiler.

The python tracing logic works by enabling `PyEval_SetProfile`, and then logging the minimal information to track every time python calls or returns from a function. A great deal of care has gone into keeping this process very lightweight; the `RawEvent` struct is only two words and doesn't do anything fancy. When a python function is called, we have to do extra work. If the call is to `nn.Module.__call__`, we simply incref to extend the life of the module. Otherwise we check if we have seen the function before, and if not go through the (somewhat expensive) task of saving the strings which we then cache.

To actually get a useful timeline, we have to replay the events to determine the state of the python stack at any given point. A second round of stack replay is needed to figure out what the last python function was for each torch op so we can reconstruct the correct python stack. All of this is done during post processing, so while we want to be reasonably performant it is no longer imperative to shave every last bit.

I still need to do a bit of refinement (particularly where the tracer interfaces with the profiler), but this should give a good sense of the general structure.

Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/67407

Test Plan:
```
import torch

class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(2, 2)
        self.relu = torch.nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        return self.relu(x)

def call_module():
    m = MyModule()
    for _ in range(4):
        m(torch.ones((2, 2)))

def top_level_fn():
    with torch.profiler.profile(with_stack=True) as p:
        call_module()

    p.export_chrome_trace("test_trace.json")

top_level_fn()
```

PS: I've tried to comment liberally, particularly around some of the more magical parts. However I do plan on doing another linting and commenting pass. Hopefully it's not too bad right now.

--- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---
Your Aunt Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a thank you card. However, there's a small problem: she signed it "From, Aunt Sue".

You have 500 Aunts named "Sue".

So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you the gift. You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine! Just what you wanted. Or needed, as the case may be.

The My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM for short) can detect a few specific compounds in a given sample, as well as how many distinct kinds of those compounds there are. According to the instructions, these are what the MFCSAM can detect:

children, by human DNA age analysis.
cats. It doesn't differentiate individual breeds.
Several seemingly random breeds of dog: samoyeds, pomeranians, akitas, and vizslas.
goldfish. No other kinds of fish.
trees, all in one group.
cars, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.
perfumes, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few kinds.
In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these. You put the wrapping from the gift into the MFCSAM. It beeps inquisitively at you a few times and then prints out a message on ticker tape:

children: 3
cats: 7
samoyeds: 2
pomeranians: 3
akitas: 0
vizslas: 0
goldfish: 5
trees: 3
cars: 2
perfumes: 1
You make a list of the things you can remember about each Aunt Sue. Things missing from your list aren't zero - you simply don't remember the value.

What is the number of the Sue that got you the gift?

Your puzzle answer was 40.

--- Part Two ---
As you're about to send the thank you note, something in the MFCSAM's instructions catches your eye. Apparently, it has an outdated retroencabulator, and so the output from the machine isn't exact values - some of them indicate ranges.

In particular, the cats and trees readings indicates that there are greater than that many (due to the unpredictable nuclear decay of cat dander and tree pollen), while the pomeranians and goldfish readings indicate that there are fewer than that many (due to the modial interaction of magnetoreluctance).

What is the number of the real Aunt Sue?

Your puzzle answer was 241.

Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: **

At this point, you should return to your Advent calendar and try another puzzle.

If you still want to see it, you can get your puzzle input.

Disable false positive from clang-tidy

Clang-tidy is smart enough to understand that the conditional is never
updated in the loop body. It will let you get away with it if it can
prove that the conditional is always false, but that is not always
possible.

Here is an example where it's not able to prove it, and thus gives a
false positive. This is a minimal reproduction of an actual case I hit
in production, where `function` is picking the function based on some
`constexpr` logic related to which type argument is currently being
tested.

```
int f();

TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE("reproduction", "", int) {
    const auto function = []() {
        return f;
    }();
    const int error = function();
    REQUIRE(error == 0); // clang-tidy complains: bugprone-infinite-loop
}
```

I did not choose to add this test to the test suite, since we're not
running `clang-tidy` in CI afaik. To run it manually, simply add the
snippet above somewhere and run clang-tidy with
`--checks=bugprone-infinite-loop`. Or see an example at
https://godbolt.org/z/4v8b8WexP.

The reason we get the infinite loop warning in the first place is the
conditional at the end of this `do`-loop. Ideally, this conditional
would just be `while(false)`, but the actual content of the
`REQUIRE`-statement has been included here too in order to not loose
warnings from signed/unsigned comparisons. In short, if you do
`REQUIRE(i < j)`, where `i` is a negative signed integer and `j` is an
unsigned integer, you're supposed to get a warning from
`-Wsign-compare`. Due to the decomposition in Catch2, you lose this
warning, which is why the content of the `REQUIRE` statement has been
added to the conditional to force the compiler to evaluate the actual
comparison as well.

This was discussed on Discord today, and an alternative approach (which
I don't have time to implement) would be to in the decomposition replace
the comparison operators with `cmp_less` and friends. These are C++20
though, and would have to be implemented manually. I am also not sure
it's a good idea to "magically" change the semantics of `<` when it's
used inside a `REQUIRE` macro.

Another alternative approach would be to trigger this warning in a
different way, by including the content of the `REQUIRE` macro in a
different way which doesn't affect the for loop. But I don't have enough
of an overview here to know where would be a good place and how to test
that I didn't break anything.

tests: Use `temp_dir` as `tmp2_dir`, drop `temp_dir` if canceled (#9601)

If you currently cancel the test during the plot setup phase it just
removes the whole directoy and with it all the test plots for no good
reason. At least in my opinion its just annoying. Sure, you can clone
the `test-cache` repo and copy them over if this happens but i still
think its better to just merge this PR :)

reenables poppets and curses

Curses and voodoo poppets, two integral parts of the Bewitchment mod, are currently disabled, taking the fun out of interacting with other people using the mod. Poppets and curses cannot kill directly; they serve as an annoyance which can be fairly simply reversed or prevented. Without these features, the bewitchment mod loses both its charm and its purpose: to wield morally grey magics, make pacts with devils, and threaten people. It's just a bloated alchemy mod without being able to affect the world.
