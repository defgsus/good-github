gdb/testsuite: remove definition of true/false from gdb_compiler_info

Since pretty much forever the get_compiler_info function has included
these lines:

    # Most compilers will evaluate comparisons and other boolean
    # operations to 0 or 1.
    uplevel \#0 { set true 1 }
    uplevel \#0 { set false 0 }

These define global variables true (to 1) and false (to 0).

It seems odd to me that these globals are defined in
get_compiler_info, I guess maybe the original thinking was that if a
compiler had different true/false values then we would detect it there
and define true/false differently.

I don't think we should be bundling this logic into get_compiler_info,
it seems weird to me that in order to use $true/$false a user needs to
first call get_compiler_info.

It would be better I think if each test script that wants these
variables just defined them itself, if in the future we did need
different true/false values based on compiler version then we'd just
do:

  if { [test_compiler_info "some_pattern"] } {
    # Defined true/false one way...
  } else {
    # Defined true/false another way...
  }

But given the current true/false definitions have been in place since
at least 1999, I suspect this will not be needed any time soon.

Given that the definitions of true/false are so simple, right now my
suggestion is just to define them in each test script that wants
them (there's not that many).  If we ever did need more complex logic
then we can always add a function in gdb.exp that sets up these
globals, but that seems overkill for now.

There should be no change in what is tested after this commit.

Moves the FUCKING LIGHT FIXTURES on tiles with surgery beds (#67644)

Moves around some wall objects in surgery rooms on both Meta and Box, primarily so that there aren't light fixtures on the same tiles as surgery beds. I moved a few unrelated things for QOL.

EVERY MOTHER FUCKING TIME I DO SURGERY I ALWAYS SMASH THE FUCKING LIGHT TUBE BY ACCIDENT AND IT PISSES ME THE FUCK OFF. WHY WOULD YOU PUT A THING THERE THAT JUTS OUT OVER THE FUCKING BED AND GETS IN THE WAY OF CLICKING ON THE SPACEMAN SPRITE FUCK GOD DAMN IT.

So it turns out, sitting around in Donnelley River, with absolutely no internet access and reading "Algorithms to Live By" gives you some weird inspiration around the most efficient way to encode and lookup a morse code table given just a memcmp as your instruction.

Well that and a day of drinking the amazing beer at Wild Hop, what can I say.

image: add image group

Add a new view called ImageGroup that will handle all advanced image
hacks from now on.

This includes the indicator (which is now animated), any selection
indicators, and the weirdness of the album song image. All of that
is now handled by ImageGroup. This is the culmination of probably
a day and a half of wrangling with android insanity and having to
remove a lot of what I liked about the indicator in order to make
this work on a basic level.

The only major bug I am currently aware of with this is that the
indicator is bugged out on Lollipop devices due to bad vectors.
Again.

I never want to do this again. I cannot believe that adding a basic
indicator took this long and required so much stupid hacks and
inefficient code. And then google wonders why android apps are so
visually unappealing and janky and laggy. Hm. Must be that devs aren't
using the brand new FooBarBlasterFlow library!

Fixes conveyor runtime (#65788)

Conveyor would runtime whenever it is right clicked with an item

Fixes #64595 (Runtime on conveyor for right clicking)

fixes a runtime with conveyor where right clicking it with any item would cause a runtime

Mothblocks rant from the issue report below, you've been warned:

Because right-clicking in BYOND is horse-shit. It pipes it all through the normal Click and only tells you it's a right-click through a flag. This means that on anything that isn't prepared, right-clicking is the same as left-clicking, which is terrible UX that only exists in SS13.

Nothing should return ..() from attackby_secondary, because the default is the legacy behavior of making right-click pass as left-click (which I want to kill ASAP, once nothing uses the stupid flags anymore).

Remove else return ..(), and make this whole thing do return SECONDARY_ATTACK_CANCEL_ATTACK_CHAIN.

Rollout of advanced microarchitecture info continues, added AMD/Intel gfx
devices, CPU built dates, process nodes, generation (in some cases, where it
makes sense), etc.

Please note: the 3.3.16 > 17 releases require manual matching table updates. If
you think disk or ram vendor, CPU or GPU process, release date, generation, etc,
information is not correct:

* FIRST: do the research, confirm it's wrong, using wikichips, techpowerup,
wikipedia links, but also be aware, sometimes these slightly contradict each-
other, so research. Don't make me do all your work for you.

* Show the relelevant data, like cpu model/stepping, to correct the issue, or
model name string.

* There are 4 main manually updated matching tables, which use either raw regex
to generate the match based on the model name (ram, disk vendors), or vendor id
matching (ram vendors), product id matching (gpu data), or cpu family / model /
stepping id matching. Each of these has its own matching tool at:
  inxi-perl/tools/[tool-name].pl
which is used to generate either raw data used by the functions (ids for gpu
data), or which contains the master copy of the function used to generate the
regex matches (cp_cpu_arch/set_ram_vendors/set_disk_vendors).

* Please use pinxi and inxi-perl branch for this data, inxi is only released
when next stable is done, all development is done in inxi-perl branch. All
development for the data or functions these tools are made for occurs in the
tools, not in pinxi, and those results are moved into pinxi from the tools.

* Saying something "doesn't work" is not helpful, provide the required data for
the feature that needs updating, or ideally, find the correct answer yourself
and do the research and then provide the updated data for matching.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES:

1. GPU/CPU process node sizes are marketing, not engineering, terms, but
work-around is to list the fab too so you at least know which set of marketing
terms you're dealing with. As of around 7nm, most of the fabs are not using nm
in their names anymore, TSMC is using n7, Intel 7, for example. While these
marketing terms do reflect changes from the previous process node, more
efficient, faster, faster per watt, and so on, and these changes are often quite
significant, 10-30%, or more, they do not reflect the size of the transistor
gate like they used to up until about 350nm. Intel will move to A20 for the node
after 4 or 5, 2nm, meaning 20 angstroms.

Intel suggested million transistors per mm^2 as an objective measure (currently
around 300+ million!! as of ~7nm), but TSMC didn't take them up on it.

GlobalFoundries (GF) stepped away from these ultra small processes at around
14nm, so you won't see GF very often in the data. AMD spun off its chip fabs to
GF aound 2009, so you don't see AMD as foundry after GF was formed. ATI always
used TSMC so GPU data for AMD/ATI is I think all TSMC. Intel has always been its
own foundry.

2. Wayland drops all its data and can't be detected if sudo or su is used to run
inxi. That's unfortunate, but goes along with their dropping support for > 1
user, which was one of the points of wayland, same reason you can do desktop
sharing or ssh desktop forwarding etc. This means inxi doesn't show wayland as
Display protocol, it is just blank, if you use su, or sudo start. This makes
some internal inxi wayland triggers then fail. Still looking to see if there is
a fix or workaround for this.

3. In sensors, a new syntax for k10-pci temp, Tctl, which unfortunately is the
only temp type present for AMD family 17h (zen) and newer cpus, but that is not
an actual cpu temp, it's:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.12/hwmon/k10temp.html

"Tctl is the processor temperature control value, used by the platform to
control cooling systems. Tctl is a non-physical temperature on an arbitrary
scale measured in degrees. It does _not_ represent an actual physical
temperature like die or case temperature."

Even worse, it replaced Tdie, which was, correctly, temp1_input, and, somewhat
insanely, the non real cpu temp is now temp1_input, and if present, the real
Tdie cpu temp is temp2_input. I don't know how to work around this problem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS:

1. Fallback test for Intel cpu arch was not doing anything, used wrong variable
name.

2. A very old bug, thanks mrmazda for spotting this one, runlevel in case of
init 3 > init 5 showed 35, not 5. Doesn't show on systemd stuff often since it
doesn't use runlevels in this way, but this bug has been around a really long
time.

3. SensorItem::gpu_data was always logging its data, missing the if $b_log.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXES:

1. Fixed some disk vendor detection rules.

2. Failing to return default target for systemd/systemctl when no:
 /etc/systemd/system/default.target
file exists. Corrected to use systemctl get-default as fallback if file doesn't
exist.

3. Fixed indentation for default: runlevel, should be child of runlevel: /
target:

4. Fixed corner case where systemd has no /proc/1/comm file but is still the
init system. Added fallback check for /run/systemd/units, if that exists, safe
to assume systemd is running init.

5. Fixed subtle case, -h/--recommends/--version/--version-short should not print
to -y1 width, but rather to the original or modified widths >= 80 cols.
Corrected this in print_basic() by using max-cols-basic.

6. Forgot to add --pkg, --edid, and --gpu to debugger run_self() tool.

7. Fixed broken sandisk vendor id.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Added AMD and Intel GPU microarchitecture detections for -Gx. These are not
as easy as Nvidia because there is no one reliable data source for product ids.

2. Going with the -Ga process: .. built: item, -Ca will show process: [node] and
built: years and sometimes gen: if available. Geeky, sure, not always perfect,
or correct, but will generally be close. Due to difficultly in finding reliable
release > build end years for example, not all cpus have all this data.

Using CPU generation,where that data is available and makes sense. Like AMD
Zen+ is zen gen: 2, for example,. Because Intel microarch names are often
marketing driven, not engineering, it's too difficult to assign gen consistently
based only on model names. Shows for Core intels like: gen: core 3

That will cover most consumer Intel CPU users currently.

3. Added initial Zen 3+ and Zen 4 ids for cp_cpu_arch(). There is very little
info on these yet, so I'm going on what may prove to be incomplete or wrong
data.

4. Added GPU process, build years for -Ga.

5. Added fallback test for gpus that we don't have product IDs for yet because
dbs have not been updated. Only used for cases where it's the newest gpu series
and no prodoct IDs have been found.

6. Added AMD am386 support to cp_cpu_arch... ok ok, inxi takes 9 minutes to
execute on that, but there you have it.

7. Added unverified Hyprland wayland compositor detection.

8. By request, added --version-short/--vs, which outputs version info in one
line if used together with other options and if not short form. With any normal
line option, will output version (date) info first line, without any other
option, will output 1 line version info and exit.

9. More disk vendors, ids! Much easier with new tool disk_vendors.pl.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES:

1. Deprecated --nvidia/--nv in favor of more consistent --gpu, that's easier to
work with multiple vendors for advanced gpu architecture. Note for non nvidia,
--gpu only adds codename, if available and different from arch name. For nvidia,
it adds a lot more data.

2. Changed inxi-perl/tools tool names to more clearly reflect what function they
serve.

3. Going with runlevel fixes, changed 'runlevel:' to be 'target:' if systemd.
Also changed incorrect 'target:' for 'default:'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION:

1. Updated man, help, docs/inxi-data.txt for new gpu data and tools, and to
indicate switch to more generic --gpu trigger for advanced gpu data, instead of
the now deprecated --nvidia/--nv, which probably will go down as the shortest
lasting option documented, though of course inxi always keeps legacy syntax
working, behind the scenes, it's just removed from the -h and man page in favor
of --gpu. Also updated to show AMD/Intel/Nvidia now, since the data now roughly
works for all three main gpus.

2. Updated pinxi README.txt to reflect the tools and how to use them and what
they are for.

3. --help, man, updated for target/runlevel, default: changes for init data.

4. Updated configuration html and man for --fake-data-dir.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE:

1. Upgraded tools/gpu_ids.pl to handle nvidia, intel, or amd data, added data
files in tools/lists/ for amd. First changed name from ids.pl to gpu_ids.pl

2. New data files added for amd/intel pci ids, and a new tool to merge them and
prep them for gpu_ids.pl -j amd|intel handling. All work. Took a while to get
these things sorted, but don't want to get stuck in future with manual updates,
it needs to be automated as much as possible, same as with disk_vendors.pl etc,
if I'm going to try to maintain this over time.

3. Made all gpu data file names use consistent formats, and made disk data files
also follow this format.

4. Changed raw_ids.pl to gpu_raw.pl, trying to keep things easy to remember and
consistent here.

5. Refactored core gpu data logic, now all types use the same sub, and just
assign various data depending on the type.

6. Changed vendors.pl name to disk_vendors.pl

7. Big redo of array/hash handling in OutputHandler, was partially by reference,
now is completely by reference. All Items now use and return $rows array ref as
well, from start to finish, unlike previously, where @rows was copied
repeatedly.

8. Going along with 7, made most internal passing of hash/arrays use hash/array
references instead, where it makes sense, and doesn't make the code harder to
work with.

9. Refactored WeatherItem, split apart the parts from output to be more like
normal Items in terms of error handling etc.

10. Added 'ref' return option for reader() and grabber(). Only useful for very
large data sets, added also default 'arr' if no value is provided for that
argument.

11. Switched some features to use grabber/reader by ref on the off chance that
will dump some execution time.

12. A few places added qr/.../ precompiled regex, in simple form, for loops,
maybe it helps a little. I don't know.

13. Added global $fake_data_dir, this can be changed via configuration item:
FAKE_DATA_DIR or one time by --fake-data-dir.

14. Created data directory, and initial data items. cpu is the fake data used to
test CPU info. More will be added as data is checked and sanitized.

AI Could Defeat All of Us Combined

///

What a limited imagination of how an AI would take over. The scenarios seem to be centered around an extrapolation of "What if a really smart human were trapped inside a computer?" The amount of anthropomorphism is astounding.
The author misses an even scarier prospect - people will want to run such an AI. They will be absolutely giddy at the prospect of running such an AI and it won't be anything like a really smart human trapped in a computer.

AI is already laying the groundwork if you look around today. Every other tweet is a DALL-E[1] image. They are everywhere. DALL-E is increasing its reach while simultaneously signaling that it is an area of research worth pursuing. In effect kicking off the next generation of image generating AIs.

Generation is an apt term. We can utilize the language of organisms with ease. DALL-E lives by way of people invoking it, and reproduces by electro-memeticly - someone else viewing the output and deciding to run DALL-E themselves. It undergoes variation and selection. As new research takes place, and produces new models, they succeed by producing images which further its reproduction, or it doesn't and the model is an evolutionary dead-end.

AI physiologically lives on the cost to run it, and evolves at the rate of research applied. Computational reserves and mindshare are presently fertile new expanses for AI, but what occurs when resources are constrained and inter-AI conflict rises? I expect the result to look similar to competition between parasites for a host - a complex multi-way battle for existence. But no, nothing like a deranged dictator scenario. Leave that for the movies.

Yesterday I found this comment to be pretty good so let me highlight it. The article itself does not seem to be worth reading.

I am amazed at how much /ic/ seems to be losing its shit over it.

10:40am. Let me get started. Let me resume the tutorial from yesterday.

Hmmm, I am confused how he gets such diffuse lighting from the sun's reflection.

...Yeah, it does not make sense for the ocean to be a perfect mirror like it is now. At this scale, the waves should act as micro facets. I've cranked up the roughness using a color ramp and now it seems better.

https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/

Finally, I accessed the NASA site!

11:20am. Just where did andrew find those maps of the Earth? He says it is from NASA, but I can't find it. It is not that easy to find resources. Various sites have stock photos of deep space, and they require a subscription, but I am having surprising trouble just finding something I could get directly. I really will end up using the limbo asset.

Oh finally something good. Those photo sites all want to take a chunk out of my wallet.

It is not an HDRI though. Well, is that really such a problem. I could always composit it.

https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/57747/blue-marble-clouds

He probably got the cloud map from here.

11:40am. This is too much of a hassle. Forget outside resources. I'll just make my own. For now let me use the limbo HDRI.

The stars are too big. I'll definitely have to work on my own, but nevermind that for now. I'll procedurally generate something else later.

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=2277

Hmmm, do you not need the cryptomatte to get the object index. There is even a normal pass. Remember when I was looking for a way to get the camera normal. This could be it. Though it might be the world normals.

11:50am. You know what, I am an idiot. I do not need a HDRI. I can just use a plane and put an regular image on it. It is not like I am going to be rotating around the space. In that case, who cares.

Still, finding something I can use commercially without paying is a challenge. I should procedurally generate the env texture.

12pm. Sigh, it is so annoying to do the nebulae. I forgot how much time procedural texture generation can take. I absolutely must use a photo.

I did the stars, but when I rotate I get weird effects.

NASA Lets You Download Thousands of High-Resolution Space Images for Free

I am just going to composit this thing. I am absolutely on the wrong track if I say I want to make my space procedurally.

https://images.nasa.gov/details-PIA12348

Let me go with this. This is beautiful.

Hmmm, is this really not an HDRI. It does look like one based on the distortion near the bottom.

Nope, it is definitely not an HDRI. The sides don't even mirror correctly. And and the top and bottom there is huge distortion. It does not matter. My aiming for an illustration makes things a lot easier. 3d offers a lot to a 2d artist.

I think it is finally time I get familiar with compositing.

12:20pm. What happened now is what happens when you know about something, but haven't fully ingrained it. It is really obvious that I should be compositing, but I am getting hung up on trying to get a HDRI.

https://youtu.be/a1weKAFJx3k
Demystifying Blender Cycles' Render Passes: Normal Pass

I should get familiar with passes. I am really wondering what the object index is. I'll try putting a few cubes into the scene just to see what comes out.

12:20pm. Hmmm, object index shows nothing. The normal pass shows the, well not the camera normals, but the object normals. It is pretty useless. But I should figure out how the object index works.

12:30pm. For an updated workflow I could just try using the cryptomattes, but I want to see what he does.

Yeah, this is the right way. I should just use the images from NASA as they are free, or other free photos and composit them. That is what I need to focus on. If I start getting anxious about HDRIs or even worse, try to do them procedurally I am going to be here for a long time. Rather than doing them procedurally, even just painting the nebulae on CSP would be better as I'll be able to make steady progress instead of fiddling with noise. But that would still take too much time, I'd need to dedicate at least a few days to do it.

The reason pros are fast is because they use assets, not because they can do everything on their own much quicker than the others. I need to focus on that.

Let me have breakfast here."

Relocates The Entertainment Offices and Custodial Closet on DeltaStation (#17480)

* Location, Location, Location!

* Lights and Pipes

I am so sorry for how hacky that disposal piping is

* TFW Disposals

* Oh god, what if there is a fire?!

* And a light switch...

Maybe the final commit? Taking bets on if I managed to forget something else

* If you bet on the requests console

You would be right.

* Bigger, Better, Janitor

* Bloody requests console...

#### Saturday 2022-06-11 13:23:02 by Karsten

This is my largest commit yet. Please forgive me.

From this day on, all future commits in this repository will be of adequate size (I promise!) :angel:

To be honest, I can't muster the energy to document each individual file change, so I'll make it brief:

- The application now has a context menu!
Just right click that juicy icon to see all the different possibilities!

- Settings
1) CUSTOM HOTKEY(s)!: You can now bind your own hotkey instead of using the default one I created in a jiffy (WIN+SHIFT+K).
2) Adjust discovery time (the time in milliseconds the app should search for Bluetooth devices)

- UI updated slightly

- Some other negligible functionality that nobody will notice

Also, I tried to clean the code base and implement some sweet tricks here and there... Personally, I ain't satisfied, but I'll keep working hard to reach omnipotence.

Thanks for joining my TED talk.

gpiolib: acpi: use correct format characters

[ Upstream commit 213d266ebfb1621aab79cfe63388facc520a1381 ]

When compiling with -Wformat, clang emits the following warning:

  gpiolib-acpi.c:393:4: warning: format specifies type 'unsigned char' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]
                        pin);
                        ^~~

So warning that '%hhX' is paired with an 'int' is all just completely
mindless and wrong. Sadly, I can see a different bogus warning reason
why people would want to use '%02hhX'.

Again, the *sane* thing from a human perspective is to use '%02X. But
if the compiler doesn't do any range analysis at all, it could decide
that "Oh, that print format could need up to 8 bytes of space in the
result". Using '%02hhX' would cut that down to two.

And since we use

        char ev_name[5];

and currently use "_%c%02hhX" as the format string, even a compiler
that doesn't notice that "pin <= 255" test that guards this all will
go "OK, that's at most 4 bytes and the final NUL termination, so it's
fine".

While a compiler - like gcc - that only sees that the original source
of the 'pin' value is a 'unsigned short' array, and then doesn't take
the "pin <= 255" into account, will warn like this:

  gpiolib-acpi.c: In function 'acpi_gpiochip_request_interrupt':
  gpiolib-acpi.c:206:24: warning: '%02X' directive writing between 2 and 4 bytes into a region of size 3 [-Wformat-overflow=]
       sprintf(ev_name, "_%c%02X",
                            ^~~~
  gpiolib-acpi.c:206:20: note: directive argument in the range [0, 65535]

because gcc isn't being very good at that argument range analysis either.

In other words, the original use of 'hhx' was bogus to begin with, and
due to *another* compiler warning being bad, and we had that bad code
being written back in 2016 to work around _that_ compiler warning
(commit e40a3ae1f794: "gpio: acpi: work around false-positive
-Wstring-overflow warning").

Sadly, two different bad compiler warnings together does not make for
one good one.

It just makes for even more pain.

End result: I think the simplest and cleanest option is simply the
proposed change which undoes that '%hhX' change for gcc, and replaces
it with just using a slightly bigger stack allocation. It's not like
a 5-byte allocation is in any way likely to have saved any actual stack,
since all the other variables in that function are 'int' or bigger.

False-positive compiler warnings really do make people write worse
code, and that's a problem. But on a scale of bad code, I feel that
extending the buffer trivially is better than adding a pointless cast
that literally makes no sense.

At least in this case the end result isn't unreadable or buggy. We've
had several cases of bad compiler warnings that caused changes that
were actually horrendously wrong.

[WIP] pAI tweaks and upgrades

Changes some things around! 

Removes the 'wipe' button from pAI's interface, since I think there being an instant 'kill player' button is pretty lame, especially since most pAIs activate on their own without a master. They're easy enough to kill or contain without this, so I don't see it as necessary. If you want to kill your pAI friend just eat them. :U

Removes the 'pAI Suicide' verb, and renames the 'Wipe Personality' to 'Enter Storage' and moved it from the OOC tab to the pAI Commands tab. Killing a pAI deletes the card and all that, where the 'Enter Storage' verb deletes the card and spawns a new one that can be used, which! I think it more appropriate.

Makes it so that, when damaged, pAIs will slowly regenerate while folded up, at a rate of 0.5 brute and burn per life tick, where previously it had been impossible to recover health outside of admin intervention.

Updated the Universal Translator with many of the newer languages that aren't obviously for events or hivemind type things.

Added the same emotes that humans can use to pAIs

Added an alternative pAI card style, and rearranged the expressions for the cards a little bit, and added one more.

Plan to add more pAI chassis to play with

munin-pihole-plugins: olympic level yoga hand-holding, 06.08.00

yet more general usability and configuration QOL additions

read below if not otherwise consumed by apathy
believe me, i know how challenging it is not to be

the tl;dr keynotes here are essentially:
 - infinitely more flexible and configurable
 - marginally safer user configuration

Changes to be committed:
 - modified:   README.md
   list and describe EXTERNAL_CONFIG_DIR and EXTERNAL_CONFIG_FILE
   adjust some verbiage regarding var values that are arrays
   (double quote quotation is required)
 - modified:   etc/bash_completion.d/munin-pihole-plugins
   bump version to 06.08.00
   add EXTERNAL_CONFIG_DIR and EXTERNAL_CONFIG_FILE
 - modified:   script/munin-pihole-plugins
   bump version to 06.08.00
   increase external configuration flexibility
   (add EXTERNAL_CONFIG_DIR and EXTERNAL_CONFIG_FILE)
   (creating either/both if required)
   dance a silly /dev/null dance with shellcheck's source parser
   (shellcheck's 'source' parsing is reasonably limited)
   (it does not cope well with sourcing a compound variable)
   (better this than ~500 identical user reported issues)
   (though very old versions of shellcheck may still complain)
   modify_external_var is now transmogrify
   (you've gotta have cool/witty function names, right?)
   add an rfc3339 compliant datetime alias
   (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS±00:00)
   (used where standard human readable datetimes are desired)
   ('date' without modifiers may produce a locale specific datetime)
   (i don't care who thinks which format is better or worse)
   (i just want a standard human readable format)
   adjust transmogrify to make use of EXTERNAL_* variables
   (nothing else uses the function at this time)
   (but it needed to be split out regardless)
   allow transmogrify to be passed a path or file
   (only variable_fun uses it right now)
   (it's better off generic even if it doesn't /need/ to be)
   ensure transmogrify encapsulates values in double quotes
   (required for arrays, i should have caught this earlier)
   (i never personally modify, nor tested, PLUGIN_LIST)
   (...i suspect very few people ever do)
   (someone however did, special thanks to user CJuarez79)
   perform more hand-holding relative to expected values
   (ensure DNS_PORT is a positive integer of valid range)
   (complain if non-integer)
   (complain if integer but integer is oob)
   (abort safe in either case)
   (special thanks to user Keiran N for pointing this out)
   fix a rare gremlin when transmogrifying a config file
   (config file existence was improperly asserted until now)
 - modified:   usr/share/munin/plugins/pihole_
   bump version to 06.08.00
   (no functional changes)

saint's musings:
 - this s/bag of shit/very fine bash script/g is now ~1100 SLOC
 - i'm not sure what's scarier, that this project is approximately
   eleven hundred source lines of code, or that it contains about
   two hundred lines of comments when nothing is commented in-line
   and everything is "simply" preceeded with a "brief" description
   of its function and/or usage

"1:30pm. Done with breakfast and chores. Let me finish Birdie Wing and then I will resume the tutorial. I've looked into what object IDs do and it turns out there is a node in the compositor that can use them as masks. Cryptomattes would be easier to use so I'll just go with them instead.

1:50pm. That was fun. Let me resume.

Demystifying Blender Cycles' Render Passes: Normal Pass

Let me watch this. Then I'll get back to the tutorial by Andrew.

https://youtu.be/a1weKAFJx3k?t=21
>It is one of the most important passes that one could have and be blessed with as a compositor, and you'll see why.

This caught my interest. I have absolutely no idea what it could be good for.

> Add rim light, in compositing.

Huh really?

https://www.youtube.com/c/TheInfinites/search?query=uv%20pass

I am tempted to watch the UV pass video, but let me skip it for now. The normal pass video was interesting.

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=2432

Focus me on this. Right now I do not know how he did the spread out effect from the sun. I got some of that thanks to the roughness, but it is different from him. For him it works even on the land.

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=2490

Let me get to this point. I should incorporate the sun. This one I am going to have to follow step by step.

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=2490

For him the light is much softer as it goes around the rim of Earth. It makes sense that it would be like this for me, but maybe some of that extra lighting is due to atmospheric deflection. I have no choice, let me back track.

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=229

This soft look of the light came for him fairly naturally. Hmmm, could this have something to do with him starting with a regular sphere and then subdiving it. Let me open a new project.

2:20pm. https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=229

I do not know. It is just naturally soft for him. To get this kind of effect I have to ramp up the sun angle in the settings to 20 degrees.

Ok, let me go with that then. I do not think he touched the light apart from this.

2:40pm. Hmmm, let me load up the image. I can just put in the camera UVs. No, I'll composit it. Discipline me.

2:50pm. Right now I am stuggling to figure out how to crop the huge image directly in the compositor.

Hmmm, I see.

3:10pm. Damn it, this is so annoying. How do I crop that big image so it maintains the aspect ratio. AT first I thought I would just to a part of it, but I changed my mind. I really like the detail in the full image, but I do not want to stretch it.

https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/compositing/types/distort/scale.html

I am really getting bogged down.

> Stretch distorts the image so that it fits into the render size. Fit scales the image until the bigger axis “fits” into the render size. Crop cuts the image so that it is the same aspect ratio as the render size.

What is the difference between fit and stretch?

Ah, fit will fit one of the axes, but it won't stretch the image. If it is not big enough one the sides, it will leave it empty.

3:30pm. Ok, I have a handle on it. First I use the `crop` node with `crop image size` and `relative` settings turned on. Then I pass that into scale that has the crop setting. That works rather well. This allows me to crop parts of the image. The original image is 4k, it is just too big, so I only take 0.7 to 1 from left to right.

...Let me do it in quarters instead of 30%s.

That should give me 2000x4000 cuttouts which the scale node will then crop. It will allow me to reuse the image from different angles and add some variety to it. It feels a bit low ress, but that will all go away once I do style transfer.

3:40pm. Right now I am just stuck admiring the viewer node. It really looks quite nice.

Let me get a move on. I am satisfied with this as my background.

4pm. I did a render, and put a sun where it should be. I won't let it render for full. I'll do that only once I am done. Still even after a minute the image quality is good.

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=2504

This kind of workflow has been completely superseeded by cryptomattes. Back when he did that video, that functionality was not available in Blender.

4:10pm. https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=2587

I find this confusing, what is he trying to do here?

4:25pm. The way the blur works is really confusing. The regular gaussian constrains it to a box, but the fast one for some reason gets mirrored when I do not want it to. Also because I composited the background I can no longer mix it easily into the original image.

I have no idea what the environment is suppose to be doing.

I though I understood it - all the objects are black while rest is not, but the alpha already gives me that. I can just get the alpha to use it as a mask for the background. So then why is he adding the blurred sun to the environment?

https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/layers/passes.html

> Environment
> Emission from the directly visible background. When the film is set to transparent, this can be used to get the environment color and composite it back in.

Wait, that gray might not be alpha, but instead it is probably the 0.02 strength white background that I put to just give the back of the world just a little lighting.

Let me test that. Let me try making it green.

Yeah, that is it. Ok. It shows up as green even though I have it transparent in the compositor.

He himself made it transparent in the compositor.

I think I understand it. He wants to mix the light from the sun into the background directly. I see.

Ok, I can play it like that.

4:35pm. Ok, then, first of all, I want to make my own sun pure white, and merge it back into the image. Then I want to light up the background. Then I can composite the lighted background with the image.

Let me take just a short break.

5pm. Seriously, why is blur leaking from the other side. I do not get this, but nevermind.

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=2633

The kind of blur he has is different from mine. It has rigid borders.

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=3071
> It is applying it still underneath the earth. What did he intend?

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=3293

I am not interested in this part since I will be putting it into the style transfer NN anyway. Let me just watch till the end and then I will do the glare properly.

https://youtu.be/9Q8PwcDzb8Y?t=3660

Isn't it great that I have cryptomates and can just grab the Atmo directly?

5:35pm. I finally finished watching the tutorial. I think I can make some things more efficiently than him. I am going to do the blurs and the glares, but skip the photoshop filters. Let me just do this.

6:05pm. I can't believe I am still trying to get the filter under control.

6:20pm. And I am still doing it. I can't believe it. The brightness of the sun can in fact influence the brightness of the rest of the image. I am only changing the sun intensity, but it is affecting the background by making it darker.

7:05pm. Done with lunch. The reason why the blur is so annoying to do is because Andrew made the sphere too small at the start. Trying to turn it into a large blur therefore leads into all sorts of issues.

I admit, I really have no idea why every filter except the Gaussian one ends up being boxy. They look like absolute shit. But that is just a part of the problem which the sun being too small for the effect I am going for.

8pm. I am going to skip the moon. It was not planned in my original composition, and I have enough material as is. I really wonder how I am going to fit the golden city into the composition.

Ah, I see. I just had an idea to do them on a separate render layer. Yes, indeed, that would make things easier for me. I never tried using two separate layers, but it would better if I did so this time otherwise I will have all sorts of rendering difficulties.

I can always move them to the same one after I am done.

8:20pm. Time for fun. I wanted to make more progress today, but I am going at my usual snail's pace. I guess I am not there yet. Today I did learn quite a bit about the compositor. This scene is only my third serious project, I'll get it down finely at some point. I knew I'd manage to get this far, but tomorrow, that is when things will get serious. I've been thinking about this for a while, but I am still not sure how I am going to architect the city properly. I'll have to look at references tomorrow and think about it seriously."

New species: Meteoran

Time pressure often creates exciting gameplay and interesting
tradeoffs. Baseline Dungeon Crawl uses the Zot Clock to add a
very weak form of time pressure, but there's so much variety
between the playstyles of different species and backgrounds
that a tight clock for some would be almost impossible for
others.

So, let's try limiting that gameplay to just one species!
Meteorae have an exciting variety of bonuses - great attributes
and aptitudes across the board, passive mapping, and exploration
healing, regaining HP and MP when viewing new territory. In
exchange, they have one big downside: instead of getting 6,000
turns of Zot clock for each floor, they get 600!

The big concern here is whether this species can be made fun
without also being made wildly, boringly 'overpowered'. Lots of
levers and knobs to tweak, so let's give it a shot!

Extra notes:
- Meteorae are humanoid beings. (In the night sky, they look
  like dots because they're very far up.) Hat tip to Neil Gaiman's
  Stardust.
- This commit has a silly 'flavour' gimmick where Meteorae's LOS
  radius decreases by 2 when they have less than 50 turns left
  of Zot clock, and again when they have less than 10. Darkness
  is closing in...
- Meteorae glow in the dark. Permanent backlit status (not halo!):
  +enemy to hit, -stealth, disables invis. Suppressed in forms.
  Seems funny.

Credit to hellmonk for the initial version of this species and
pushing to make 'em happen. :)

Scipaper rebalancing: Nitrium and halon shell removal. Nitrous added. Emphasis on BZ. (#66738)

Similar in spirit to #65707, with some more changes.

Restructured the gaseous experiments to:

    Nitrous (practice experiment)
    BZ (mainstay experiment)
    Hyper-Nob (lategame/once-in-a-while experiment)

Added a mining partner.

Moved adv weaponry lock to normal weaponry under reactionless. Toned down t3 reactionless.

BZ locks adv engi. Medbay unbridled by toxin gasses now.

Removed Xenobio's BZ Can.
Why It's Good For The Game

My original intent with papers was expanding the difficulty range of toxins. Both to things harder than tritium (nob, nitrium, etc) and also to things easier than tritium (bz, reactionless, etc).

In that process, I feel that i strayed a bit to the harder side, this PR is an attempt to tone down the overall difficulty of some of the gaseous experiments a notch.

Nitrous now takes place of the old BZ, BZ takes place of old nitrium/halon, and noblium stays because it's difficulty is in a pretty good spot for a relatively unimportant but nice to have tech.

While we're at it, I also added more emphasis to BZ production to toxins instead of tritium. This will hopefully incentivize people to try the department out. There is a risk of this being a bit of a chore, but I believe that the relevant atmos gameplay loop is strong enough to have it be fun. You need to check on the chamber, turn on pipes, adjust the input rate, and many more that makes it significantly more fun to do.

We do this by:

    Locking advanced engineering with BZ (organs and implants lock lifted). Depending on feedback i wont mind changing this around if you want to suggest another node as long as it's of similar or very slightly less importance.

    Getting rid of xeno's BZ can. Some xeno players need it for making slimes sleep, with their roundstart supply removed there should be a significant demand for the BZ production in toxins to go online asap.

If you have been paying attention to our PRs, i have been working to make BZ production as seamless and quick as possible in toxins. My five map prs #66454 #66198 #66064 #66010 #65857 have been building up to this. You can make BZ relatively quickly with the new freezer chamber in place. Probably even faster than ordering it in cargo, which is a fine ballpark to use if you want to make changes to it.

If you want to know how to operate it, here is a wiki guide in place https://tgstation13.org/wiki/User:Vincentius_vin/Sandbox#BZ_Synthesis. We will move it to the main toxins page once the rest of the page is finished, pictures are added, 

Made adv engi tech node require bz shells as an experiment, organs no longer need it.
Adv mining no longer requires adv engi.
Removed nitrium and halon shell, implant experiment lock lifted because of the former.
Relocked sec 1 tech node to need pressure bombs, sec 2 no longer needs tritium bomb.
Made advanced pressure bombs easier to do without funny fusion gases.
Added a new mining partner that accepts smaller (even non-atmos/non-ordnance related) bombs
Added more options to purchase nodes in the paper partners. Your point gain stays the same though.
Removed roundstart BZ can from xenobio.

Removes (in) smoke and foam reactions (#67270)

* Removes smoke and foam reactions

Turns out when you let reagents react in foam/smoke, people put bombs in
them.

This behavior was initially added to just smoke, accidentially in
(56f7ac0c0a29e8f898c4aab35947d027952b43f7) accidentialy (thalpy tried to
make both foam and smoke instant react, but instead made smoke's temporary
holder reagent instant instead. hhhhhhh)

Assuming this was intentional it was then extended to foam in
(1879e2d338c9bf5f191cef6c39944b26a41e6092)

Basically, we're idiots. Anyway lets just walk this all back to instant
reaction on smoke/foam formation. Hate you people

* Removes another source of gunpowder smoke

Temporal told me about this. Gunpowder uses an ex_act signal as a
starter, and that also counts for smoke objects.

Really don't want instant detonation smoke bombs, so let's just... not
shall we?
