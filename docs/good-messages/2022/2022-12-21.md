Create Karaoke song selector

Step 1
Ever sung karaoke? It's a place where you sing songs with your friends, and it's a lot of fun. We've created a table with songs, and in this challenge, you'll use queries to decide what songs to sing. For the first step, select all the song titles.

Step 2
Maybe your friends only like singing either recent songs or truly epic songs. Add another SELECT that uses OR to show the titles of the songs that have an 'epic' mood or a release date after 1990.

(Tip: If you're not sure how to select rows where a column equals a value, remember that you can check the documentation below.)

Step 3
People get picky at the end of the night. Add another SELECT that uses AND to show the titles of songs that are 'epic', and released after 1990, and less than 4 minutes long.
Note that the duration column is measured in seconds.

fixed DialogBox

the DialogBox was maybe the first semi-complex system integrated into the game, and oh boy is it a mess.
i realize now that there were problems due to the fact that both "examine" and "attack" actions are meant to advance dialog, but for when dialog is supposed to get advanced by buttons (ie. question posed to the player), the system was fucking up big time. except, it wasn't throwing errors: it simply behaved wrong, displaying the wrong dialog indexes at the wrong times, having buttons do random things... etc.
the system has been re-written as follows:
in regular dialog conversations, pressing either the "attack" or "examine" actions can result in 1 of 3 occurrences:
1. if the dialog is "finished" (fully displayed) on its last conversation index, ends the dialog;
2. if the dialog is currently in the middle of being revealed (ie., it's "typing"), then load_dialog() reveals the rest of the text and sets finished = true;
3. if the dialog is fully displayed (finished = true), and there remains more dialog in the next conversation index, load_dialog() handles the next dialog event.
so it either ends the dialog, reveals the current dialog, or goes to the next index in the dialog.
when a dialog entry is fully displayed (finished = true). when we call event_handler(event), indicating a next dialog event, finished becomes false.
if the event (which is a dictionary with each key referring to dialog behaviour, ie.; "name", "text") matches an event (eg., {'text'}, {'name', 'text'}, we call the appropriate functions.
if the event includes {'question'}, then that means we have to change behaviour a bit:
asking_question becomes true. this variable is used for 2 things:
1. during _process(), we check if asking_question == true. if it is, we set $OptionsRect.visible to finished, revealing it;
2. if a dialog's text is fully revealed, we check if asking_question: if we are, we start the TimerDelaySelect, which delays the option buttons from grabbing focus for a short moment. when it grabs focus, we also set "waiting_for_input" to true.
whenever _input() received an InputEvent (of which only "attack" & "examine" are checked for), we check if waiting_for_input and discard (return void) the input function if it's true. this is because we don't want the InputEvent that presses the option button to also call load_dialog().
when a button is pressed, it can have a 'variable' key in its event dictionary. this 'variable' is used to connect its button pressed signal to the DialogBox's _on_option_selected(_option, variable, value) method, which itself is used to skip dialog indexes in a dialog_script.
a button can instead contain a 'checkpoint' key in its event dictionary, which is used to connects its button pressed signal to the DialogBox's change_position(_i, checkpoint) method. this is to "go back" in dialog ("Do you want me to repeat that?" ... etc.)
so the above 2 functions effectively alter the value of "dialog_index" before calling load_dialog().
what's interesting about this system is that the Buttons do not need to be coded or configured with any functionality themselves. their functionality is inferred by event_handler() and what it finds in the dialog_scripts:

        {
            "name": "Skeleton",
            "question": "Yes or no?",
            "options": [
                { "label": "Yes", "skip": "0"},
                { "label": "No", "skip": "1"},
                { "label": "Maybe", "skip": "2"}
            ],
            "variable": "answer",
        },
the above is an example of a single conversation index (dialog event). god the naming is horrible. the keys in the outer dict ("name", "question", etc.) are the "events" being passed to event_handler(). if event_handler() finds "question", then there MUST be an "options" key as well. the value of "options" must be an array; each index of the array corresponds to a button (option) that will be created for the DialogBox, and contains its text and its "skip" value.
the text is used to adorn the button, and the "skip" value is the number of indexes in the dialog_script to skip after choosing this option.

button.text = o['label']
button.connect("pressed",Callable(self,"_on_option_selected").bind(button, event['variable'], o))

_on_option_selected(button, variable, options):
advance_dialog(int(options['skip']))

what the above snippet does is grab the "skip" value from its corresponding "options" index in the dialog event. advance_dialog() is called, updating dialog_index, before load_dialog() is called.

there is a lot of un-used code in the DialogBox. some of it has to do with Global.custom_variables[], which - through the DialogBox scene - dialog_scripts can set. these custom variables can then be retrieved in un-related dialog_scripts through DialogBox. the idea is that if you give an NPC an "answer", that "answer" is stored in a global custom_variable array and can be grabbed from somewhere else in the program - at least, theoretically. i haven't tried doing this yet with two NPCs.

[MIRROR] *hand, or That /One/ Emote You Always Felt Was Missing [MDB IGNORE] (#18200)

* *hand, or That /One/ Emote You Always Felt Was Missing (#71600)

## About The Pull Request
It's happened to me _repeatedly_ that I'd see someone down on the floor,
and wanted to just, give them a hand, so they could take it and get up
that way, without just, directly clicking on them, since that's a little
bland. I've also wanted to just, offer my hand to someone so they could
grab it, so that I could pull them alongside me, rather than just
targeting one of their arms and ctrl-clicking them.

I've had this idea for a _long_ time, and only just decided to do this
today.

Now, I know what you might say. "Golden, that's a lot of code for
something this simple!" You're not wrong. _However_. I decided to go
along and to give some more love to the `/datum/status_effect/offering`
status effect and the offering-related alerts, to make them a lot more
versatile and a lot less hardcoded. Hence the whole "refactoring" part
of this.

Of course, when I add something, I don't do it half-way. So, the way the
emote works is much like the `*slap` emote, except that:

- When you click on someone, it does the exact same as if you were
offering the item to them, except that it's targeted (much like
ctrl-shift-click).
- If there's nobody directly adjacent to you, it won't do anything.
- If there's at least one person lying down around you, you will offer
them your help to get up. Should they take your hand and let you help
them up, you will both receive a simple memory about being helped up (or
helping up), as well as a 45-seconds-long small mood buff, because it
feels nice to be on either end of such a friendly gesture. If they get
up, they automatically get disqualified from being offered some help
standing up, and likewise, if you lie down, that offer goes away as
well.
- If there's at least one person around you, you will instead extend
your hand in their direction, for them to grab onto it. Should they do
so, you will then grab them by their arms and pull them.

I reworked the offering status effect to no longer have a hardcoded
`can_hold_items()` check, so that kisses and the hand offering would no
longer need you to have free hands to complete. The logic here is that
you can still pull someone even with both hands filled, so I figured I'd
leave it this way.

Note: If anyone would like to give the item a better sprite, by all
means, go ahead, that'd be amazing. I'm just not really a great spriter
and couldn't be bothered to waste hours making a very _meh_ hand.

## Why It's Good For The Game
It's fluff, and nice fluff at that. It makes it easier for people to be
nice to one-another without having to necessarily spend so long writing
up an emote that the person on the floor will already have gotten back
up. I'm sure the MRP folks will like it, and I'm certain the HRP
downstreams will love it too ;)

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Added the *hand emote, which you can offer to someone standing up
in order to give them the possibility to grab onto your hand and let you
drag them away, or to someone lying down to help them back up, which
always makes everyone involved a little happier!
refactor: De-hardcoded and genericized a lot of the offering status
effect and alert code, to make it require a lot less copy-paste to
handle new cases.
fix: Offering a kiss no longer requires the receiver to have free hands
to accept said kiss!
/:cl:

* *hand, or That /One/ Emote You Always Felt Was Missing

[arm] O frabjous day! Working USB firmware for STM32F303/F072!!!!!

Late last night I realized that I the "variable" defining word was
wrong, and wouldn't work for code compiled into flash.

I fixed it, re-compiled the USB test code, and it immediately worked!

This is after trying over and over to get it to work, and basically
giving up on ST and the STM32. It turned out to be a stupid simple
mistake on my part.

I've made a few small changes to the USB code, including commenting out
the possibly offensive "manufacturer string" and replacing it with
something banal.

I've also made the USB code the "out of the box" code that the STM32F072
Discovery and F3 Discovery board files load.

You too can try this at home!

  ./muforth -f target/ARM/board/stm32f072b-discovery.mu4

OR

  ./muforth -f target/ARM/board/stm32f3-discovery.mu4

then

  jtag
  flash-image
  verify

Reset the board, plug into the "user USB" jack, and watch your favorite
OS enumerate the board. I've had success with Linux and Windows 10.

Pressing the reset switch will disconnect from the USB, and the board
will re-enumerate.

It doesn't do anything more than that, but the hard part was getting to
this point. Adding code to process vendor requests to turn it into a
chat target is pretty easy.

Super exciting!!!!

contracts/checkpointoracle,contracts/checkpointoracle/contract,params/types/genesisT: run 'go generate ./...' with partial success

A few things I learned along the way this evening.

- solc in path must be 0.6.0 or some mysterious upper
bound less than the latest available versions that I
also tried.
- solcjs is not solc. npm install solc installs solcjs
which is like solc but is not solc.

All of this partially fixes an error which looked like this.

go generate ./...
protoc-gen-go: no such flag -import_path
--go_out: protoc-gen-go: Plugin failed with status code 1.
accounts/usbwallet/trezor/trezor.go:45: running 'protoc': exit status 1
Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.8.5+commit.a4f2e591.Linux.g++) - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
 --> contract/oracle.sol:1:1:
    |
           1 | pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
         | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

              contracts/checkpointoracle/oracle.go:20: running 'solc': exit status 1

The error now looks like this

go generate ./...
protoc-gen-go: no such flag -import_path
--go_out: protoc-gen-go: Plugin failed with status code 1.

Maybe we don't even want these changes. I don't know.
I just want the command to work for the sake of order
in the universe.

But seriously
- maybe we should upgrade the Solidity version pragma too/instead?
- maybe proto-gen-go actually wants a different version than 'latest',
  (which is what 'make devtools' installs).

Goodnight, dream of green lights.

Remove 6 Gaps, add Private Room

Remove 6 Gaps, 5 Builders from Quirky. On Lemmings Forums, we think
it's not pulling its weight as a puzzle, even if we were to fix it
so that no single builder can cross 2 gaps, and you'd need 2 builders
to cross 3 gaps.

Move Ferry Tale from Lovely into Quirky. It's hard enough.

Add Private Room Without Room, a new level by mobius, to Lovely.
This fills Ferry Tale's old slot.

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].

 */
Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

2022 Day 21 Part 2

Oh, we're solving for a variable now! My first thought was to do a brute force search for the right answer. Now that I'm typing this up I wonder if I should have tried to do a binary search or something...oh well. Anyway, I expect that z3 (which I have no experience in) could solve this super quickly but that is a no go. I tried to give the equation to Wolfram Alpha as well but that also didn't work. So unfortunately I was left solving this myself.

This essentially is a parse tree and one side was pre-evaluated (yay) so I could just unwind the tree and modify the target until I got the right answer which is nice. That took a lot of typing though, some library to solve an expression for a variable (again, z3 probably can do it easily) would have been so nice.

Anyway, I didn't leaderboard but I at least got rank 154. Fine by me, I was not prepared for this at all!

Bug fixes.

The No Teleport Zone on the east wall (by the front door) now runs from the corner behind the fireplace to the door without any gaps.  This has cut off the ability to teleport out of the room anywhere around the stove.

I double checked that my hidden mat (with the Mesh Render off) was on top of the No Teleport Zone.  It is.

I duplicated that mat by the punch lists so that when teleporting in a limited area, it is possible to teleport anywhere in front of any of the four punch lists to be able to easily reach this.

I double checked that my hidden mats by the punch list were back far enough and that this prevented teleporting out, it did.

I fixed the bug where when going from Continuous Motion to Teleport Anywhere and then back to Continuous Motion again in the Settings menu this kept the teleport anywhere plane turned on so that it appeared like you could teleport anywhere, even though you couldn't because you were in Continuous Motion (the teleportation provider was turned off so this gave the effect of showing the reticle even though you couldn't complete the teleportation).  The fix was to set the teleportation area to be disabled whenever Continuous Motion is selected from the settings menu.

The toggle colliders for my left and right physics hands were in Select Enter and Select Exit for direct interactor and ray casting were lost in a previous save when making changes to my physics hands.  Thus, colliders on those physics hands were staying on, on both left and right hand regardless of which hand picked up the item).  I re-set this up for the direct interactor and for the rays.

There is still a bug that needs to be fixed in the C# code for these physics hands and I have a coding solution I can implement and test.  But this will have to wait until tomorrow.  The bug is both when an item is dropped and picked up again and I suspect that this same bug happens when switching items between hands (due to the timing of dropping something and then picking it back up again before the duration timer is up).  The bug allows the hand colliders to be turned back on, on both hands, again in both instances while still holding an item.  This causes certain items to act buggy due to collisions between the hand colliders and the interactable colliders.  Implementing this change should fix this issue.

I play tested the stapler and the balls again and neither acted buggy when the hand colliders were turned off so no changes need to be made to the interactables themselves.  In short, these ended up not colliding with themselves (at one point they had but I had previously fixed this and that piece is still in place) but with the hands.  The above last fix should help to prevent any bugginess when picking up items.

I also increased the scale of the table by 1.15 on the z-axis.  This allowed me to move the right chair over a little to make a little more room to get up to the table.  I also adjusted the lamp's transform (with the baked in shadows) so that it again matched the shadows and those shadows didn't look out of place.

However, while that gap increase between chairs was needed to the user to be able to get up to the table in Continuous Motion, there is still a collision happening before reaching the table.  I've disabled both the chairs and the table and play tested to confirm that collisions aren't happening with any of those three items.  They are not.  So I will need to investigate this further to see what other object's collider is preventing getting up to the table.  That investigation will also need to be tomorrow.
I play tested and found that this problem only occurs when the setting is set to Continuous Motion.  This problem is non-existent when on Teleport Anywhere or Teleport (Limited Area).

I moved the invisible mat by the study over to the right a little bit more (this was inadvertently to far to the left and under the watering can).

I checked the rigidbody of my XR Rig and I tried changing the mass from 1 to .4 to see if that prevented me from being able to open the door by leaning into it.  It did not.  Leaning into the door causes the door to rubber band or the hinge joint to break (both are great Google search terms to use when investigating this problem further).  Leaning into the door handle causes the door handle to freak out and to rapidly glitch and rotate and even clip in and out of the door.  This is something I still need to investigate.

I haven't yet come up with any solutions as to why the white board marker is so glitchy when moving the marker certain directions and/or why its rotation lock doesn't always happen (per the C# code).

That's all for tonight! Most of those are fixed now with the exception of the front door leaning, the whiteboard marker (I didn't do any further troubleshooting of it this evening -- no time, but I hope to dive into it again over break) and the mysterious invisible collider in front of the table.  The table collider piece I'm pretty sure I'll be able to resolve pretty easily.  The front door and marker, may be much more difficult to pin down what is happening and/or a fix.  I have a discord post (of the YouTuber who made the video) asking for help with the marker glitch that currently has no replies.  I may post back to see if there is anyone who might have any ideas for me there.

rework), and "Nuke Ops Victory" (station destroyed via nuke) (lost from,
what I can see, an oversight / accidental swap of report values).

Additionally, small roundend report QOL for cult: Removes antag datums
from spirit realm ghosts after being dusted, so they do not show up on
the report. And in reverse, heads of staff who were dusted / destroyed
in revolution rounds are now also shown in roundend reports.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Some of these reports are dead, which is is a shame because I think
they're cool and fun.

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
qol: Successfully fending off a blob now has a cross station news report
again. More pressing reports will take priority over it, though.
qol: Successfully killing a wizard (and all of their apprentices) now
has a cross station news report again.
qol: If more than half of a cultist team manages to escape on the
shuttle (rather than summoning Nar'sie), they will send a unique cross
station news report. This is still a loss, by the way. Summon Nar'sie!
qol: Nuclear Operatives successfully nuking the station now has its
unique cross station news report again, and no longer uses the generic
"The station was nuked" report.
qol: Nuking the station to stop a blob infection now has a unique cross
station news report again. Good luck convincing admins to allow this.
qol: Cult ghosts from "Spirit Realm" no longer persist on the cult's
team after being desummoned, meaning they will not show up on roundend
report.
qol: Heads of staff will now always show up on revolution roundend
report - even if their body was fully destroyed.

- migrated reobfJar task over to ACP-Gradle. See the latest commit (cd231c8) in ACP-Gradle's repository.
- merged the "modifyJar" task into the default Gradle "jar" task.

Initially I wanted both the jar construction stuff and the reobfuscation to be in the plugin, but I had way too much trouble getting the jar constructing integrated into the ACPPlugin class properly. This was due to a number of reasons, primarily dealing with the Copy task (and its inheritors) and how it works in Java (Java has no closures, unlike Groovy, which made it far more difficult to get things configured the way I wanted). I'll chalk up most of it to inexperience on my part. Still frustrating nonetheless.

Traitor UI only shows Unlock/Failsafe Code if you have it (#72114)

## About The Pull Request

There are cases in which you don't have an unlock code (if the uplink is
implanted in you from the start) and you obviously don't always start
with with a failsafe code (need to buy it). So, let's only fill in this
fields in the UI should they exist.

There might be something to be said about wanting to ensure that people
remember that they can check this UI screen to find the failsafe code
should they lose it later, and I wouldn't mind changing the string to be
something like "Failsafe: None" in that case. However, I just think that
keeping it as:

```txt
Code:
Failsafe:
```

is silly and should be changed somehow.
## Why It's Good For The Game


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/208604758-d7ff3ae9-e552-4dd2-998d-81715cd06ffc.png)

Note: That white box isn't part of the UI, that's a part of the edit I
did to the screenshot in the area where the stuff... isn't? What was i
thinking

I think the UI looks a lot cleaner for those cases when you just don't
have anything.
## Changelog

qol: The Traitor's Antagonist Panel's Unlock and Failsafe entries will
only appear if there is an Unlock/Failsafe Code to display.

refreshes syndi-kits and syndicate surplus crates, introduces shared limited stock (#71869)

## About The Pull Request

After all, the Syndicate loves a good throwback.


![C6O47fPhAB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/207737104-3d24574f-02e0-433d-8ea7-6825ca4cb970.png)

This PR does a few things with the goal of reimplementing and
revitalizing syndicate traitor kits and the syndicate surplus crate.
Of note is that I have added in a way for limited stock items to share
their limited stock.

Following maintainer guidance the syndicate traitor kits have increased
in price and as a result some of the lower value ones have been
adjusted. I've given all active bundles current TC costs per item
knowing full well they will be inaccurate eventually.

<details>
  <summary>Changes as a result of my audit of syndikits</summary>
    
### UNCHANGED
Recon, Spai, Stealthy, Screwed, Sniper, Nukie Meta, Implants
Mad Scientist, Bees

Lord Singuloth is also unchanged and disabled, I think that it should
turn into a new supermatter themed kit maybe. outside of current scope.

### Gun Kit
Replaced emag with doorjack and gave it a chameleon holster, literally
moved 1 tc elsewhere

### Murderer
replaced emag again, no additions its a lot of tc and Just Good

### Hacker
added doorjack, otherwise unchanged

### Sabotage
no changes other than adding in extra bombs it didnt have

### James Bond
gave him some gadgets with the freedom implant, emp flashlight, and one
x4. also a cyanide pill and deck of cards for fun

### Ninja
Added in miner Jump Boots, smoke spell, and doorjack. dont just want it
to be space ninja

### Dark Lord
Added in new lightning bolt spell granter and made the desword default
to red. probably overbudget.

### White Whale
dehydrated carp added so you can ride it alongside the ones you grenade
out. hard to imagine changing this

### Mr Freeze
changed temperature gun to be cryo only so that i could give him the
cryo thermal pistol. cold attacks only.

### 2006 Traitor
doorjack.

</details> 

tl;dr theyre all about 30 tc worth of shit more or less some are more
but thats what rarity should be for
you can only buy from one type of syndicrate per round


![QOF1WO7CC6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/207739417-00ae6b81-b6aa-4774-a4bb-f2d880988ff4.gif)

Next up is the return of the surplus crate. 
Crate is generated, gives you gear **based on your progression at the
time of buying the crate**, you can use it all at the start and get some
chameleon kits and not a lot of dangerous weapons or wait till later.
I've changed the weight on some items here and there and given weight to
role and species locked items, though I will admit that latter is
unimportant because I set moth lanterns to be unable to appear in these
two crates.


![dreamseeker_t8abXysKqK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/206761978-96e2a51e-f9a5-48e4-a863-a9198fa15ea2.gif)

But who cares about that your eyes instantly went to the United Surplus
Crate and the United Surplus Key lets be honest.

The united surplus crate is 80 TC worth of uplink items relative to your
current progression when you purchase it and gives you a locked box. It
**will explode if you try to break it** so be careful with it. It gives
you 80 TC and costs 20 TC because it is impossible to open without key.
The rub of course is that the Syndicate forbids agents from buying more
than one surplus item of any kind, you need to find another traitor and
make them buy you a key to open your box. Or I guess you can share the
box?


![dreamseeker_ts0AZeiyfy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/207740388-3f688bba-5d71-48d2-8079-671bbed7e54e.gif)

Regardless, if the crate is opened with any other means it doesn't spawn
its contents, you need 2 traitor uplinks.
Both of these items have a 30 minute timer because you don't want a
crate that has 5 emp flashlights in it. You at least want one energy
sword.

I did a lot of code shit and changed various things to be proc based to
allow for more editing and interjection of things, as I wrote in code
comments making a crate thats locked to a specific set of progression
just means changing the proc that generates a list of valid uplink items
to check items' progression values to a specified value instead of your
characters progression.

Ok I think that goes over everything more or less????

## Why It's Good For The Game

I've heard that people liked these and I think they are quite fun, being
able to go from "i dunno what to do as a traitor" to "ah, of course, I
will become the Bombler" is a fun thing to be able to have, and people
like to get a bunch of random shit in the mail. Some of it even feels
free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Brain points go up!!!

The division of procs allows for more creativity with this system than
existed before as well as other possibilities for interacting with the
uplink handler in funny ways.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: the syndicate is once again distributing syndi-kits, some now with
new technology
add: a fresh batch of syndicate surplus crates have been sent out,
though they seem a bit lighter than before
add: in an effort to encourage cooperation, a traitor can now purchase
either the new United Surplus Syndicate Crate or its key, but not both
add: lightning bolt book granter for wizard event and one syndie-kit
bundle
add: temperature gun that only makes things colder for one syndie-kit
bundle
code: it is now possible to have uplink items share limited stock
bal: role-restricted items no longer can be delivered by the stray
syndicate drop pod event

* Turns Sol into a Subsystem & Many more

Turns Sol into a subsystem and hooks Bloodsuckers onto it via signals instead of doing a ton of for() loops anywhere. This made Sol incredibly fucking fast, so I halved the speed so it only ticks every 2 seconds.

I also improved the sunlight hud to update with regular bloodsucker updates to avoid some useless proc overhead and fixed Coffins not locking by themselves.

vamp lurker strain (#955)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

## About The Pull Request

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->
Adds a new strain for lurker (vampire is the name for now but i can be
changed i just lack the creativity) has less health than the average
lurker but its faster and slashes faster but deals less damage .

**### BASE STATS**
health : 390
armor : 20 
slash damage : 35
speed : 0.1 faster than base lurker // for reference cloaked speed is
0.2
slash speed : 2


Vamp lurker cannot cloak but has a larger kit of abilities focused on
dealing damage and healing making it a high risk high reward backliner
with skill based abilities rather than just stun.
### **Abilities :**

**Rush:** 
Shorter version of pounce (4 tiles) instead of stunning it will daze and
slightly screenshake the target .
damage : 30
cooldown : 6 seconds and 3 if you land it.

**Flurry:**
AOE attack that deals damage to the targets in front of you in a 1x3
area . if landed it will heal you by the same amount and apply a small
slow for the user ( very short second slow)
damage: 30
heal : 30
cooldown : 3 seconds if missed 

**Tail Jab:**
Targeted attack will deal a small amount of damage to the target and
knock him away from you . if you use it on a target in critical state it
will execute it healing you a LOT.
damage : 30
Execution damage : 80 with penetration
cooldown : 7 seconds 
heal : 150
critical state : this occurs when the target either paincrits or falls
INCONCIOUS

## Why It's Good For The Game

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->
Lurker lacks strains and i looked up in the Trello that Lurker strain
was required . i tried to follow the indicators but kinda ended up with
something else i guess but i really like how it ended so i am making
this PR to see what you think about it.

I share the belief of many of my contemporaries that the spiritual crisis pervading all spheres of Western industrial society can be remedied only by a change in our world view. We shall have to shift from the materialistic, dualistic belief that people and their environment are separate, toward a new consciousness of an all reality, which embraces the experiencing ego, a reality in which people feel their oneness with animate nature and all of creation. - Hofmann, Dr. Albert

If the thoughts are absolutely tranquil the heavenly heart can be seen. The heavenly heart lies between sun and moon (i.e. between the two eyes). It is the home of the inner light.  To make light circulate is the deepest and most wonderful secret.  The light is easy to move, but difficult to fix.

Merge #89613 #93985 #93989

89613: gossip: remove frequent gossiping of gossip client connections r=irfansharif a=a-robinson

These gossip-clients keys make up two thirds or more of the gossip traffic in various large clusters I've inspected, consuming almost an entire CPU core in the worst case I've seen. They don't provide enough value to justify that sort of ongoing cost, so this commit removes them entirely as well as the periodic logging of the gossip network and the crdb_internal.gossip_network table, both of which relied on them.

These gossip-clients keys make up two thirds or more of the gossip

value to justify that sort of ongoing cost, so this commit removes them
entirely as well as the periodic logging of the gossip network and the
crdb_internal.gossip_network table, both of which relied on them.

Release note (backward-incompatible change): We've stopped
supporting/populating the crdb_internal.gossip_network table. It was an
internal table with no API guarantees (so perhaps no meriting a release
note?).

Release note (performance improvement): Significantly reduced CPU usage
of the underlying gossip network in large clusters.

---

Informs #51838 (largely fixes it for practical purposes, although there's likely still more that could be done)

This is clearly going to break [the gossip roachtest](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/cmd/roachtest/tests/gossip.go#L50-L58), but between `@irfansharif` kindly volunteering to fix that up separately and his existing TODO in that file I've left that out of this change.

I don't know if completely removing the gossip_network table is really the best idea or if it should just be left in and only populated with the clients from the local node. For example, when run in a mixed version cluster does `debug zip` run all of its sql commands against the local node or does it run some against remote nodes? If an old node ever tries to query the `gossip_network` table on a different node it could have a bad time.

93985: ui: degrade gracefully when regions aren't known r=matthewtodd a=matthewtodd

Part of #89949

Previously, when a tenant SQL instance had spun down (leaving us no way to remember which region it had been in), the SQL Activity pages would claim that statements and transactions had occurred in an "undefined" region.

This change moves from saying "undefined" to saying nothing at all, a slightly nicer user experience.

This broader problem of losing the region mapping has been described in #93268; we'll begin addressing it shortly.

Release note: None

93989: leaktest: exclude long running logging goroutines r=srosenberg a=nicktrav

The `leaktest` package detects potential goroutine leaks by snapshotting the set of goroutines running when `leaktest.AfterTest(t)` is called, returning a closure, and comparing the set of goroutines when the closure is called (typically `defer`'d).

A race condition was uncovered in #93849 whereby logging-related goroutines that are scheduled by an `init` function in `pkg/util/logging` can sometimes be spawned _after_ the `AfterTest` function is run. When the test completes and the closure is run, the test fails due to a difference in the before / after goroutine snapshots.

This mode of failure is deemed to be a false-positive. The intention of the logging goroutines are that they live for the duration of the process. However, exactly _when_ the goroutines scheduled in the `init` functions actually start run, and hence show up in the goroutine snapshots, is non-deterministic.

Exclude the logging goroutines from the `leaktest` checks to reduce the flakiness of tests.

Closes #93849.

Release note: None.

fix: edge case ci error exit (#62660)

so a step of the reviewer workflow always runs, good it is the actual
magical step doing the hard work, but if the workflow gets canceled, the
step exits with an error code, I actually knew this but me from like a
day ago was like:
"nah man this won't bother me in the future."

guess what; after a couple hours I was felling the pain my perfectionist
subconscious was putting me through, plus odd error code exits aren't
very professional or clean or pleasing I'd say, also someone may think
it's weird, look into it, waste time looking at my code

a.yanin/common: Create a new common module `loop`

After prolonged deliberation, I've decided to create a simple event loop
that would support async TCP socket operations.

The event loop design is directly inspired by libuv,
with a few minor differences.

- the extensive use of the `error` and `log` modules because I don't
  care about other people's use-cases

- fearless memory allocations (since I've kept avoiding them for some
  reason while having a machine with 16 GiB of RAM)

- `poll` instead of the clearly superior `epoll` because POSIX...
  at least it's not `select`, duh.

- the extensible handler interface
  - they'll be responsible for juggling callbacks

- a decoupled executor interface (now that I think of it, it looks
  really similar to Java's executors... that's scary.)

I'm still thinking where to put the I/O operations in this picture
so that they wouldn't be a royal pain.

The goal is to have an overwhelmingly large part of the codebase shared
among the 31st and 33rd labs; the only difference there being
a different choice of the executor (single-threaded vs thread pool).

And since I anticipate (and actively hope) that this will be my last
grand effort writing code in C, I'm going extravagant with my designs.
To the detriment of the poor people who'll have to review this.
To them I say this: I'm not sorry at all.

Makes dog a basic mob [MDB IGNORE] (#70799)


About The Pull Request

    Made a basic version of the pet base called /mob/living/basic/pet. It's significantly more stripped down from the old simple_animal one, because its half collar stuff and...

    Made the collar slot a component that you could theoretically remove from a pet to disable the behavior, or add to any other living mob as long as you set up the icon states for the collar (or not, the visuals are optional).
        The corgi's collar strippable slot is now generally the pet collar slot, and in theory could be used for other pet stripping screens.

    I also gutted the extra access card code from /mob/living/basic/pet as it's only being used by corgis. Having a physical ID is now just inherent to corgis, as they're the only ones that could equip it anyway.

    Ported the make_babies() function from simple_animals to a new subtree and associated behavior, called /datum/ai_planning_subtree/make_babies that uses blackboards to know the animal-specific info.
        Note that it's marginally improved, as the female walks to the male first instead of bluespace reproduction.

    Tweaked and improved the dog AI to work as a basic mob, including making /datum/idle_behavior/idle_dog fully functional.

    Made a /datum/ai_planning_subtree/random_speech/dog that pulls the dynamic speech and emotes to support dog fashion.

I've tested base collars across multiple pet types.

For dogs, I've tested general behavior, fetching, reproduction, dog fashion, and deadchat_plays, covering all the oddities I'm aware of.

bin/rust: add program to search through SMS backups

It searches through this crazy XML dump (gigabytes big) for text
messages. It doesn't extract every bit of data (particularly media), but
does pull out all of the plain text.

Normally I'd try to just do this sort of thing ad hoc with grep and awk,
but holy hell XML is too annoying to deal with that way. And the data is
just so big that it really helps to have an easy to use presentation
style.

feat: Basic setup for working with packer.nvim

After what felt like an eternity of trying to figure out how to
get `packer.nvim` in as an optional package, I gave up.

What we have no is `packer` installed in the way that their README
suggests. A slight difference that I am toying with, is to separate each
plugins as it's own module under the plugin folder. The
`/plugins/init.lua` is what sets everything up and it does so by
iterating through every file in the plugin folder and loading them.

To make things somewhat easier, I created and autocommand that will
reload all configurations whenever a write is made to a file that exists
in the folder.

So far, things kinda work. Next time, I want to add a plugin, I simply
write add a new plugin spec file in the plugins folder. It seems to work
for now, so... fuck it.

experimental_use(promise) (#25084)

* Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises

This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when 
something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
can run, then continue in a new task.

I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
separate commit.

* Move throwException to after work loop resumes

throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right 
before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
render the fiber again.

This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
(RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the 
RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
from appearing.

* Use expando to check whether promise has resolved

Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
resolved.

In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
the resolved value.

This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
by `Promise.allSettled`.

The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
without waiting a microtask.

* Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook

Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
implement it yet.

* use(promise)

Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components, 
but that is planned.

If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
"immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in 
previous commits.

Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing 
whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.

When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
principles largely apply.

The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
be deprecated.

[MIRROR] Excercise Equipment is now craftable [MDB IGNORE] (#17495)

* Excercise Equipment is now craftable (#71190)

## About The Pull Request

Imagine if you will a humble chaplain who wants nothing more than for
all of the spiritual folk on the station to get as massive gains as they
can, after finding that they can not just make more exercise equipment
and that the station does not have any in public places, they go annoy
security enough to get into permabrig only to find out that they cant
even unwrench the equipment and move it to the church!!!

NOT ANYMORE!!!

Now you can craft as much exercise equipment as you want! May everyone
on the station get as strong as possible and not just prisoners.

Also I changed the message that plays when you try to use exercise
equipment someone else is using into a balloon alert.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Access to exercise equipment on some maps is limited to static positions
and is currently mostly only for prisoners as every map does not have
public exercise equipment. Expanding the access means that you can have
a Drill Sargent Head of Security or Captain who commands people use
these or allows a psychologist to prescribe healthy exercise habits to
their patients.

I think having the potential for exercise equipment on every map is more
fun and also if prisoners get their hands on tools they should be
allowed to mess with these to annoy security or aid in their escape.

Fixes cable merging, changes merging code just a little bit (#60997)

Makes stack code support merging two different stacks with the same mats, but different mats_per_unit numbers by implementing averages.

It's in an attempt to support the stupid efficiency shit that protolathes do. It's not great, but it ought to work alright for now. Kinda a bandaid

Cargo ammo and ammo box mapping (re-up) (#1759)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

## About The Pull Request

Previous version of this PR ( #1650 ) claimed to have changed 384 files,
which would be impossible to review. So re-uploading this PR with
hopefully a sane amount of files changed...

---

When I was playing cargo I spent a good half an hour in a round just
mindlessly packing ammo magazines into boxes in squad prep. It didn't
put a dent in the squad prep supply, and I barely got a handful of
boxes. So I thought to myself that this is pretty much a waste of time
for cargo and decided to code a better solution:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnXcEYAV8P4

So now select vendors (opt-in via `VEND_LOAD_AMMO_BOXES`) support ammo
consolidation. They count the number of ammo magazines you have and from
that they derive the number of magazine boxes you can vend. If you vend
a magazine, it updates the number of boxes available, and if you vend a
box, it updates the number of magazines available (as well as all
derived boxes - see the 3 pack of grenades and 25 pack box).

The `item_to_box_mapping` tracks ammo boxes (minus loose ammo), grenade
boxes, grenade packets and mine boxes.

Most notable affected vendors - Requisition ammo vendor, Requisition
vendor that features grenades, Squad vendors that have ammo in them.

So now Requisition will be able to easily raid Squad Vendors to stock up
their ammo drops and save countless hours of mind-numbing cargo work.

This code ALSO correctly works when you're re-stocking a vendor with
either individual magazines or magazine boxes. Correct amounts are
updated everywhere. So you *could* take a magazine box, put it in a
vendor and thus let people vend 16 magazines out of it seemlessly.
Really useful just incase you need to restock Requisitions with
individual ammo or something...

Other notes:
- Boxes of magazines are put directly under the corresponding ammo so
you can vend them in larger amounts easier. Useful for 3-packs of
grenades
- We should add a Shotgun Shell Box Box so we can also handle those
easily...
- Nailgun ammo box had to be converted from being /smg/ since that
created an invalid ammo box that nobody used.
- Nulled out a magazine type for an intermediary box that later gets
used for MREs and all that

## Why It's Good For The Game

Gameplay around loading magazines into ammo boxes is not interesting, so
cutting it down to minimum is for the best.

:cl:
add: Added an automated ammo box management system to various vendors
stocking bulk ammo and grenades. It will automatically combine ammo
magazine into boxes, and divide boxes into individual magazines (or
grenades, MRE packets, etc.). The boxes will appear at the bottom of the
vendor (yes, this also includes the regular grenade boxes that used to
be higher).
qol: Cargo will no longer need to pack individual vended ammo magazines
into boxes thanks to the ammo box management system. Your chains have
been broken!
qol: Requisitions vendor now stocks 3-packs of grenades as well as
individual HEDP grenades.
qol: Requisitions ammo vendor now can vend a lot more individual
magazines (actual number of magazines remains unchanged, just the ammo
boxes have been consolidated into magazines).
qol: Requisition vendors now vend to floor when they are not vending to
the front desks. This will make filling crates of ammo boxes or rappels
easier.
code: Minor changes to code around some ammo boxes to remove one phantom
box and prevent intermediate box types from being indexed when they
shouldn't be.
code: Refactored the code that checks whether items are in mint enough
condition to re-stock.

Update README.md

My research idea was to select fifty articles from the category of “most read articles” and make topic modeling either with LDA or on the Voyant tool. The research question was “What are the most discussed themes in those articles on Special Needs Education?”. When I downloaded the articles, I ended up having only fifteen articles as a dataset, due to the open access restriction.
I changed the category from “most read” to “open access” and was able to download fifty two articles.
https://www.tandfonline.com/action/showOpenAccess?journalCode=rejs20
However, LDA seemed to be challenging, I tried to give it a try and It worked as I used the code given in the following resource: https://towardsdatascience.com/end-to-end-topic-modeling-in-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-35ce4ed6b3e0  As I was planning to use Python since I have had some little experience with, I searched for some specific resources where I can use Topic modeling in Python. The article in the above link “Topic modeling in Python: LDA” was the main resource for my project along with the lesson materials.
I used Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning. Data was first loaded into a Jupyter notebook and cleaned. Some specific steps followed according to the article and other resources. The punctuation, white spaces, and lower cases were removed.
These are the steps used for the implementation of this project:
1.   	Loading data: Data was loaded to the Jupyter notebook, and all texts from 52 PDs were extracted and saved under a single list. In the next step, I convert this list to the data frame.
2.   	Data cleaning: In data cleaning is removing punctuation and lowercase. (Converting all texts to lowercase).
In order to visualize the data after data cleaning, the processed data,  data is added to the data frame under a separate column, which I named “paper_ text_processed”. 
3.   	Exploratory analysis: This step is used for getting an idea about the data after cleaning and before the LDA analysis. We can choose a specific number of words to visualize and see how our current data looks like after cleaning. This part could not be implemented, and the code gave an error. The reason might be due to the need for further cleaning of processing steps. Since this part is  used for visualization purposes, it will not have a crucial effect on my final LDA analysis. 
4.   	Preparing data for LDA analysis: This is the most important step of the whole pipeline as we prepare the final data for LDA training. First, NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) “stopwords” package is used to remove the meaningless words that the search engine is programmed to ignore. We would not want these words to take up space in our database or take longer processing time. Additional to the default list that the package contains, I extended the list with a few additional stop words based on the reference. Moreover, all the sentences are converted to words using “simple_preprocess” package. As the final step, we convert the tokenized object into corpus and dictionary.
 
5.   LDA model training: We should decide the number of topics for anaylising the LDA model training. Corpus, id2words(a dictionlar that maps the word “id” to a token ), number of topics are passed as arguments to the LDA model training.The result path should be given in order to save the training results under a separate folder.
6.   Analyzing LDA model results;
On the base of LDA model result  the Topic numbers 2 and 7 are relatively relevant while topics number 5, 8,9,10, and topic number 3 and 4 grouped under the same cluster.Topic 1 and topic 6 are located far from each other as well as from all above mentioned cluster of topics.We can observe the most relevant 30 words for each “hidden” topic with moving the mouse to the specific topic in Intertopic Distance Map.
Thirty most relevant terms for topic 1 contains 32,1 % of overal tokens which is the biggest topic among all. This topic centers around educational  words, e.g. education, teacher, assessemt, research, school, learning, journal, student, study, special, pupils. During the analysis of topic 1 chart, I observe meaningless terms that I added to the stopword list to improve LDA results. 
Topic 7 lays in the same range as topic 2, which has smaller estimated term frequency. We see common and a few different terms between these two topics, while topic 7 can be considered as a subtopic of topic 2. 
The same case is valid for topic 3 and 4, which contains the words like work, parents, support, time, group, european, data, education e.t.c. 
Topic 6 is located near to topic clusters 3,4 and 5, 7,9,10 in intertopic distance map, while it is quiet far from topic 1. The relevant terms belong to this topic(6) contains only 2,2,% of total tokens. 
Topic 5 includes topic 8 and 10 and overlaps only with a small percentage with topic 9 that contains only 0,7% of overal tokens.This cluster contains words such as; knowledge, collaboration, results, different, inclusion, children, research.
Conclusion:
I would like to mention two possible obstacles that could have lead to the better results if they had been handled properly: 
1)Data would need further processing for the training, e.g. extra data cleaning steps could have been implemented.
2)Since it is hard to decide which stopwords prevent good result in training, my extended list of stopwords obviously does not contain all the necessary stopwords to be removed from the text. However, according to some literature, in some cases the stopwrods have no crucial impact on results. Overall, I think the model can give a good overview throughout 10 “hidden” topics and one can observe 30 more common words for each topic as well as observe their estimated term frequency within the selected topic.
