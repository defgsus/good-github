General pAI code improvements (#63688)

Fikou said they would've made MODsuits be controllable by pAI's rather than AI's, if pAI code wasn't as bad.

But pAI code ISN'T AS BAD AS AI CODE LIKE HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK MAN???

Anyways, this is just general code improvements for pAIs that I thought would be nice to have.

Documents previously undocumented vars
Moves loose vars to be where they should be
Removes single-letter variables
Makes pAI a defined job
Moves vars around to where they should be while removing unused ones.
Makes pAI abilities its own .dm file
Replaces var/silent with Stun() (like cyborgs)
Reworks pAI's doorjack to not have a ton of procs, copy paste, and a reliance on Life(), instead it just uses a do_after()
Moves screwdrivering radios from attackby to screwdriver_act

Just general code improvement for Silicon, the thing no one likes or wants to touch.

[REF] core: HTTPocalypse (12) web ir.http & login

This commit is the 12th commit of a comprehensive refactor of our HTTP
framework. See odoo/odoo#78857 for complete historic, discussions and
rationnals.

The web module is twofold, on one side there are many controllers: /,
/web, /web/login, /web/database/selector, /web/dataset/call_kw, etc, on
the other side there is `session_info`: the method responsible to create
the web client's environ.

This module is kinda an exception as it is (with base) a server wide
module. In the case of the HTTP framework, it means that the controllers
of web are always accessible, i.e. going to / or /web/login will never
return a 404 Not Found even if the user is not connected to a database.

This is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because the
controllers are always accessible it means that a new users can freely
access those routes. It is a curse because *any* user can access them,
even user who don't have a session yet thus who are not connected to a
database yet. From a developer standpoint, we have to put extra care to
correct serve users with and without a database. An example is the
/web/login route, the login/password pair is stored in a database,
without database it is impossible to validate a user login but users can
still access this route without db.

To solve this problem, there is the `ensure_db` function. This function
attempts to find a database using various sources (?db= query-string,
session db, mono db) and to save it on the user session. In case no db
is found, the user is redirected to the database selector. In a way,
this function grants a database to the user in a seamingly experience.
In a way, this function brings a welcome differentiation between
`auth='none'` with a database and `auth='none'` without a database. Such
differentiation only matters for the server wide modules as "regular"
module controllers are only accessible via the ir.http routing map, i.e.
it is not possible to declare a nodb controller outside of server wide
modules.

An important changement is the `session.authenticate` method, before it
was possible to call the method when the cursor was not yet initialized,
authenticate would open a cursor against the given database, setup a
registry and an environment and ultimately save everything on the
current request. Because the cursor is now greedily created, it is no
more possible to update the request environment when authenticating on
another database.

Makefile.lib: Lower kernel gzip compression to fastest

You're reading this - so you're trying to understand "JUST WHY OMG".
That's already a good step.

First of all, this is a downstream kernel - always keep that in mind!
Now, this kernel is targeting new *very powerful* Qualcomm platforms
like SM8250 and the Sony Edo platform - which has a very fast UFS card.

Keep in mind that the bootloader sets the CPU at a frequency that is
slightly faster than the "in the middle" ones, which is anyway not
veeeery fast - but that's good, really. I agree.

So.. check this out:   for Image.gz-dtb.....
COMP_LEVEL    SIZE
9             20116171
5	      20220479
2	      20940223
1	      21231290

Remember again that we're loading from a UFS card and that
we are loading ~1.1MB more out of a 20MB file.
If you're smart enough you surely know already about RAM and CPU
overhead of very high compression levels.

If you still disagree with what I just did, read this commit description
another 20 times, or more, until you understand it. :)))

Basic here docs exec parsing logic done...
... let's keep an eye on eventual edge cases.
  What's left to do :
- breaking the prompt loop on CTRL-D intercept and sending err msgr
  (also for all the fixed prompts).
- Double checking that we haven't left idiotic checks here and there
  (notably for my stupid idea of using # as a lexical token...) by
  renaming hdoc_eof.
- That stupidity aside, I'm really proud the trick I used to add HEREDOC
  to the lexicon in the end !
- Or placing it into the prb->curr node ? So far it seems my checks are
  pushing RDIR nodes well without prior initialisation but I may be
  wrong for some cases.
- close_node() and close_line() were streamlined as a result of this
  implementation.

Clobber assets before running jasmine tests

I'm adding this in because we use globbing to match what files to test.
I'm concerned that without this we're at risk of the same files being
included multiple times (say you have application-1234.js, then edit it
and end up with application-2345.js)

It's a bit of a pain to do a clobber first as it means you'll always
have to experience the cost of compiling assets each test run, however
this is preferable to tests liable to fail.

Ballistic to Energy: Autorifles for Thermal Pistols; Adds .38 Crate to Cargo (#64280)

About The Pull Request
The design doc behind this PR, which is only mildy been deviated from on some of the end particulars. Cobby-Approved! Maintainer Discussed!
https://hackmd.io/@6DbtsAKCTtW_9MByKFjZqg/r1xYKCNOt

Cargo Changes
Cargo has had all WT-550's removed and replaced with Thermal Pistols.
Cargo can now order Thermal Pistols, a kind of energy/ballistic hybrid weapon shooting chunks of altered nanites into people. We couldn't use them in people, so maybe we'll use them as bullets! Magma/Ice bullets, to be exact.
You can, after paying a whopping 4K on a goodie pack (you have to pay from your own personal account) buy a .38 revolver. This is mostly to help some poor detective who lost their revolve in what I'm sure will be an inevitable scramble for ballistics. If even the 4K pricetag isn't enough, at least it requires detective access to open the pack...I hope.
Some of the crates that contained autorifle related items have been changed/removed.

unknown (2)

securarevolver 4 0

Science Changes
Ballistic Weaponry node no longer exists, and has been replaced with Exotic Ammo as both the pre-requisite to other nodes, as well as being able to be researched as soon as the Weaponry node is unlocked and not Advanced Weaponry.

Thermal Pistols
-Fairly average bullet statistics; 10 AP but shooting into Energy armor. 20 damage (Brute for cryo, Burn for inferno). Decent wounding potential, but individually much lower ammo counts than lasers.
-Bought in twinned pairs in a two gun holster (just for normal sized energy guns). They're normal sized.
-Each gun has 8 shots (thereabouts). 16 between two.
-Cryo pistols do a knockdown and extra damage against extremely hot targets. Inferno pistols do an explosion cantered on the target against extremely cold targets.
-The guns are EMP-proof.

Why It's Good For The Game
The current gameplay loop of crew combatants is them relying on backup and retreating as necessary to reload their weapons during fights. The ability to repeatedly harry opponents in the field reloads is something that should be moved away from for crew equipment, as it emphasizes lone wolf tactics and one-man army problems, with boxes full of spare ammo usually allowing any single combatant to outlast multiple foes. In addition, ballistics often are not subject to the same (interesting) limitations of energy weapons, so they're typically a no-brainer choice. We shouldn't have such an easy choice be readily available like that.

The thermal pistols present a more challenging weapon to use as a solo combatant but become far more versatile and potent when paired with a decent buddy and basic level co-ordination. They're not a straightforward choice for every situation, but instead are a weapon employed given the right circumstances for them to shine.

In addition to the gameplay issues that ballistics pose, we're in a goddamn spacegame. Unless the ballistics are noticeably weird (they're not), we should expect that our more advanced research station has some pretty odd guns of the energy variety.

Changelog
ðŸ†‘ Necromanceranne, quin
add: Adds the Inferno and Cryo Pistols. A hybrid energy/ballistic weapon, to cargo. It can be purchased in either a goodies pack or a normal crate order.
add: Thermal Pistols do more damage and a special based on temperature of the target hit.
add: Inferno pistols cause an explosion when they hit a severely cold target.
add: Cryo pistols cause a knockdown and extra damage if they hit a severely hot target.
add: There is a special nanite pistol, which is admin spawned. Don't tell anyone about the forbidden ballistic energy gun.
add: You can order a .38 revolver as a goodie pack. It is expensive.
del: Removes WT-550's from cargo and related content from the techweb/protolathes.
balance: Exotic Ammo is now much earlier in the tech web to take the place of Ballistic Weaponry.

Fixes a few hard deletes and runtimes I either caused, or ran into when trying to fix hard deletes (#61953)

Please don't try and send chat messages if you have nothing to say
Fixes a spurious runtime.
Fixes a runtime caused by my lack of understanding of huds. remove_hud_from is intended for hud watchers, remove_from_hud is intended for hud items. Doesn't really make sense most of the time, and just runtimes out the ass
Fixes a runtime in shapeshifting, restore should not run if the object is not restoring, or if it's deleting. it should run if it's not restoring, and it's not deleted. 4head
Fun fact, if there's two turret control boards they'll override each other. Use weakrefs. Oh also removes a var called cp, nothing good will come of that
Today in: Good lord the stacking machine is an afront to god, we discover that the labor claims console was attempting to act as a console, which of course fails when it comes time to clear it's improperly named var. Disgusting
Attempts to fix potential wound ref hangs in surgeries? maybe?
Fixes a runtime in luminescent stuff I created in my big harddel crusade. owner is a mob, not a species
Fixes a runtime related to headspikes deleting themselves twice. Pain
Fixes hard deletes sourced from the prophet trauma. Good fucking lord this is awful
Offhand item is somehow hard deleting. I have no idea how. Here's hoping signals fixes it, because if it doesn't I'm stumped. It's not a common scenario, but it does happen in spurts that suggest repeated usage

Issue #3: Try to find a way to overlay 2 images

Everything is working now. Serveral changes have been made, which I'll explain briefly below.

Looking in CrossOut.java. Line: 23 - 26.  The technique to overlay 2 images is by using the BlendMode method.
Line 23-26 creates a new Group called blend, which overlays the bottom and the top imageview.

Thing is when I tried to add the blend (object?) in the imageView Arraylist<ImageView> in Display.java, I get an error message due to the fact that the blend object is not an ImageViewObject.

So in order to avoid this problem, I changed the loadPics() method (Line 65 - 76) in Display.java. So instead of adding the ImageViews in an Arraylist<ImageView>, I immediately put the ImageViews into an HBox and stored them in an Arraylist<HBox> called imageViewsHBox. By doing this, I have no trouble to add the blend object into the Arraylist<HBox> imageViewsHBox.

Holy shit. I'm bad at writing hahah. I'll explain it to you once again in detail if you don't get my message above.

Anyway (Line 78 - 87), we save the paths of the images in a ArrayList<String>.
This is useful the crossOutPic() method (Line 101 - 105). First we look for the index of the ImageView to replace, then replace it using imageViewsHBox.set(index, crossOut.getLayout()); (Line 104)

For tesing purposes, look at Line 58-59. There we replace the Maria.png

Add files via upload

Day 25, and we made a US States Guessing Game using Turtle and Pandas.

Pandas is a weird plugin. Powerful? Yes. A bit unintuitive? Also yes.

The guessing game was actually one of three different projects we worked on today. This was a big lesson!

My big frustration from this lesson was self-inflicted. I actually wrote a perfectly functional line of code that didn't appear to do anything...because I needed to create another Turtle object to write things onto the screen. I felt like a colossal idiot when I realized what I had done, especially since I had spent not an insignificant amount of time trying to figure out what was going wrong!

Anyway, it works! Hooray!

Fix bugs caused by Preact update

The new Preact version seems to have broken a lot of low-level
magic we used. We plausibly shouldn't be using such low-level magic
in the first place, but that's a conversation for another day.

In particular:

1. `preact.render` seems to replace all of `containerNode`'s contents
   if `replaceNode` isn't passed (previously, it would append a child).
   This is an insane thing to change without any documentation... Maybe
   I'm misunderstanding it?

2. Making a button value an uncontrolled form was a pretty big hack
   in the first place, but at least it worked. Now that it doesn't,
   we're giving up and switching to controlled forms, which makes the
   code a lot nicer, fixes a bug, and I should probably have just done
   in the first place.

core: Rework the Photos features blacklist again

* Apparently, Magic Eraser currently requires a
  specific Photos version for it to show up and
  actually work. (https://apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/photos/photos-5-65-0-405472367-release/google-photos-5-65-0-405472367-10-android-apk-download)

* Basically, Magic Eraser feature will crash if
  Photos is spoofed as Pixel XL. We want to
  make Magic Eraser work by default as long as
  the Unlimited Photos spoof is turned off.

* However, when PIXEL_2021_EXPERIENCE feature
  is detected by the Photos app, it will use
  the TPU tflite delegate. So we need to
  blacklist it by default from the Photos app.

* TL;DR Magic Eraser is wonky and hard to
  enable and all this mess isn't really worth
  the trouble so just stick to the older setup.

Loading the Tooltip Asynchronously

Fortunately, optimizing these requests is really easy. All we need to do is add a `loading` attribute and have it set to `"lazy"` to [lazy-load][] the tooltips.

This means the request to the tooltip endpoint will be made only when the `<turbo-frame>` becomes visible in the viewport. This is because `loading="lazy"` is using the [Intersection Observer API][] [under the hood][].

```diff
 <!-- app/views/users/_user.html.erb -->
 <div id="<%= dom_id user %>" class="scaffold_record">
   <p>
     <strong>Name:</strong>
     <%= user.name %>
   </p>

   <p class="relative">
     <%= link_to "Show this user", user, class: "peer", aria: { describedby: dom_id(user, :tooltip) } %>
     <!--
       Right now we're hiding each frame and its children
       with the `hidden` class. We're revealing each frame
       and its children with the `peer-hover:block` class.
      -->
     <turbo-frame id="<%= dom_id user, :tooltip %>" target="_top" role="tooltip"
                  src="<%= user_tooltip_path(user, turbo_frame: dom_id(user, :tooltip)) %>"
                  class="hidden absolute translate-y-[-150%] z-10
                         peer-hover:block peer-focus:block hover:block focus-within:block"
+                 loading="lazy"
     >
       <!-- The tooltip will be added here. -->
     </turbo-frame>
   </p>
 </div>
```

If you go back to `http://localhost:3000/users` you'll notice that a network request is only made once you hover over the link.

![Hovering over each link loads the tooltip asynchronously](https://images.thoughtbot.com/blog-vellum-image-uploads/rVXa8PJ9Sq2u3G3WXTEZ_hw-2.gif)

Right now we're hiding each frame with the `hidden` class and then revealing it with the `peer-hover:block` class. Both of these classes are provided to us by [Tailwind][] and are a nice abstraction of the [general sibling combinator][]. Even though a `<turbo-frame>` may be in the viewport, the fact that it's not visible prevents the network request from being made. It's only when the `<turbo-frame>` is revealed via CSS that the request is made.

![The Tailwind classes used to abstract the general sibling combinator and reveal the tooltip](https://images.thoughtbot.com/blog-vellum-image-uploads/n8yQbPEhSrClaUTcZ1ve_hw-3.png)

In order to test this, try removing the `hidden` class from the `<turbo-frame>`. You'll notice the tooltips are still lazy-loaded, except this time they are loaded once they come into the viewport.

```diff
 <!-- app/views/users/_user.html.erb -->
 <div id="<%= dom_id user %>" class="scaffold_record">
   <p>
     <strong>Name:</strong>

       and its children with the `peer-hover:block` class.

     <turbo-frame id="<%= dom_id user, :tooltip %>" target="_top" role="tooltip"
                  src="<%= user_tooltip_path(user, turbo_frame: dom_id(user, :tooltip)) %>"
-                 class="hidden absolute translate-y-[-150%] z-10

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

There are two main takeaways from this simple demonstration that extend beyond Hotwire and Tailwind.

<h3>Lazy-load content when you can</h3>

There's a cost to each network request, and not all user's will be viewing your application on the latest hardware or on a stable internet connection. Consider lazy-loading content that's not critical to the initial page load, especially if that content is not in the viewport.

Turbo makes this easy with its `loading` attribute, but this is not a Turbo specific concept.

<h3>CSS can be leveraged to drive interactions</h3>

In our example we're able to reveal the tooltip by hovering over the tooltip's sibling. This may seem like the result of some magical property provided by Tailwind via the [peer class][], but in reality it's just the result of the [general sibling combinator][] (which has been around since Internet Explorer 7) in combination with [user action pseudo-classes][]. This is an incredibly powerful yet under utilized feature of CSS, and is often unnecessarily replicated with JavaScript.

Tailwind has exposed some of the most powerful features that CSS has to offer, but remember that they're just abstractions around existing CSS specifications.

Hiding the results when inactive

Now that we're overlaying our results on top of the rest of the page,
we'll only want to do so when the end-user is actively searching. We'll
also want to avoid needless requests to the server with empty query
text.

Lucky for us, browsers provide a built-in mechanism to prevent bad
`<form>` submissions and to surface a field's correctness: [Constraint
Validations][]!

In our case, there are two ways that a search can be invalid:

1. The query `<input>` element is completely blank.
2. The query `<input>` element has a value, but that value is comprised
   of entirely empty text characters.

To consider those states invalid, render the `<input>` with [required][]
and [pattern][] attributes:

```diff
--- a/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
       <form action="<%= searches_path(turbo_frame: "search_results") %>" data-turbo-frame="search_results">
         <label for="search_query">Query</label>
-        <input id="search_query" name="query" type="search">
+        <input id="search_query" name="query" type="search" pattern=".*\w+.*" required>
```

By default, browsers will communicate a field's invalidity by
rendering a field-local tooltip message. While it's important to
minimize the number of invalid HTTP requests sent to our server, a
type-ahead search box works best when users can incrementally make
changes to the query string. In our case, a validation message could
disruptive or distract a user mid-search.

To have more control over the validation experience, we'll need to write
some JavaScript. Let's create
`app/javascript/controllers/form_controller.js` to serve as a [Stimulus
Controller][]:

```javascript
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
}
```

Next, we'll need to listen for browsers' built-in [invalid][] events to
fire. When they do, we'll route them to the `form` controller as a
[Stimulus Action][] named `hideValidationMessage`:

```diff
--- a/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
     <header>
-      <form action="<%= searches_path(turbo_frame: "search_results") %>" data-turbo-frame="search_results">
+      <form action="<%= searches_path(turbo_frame: "search_results") %>" data-turbo-frame="search_results"
+        data-controller="form" data-action="invalid->form#hideValidationMessage:capture">
         <label for="search_query">Query</label>
```

One quirk of [invalid][] events is that they _do not_ [bubble up][]
through the [DOM][]. To account for that, our `form` controller will
need to act on them during the capture phase. Stimulus supports the
[`:capture` suffix][capture] as a directive to hint to our action
routing that the controller's action should be invoked during the
capture phase of the underlying event listener.

Once we're able to act upon the [invalid][] event, we'll want the
`form#hideValidationMessage` action to [prevent the default behavior][]
to stop the browser from rendering the validation message.

```diff
--- a/app/javascript/controllers/form_controller.js
+++ b/app/javascript/controllers/form_controller.js
 import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

 export default class extends Controller {
+  hideValidationMessage(event) {
+    event.stopPropagation()
+    event.preventDefault()
+  }
 }
```

When an ancestor `<form>` element contains fields that are invalid, it
will match the [:invalid][] pseudo-selector. By rendering the search
results `<turbo-frame>` element as a [direct sibling][] to the `<form>`
element, we can incorporate the `:invalid` state into the sibling
element's style, and hide it.

```diff

"10:45am. Let me chill and then I will get started.

11:10am. Let me start. First of all, let me do some playing around on my own. I had the time to think about my questions more in depth. I just do not understand why they insist that density is between [0,1) when in actuality it can be above and even negative. The description in the docs make zero sense.

Yesterday I said that filling the interior did not increase memory consumption as much as I expected, but consider the case of a box 1x1x1 in dimensions. If the voxel size is 0.01, that means one of the face is 100*100 voxels wide. 10k. If the interior is not filled that means to cover the box in voxels, all that is needed is to put a film of them on all the faces. So 10k*6.

If the interior is fulled, that would instead be multiplied by the side. So 10k*100. So the fact that my memory consumption increased only by 16 times is in fact inline with my napkin calculations.

11:15am. The reason VDB is efficient because it leaves out the interior and considers only surfaces. But it is still a n^2 representation while the interior is n^3. Both have poor scaling properties.

Now, what happens if you have an unfilled interior and want to change the density?

11:20am. Surprinsgly it is possible, but it is less sensitive for small amplitudes.

11:25am. Ok, I think I get it. Let me check out the example file.

Yes, I think that the internal parts are represented using tiles...which I am guessing are just bigger voxels.

Let me ask the author to update the file as I am getting a wall of errors.

https://www.sidefx.com/forum/topic/67110/?page=1#post-286853

Here is the post.

https://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=HoudiniVolumes

Lot of info here. For now let me see how far I can get into the example file.

11:40am. Ah, I see. I think the previous version of Houdini had VDB Densify and VDB Prune. In the file they've been replaced by merge nodes as a fallback.

11:55am. > This can be handy for many things. If you have a robust way to generate a SDF (which of course we do in Houdini), it's a great way to generate collision geometry for simulations. Particles or RBD objects can very quickly sample the SDF, if their sign is negative, they're inside the shape. They can then measure the gradient of the SDF, and determine exactly how far and how much to be pushed to stop intersecting.

Ah, I see.

Also this explains why the inner band.

12am. Maybe if I want to do fast colission detection for those wines vs the frame, I could convert to VDB first and find a way to do that operation there?

1pm. Enough of this for now. This is a very long example file. Time for breakfast and chores. I'll finish the extended chores today and will be able to get back to the usual routine tomorrow.

2pm. I chill'd. Let me do the chores.

3:25pm. I am back. Let me chill a bit. I meant to work on clearing the old wall more, but the weather started to turn rainy. I guess I'll finish it tomorrow or in the next two days.

4:05pm. Let me start. I'll leave Cultivator vs Superhero for later.

Let me study those volume example for a while longer.

4:10pm. No these are too boring. Let me go back to the rock video. I'll try skimming tihs time. After that I'll just do my own thing.

4:40pm. Had to take a break again. I pretty much wasted the last hour. These extended chores kill my momentum. Let me just focus on the video. Forget the fact that I do not need it. Let me watch it and I will move on.

4:45pm. https://youtu.be/WTg_pVZoac0?t=5989

I really dislike his technique. A strong technique would start from the big features and add progressively lower level of detail. This guy feels like he is jumping all over the place with the places he adds noise to.

https://youtu.be/WTg_pVZoac0?t=6094

Let me pause here. This is useless to me. Let me check out how Rohan did clouds. I am thinking about my own method, but if it is merely for controling the density a coarse fog would not be bad.

5:15pm. This is so annoying. Why am I getting such strange results in the inner and outer bands?

5:20pm. For some reason the exterior band option for fog volume does not work.

I just wanted to check if the exterior band auto expands when reshaped. It does not. Volumes have a strict bounding box around them.

5:30pm. I did not realize he built the scaler for the fog density himself. There is a relative to bounding box node.

5:35pm. You can access positions relative to the bounding box with BBX, BBY and BBZ.

This vop node even gets the relative position of a bounding box based on a group.

This is important. Working relative to bounding boxes is something I need to keep in mind.

The way he implemented procedural gradients here is brilliant.

5:45pm. The way he did the cloud is quite different from how the rock guy does it. He mostly used cloud nodes and did not mess with VOPs much. Still this does give me an option.

5:35pm. I thought that Scatter would accept the volume density, but it does not.

Houdini - How to scatter points inside a volume or on a surface

I must be going crazy.

6:10pm. Scatter can scatter points inside a volume, but it won't accept the density attribute.

Oh, no wait. It does that automatically.

6:40pm. Had to leave for lunch.

https://youtu.be/FU0DM84UGxQ
The Legend of Ghost Corgi - Part II - Volume Adjust Fog - Houdini 19

Sure Rohan showed me how to do the gradient ramp for the density, but there should be better ways. This is such a simple thing, but this particular SOP has been giving me a lot of trouble. I can't intuit how it works. Let me watch something on it.

6:45pm. Nevermind, I finally figured out how the line pattern works. This is wonderful. A lot better than having to implement the VOP.

The Bounding Box pattern type is exactly what is needed to implement the gradient. This is good. I can also try a radial gradient.

6:55pm. Perfect! The radial gradient is exactly what I've been looking for.

I really get it now. With this I should be able to carve away volume In ways that I see fit. I can take that big box, adjust it, turn it into volume, maybe even using the Cloud node since that takes in a flat division number and is scale insensitive, and then use Adjust fog to give it some gradient at the top and a radial reduction from the middle. I'll want to push the density towards the surface and away from the top.

7pm. Let me watch the Ghost Corgi video.

https://youtu.be/FU0DM84UGxQ?t=158

This is the kind of thing amateur programmers do - he could have just put in `max(@corgi,0)`. That would have saved him having to put in the upper range.

https://youtu.be/FU0DM84UGxQ?t=204

I am confused, why is he getting an outline? Is that a property of the noise function like Voroni distance to edge in Blender.

https://youtu.be/FU0DM84UGxQ?t=52

Ah, he has a special attribute. I am not sure what it is.

https://youtu.be/FU0DM84UGxQ?t=668

It seems this node only came in in Houdini 19. No wonder Rohan was making a ramp.

https://youtu.be/FU0DM84UGxQ?t=740

Oh wow, you can do it like this.

7:30pm. Ok, I got this far. Let me watch the rock tutorial and then I'll close at 8pn. I am satisfied with how well I know volumes now. I can make use of them to scatter point without problem.

Today I do not feel like going at it till 10pm. This kind of pace is not sustainable. Tomorrow I will definitely get back to my own project. I'll scatter those tiles without a hitch.

Instead of doing it like he has here, he could have instead copied the volumes to points (packed) and did an a foreach fold. I actually don't know how to use the for loop to do a fold just yet, but it should be doable. I'd have to fiddle around in order to figure it out. To combine he just needs to use the max operation.

8pm. I've been wondering what the second input to foreach is. Maybe that would solve the mystery of the input being different from what I need to iterate over.

8:10pm. > A loop can have more than one Block Begin node. So, for example, one branch of the network will get its input piecewise and another branch will be simple repetition accumulating the result of using the pieces.

Ohhh, I see.

8:40pm. I've figured it out. I completely understand how loops work in Houdini now. The second input can just be substituted with the piece block path param. It is no big deal.

This should be useful.

Every day that passes, Houdini seems less mystical.

Let me watch more of the rock tutorial. I'll try going till the 2h mark.

Look at this shit. The For loop documentation literally tells him how to do this more efficiently.

https://youtu.be/WTg_pVZoac0?t=6554

This is quite nice. Yeah, this is how I expected this would work.

8:55pm. https://youtu.be/WTg_pVZoac0?t=6715

This is a good idea. Taking the dot product with an upvector to get the color.

9:15pm. https://youtu.be/WTg_pVZoac0?t=7364

Let me watch the edge displacement part as well. I wonder if he will just resample the edges and then push them in the normal direction?

https://youtu.be/WTg_pVZoac0?t=7604

For once I actually anticipated what he would do. Using the cross product to get the 3 axes is a great idea.

9:30pm. If I wanted to deform just the edges, and Resample SOP did not work, I'd use the edges to create a mask and move the points depending on it. That would allow me to have a smooth surface.

Free Masterclass: Developing Complex Details Using Volumes in Houdini

Let me stop here. Since I've come this far, maybe I should finish tihs long tutorial. I am learning quite a bit.

I feel that learning about the cross product last week was like gaining a superpower. Yeah, learned about it in school, but it was useless there so I forgot all about it. But here it is quite useful!

9:35pm. I think that originally, way back in elementary school, really internalizing various concepts, like I've done today with the loop and the fog adjust node for example, is what kept me going all the way to that championship win.

What I am doing now has roots in my Logo programming. I wasn't always a functional programming junkie.

I guess it was inevitable that I would return to the path that would first bring me success. I never thought that something like Houdini existed. Nor that I would actually be seriously studying it, while leaving ML to the side. If I live long enough, I'll have my rematch with both trading and ML.

I need to accumulate a critical mass of art skill in order to be able to move other people's hearts, purely for the sake of enriching myself.

Normies always make a big deal about socializing. As if it is a big to toe the NPC line. The autism's answer to that is art.

The closer it gets to the essence of mind control, the better.

The more I draw upon the power of technology to empower myself, the better.

If I could just a machine into my brain to draw out my imagination directly, I sure would do that.

For the time being my hands will have to be the conduit for my desire, just as they have been."
