[MIRROR] Fixes Some Incredulously Fucked Up Recycler Behavior [MDB IGNORE] (#17018)

* Fixes Some Incredulously Fucked Up Recycler Behavior (#70638)

* test one

Hey there!

Did you know that if you toss someone into a recycled emagger, that we delete _all_ of that mob's contents? You probably didn't because this shit is broken broken. Like, ow.

That's because we manually moved an item to nullspace, which caused a _slew_ of odd behavior in the Destroy chain for `obj/item` since it moves it to nullspace at a very specific point in time and makes all of it's assumptions on when you move the thing to nullspace. If it's in nullspace before you call qdel, you would shit out the ass with hanging references stuck on the mob (like `w_uniform` pointing to something in nullspace, like the image above).

All fixed now, though.

* I FUCKING LOVE UNIT TESTS

THIS SHIT WILL NEVER BREAK AGAIN!!!

Record dependencies of a cast on other casts that it requires.

When creating a cast that uses a conversion function, we've
historically allowed the input and result types to be
binary-compatible with the function's input and result types,
rather than necessarily being identical.  This means that the new
cast is logically dependent on the binary-compatible cast or casts
that it references: if those are defined by pg_cast entries, and you
try to restore the new cast without having defined them, it'll fail.
Hence, we should make pg_depend entries to record these dependencies
so that pg_dump knows that there is an ordering requirement.

This is not the only place where we allow such shortcuts; aggregate
functions for example are similarly lax, and in principle should gain
similar dependencies.  However, for now it seems sufficient to fix
the cast-versus-cast case, as pg_dump's other ordering heuristics
should keep it out of trouble for other object types.

Per report from David Turo≈à; thanks also to Robert Haas for
preliminary investigation.  I considered back-patching, but
seeing that this issue has existed for many years without
previous reports, it's not clear it's worth the trouble.
Moreover, back-patching wouldn't be enough to ensure that the
new pg_depend entries exist in existing databases anyway.

[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

Builds logic that manages turfs contained inside an area (#70966)

## About The Pull Request

Area contents isn't a real list, instead it involves filtering
everything in world
This is slow, and something we should have better support for.

So instead, lets manage a list of turfs inside our area. This is simple,
since we already move turfs by area contents anyway

This should speed up the uses I've found, and opens us up to using this
pattern more often, which should make dev work easier.

By nature this is a tad fragile, so I've added a unit test to double
check my work

Rather then instantly removing turfs from the contained_turfs list, we
enter them into a list of turfs to pull out, later.
Then we just use a getter for contained_turfs rather then a var read

This means we don't need to generate a lot of usage off removing turf by
turf from space, and can instead do it only when we need to

I've added a subsystem to manage this process as well, to ensure we
don't get any out of memory errors. It goes entry by entry, ensuring we
get no overtime.
This allows me to keep things like space clean, while keeping high
amounts of usage on a sepearate subsystem when convienient

As a part of this goal of keeping space's churn as low as possible, I've
setup code to ensure we do not add turfs to areas during a z level
increment adjacent mapload. this saves a LOT of time, but is a tad
messy

I've expanded where we use contained_turfs, including into some cases
that filter for objects in areas. need to see if this is sane or not.

Builds sortedAreas on demand, caching until we mark the cache as
violated

It's faster, and it also has the same behavior

I'm not posting speed changes cause frankly they're gonna be a bit
scattered and I'm scared to.
@Mothblocks if you'd like I can look into it. I think it'll pay for
itself just off `reg_in_areas_in_z` (I looked into it. it's really hard
to tell, sometimes it's a bit slower (0.7), sometimes it's 2 seconds
(0.5 if you use the old master figure) faster. life is pain.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Less stupid, more flexible, more speed

Brimdemons & Lobstrosities drop (slightly) useful organs (#70546)



Goliaths, Legions, Watchers, and (as of recently) Bileworms all drop
something vaguely useful when they die.
Brimdemons and Lobstrosities do not. This PR aims to fix that, so that
there's at least some vague benefit to hunting them.

In this case it takes the form of organs you get when you butcher them,
similar to the regenerative core from Legions.
As they're similar to the regenerative core, I modified the regenerative
core to extend from a new common "monster core" typepath which these two
new organs also extend.
Like the regenerative core, both of these items do something when used
and something slightly different if you go to the effort of having
someone implant them into your body. They also decay over time, and you
can use stabilising serum to prevent this from happening.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967746-55a7d04d-224e-412d-aedc-3a0ec754db3d.mp4

The Rush Gland from the Lobstrosity lets you do a little impression of
their charging attack, making you run very fast for a handful of seconds
and ignoring slowdown effects. Unlike a lobstrosity you aren't actually
built to do this so if you run into a mob you will fall over, and if you
are doing this on the space station running into any dense object will
also make you fall over (it shouldn't make you _too_ much of a pain for
security to catch).
The idea here is that you use this to save time running back and forth
from the mining base.

The Brimdust Sac from the Brimdemon covers you in exploding dust. The
next three times you take Brute damage some of the dust will explode,
dealing damage equal to an unupgraded PKA shot to anything near you (but
not you).
If you do this in a space station not only is the damage proportionally
lower (still matching the PKA), but it _does_ effect you and also it
sets you on fire. You can remove the buff by showering it off.
The idea here is that you use this for minor revenge damage on enemies
whose attacks you don't manage to dodge.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967811-0b362ba9-2da0-42ac-bd55-3809473cbc74.mp4

If you implant the Rush Gland then you can use it once every 3 minutes
without consuming it, and the buff lasts very slightly longer. It will
automatically trigger itself if your health gets low, which might be
good (helps you escape a rough situation) or bad (didn't want to use it
yet).


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967888-f63f7cbd-60cd-4309-8004-203afc5b2153.mp4

If you implant the Brimdust Sac then you can use it once every 3 minutes
to shake off cloud of dust which gives the buff to everyone nearby, if
you want to kit out your miner squad. The dust cloud also makes you
cough if you stand in it, and it's opaque. If you catch fire with this
organ inside you and aren't in mining atmosphere then it will explode
inside of your abdomen, which should probably be avoided, resultingly it
is very risky to use this on the space station.

Move Boost into C++ Docs; Add Libraries Section

Hi wonderful Bazelers,

This is just a docs change.

Backstory: I'd been looking to make HTTPS requests across platforms from C++. A classic problem if there ever were one, networking being perhaps the most glaring omission in the C++ standard library. Thankfully, this is a problem Bazel can solve well, since most of the problem is the friction of using 3rd party libraries from C++. So, I spun up some build rules to make network requests easy, inspired by collaborating on the boost ones, and set off to add them to the docs.

Along the way, I noticed that the boost rules were in an odd spot: Listed at the language level alongside C++, rather than nested within C++. So I fixed that by nesting Boost inside, added Abseil, and then (hoping you'll forgive my hubris), I'd love to add the rules I just released, since I think they're a solution to a very real need. Perhaps rules for more famous, critical libraries can accumulate there over time, helping Bazel users get set up with the essential tools they need.

Thanks for your consideration!
Chris
(ex-Googler and author of [bazel-compile-commands-extractor](https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor), also in the docs.)

Closes #16621.

Prestige Neopolis Hyderabad - Enjoy Seamless Connectivity

Since the start of the pandemic, sales of the luxury development of Prestige Neopolis have been on the rise, and demand remains high even now. There is a good appetite for luxury flats with high-end conveniences and thoughtful plans.

Several real estate experts believe that the demand for luxury real estate projects like Prestige Neopolis Hyderabad has not only increased but also that values have risen in the upcoming times. This is largely due to demand exceeding the source.

Commit 2b1299322016 ("x86/speculation: Add RSB VM Exit protections")
made a right mess of the RSB stuffing, rewrite the whole thing to not
suck.

Thanks to Andrew for the enlightening comment about Post-Barrier RSB

Manually copy trailing attributes on a resize (#12637)

## THE WHITE WHALE

This is a fairly naive fix for this bug. It's not terribly performant,
but neither is resize in the first place.

When the buffer gets resized, typically we only copy the text up to the
`MeasureRight` point, the last printable char in the row. Then we'd just
use the last char's attributes to fill the remainder of the row.

Instead, this PR changes how reflow behaves when it gets to the end of
the row. After we finish copying text, then manually walk through the
attributes at the end of the row, and copy them over. This ensures that
cells that just have a colored space in them get copied into the new
buffer as well, and we don't just blat the last character's attributes
into the rest of the row. We'll do a similar thing once we get to the
last printable char in the buffer, copying the remaining attributes.

This could DEFINITELY be more performant. I think this current
implementation walks the attrs _on every cell_, then appends the new
attrs to the new ATTR_ROW. That could be optimized by just using the
actual iterator. The copy after the last printable char bit is also
especially bad in this regard. That could likely be a blind copy - I
just wanted to get this into the world.

Finally, we now copy the final attributes to the correct buffer: the new
one.  We used to copy them to the _old_ buffer, which we were about to
destroy.

## Validation

I'll add more gifs in the morning, not enough time to finish spinning a
release Terminal build with this tonight.

UpdatePaths Readme - Reforged (#70806)

* UpdatePaths Readme - Reforged

I'm a bit tired after typing for the last hour so apologies if some of this stuff is unreadable. Basically, I just took time to add a small blurb about UpdatePaths in MAPS_AND_AWAY_MISSIONS.md, as well as write out examples on how you can properly use every single function UpdatePaths might have. I'm probably missing something? I think I got everything though. Let me know if I should be consistent somehow, but I did deliberately choose different test-cases per example because it's nearly impossible to come up one "generic" fit-all situation that illustrates every possible use of UpdatePaths (to my small mind).

Anyways, hope this helps.

Copy requirements map to robot context when loading a new `ProcessedTerm` (#827)

Closes #540.

When we typecheck and capability check a new term, resulting in a `ProcessedTerm`, we already know the `Requirement`s for all the `def`s it contains.  This PR simply takes all those definition requirements and adds them to `robotContext . defReqs` just before installing the new `ProcessedTerm` in the CESK machine, so that if we ever encounter the name of any of the definitions inside an argument to `build` or `reprogram`---which we capability check at runtime---we will be able to properly match up names with their requirements.

This is a hack for several reasons:
- We really shouldn't be capability-checking arguments to `build` and `reprogram` at runtime in the first place---ideally we should be able to check everything statically.  But fixing that will require implementing #231 .
- We have to do this in three places in the code: when loading a new term into the base when the player hits Enter at the REPL; when executing `run`; and when running the solution from a scenario in the integration tests.  Ideally, there would be only one place, but I don't have a good idea at the moment how to refactor things properly.
- Technically, the names being defined shouldn't be in scope until after their corresponding `def` runs, so it's incorrect to dump them all into the `defReqs` prior to executing any of the `def`s.
    - However, doing it properly, with each name coming into scope with its requirements right after the `def` runs, is very tricky/annoying to implement for more reasons than I care to write about here (believe me, I tried, and it made my brain hurt).  For starters, we don't really have access to the robot state when stepping the CESK machine.
    - The only scenario where this would be a problem is if (1) there is already a name `x` defined, and then we (2) `run` a `.sw` file containing, first, a `build` command whose argument references `x`, and second, a redefinition of `x`.  In that case the `build` would incorrectly decide that the `x` in the argument to `build` has the requirements of the *second* `x` (the one that will be redefined later) even though the first `x` is the one that should still be in scope.  However, this seems like a very unlikely scenario (who would write a `.sw` file that depends on some specific name already being defined before it is run, but then redefines that same name later?) and I'd *much* rather have that obscure problem than the current very relevant and annoying one.

However, it's a simple hack that solves the issue and will be easy to get rid of later if and when we do something better.  I'm a big believer in doing things the right way, but in this instance I definitely think we should just do the simple thing that mostly works and then continue to make it better in the future.
