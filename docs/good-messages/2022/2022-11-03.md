UpdatePaths Readme - Reforged (#70806)

* UpdatePaths Readme - Reforged

I'm a bit tired after typing for the last hour so apologies if some of this stuff is unreadable. Basically, I just took time to add a small blurb about UpdatePaths in MAPS_AND_AWAY_MISSIONS.md, as well as write out examples on how you can properly use every single function UpdatePaths might have. I'm probably missing something? I think I got everything though. Let me know if I should be consistent somehow, but I did deliberately choose different test-cases per example because it's nearly impossible to come up one "generic" fit-all situation that illustrates every possible use of UpdatePaths (to my small mind).

Anyways, hope this helps.

* i fucked up with the TGM format

Brimdemons & Lobstrosities drop (slightly) useful organs (#70546)



Goliaths, Legions, Watchers, and (as of recently) Bileworms all drop
something vaguely useful when they die.
Brimdemons and Lobstrosities do not. This PR aims to fix that, so that
there's at least some vague benefit to hunting them.

In this case it takes the form of organs you get when you butcher them,
similar to the regenerative core from Legions.
As they're similar to the regenerative core, I modified the regenerative
core to extend from a new common "monster core" typepath which these two
new organs also extend.
Like the regenerative core, both of these items do something when used
and something slightly different if you go to the effort of having
someone implant them into your body. They also decay over time, and you
can use stabilising serum to prevent this from happening.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967746-55a7d04d-224e-412d-aedc-3a0ec754db3d.mp4

The Rush Gland from the Lobstrosity lets you do a little impression of
their charging attack, making you run very fast for a handful of seconds
and ignoring slowdown effects. Unlike a lobstrosity you aren't actually
built to do this so if you run into a mob you will fall over, and if you
are doing this on the space station running into any dense object will
also make you fall over (it shouldn't make you _too_ much of a pain for
security to catch).
The idea here is that you use this to save time running back and forth
from the mining base.

The Brimdust Sac from the Brimdemon covers you in exploding dust. The
next three times you take Brute damage some of the dust will explode,
dealing damage equal to an unupgraded PKA shot to anything near you (but
not you).
If you do this in a space station not only is the damage proportionally
lower (still matching the PKA), but it _does_ effect you and also it
sets you on fire. You can remove the buff by showering it off.
The idea here is that you use this for minor revenge damage on enemies
whose attacks you don't manage to dodge.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967811-0b362ba9-2da0-42ac-bd55-3809473cbc74.mp4

If you implant the Rush Gland then you can use it once every 3 minutes
without consuming it, and the buff lasts very slightly longer. It will
automatically trigger itself if your health gets low, which might be
good (helps you escape a rough situation) or bad (didn't want to use it
yet).


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967888-f63f7cbd-60cd-4309-8004-203afc5b2153.mp4

If you implant the Brimdust Sac then you can use it once every 3 minutes
to shake off cloud of dust which gives the buff to everyone nearby, if
you want to kit out your miner squad. The dust cloud also makes you
cough if you stand in it, and it's opaque. If you catch fire with this
organ inside you and aren't in mining atmosphere then it will explode
inside of your abdomen, which should probably be avoided, resultingly it
is very risky to use this on the space station.

Clowns will now always like bananas. (#70919)



## About The Pull Request
Clown's liver makes them like bananas, ignoring their racial food
preferences.

## Why It's Good For The Game
I don't think clown moths should vomit from eating bananas. They are
clowns, after all.
Also clowns are healed from eating them, so it's a bit silly that they
vomit from their funny medicine.

## Changelog


:cl:
balance: Non-human clowns enjoy eating bananas now.

cocci: make "coccicheck" rule incremental

Optimize the very slow "coccicheck" target to take advantage of
incremental rebuilding, and fix outstanding dependency problems with
the existing rule.

The rule is now faster both on the initial run as we can make better
use of GNU make's parallelism than the old ad-hoc combination of
make's parallelism combined with $(SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE) and/or the
"--jobs" argument to "spatch(1)".

It also makes us *much* faster when incrementally building, it's now
viable to "make coccicheck" as topic branches are merged down.

The rule didn't use FORCE (or its equivalents) before, so a:

	make coccicheck
	make coccicheck

Would report nothing to do on the second iteration. But all of our
patch output depended on all $(COCCI_SOURCES) files, therefore e.g.:

    make -W grep.c coccicheck

Would do a full re-run, i.e. a a change in a single file would force
us to do a full re-run.

The reason for this (not the initial rationale, but my analysis) is:

* Since we create a single "*.cocci.patch+" we don't know where to
  pick up where we left off, or how to incrementally merge e.g. a
  "grep.c" change with an existing *.cocci.patch.

* We've been carrying forward the dependency on the *.c files since
  63f0a758a06 (add coccicheck make target, 2016-09-15) the rule was
  initially added as a sort of poor man's dependency discovery.

  As we don't include other *.c files depending on other *.c files
  has always been broken, as could be trivially demonstrated
  e.g. with:

       make coccicheck
       make -W strbuf.h coccicheck

  However, depending on the corresponding *.c files has been doing
  something, namely that *if* an API change modified both *.c and *.h
  files we'd catch the change to the *.h we care about via the *.c
  being changed.

  For API changes that happened only via *.h files we'd do the wrong
  thing before this change, but e.g. for function additions (not
  "static inline" ones) catch the *.h change by proxy.

Now we'll instead:

 * Create a <RULE>/<FILE> pair in the .build directory, E.g. for
   swap.cocci and grep.c we'll create
   .build/contrib/coccinelle/swap.cocci.patch/grep.c.

   That file is the diff we'll apply for that <RULE>-<FILE>
   combination, if there's no changes to me made (the common case)
   it'll be an empty file.

 * Our generated *.patch
   file (e.g. contrib/coccinelle/swap.cocci.patch) is now a simple "cat
   $^" of all of all of the <RULE>/<FILE> files for a given <RULE>.

   In the case discussed above of "grep.c" being changed we'll do the
   full "cat" every time, so they resulting *.cocci.patch will always
   be correct and up-to-date, even if it's "incrementally updated".

   See 1cc0425a27c (Makefile: have "make pot" not "reset --hard",
   2022-05-26) for another recent rule that used that technique.

As before we'll:

 * End up generating a contrib/coccinelle/swap.cocci.patch, if we
   "fail" by creating a non-empty patch we'll still exit with a zero
   exit code.

   Arguably we should move to a more Makefile-native way of doing
   this, i.e. fail early, and if we want all of the "failed" changes
   we can use "make -k", but as the current
   "ci/run-static-analysis.sh" expects us to behave this way let's
   keep the existing behavior of exhaustively discovering all cocci
   changes, and only failing if spatch itself errors out.

Further implementation details & notes:

 * Before this change running "make coccicheck" would by default end
   up pegging just one CPU at the very end for a while, usually as
   we'd finish whichever *.cocci rule was the most expensive.

   This could be mitigated by combining "make -jN" with
   SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE, see 960154b9c17 (coccicheck: optionally batch
   spatch invocations, 2019-05-06).

   There will be cases where getting rid of "SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE" makes
   things worse, but a from-scratch "make coccicheck" with the default
   of SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE=1 (and tweaking it doesn't make a difference)
   is faster (~3m36s v.s. ~3m56s) with this approach, as we can feed
   the CPU more work in a less staggered way.

 * Getting rid of "SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE" particularly helps in cases
   where the default of 1 yields parallelism under "make coccicheck",
   but then running e.g.:

       make -W contrib/coccinelle/swap.cocci coccicheck

   I.e. before that would use only one CPU core, until the user
   remembered to adjust "SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE" differently than the
   setting that makes sense when doing a non-incremental run of "make
   coccicheck".

 * Before the "make coccicheck" rule would have to clean
   "contrib/coccinelle/*.cocci.patch*", since we'd create "*+" and
   "*.log" files there. Now those are created in
   .build/contrib/coccinelle/, which is covered by the "cocciclean" rule
   already.

Outstanding issues & future work:

 * We could get rid of "--all-includes" in favor of manually
   specifying a list of includes to give to "spatch(1)".

   As noted upthread of [1] a naïve removal of "--all-includes" will
   result in broken *.cocci patches, but if we know the exhaustive
   list of includes via COMPUTE_HEADER_DEPENDENCIES we don't need to
   re-scan for them, we could grab the headers to include from the
   .depend.d/<file>.o.d and supply them with the "--include" option to
   spatch(1).q

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].
With this patch a process can be killed via:

 #include <fcntl.h>

 */
Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

Introduces a new `PgTryBuilder` type for properly mimicking Postgres' `PG_TRY/PG_CATCH/PG_FINALLY` C macro construct.  This completely replaces the old `pg_try()` function (which is now gone and was severely bugged).

`PgTryBuilder` lets users execute code and respond to any `PgSqlErrorCode` (which now includes a `::RustPanic` variant!) to either do cleanup work and rethrow the error, or otherwise ignore it and return a different value.  Documentation, examples, and tests for PgTryBuilder will be coming in another commit.  Rust drop semantics work properly as well.

There's a lot of other nice changes in here as well...

- The `CONTEXT` ("errcontext_msg") slot of a raised Postgres error now contains as much stack information we can gather while pgx is propagating errors.  Additionally, the `LOCATION` slot contains the `file:line` of whatever raised the first error -- either a Rust panic or a Postgres error.  This did require pushing down a `#[track_caller]` attribute on **every** Postgres FFI we wrap.

Overall, error handling has been cleaned up such that the **only** place we call back to postgres to raise an ERROR (or rethrow one) is the top-level `guard(|| ...)` function, which is used by `#[pg_guard]` and friends.

(note to self: other users of that function throughout the code need to be audited.  I think they need to instead use PgTryBuilder).

- The `ereport!()` macro has been expanded to support a shorthand syntax where the first argument can be the error level name.  Example:  `ereport!(ERROR, PgSqlErrorCode::ERRCODE_INTERNAL_ERROR, "oh no!");"`.  And the `ERROR/PANIC/FATAL` versions know they don't return and insert an `unreachable!()`.

- The `error!()` macro now also supprots specifying an error code:  Example: `error!(PgSqlErrorCode::ERRCODE_NUMERIC_VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE, "too small")`

Add shell completion

This provides a shell completion mechanism for dune. This relies on the
bash completion API, which can be used with zsh as well.

The architecture is:

- `dune complete script` outputs a script to be sourced in the user's
  shell. It is comprised of a `_dune` function and the `complete -F
  _dune dune` command to register it. The `_dune` function can be used
  in cram tests to write natural-looking tests for this feature.
- this script calls `dune complete command` with the partial
  command-line. This internal command parses it to determine what the
  word being completed refers to: a command name, an argument name, or
  an argument value. The first two ones are part of the metadata
  `cmdliner` knows about; the last one is provided through a completion
  function that can be passed in one the `Arg` functions.
- the interface between `bash` and `dune complete command` is simple:
  it passes the command line and a position to complete at (this is
  necessary to encode the difference between `dune bui<tab>` and `dune
  build <tab>` for example), and reads an array from the output of the
  command.

The things I'm happy with:

- it is small!
- coverage is pretty good: command names, arguments (positional and
  optional, including optional arguments with optional names), and the
  `--` construct are supported. So, this is likely to improve the user
  experience already.
- it is easy to test through cram or unit tests (I chose the former).

Now, for the ugly bits...

- this effectively is a partial reimplementation of cmdliner inside
  `complete.ml`. If the exact parsing rules are different, it means that
  we can complete to something with different or wrong semantics.
- the vendored copy of cmdliner is patched to expose so that it is
  possible to use the private APIs. these two points need to be resolved
  before we can think about how to upstream this.
- some bits of the cmdliner API need to be modified to provide
  completion automatically. For example for things like `enum` it's easy
  to provide a completion function automatically.
- it is difficult to define the right API for the completion functions.
  `unit -> string list` is a first approximation but with some
  limitations. For example, getting a list of buildable targets needs to
  run under `Fiber`, but we can't pollute the API with it. Interestingly
  enough, algebraic effects seem like they would be an interesting
  solution for this.
- at the moment, we're not relying on the shell's completion helpers to
  complete things like filenames. To support this we would either need
  to implement that in OCaml, or extend the bash/dune interface so that
  the completion function could call `compgen -f` based on the dune
  output.
- as a way to tie the two previous points: if we wanted to complete
  `dune build dir/file<tab>`, it would be a lot more efficient to pass
  the prefix to the build system and let it compute just the targets
  that match this, rather than compute everything and filter it
  afterwards. So that prefix would need to appear in the completion API.

[FIX] website, *: allow to re-edit company team snippet images

*: website_sale

Since [1], it was not possible to edit a company team snippet image
anymore as soon as the page was saved once. Indeed that commit added
o_not_editable/contenteditable="false" on the parent column to make sure
no text can be added in that column and contenteditable="true" on the
images so that they are still editable (even though HTML-specs-wise
adding contenteditable="true" on images probably does not mean much as
images are self-closing tags, our editor understand that as the ability
to edit the image anyway). That contenteditable="true" part is however
removed when leaving edit mode... and was not restored upon entering
edit mode again.

This fixes the problems with a specific JS patch, we'll review to see if
better can be done in master.

Funny enough, that bug was actually gone in 15.0... by mistake. A recent
bug fix actually reintroduced that isolated bug at [2] (by reintroducing
the fact that images in a non-editable environment are not possible to
edit). The 3 opened tickets this commit mentions were actually reported
for 15.0 immediately after that, while the 14.0 being broken about this
since the beginning apparently did not bother anyone.

Note: as a forward-ported fix, this also takes the opportunity to clean
a bit what was done at [3]. (calling `_super`, no duplicated code,
adding comments, ...).

Chore(hooks): move secret check to pre-commit

So far the check for secrets runs on pre-push. This leads to some
trouble when working with files that have a checksum. These files (e.g.
`build.gradle.kts` or `README.md`) have false positives and are accepted
with a specific checksum. Adjusting these files always creates a new
checksum and needs to be verified again. Finally the new checksum must
be put into the `.talismanrc` and added to the commit.
If the check runs after all commits are bundled, it is cumbersome to
either interactively rebase the local history to integrate this change,
or append a "stupid" fix commit.
To circumvent this problem, we now check secrets pre-commit. The check
is fast enough to not be annoying on every commit.

  <ul type=circle>
<ul> <li>Rene Magritte was born in Lessines, Belgium in 1898. Although little is known about his early life, we do know he began drawing in 1910 at the tender age of 12.</li><br>
  <li>From 1916 to 1918, Rene decided to study at the <em>Academie des Beaux-Art</em>, which was located in Brussels. He left the school, because he thought that it was a waste of time. All his paintings afterward reflect cubism, the movements which were introduced by Pablo Picasso and was very popular at the time. In 1922 he married Georgette, and took a number of small jobs, including painting cabbage roses for a wallpaper company, in order to be able to pay the bills.</li><br>
  <li>Magritte's 1964 The Son of Man, which features a bowler-hatted subject's face shrouded by a hovering green apple and is ostensibly his most famous piece, was really created as a self-portrait! I found this to be very interesting as there is usealy s story behind an artists self-portrait.</li><br>
  <li> Magritte's works have grown so recognizable in the period after his death in 1967 that they can't even be stolen, as a group of thieves discovered in 2009. Hilariously,they were unable to sell his £3.6 million work, <em>Olympia</em>, on the black market after liberating it, with possible buyers arguing it was too recognizable to acquire. Three years later, the painting was dutifully returned to the Magritte Museum in perfect condition.</li><br>
   <li> Brussels, where Magritte spent much of his life, named a street <em>Ceci n’est pas une rue</em> meaning <b>This is not a street</b> after his most famous work, <em>The Treachery of Images.</em></li><br>
  <li> Magritte spent much of his free time, in addition to his professional interests, experimenting with photography, and while his images were never viewed with the same veneration as his paintings, they did play a role in inspiring his later works. <br><br>
 <li> Now that we've got the history out of the way let's look at some of his most famous pieces of art - and the first one coming up is one I've wanted for a very long time on a wall in my house...

     In 1953-1954, artist Rene Magritte painted The Empire of Lights. It is the only time that Magritte used a title that was not his own.<br><br> The intriguing oil painting displays a beautiful house lit up by its interior lights, and surrounded by the darkness of the night. Especially surreal is that the sky above the house and treeline is a daytime sky full of brightness and plump white clouds. <br><br>It is a serene, mysterious scene. In Empire of Light, numerous versions of which exist, a dark, nocturnal street scene is set against a pastel-blue, light-drenched sky spotted with fluffy cumulus clouds. With no fantastic element other than the single paradoxical combination of day and night, René Magritte upsets a fundamental organizing premise of life. Sunlight, ordinarily the source of clarity, here causes the confusion and unease traditionally associated with darkness. <br><br>The luminosity of the sky becomes unsettling, making the empty darkness below even more impenetrable than it would seem in a normal context. The bizarre subject is treated in an impersonal, precise style, typical of veristic Surrealist painting and preferred by Magritte since the mid-1920s.

        alt="The Human Condition, 1933"/><br>
<p>
  Two of Magritte's favored themes were the "window painting" and the "painting within a painting." The Human Condition is one of Magritte's earliest treatments of either subject, and in it he combines the two, making what may be his most subtle and profound statement of their shared meaning.
<b>The Human Condition<b> displays an easel placed inside a room and in front of a window. The easel holds an unframed painting of a landscape that seems in every detail contiguous with the landscape seen outside the window. <br><br>At first, one automatically assumes that the painting on the easel depicts the portion of the landscape outside the window that it hides from view. After a moment's consideration, however, one realizes that this assumption is based upon a false premise: that is, that the imagery of Magritte's painting is real, while the painting on the easel is a representation of that reality. In fact, there is no difference between them. Both are part of the same painting, the same artistic fabrication. It is perhaps to this repeating cycle, in which the viewer, even against his will, sees the one as real and the other as representation, that Magritte's title makes reference.</p>

        alt="On the Threshold of Liberty, 1937"/><Br>
<p>
  On the Threshold of Liberty is a controversial piece by René Magritte. It is a prime example of pre-world war two surrealism, which is also an example of the fusion of pre-surrealism/post-dada movement: a modal intermediate between 'anti-art' and the expressionistic ideas of dreams presented by the works of Carl Jung that symbols have meaning based in dreams.<br> <br> Through these ideas of semiotic studies, the expressionism used with varied images to convey surreal contortion of art, making use of dream images fused into paintings. It was a common element to use the 'collective conscious' idea as a mantra for painting in the surrealist movement: creating a fabricated reality with no coherent meaning other than what the observer created.</p> <br><br>

Optimizes qdel related things (slight init time savings) (#70729)

* Moves spawners and decals to a different init/delete scheme

Rather then fully creating and then immediately deleting these things,
we instead do the bare minimum.

This is faster, if in theory more fragile. We should be safe since any
errors should be caught in compile since this is very close to a
"static" action. It does mean these atoms cannot use signals, etc.

* Potentially saves init time, mostly cleans up a silly pattern

We use sleeps and INVOKE_ASYNC to ensure that handing back turfs doesn't
block a space reservation, but this by nature consumes up to the
threshold and a bit more of whatever working block we were in.

This is silly. Should just be a subsystem, so I made it one, with
support for awaiting its finish if you want to

* Optimizes garbage/proc/Queue slightly

Queue takes about 1.6 seconds to process 26k items right now.
The MASSIVE majority of this time is spent on using \ref
This is because \ref returns a string, and that string requires being
inserted into the global cache of strings we store

What I'm doing is caching the result of ANY \ref on the datum it's
applied to. This ensures previous uses will never decay from the string
tree.

This saves about 0.2 seconds of init

reversion back to 3.5

as expected, many things broke when upgrading to godot 4. instead of going through and fixing each issue one-by-one, which would have taken a very long time with no guarantee of working, we've reverted back to 3.5 and will make an attempts to prepare the project a little bit before attempting to upgrade again. ideally, we would wait for a stable 4 release, but i've put off doing this for too long already and would like to get started.
one of the changes that broke the project was the automatic re-naming of some nodes, notably, "World" became "World3D". worse still, filepath directories that pointed to a folder named "World" had their path re-named "World3D".
this gives us an opportunity to really clean up our codebase. we shouldn't reference our "World" node directly in script anywhere, except once, storing its NodePath in a global variable, which other parts of the program can access if they need to.
we also have to decide how we want to name this node in such a way to that the conversion process doesn't automatically re-name it to something else. i think something like "GameWorld" might work, since it seems the conversion only affected whole word isntances of "World". this is such a stupid fucking problem. maybe i'm wasting my time doing this and should wait for a stable 4 release after all. if all that ends up happening is me running into stupid fucking problems, then i'm wasting my time.

      Refactor for NULL datastack support

Jason Madden (244):
      Back to development: 1.2.0
      A bare thread.join() with no timeout is an invitation to hang the process.
      A bare Event.wait() with no timeout is an invitation to hang the process.
      See if all compilers can work in C++ mode.
      Debugging: Do thread_local objects work?
      Drop Python 2.7 on Windows; the compiler is far too old.
      Try declspec(thread) for old MSC.
      Port all global variables to a threadlocal struct.
      Add benchmarks.
      debug.
      more debugging.
      g_switchstack was using a stack local variable, which it can't do.
      Perhaps MSVC was combining the two apparent copies of g_thread_state_global in g_switchstack into a single copy, thus messing up the stack.
      Try a separate function.
      Remove debugging and update comments.
      Checkpoint on #252.
      Fix compilation on MSVC.
      Enable debug prints, windows is crashing.
      You can't call PyObject_Print if there's an error set.
      More debugging
      Hmm, sometimes the current greenlet was null on Windows? How?
      Checkpoint moving to a more flexible use of TLS.
      The indirect TLS support appears to be working, and I have fixed #252
      Some debugging.
      Sometimes we lose a greenlet.
      Fix the leak on older versions of CPython.
      Some platforms don't leak the greenlet when explicitly referenced.
      Queue pending cleanups to reduce the number of Py_AddPendingCall slots we take.
      Separating out concerns.
      Progress on supporting older compilers.
      Thus begins the fight against MSVC 9.
      Use the old idiom.
      Stop including headers we know aren't present. We got to that point of the compile on old MSVC.
      Trying MFC classes for the lock. Not sure if that will work.
      MFC was a no-go. So use the win32 API.
      Introduce PyMainGreenlet as a subtype of greenlet.
      Fix bad descriptor error on Python 2.7 for the main greenlet, and compilation error on MSVC.
      Implement cleanup using the thread dictionary on platforms that require it.
      Add GHA test cases that disable the use of standard threading.
      Allow using the PyThread_ APIs back on Python 2.7 as well. Add tox.ini to test this.
      Test 2.7 non-standard threading on GHA. Use 3.10 final on Appveyor.
      Eliminate a few unneeded calls te GET_THREAD_STATE.
      Passing the thread state through all the calls was too much, see if we can save just this one.
      Try another way to pass the info around.
      Reducing preprocessor reliance.
      Simplify thread state cleanup.
      Fix a faulty assertion.
      Tweak compiler flags.
      More Py2/Py3 cleanups.
      Py2.7 testing.
      Remove more debugging code.
      Update documentation.
      Ensure more tests don't leak greenlets.
      Try to clean up some more leaked greenlets seen on linux.
      Debugging
      More debugging
      Yet more debugging.
      Yet more debugging.
      Looks like my cleanup isn't running?
      Try harder to wait for active threads to die.
      More work on the race conditions seen on GHA
      Make waiting for the greenlet cleanup much more deterministic.
      Always use RAII/stack-based locking/unlocking.
      Enable exception handling for old MSVC
      Whoops, can't enable PYTHONFAULTHANDLER twice. GHA complains.
      Fix a double-addressing issue.
      Add change note.
      Sketches on #265. Which compilers will fail?
      compiler compatibility; continuing to iterate design.
      More iteration.
      Missed a header.
      Checkpoint.
      Fix a leak for run functions in greenlets that were never switched to.
      More static typing...and because this is C++, lots more keyboard typing.
      More type safety at initialization.
      Incremental progress threading ownership objects throughout.
      Move the tracefunc.
      Move target greenlet and origin greenlet to typed references.
      Move main greenlet to ownership refs.
      More on error handling and arg parsing.
      Fix MSVC.
      Checkpoint.
      Do initialize the main greenlet automatically.
      Add leakchecks to the actual test cases themselves.
      Add leakchecks to the actual test cases themselves.
      Move operator== outside the class for old MSVC.
      More comments on the leaks.
      Move ref classes to new file.
      Checkpoint on more closely managing object lifetime during switches.
      We are very sensitive to where greenlets get deallocated.
      Fix some crashes.
      Fix tests, including fixing an actual leak.
      Fix a threaded crash; zope.testrunner no longer reports reference leaks
      fix test_tuple_subclass on python 2
      In optimized builds, green_switch could crash.
      Add a test for, and fix, a potential crasher.
      Hopefully fix Py27 on Windows.
      That fixed Py27 on Windows, but broke every other Windows compiler.
      STill failing on windows, so try a regular static object.
      Better return value handling.
      Find and fix one apparent leak
      More notes on stack leaks and attempts to do something about it.
      Improve error handling, add a test for a path that was previously untested.
      Add version pin for docutils on Python 2.7.
      Use faulthandler on Windows as well.
      Windows: 32 bit builds are crashing somewhere, unclear why. Try to see any compiler warnings.
      The 32-bit windows error seems to have something to do with Microsoft's SEH.
      /EHa did not fix the 32-bit Windows problem. Maybe /SAFESEH:NO?
      What if we require SAFESEH?
      Fix the crash checking against a different thread state again.
      The SAFESEH stuff looks like a red herring.
      Add another test for cross-thread throwing.
      It looks like 32-bit Windows compilers don't like catch(...), no matter how new the compiler is.
      Try using the compiler intrinsics to access the SEH info
      Take the c off the /EHsc.
      Debugging.
      MSVC is picky about extern C matching.
      More debugging.
      Force g_switch_finish to be called virtually.
      Some extra info lives on the stack of functions that use exceptions. Perhaps we need to add some magic?
      Too much
      Sprinkle in some more noexcept.
      Quite possibly we weren't saving the seh in a place it would actually be saved.
      Ok, I give up on 32-bit windows. See how far we need to rewind to use exceptions correctly; just return until then.
      Silly compile error.
      One level was not enough. Try two.
      That got us a lot further; now more debugging.
      More debugging.
      One more try with /EHa.
      Enable some debug options on MSVC.
      Can't use /MDd because we would need the Python debug libs.
      Debugging: Temporarily add a vectored exception handler.
      We do seem to get a vectored exception each time we throw a C++ exception.
      Try to traverse SEH chain manually.
      Guard the SEH walking with SEH handling. This probably doesn't work, but lets find out.
      Maybe ignoring access violation wasn't a good idea.
      No need for set_terminate either.
      Showing before replacement but after stack switch makes no sense.
      It looks like unwinding through shared stack frames is corrupting the state.
      Save and restore the SEH state from the main greenlet into new greenlets.
      Must explicitly convert.
      The constructor of the thread state is too late to capture, because it has its own SEH handlers. Argh.
      More debugging.
      We seem to need to keep the bottom three handlers around, perhaps?
      Helps if you actually return it.
      Hot dog, that fixed the tracing tests. Did it fix all the tests?
      Hmm, the build shows failed, but the log cuts off in the middle with no error. Too much output?
      Debugging.
      Use a better testrunner.
      Make the part of g_initialstub that never returns its own function.
      It seems that now we really are calling terminate()
      Entering the try block doesn't change the SEH HEAD, entering the function containing the try block does.
      That worked, but possibly by accident: We might have grabbed the SEH handler from the call into the thread state, not our own. Debug output to verify.
      Nope, both are needed. So what about if faulthandler is off and we optimize (inline things)?
      Neither disabling faulthandler nor enabling optimizations changed the SEH depth.
      Remove set_terminate
      Cleanup debugging code.
      Clean up argument passing.
      Always test C++.
      Update comment. We're leaking less than 1.1.2
      Cleanups for non-native thread state creation.
      Add change note for #271.
      Make tracing state exception safe.
      Remove enneeded print statements from test.
      Start work on making PyGreenlet opaque. First part of the conversion: the exception state.
      Encapsulate the Python state in an object.
      Extract stack manipulation and state to its own object.
      Do a better job freeing stack copy memory.
      Fixes for old MSVC.
      Properly mark all unused parameters.
      Make the PyGreenlet object opaque using the pointer-to-implementation pattern.
      Fix the leak of the parent greenlet.
      Forgot the allocator.
      Need to explicitly include vector for some compilers.
      MSVC is picky.
      More precise frame tracking.
      Checkpoint on additional safety.
      Hopefully some fixes for MSVC.
      Hopefully more fixes for old MSVC.

      The leakcheck errors on Py 3.5/6/7/8 were due to the new graphviz 0.18 using a MagicMock as a type hint.
      Better detection of dead greenlets: Any greenlet from a dead thread is dead, even the main greenlet.
      Make stack_state private.
      Make the main greenlet protected.
      Refactor to separate the main greenlet from user-created greenlets.
      Drop the PyMainGreenlet type.
      Change some dynamic_cast to static_cast where we know its safe.

      win32 compiler: don't assume C functions cannot throw.
      Win32: Using /EHr, annotate inner_bootstrap again as noexcept to try to force the termination that we otheriwse can't seem to get.
      win32: simplify the test matrix.

I am back to just a recycler view. Turns out developing even the most basic note taking app is incredibly fucking difficult for no real good god damned reason. This is fucking ridiculous.

[MIRROR] Fixes Some Incredulously Fucked Up Recycler Behavior [MDB IGNORE] (#17018)

* Fixes Some Incredulously Fucked Up Recycler Behavior (#70638)

* test one

Hey there!

Did you know that if you toss someone into a recycled emagger, that we delete _all_ of that mob's contents? You probably didn't because this shit is broken broken. Like, ow.

That's because we manually moved an item to nullspace, which caused a _slew_ of odd behavior in the Destroy chain for `obj/item` since it moves it to nullspace at a very specific point in time and makes all of it's assumptions on when you move the thing to nullspace. If it's in nullspace before you call qdel, you would shit out the ass with hanging references stuck on the mob (like `w_uniform` pointing to something in nullspace, like the image above).

All fixed now, though.

* I FUCKING LOVE UNIT TESTS

THIS SHIT WILL NEVER BREAK AGAIN!!!

Merge pull request #775 from kleinerm/master

Pull for 3.0.18.11 update

This is mostly a release with smaller quality of life improvements, some bug/compatibility fixes, and more work to take advantage of new Ubuntu 22.04-LTS features and improvements.

### General

- Various help text and documentation updates. Minor cleanups and improvements, maintenance work etc.

- PsychVRHMD: Prep work for future OpenXR driver, and some cleanups and minor fixes.

- PsychPortAudio: Add new AM modulator flag 256 "kPortAudioAMModulatorNeutralIsZero". By default, a stopped AM modulator device acts as if no AM modulator is attached. With this flag set, while attached to an audio output slave device, it will instead "gate" or "mute" sound output on its associated audio output device, iow. the AM gain value during stopped modulator is zero instead of one. This has proven useful to allow to output tone bursts that are windowed/gated/modulated by an envelope function. Sponsored by a paid support membership - Thanks.

- Eyelink: Fix potential false "buffer overflow" alert in 'EyelinkGetQueuedData', which can cause Octave/Matlab to abort() as a false alarm. Sponsored by SR-Research, paying members of our partnership program - Thanks.

### Linux

- XOrgConfCreator: Split up into a legacy version for systems with X-Server 1.20 and earlier, e.g., Ubuntu 20.04-LTS, and a modern version for systems with X-Server 21 and later, e.g., Ubuntu 22.04-LTS. The legacy version is now in maintenance mode, frozen in its behaviour for old systems. The X-Server 21 / Ubuntu 22.04-LTS version was cleaned up, extended and made more plug and play. It hides some rarely needed (for normal users) options behind a "expert mode" flag, simplifies the questions it asks to users, streamlines the whole setup experience, and exposes some new functionality only available on modern X-Server 21, e.g., AsyncFlipSecondaries support for clone/mirror display setups (subject + experimenter displays) which are not synchronized. Improvements to deep color setup, Prime renderoffload "Optimus" setup, VRR setup etc.

- Deal better with problems in AssertOpenGL, giving better troubleshooting advice -- now updated for Ubuntu 22.04-LTS

- Gamepad/GetGamepadIndices: Refinements for Linux/X11, help text updates. Make selection of the proper GamePad / Joystick device more simple and robust. This work supported by a Psychtoolbox paid support membership - Thanks.

### macOS

- PsychVulkan: Add a new workaround for another macOS Metal bug. Make visual presentation timing it a bit better, but still quite awful.

- Screen('AddFrameToMovie'): Change mapping of 'rect' to actual capture area. The old math didn't determine vertical start position of the capture rectangle by rect(kPsychTop), but based on rect(kPsychBottom), which could cause inconsistencies on movie frame capture area on macOS with Retina displays in Retina backwards compatibility mode. The new math fixes this, to deal with Retina displays better.

- Maybe restore backwards compatibility of Psychtoolbox 3.0.18 with macOS versions older than 10.15 Catalina, possibly back to 10.11 El Capitan with fixes to Screen and PsychPortAudio. This is untested, due to lack of any macOS test systems other than 10.15.7 Catalina final, but may work. Maintaining backwards compatibility is difficult without test systems and the constant breakage introduced by the iToys company in more recent SDK's and compiler toolchains. Officially we don't guarantee that current 3.0.18 runs on anything but Catalina.

PsychLinuxConfiguration: Add workarounds for RaspberryPi OS 11 Mesa v3d.

Testing after upgrading the RPi 400 to Raspbian 11 showed new trouble:

At least on Mesa's gallium v3d driver for the RPi 4/400's VideoCore 6
gpu, Raspbian 11 Bullseye, page-flipping is broken by default - again.
Pageflipping for fullscreen OpenGL PTB onscreen windows fails, with
error messages flooding the XOrg log, and the copyswap fallback causes
PTB timing failures and horrible tearing.

The RPi desktop GUI composited by the Mutter X11 desktop compositor
doesn't have that problem, because Mesa for Raspbian 11 was patched
with some out-of-tree downstream patches to accept a new secret
parameter "v3d_maintain_ignorable_scanout" that if set to true allows
to fix pageflipping, but defaults to false == broken. God knows why
"broken by default" was considered an appropriate config choice, but
here we are...

Reference link to the patch series, which is not to be found anywhere
else with a Google search, and not yet in Mesa main upstream:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/6079
https://github.com/bluestang2006/Debian-Pkgs/tree/master/mesa/debian/patches

This adds the magic parameter to fix pageflipping for octave + PTB
to the deep color config file and updates PsychLinuxConfiguration to
always force-install/update that file on ARM systems. I'm too lazy
to add extra config files and revalidate stuff, so we stuff it into
an unrelated Mesa config file.

This should fix PTB on RPi OS 11 on RPi 4/400.

Heretics cannot be converted, and are immune to cult stun hands. Instead, the cult is rewarded for sacrificing them with the bloody bastard sword, an oversized SPIN2WIN funblade. + Soul Stealing Fantasy Affix (#69725)

About The Pull Request

Heretics can no longer be converted to a cult, as they follow their own Forgotten Gods.
Instead, Nar'Sie will reward the cult for managing to sacrifice one, with the bastard sword.
The bloody bastard sword has been cleaned up codewise and all that. Because it is a free reward instead of a (removed) progression mechanic of cult, it swings just a bit slower during the spin and doesn't have a jaunt. It's still a !fun! swinging sword of hilarity and death.
BLOODY BASTARD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukznXQ3MgN0
Fantasy weapons can now roll "soul-stealing" weapons. They, on killing something, capture its soul inside the item.

    Add fail conditions that instantly end a spin2win, ala how 

    Mimes can now hold a baguette like a sword by right clicking it #69592 works

Why It's Good For The Game

Bloody bastard sword was fun, it made no sense that heretics were valid converts when they're already worshipping a DIFFERENT evil god granting them powers. Should be in a good spot as a nice little antag to antag special interaction. I fucking love antag to antag special interactions, we should have more of 'em

Fantasy affixes are always a neat thing to throw a new component into
Changelog

cl
add: Heretics can no longer be converted to cult. But sacrificing them is very valuable to Nar'Sie, and she will grant special weapons if you manage to do so.
add: Fantasy affixes can also include soul-stealing items!

Life is one big road with lots of signs. So when you riding through the ruts, don't complicate your mind. Flee from hate, mischief and jealousy. Don't bury your thoughts, put your vision to reality. Wake Up and Live!

1. Topic Modeling 
Objective: Help a leading mobile brand understand the voice of the customer by analyzing the reviews of their product on Amazon and the topics that customers are talking about. You will perform topic modeling on specific parts of speech. You’ll finally interpret the emerging topics.

Steps to perform:	
Discover the topics in the reviews and present it to business in a consumable format. Employ techniques in syntactic processing and topic modeling.
Perform specific cleanup, POS tagging, and restricting to relevant POS tags, then, perform topic modeling using LDA. Finally, give business-friendly names to the topics and make a table for business.

Tasks: 
Read the .csv file using Pandas. Take a look at the top few records.
Normalize casings for the review text and extract the text into a list for easier manipulation.
Tokenize the reviews using NLTKs word_tokenize function.
Perform parts-of-speech tagging on each sentence using the NLTK POS tagger.
For the topic model, we should  want to include only nouns.
Find out all the POS tags that correspond to nouns.
Limit the data to only terms with these tags.
Lemmatize. 
Different forms of the terms need to be treated as one.
No need to provide POS tag to lemmatizer for now.
Remove stopwords and punctuation (if there are any). 
Create a topic model using LDA on the cleaned up data with 12 topics.
Print out the top terms for each topic.
What is the coherence of the model with the c_v metric?
Analyze the topics through the business lens.
Determine which of the topics can be combined.
Create topic model using LDA with what you think is the optimal number of topics
What is the coherence of the model?
The business should  be able to interpret the topics.
Name each of the identified topics.
Create a table with the topic name and the top 10 terms in each to present to the  business.
from gensim.models import CoherenceModel
coherence_model_lda = CoherenceModel(model=lda_model, texts=reviews_sw_removed, dictionary=id2word, coherence='c_v')
coherence_lda = coherence_model_lda.get_coherence()


print('\nCoherence Score: ', coherence_lda)



2. Classify_hate_vs_Nonhate_tweets : Help Twitter Combat Hate Speech Using NLP and Machine Learning.


Objective: Using NLP and ML, make a model to identify hate speech (racist or sexist tweets) in Twitter.

Problem Statement:  
Twitter is the biggest platform where anybody and everybody can have their views heard. Some of these voices spread hate and negativity. Twitter is wary of its platform being used as a medium  to spread hate. 
You are a data scientist at Twitter, and you will help Twitter in identifying the tweets with hate speech and removing them from the platform. You will use NLP techniques, perform specific cleanup for tweets data, and make a robust model.


Analysis to be done: Clean up tweets and build a classification model by using NLP techniques, cleanup specific for tweets data, regularization and hyperparameter tuning using stratified k-fold and cross validation to get the best model.

Content: 
id: identifier number of the tweet
Label: 0 (non-hate) /1 (hate)
Tweet: the text in the tweet

Tasks: 
Load the tweets file using read_csv function from Pandas package. 
Get the tweets into a list for easy text cleanup and manipulation.
To cleanup: 
Normalize the casing.
Using regular expressions, remove user handles. These begin with '@’.
Using regular expressions, remove URLs.
Using TweetTokenizer from NLTK, tokenize the tweets into individual terms.
Remove stop words.
Remove redundant terms like ‘amp’, ‘rt’, etc.
Remove ‘#’ symbols from the tweet while retaining the term.
Extra cleanup by removing terms with a length of 1.
Check out the top terms in the tweets:
First, get all the tokenized terms into one large list.
Use the counter and find the 10 most common terms.
Data formatting for predictive modeling:
Join the tokens back to form strings. This will be required for the vectorizers.
Assign x and y.
Perform train_test_split using sklearn.
We’ll use TF-IDF values for the terms as a feature to get into a vector space model.
Import TF-IDF  vectorizer from sklearn.
Instantiate with a maximum of 5000 terms in your vocabulary.
Fit and apply on the train set.
Apply on the test set.
Model building: Ordinary Logistic Regression
Instantiate Logistic Regression from sklearn with default parameters.
Fit into  the train data.
Make predictions for the train and the test set.
Model evaluation: Accuracy, recall, and f_1 score.
Report the accuracy on the train set.
Report the recall on the train set: decent, high, or low.
Get the f1 score on the train set.
Looks like you need to adjust the class imbalance, as the model seems to focus on the 0s.
Adjust the appropriate class in the LogisticRegression model.
Train again with the adjustment and evaluate.
Train the model on the train set.
Evaluate the predictions on the train set: accuracy, recall, and f_1 score.
Regularization and Hyperparameter tuning:
Import GridSearch and StratifiedKFold because of class imbalance.
Provide the parameter grid to choose for ‘C’ and ‘penalty’ parameters.
Use a balanced class weight while instantiating the logistic regression.
classifier_lr = LogisticRegression(class_weight="balanced")
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator = classifier_lr, param_grid = param_grid, 
                          cv = StratifiedKFold(4), n_jobs = -1, verbose = 1, scoring = "recall" )
grid_search.fit(X_train_bow, y_train)
grid_search.best_estimator_
y_test_pred = grid_search.best_estimator_.predict(X_test_bow)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_test_pred))

Find the parameters with the best recall in cross validation.
Choose ‘recall’ as the metric for scoring.
Choose stratified 4 fold cross validation scheme.
Fit into  the train set.
What are the best parameters?
Predict and evaluate using the best estimator.
Use the best estimator from the grid search to make predictions on the test set.
What is the recall on the test set for the toxic comments?
What is the f_1 score?
