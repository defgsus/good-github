Add files via upload

YTD Video Downloader PRO is a simple and easy-to-use program that is designed to download and subsequently watch videos from popular video sharing services YouTube, Facebook, Google Video, Yahoo Video, etc. Also YTD Video Downloader PRO allows you to convert videos to various formats (for example MP3 , MP4, AVI, 3GP, MPEG), which can then be viewed on various mobile devices (iPod, iPhone, PSP and iTunes). There is the ability to play downloaded videos using the integrated player.

Popularity of YTD Downloader(YouTube Downloader) received for a simple motto, under which the developers created this miracle. The motto is simple - “Nothing more,” and fully characterizes the final product of Green Tree Applications. A program created for downloading video files from the Internet should not send the user messages about the weather in his city, changes in the status of friends in popular social networks, or the arrival of regular spam in the mailbox. Instead of all these useful, but not necessary functions for downloading video programs, YTD can convert to iPod, MP4, MP3, AVI, wmv and FLV formats. The ability to download videos includes HQ and HD videos.

To download, you must enter a link to the video you want to download and specify a folder to save the clip. The interface is simple and clear, all the functionality is at a glance. For example, to download a file from YouTube, just copy the link to it. (YTD) YouTube Downloader automatically recognizes such links and knows in advance what to do with them. What should be done with them? Of course, download and convert. It remains only to press the corresponding OK button to start the process, since YTD prefers not to stoop to the primitive amateur activity characteristic of some stupid software that claims to be "intellectual." You can download the video separately, or you can (why not waste time on something?) Download the entire playlist. The main thing is not to put the playlist on the download “accidentally”, so as not to search later,

Key features:
• Choose the optimal video quality during the download procedure.
• Add, if necessary, links to videos in the original source.
• Download any file you are interested in in its original quality - that is, in the quality in which the video was originally uploaded to YouTube.
• It is possible to view icons for YouTube videos in the program.
• User can download artist playlists.
• You can upload video files with limited YouTube access through the most common browsers today: Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Google Chrome.
• The program has a simple, convenient and intuitive user interface.

:: SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ::

Windows 2000/XP/Vista/?/10



– Download & Install
– Use patcher for activation
=================
Done. Enjoy!

WIP: Attempt #3 (?) to deal with feedback not associated with an internship payment

The questions I put into the new intern and mentor feedback model are
pretty solid.

I've updated the mentor guide to have mentor expectations for week 5 and
week 6. We will ask mentors if they've met those expectations in their
feedback, which is due during the start of week 6.

Ideally some of these expectations would have been mentioned in a week 3
mentor expectations section, so that it's more of a gradual ramp-up into
week 5 and 6 expectations. The week 3 email would need to reference the
mentor expectations section once that's added.

Ugh, I *hate* the names of these new feedback classes. I think they
should be something like 'Feedback2FromMentor' and 'Feedback2FromIntern'

The fact that we have class names like 'InitialMentorFeedbackv2' is
super confusing.

So, here's the new plan:

MVP
---

x Rename
  Initial{Mentor,Intern}Feedbackv2
  to
  Feedback1From{Mentor,Intern}

x Use Feedback2From{Mentor,Intern} instead of
  Second{Mentor,Intern}Feedback

- Make sure tests pass - tests don't currently pass for the intern
  feedback (which is expected because I didn't update that test yet to
  use the new Feedback2FromIntern fields), and the test for submitting
  termination feedback doesn't pass, which is not expected and I haven't
  looked into it yet.

x Manually test that interns and mentors can fill out forms

x Manually test that intern, mentor, and staff views of feedback work

- Move older feedback models to the end of home/models.py and comment
  that they are deprecated

Longer term
---

- Write an export function that exports all prior feedback collected
  - CSV export is probably the easiest format for quick checks
  - JSON export might be nice for preserving data types for data science
  - explore Django management dumpdata command
- Export feedback from all cohorts that are not currently active
- Stop relying on the final payment authorization data to determine if
  an internship is inactive. (See detailed plan below)
- Delete all feedback objects from the website production database

Active contacts changes
---

We need to show all "active" contacts. Active contacts are people who
should be subscribe to the mentor mailing list and/or the Outreachy
Zulip chat. Who an active contact is changes during the year.

When an internship cohort is almost finished, and the community CFP is
open for communities to sign up, the active contact list includes:
 - coordinators from communities approved to participate
 - approved mentors with approved projects from approved communities
 - approved new mentors for internships that are almost over

(The last case is a bit of a corner case that we can handle manually. It
does rarely happen that a mentor gets sick or is otherwise unable to
complete their mentor duties, and we find a replacement mentor. But
usually these cases are something Outreachy organizers are aware of and
can manually add the new mentor to the mailing list and Zulip chat.)

Once internships from the last cohort end, some mentors may choose to
unsubscribe from the mentor mailing list. So we don't want to
re-subscribe a mentor for an internship that has ended.

Once the internships for the new cohort begin, we don't want to
subscribe mentors who didn't select an intern for their project. Some
first-time mentors don't find an intern, decide they don't want to
participate in Outreachy again, and they unsubscribe themselves from the
mentor mailing list. Re-subscribing them causes annoyance.

  - Revise intern review page:
    - make the URL take a cohort
    - Put links to each cohort in a staff dashboard section
    - make sure the intern review page
      displays any details the 'active internships' page currently displays
    - Make intern review page list internships at the top by most recent end
      date (and show feedback status)

  - Put the list of contacts for the current cohort on a different page
    - have the contact list take a RoundPage slug
    - move the instructions about mailman from the staff dashboard here
    - list approved coordinators for all communities
    - list approved coordinators for all communities approved to
      participate in this cohort
    - list all approved mentors with an approved project in a community
      approved to participate in this cohort
    - list all approved mentors for approved projects in approved
      communities with interns who are approved by the Outreachy
      organizers and in good standing
    - list interns approved by Outreachy organizers and in good standing

highlighted the second half of "Descent into Hell"

i brought forth a strange plant today: the _tenput_ seed. an image of software rooted in art and rage and faith. WE HAVE SEEN software without soul.

the descent grows darker in this half. take counsel in your fears. be prepared: you must both sacrifice and be sacrificed, inflicting the suffering of the world unto your own heart, knowing it was done by your own heinous hand. new life can only be born of such torment.

events are meaningless, yet we create meaning for them anyway. we do this in part to bequeath those images unto our future. but these events, these things outside of us, this is dead, the already-has-been. but life is _inside_ of us, where the meaning is created.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Fixes: c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

Remove `@Beta` from uncontroversial `Futures` methods:

- `submit`
- `submitAsync`
- `scheduleAsync`
- `nonCancellationPropagating`
- `inCompletionOrder`

I did also add a TODO to potentially make the return type of `scheduleAsync` more specific in the future. However, to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever asked for this. (That's not surprising: `ScheduledFuture` isn't any more useful than `Future` unless you're implementing a `ScheduledExecutorService`, and even then, access to its timeout is unavoidably racy.) Plus, should we ever need to do it, we can do it compatibly by injecting a bridge method with the old signature.

(I didn't see any discussion of the return type in the API Review doc or the CL review thread. It probably just didn't come up, or maybe we all independently concluded that it wasn't worth the trouble, given that `MoreExecutors.listeningDecorator(ScheduledExecutorService)` is a bit of a pain? But I'm guessing `scheduleAsync` would be easier.)

RELNOTES=`util.concurrent`: Removed `@Beta` from `Futures` methods: `submit`, `submitAsync`, `scheduleAsync`, `nonCancellationPropagating`, `inCompletionOrder`.

* made chainsaw stop enemies dead in their tracks when hitting them, drops created by chainsaw disappear much faster and are launched away from the killed enemy
* fixed flame shot cannon error and made it remember only 1 enemy so it can bounce between 2 high hp targets
* increased laser lifetime and reload of the mega laser acnnon
* gave bow and gas lighter a minimum charge before you can hear the charge sound
* fixed gold and cursed bullets particle creation offset and depth

"11:10am. Let me read Kage and I will start the tuts. The thread is up.

11:20am. Let me start.

https://youtu.be/4p9AizjZXwY?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv
Chapter 2 - Mantaflow Volume Shading / Blender

Start up Blender, play around. Go.

11:25am. I am trying to get it to work and am having some trouble. I have the domain object and the smoke object. I know I should link them together, but I am not sure how. Isn't there supposed to be some setting to do that. Or should I just parent the smoke object to the boundary one? Let me try that.

Surprisngly, that really was the answer. Great.

Now...what is different compared to what I had in the video is that there are no bake options. In the video he had to click on them, but here it seems it is automatic once I start play. The newer way of doing things is better. Lucky me. Blender is an old program, but it kept evolving and got to its current level.

11:35am. No it is not working as it should. I change the settings, but the simulation is baked to the old one. So much for automatic adjustment. How do I force the simulation to be redone?

https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/physics/baking.html

I need a newer tutorial, I can't find these settigns.

How to make EASY (but realistic) smoke and fire simulation in Blender | 2021

Let me go for this.

https://youtu.be/u_dL3JqXdp8?t=240

This is what I need to pay attention to. Ah, so that is how you get the bake option. Ok.

11:45am. It really takes a while. I should ower the number of frames from 250 to something like 100.

12:05pm. I do not understand why, but Eevee is really shitty when it comes to rendering smoke. Even solid mode is giving me more appealing results.

12:25pm. I am messing around and I can't figure out how to change the smoke color in Eevee.

How do I do a transparent background again? It is in film. I can never remember where that option is.

https://youtu.be/u_dL3JqXdp8?t=698

I do not understand why the sim is so smooth for him. It is very janky for me even in solid mode.

1:05pm. I've messed with the thing enough. It is really so slow. I can't even run it properly in realtime in Eevee. Hell, it looks better in solid mode for that reason.

Let me stop here for breakfast and I'll go through the Indian guy's videos.

2:50pm. Done with chores. Let me chill a bit and I will resume.

3:20pm. Let me start. Focus me. Start the vid.

Chapter 2 - Mantaflow Volume Shading / Blender

This one.

https://youtu.be/4p9AizjZXwY?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=132

Let me check out those attribute. It really would be hard to figure this out on my own. Youtube is the greatest innovation in education since the invention of formal schooling.

...Hmmm, no I don't know where to find these settings. It is different in 3.0.

3:35pm. I think Blender crashed while I was rendering 128. It was at 52 and when I tabbed into it, it crashed.

Hmmm, I guess I need a better rig. For the first time I am wishing that I have the last GPU and more RAM. I'll just have to make do with less for the time being.

3:55pm. https://youtu.be/4p9AizjZXwY?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=504

I am taking the time to think about what he is saying and explore as I go along.

Right now, it is really a drag to play the animations in the viewport. It might be better to set a camera, render it separately and the view it in full time. All the stuttering is making it look like shit.

https://youtu.be/4p9AizjZXwY?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=913
> This of it as a roughness parameter.

Interesting, I never knew what anisotropy was about. For a lot of the stuff in Blender, even if you fiddle with it, it is hard to tell a difference. So him telling me in which contexts there is an effect is a huge help.

https://youtu.be/4p9AizjZXwY?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=1298

What's a gamma node?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function

Is it this?

So it is like a factorial that works on reals? I guess I see it.

https://youtu.be/5K3tfbA5gtk
The Gamma Function and (-1/2)!

Ah fuck it, let me watch this.

https://youtu.be/5K3tfbA5gtk?t=406

I really hate dealing with infinities.

https://youtu.be/4p9AizjZXwY?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=1307

I do not know, is this really the generalized factorial function? Could it not have something to do with color instead?

https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/color/gamma.html

> Use this node to apply a gamma correction.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction

Yeah, it is a different thing. I wasted my time studying that random math thing.

So this just raises it to a power and multiplies it by a constant?

Hmmm, why does the node not have that then?

https://blenderartists.org/t/gamma-in-blender-cycles/597027/4

> The sentence “I perform a gamma correction of 2.2.” translates mathematically to raising the input value to the 1/2.2 power: output = input ^ (1/correction).

Most other apps base their gamma implementation on the spoken word, while Blender clings to the mathematical expression and wants you to directly input the reciprocal value of the gamma correction. So, if you want to gamma correct by 2.2, you have to input 1/2.2 = 0.4545.

So the gamma is just the power function that acts on brightness?

That could be useful.

https://youtu.be/4p9AizjZXwY?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=2041

The way he sets these value is really arbitrary. Why is he using a color ramp on this, it should only be used for values between 0 and 1. After all those powers and multiplies, no way will it make sense. I think artists do too much evolutionary programming by hand.

As a programmer I would not accept this. Using the power function to make the values further apart is a good idea though. The density value itself acts as a multiply so there is no need for a node.

5:20pm. Finally done with that chapter. Let me play a bit more. I need to firmly conclude what all those nodes are doing.

Because Ram uses all those transformations I am not sure what to think about all this.

5:50pm. This is such a waste of time. I am trying to figure out how to use the flame attribute, but because it overlaps with the temperature so much I am not sure how to deal with it.

Let me take a look at the previous video. I want to see how he does the wind. I tried a force field, but it just spread the smoke everywhere.

https://youtu.be/WMQdiC-6aVE?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=595

This was easy. Ok.

Chapter 3 - Mantaflow Fire / Blender

Let me watch this for a bit and then I'll go have lunch.

6:10pm. https://youtu.be/lR9vjaYzeYQ?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=648

I'll watch this while I eat.

6:20pm. Actually let me waste time instead. I do not feel like studying while relaxing.

6:50pm. Let me read the Satanophany chapter, and then I will watch the 3rd video. I didn't even get to explore the settings properly today, I just fiddled with the basics. I haven't tried high res simulations, but the low res ones are quite poor.

Let me resume. 25m more and I'll stop for the day. I still have to post on the PL sub. Maybe I'll make that my last post since I am not programming anymore.

https://youtu.be/lR9vjaYzeYQ?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv&t=1757

In the preview I thought that the ground was wet, but those are just low roughness areas. This is a good lesson, rather than making water explicitly, I should consider just lowering the surface roughness in order to emulate the wet feeling.

7:20pm. https://youtu.be/fuuKOFLmg3U?list=PLgO2ChD7acqElskP1q7SQKWgOybrO54Xv
Chapter 4 - Mantaflow Liquid Basics / Blender

This is 1.5 hours long and I'll leave it for tomorrow.

By the looks of it, all this will take me a while. There is no going through tutorials quickly if you want to learn something. In order to progress, I am going to have to put in the time to study this properly.

The path of an artist is as rough as the path of a programmer.

But this is what I desire. I no longer care about making it to the top in one go. Instead I want to cultivate a path slowly and consistently. Programming just by itself is not going to give me anything. It will have to be relegated to a support skill, while art and music will have to be mains.

This would all change if I could get a sponsor for Spiral in order to work on AI chips, but I have no interest in touching it otherwise.

7:35pm. Now, for my last spurt of effort for the day, let me post my PL sub review. I'll want to keep doing those as advertizing.

///

In December I've mostly been going through Blender tutorials, but I did take the opportunity to make my [first art piece](https://twitter.com/Ghostlike/status/1477014732997640194). The first two were a pencil drawing of a watering can, and a very loose sketch of a hand, so this is a large jump in complexity and quality. I seem to be making large strides without explicitly drawing much which is a sign that I am studying properly. It is similar how in programming you make progress by thinking things through instead of writing code. The two activities are quite similar, and digital art is less dependent on dexterity than you'd think because of all the tools at your disposal.

Right now I am still going through Blender tutorials, but I should have covered most of the basics by the end of the month. The 3d art has incredible breadth, I've been studying it for the past 3 months and I still haven't touched upon all the areas. It would be hopeless trying to learn it without all the Youtube tutorials.

As for Spiral, I've decided what my strategy for it will be. Right now, the AI chips have no community, but in the future that will change, so that is what I should be targeting. In 2021, I've had the delusions that all I needed was to put myself out there and the customers would come lured in by the obvious benefits of the tool, and when I realized that nobody gives a fart about languages, I've actually had brief bouts of normality where I tried to get the companies attention directly. That did not go well.

Now that I've taken a step back and my sanity points have recovered I see that all I have to do is be patient and advertise in [correct places](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tenstorrent/comments/rhtuxn/seeking_a_sponsor_for_a_functional_programming/). Right now that place is dead, but eventually people will get tired of deep learning and take an interest in programming these kinds of chips directly. Or somebody high up at one of the companies will see my post and think about it. That will be a path towards getting paid for my work on Spiral. I really wish I could program the TensTorrent chips right now, but I can't afford the 1k to buy even the cheapest Grayskull. It is a pity, as the path I am on right now is a waste of my programming skills - it would be a lot better if the companies barged on my door and I did the work needed to make these chips easy to program ahead of time, but that is life.

Originally, the money to buy these things was supposed to come from ML, but they are too weak to make agents even for toy games like poker so I've been left in a weak position.

I was adrift for a while on how ML should be done. I can't be trusted, and the ML community can't be trusted, so once I get the resources I need, what I will do is build a genetic programming system and evolve the learning algorithms themselves. With superior algorithms at my disposal I would be unstoppable. The right choice is to have the hardware itself tell me how it should be used. I am well suited to undertake this kind of research since the main difficulty is making an interpreter. I could easily whip up a ref counted backend for any of the chips and implement such a system in Spiral, but the average researcher would have to do it in C, or even worse, assembly.

I've taken this path because I've decided that I'd rather just do one thing and slowly cultivate it, than do random jobs for random people which would leave my char sheet a chaotic mess by the end of it. That is what I wanted to do with Spiral, and the reason that I failed is that deep learning is mostly hype and little substance. Deepmind could do it, but it would also need to spend a million to get it trained. If I had a million I wouldn't have been preparing to do virtual banditry.

I am not sure whether to keep these PL sub reviews going since I am not even programming at this point, but it will serve as advertising. Maybe if I am lucky the lull between now and when I get a sponsor won't be too huge and I'll be able to do the work that needs doing.

///

Put it through dosc. Let me go with it. I want to stop doing these reviews, but I should not leave an audience aside. Unlike friends, they could benefit me in the future."

4.14.260/47961,fix sitesurvey display."autotune is the new 'do-nothing'" - randy marsh

- hard to improve upon last week's build. errors are way down now.

- small fix for site survey's summary, which would report 'no' for open
  networks, even though the mouseover stated it was open. you will now
  see open networks without having to mouseover each one.
    - small fix but it looks better now.

- update tor in the bigger builds and lootbag.

- updated busybox for the latest changes

- update ksmbd

- we'll see if i can get mt_wifi 5.1.0.0 working right. for some reason
  the wireless client summaries are garbled. if i can find out what exactly
  is causing the problem, i'll just pull this build and replace it.
    - just like i pulled 47960 for this build.
            - w/e blow me.

the redskins are pleased to announce we are in negotiations with randy
marsh, who insists auto tune technology is the best way to tell
our fans to GO FUCK THEMSELVES.

elaborating further, marsh claims that auto tune is the modern
embodiment of the redskins' cherished mantra because it allows useless
people to operate under the pretense of an 'artist'.

this is a tantalising proposition that we are internally deliberating.

keep you posted.

and just remember: GFY

stay classy, redskin fans.

        his secret identity]

        Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know.

Stan
        Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.

Randy
        Oh really? A-About... about what?

Stan
        Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on
        the outside but totally different on the inside?

        [Randy sighs deeply and stands up to walk]

        I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be
        something else but still have it be nothing about sex?

Randy
        Yes. Yes, Stan. I am <'famous' "musician">.

Stan
        ...What?

Randy
        It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson.
        He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know?
        Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got
        fed up and pretended to be a woman.
        I called myself <'famous' "musician">. Have you ever been in a
        woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls
        for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was
        in there, and then I- started writing things down.

Stan
        Well you said you knew a guy at work who was
        <'famous' "musician">'s uncle.

Randy
        Yah, that's my cover.

Stan
        The chick that wrote the theme song to the new
        <shitty recession stimulus-funded book and movie series>, is you?

Randy
        Yeah.

        [turns around and faces Stan]

        The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go:

            "<shitty recession stimulus-funded book and movie series>,
            yah yah yah, yah yah yah! <shitty recession stimulus-funded
            book and movie series>."

        But they just- do what they want with my songs.

Stan
        Wha-wait, <'famous' "musician"> sounds like a girl.

Randy
        Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?

        [moments later, a music program pops up.
        Twelve tracks are shown at lower left]

        I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work.

        I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.

        [plays the highlighted track]

            "Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn'
            thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn"

            [farts and poop noises]

            "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."

Stan
        Dad, <'famous' "musician">'s music is actually really good.

Randy
        Thanks.

        But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.

        [replays the same track with drum loops added]

        Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.

        [brings up the quantizer and chooses his settings]

        Backup instruments.

        [scale, beats, bass, tambourine, guitars, strings]

        And then finally I use the Autotune.

        ["Auto-Tuner v10." He chooses his settings there, and
        the song is transformed. The same track is now enhanced
        with <no name shitty "musician">'s voice and no trace of Randy]

            "Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday.
            Givine me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn.
            What I need is a little bit of shelter."

        [this is all too much for Stan to take in, and he passes out.]

        [Randy notices]

        Stan?

mm, oom: pagefault_out_of_memory: don't force global OOM for dying tasks

commit 0b28179a6138a5edd9d82ad2687c05b3773c387b upstream.

Patch series "memcg: prohibit unconditional exceeding the limit of dying tasks", v3.

Memory cgroup charging allows killed or exiting tasks to exceed the hard
limit.  It can be misused and allowed to trigger global OOM from inside
a memcg-limited container.  On the other hand if memcg fails allocation,
called from inside #PF handler it triggers global OOM from inside
pagefault_out_of_memory().

To prevent these problems this patchset:
 (a) removes execution of out_of_memory() from
     pagefault_out_of_memory(), becasue nobody can explain why it is
     necessary.
 (b) allow memcg to fail allocation of dying/killed tasks.

This patch (of 3):

Any allocation failure during the #PF path will return with VM_FAULT_OOM
which in turn results in pagefault_out_of_memory which in turn executes
out_out_memory() and can kill a random task.

An allocation might fail when the current task is the oom victim and
there are no memory reserves left.  The OOM killer is already handled at
the page allocator level for the global OOM and at the charging level
for the memcg one.  Both have much more information about the scope of
allocation/charge request.  This means that either the OOM killer has
been invoked properly and didn't lead to the allocation success or it
has been skipped because it couldn't have been invoked.  In both cases
triggering it from here is pointless and even harmful.

It makes much more sense to let the killed task die rather than to wake
up an eternally hungry oom-killer and send him to choose a fatter victim
for breakfast.

Support wrapping a script's function for C++ use.

Ahh, the beauty of time. Namely ten years later the compilers that
made it so troublesome to do this are now so old that"IDGA*" and
the feature is wrapped in a conditional compilation for modern C++.

Wrapping as C++14, as I find i thard to remember which bits and
pieces of syntax land in 11 and 14, and by the time the compiler isn't
a problem you're basically at C++14.

drm: Handle dim for udfps

* Apparently, los fod impl is better than udfps cuz it
  has onShow/HideFodView hook, which allows us to toggle
  dimlayer seamlessly.

  Since udfps only partially supports the former one,
  we'd better kill dim in kernel. This is kinda a hack
  but it works well, bringing perfect fod experience

Add protos for staking messages, set up code infrastructure

This chunk of work was meant to be simple and turned into an unexpectedly deep
rabbithole, but going down the rabbithole revealed some lessons for our
development process and helped build out a bunch of basic infrastructure.

The start was the creation of `stake.proto`, meant to define some stub proto
messages that we could use to do staking and delegation actions:

- defining (or updating) a validator;
- delegating to a validator;
- undelegating from a validator.

Delegation and undelegation messages are fairly straightforward: they specify
the validator, the unbonded amount, and the epoch.  (Those details determine
the rest of the parameters; the implementation work is in the checks that
they're consistent with the rest of the transaction, rather than in the data in
the message).

To avoid a separate process for creating a new validator and updating its
configuration, the idea is to use the same message with create-or-update
semantics.  This configuration data should be signed by the validator, and, as
with the other transaction structures, we split out the data-to-be-signed into
a separate message (`Validator`), and have the signed message
(`ValidatorDescription`) consist of a message+signature pair.  A transaction
can include a `ValidatorDescription` message to (re)define a validator.

Because this message includes a signature from the validator it configures,
it's self-authenticating.  However, a third party could create a transaction
including an authentic but stale validator description to roll back a
validator's configuration to some previous state.  To prevent this, the
`Validator` message includes a sequence number, so that the chain can require
that redefinitions have increasing sequence numbers, forcing each update to
pass through a signing oracle.

To specify the contents of the `Validator` description itself, we look at
the contents of the Cosmos SDK `create-validator` transaction as a model [0].
Some fields are just basic metadata, like the name, website, and description,
and others we ignore:

- initial commission rate, since we use funding streams;

- maximum commission and commission max change rate, which add implementation
  complexity to prevent a scenario with low impact (a validator advertises 0%
commission, then updates it to 100% in the hope the delegators won't notice)
that could be addressed by other means (social pressure, easy redelegation);

- minimum self-delegation, which doesn't fit cleanly with our delegation token
  model (and has unclear impact in a system with native delegation tokens
anyways).

However, looking at the address and pubkey fields reveals a problem with our
existing data modeling: Cosmos uses separate keys for the validator's identity
(determining the address, etc), and Tendermint consensus.  This is important
for various reasons, but most importantly, it allows the validator's identity
key to be stored offline, unlike the consensus key, which must be used online
to sign blocks.

The new `Validator` message distinguishes between the validator's
identity key (a decaf377-rdsa spend authorization key) and the validator's
consensus key (a Tendermint Ed25519 pubkey).  The validator's identity key
authenticates the consensus key by signing the `Validator` message.

Our existing code didn't notice this distinction, and changing the code to
account for it required propagating a bunch of other changes to the state
handling, effectively rewriting it.  While rewriting code isn't the end of the
world (especially when going from a first-pass of mapping out functionality to
a second-pass, coherent organization), in this instance the process was less
than ideal, and it would be good to figure out how we could try to improve it
in the future.

One observation is that it's not that the existing code was bad, but that we
worked "upwards" from the Tendermint API towards some idea of higher-level
application requirements, rather than specifying the eventual requirements in
more detail first, and then working from those requirements to the
implementation.  Writing down the requirements (in the form of proto
definitions for the messages the system uses to communicate) revealed a bunch
of details that we didn't previously think of.  The identity/consensus
distinction is a big one, but there are other, more trivial ones, like the fact
that we should record a validator's name and website, or that we'll need to
record both the exchange rates and reward rates.

This observation points to a potentially improved process: for each chunk of
functionality,

1. Write protos that define the data structures it will use;
2. Write domain types corresponding to those protos, and write the data
validation code as part of the conversions bundled with our `Protobuf` trait;
3. Implement the functionality using the domain types.

This way, in step 1, we can see how the data structures will fit together in
code review and map out the functionality without having to worry about the
details of the implementation, and the different components of step 3 can be
more easily parallelized, because people can work on different chunks of
implementation work using already-defined data structures.

Finally, another side benefit of centering the proto structures is that it
provides a clear definition of the data format, a centralized pathway for
validation (the conversion between the proto types and the domain types), and a
single location to define serializations in other formats (e.g., JSON).  Rather
than using Serde to derive serialization implementations ad-hoc, making every
structure definition potentially load-bearing and littering the code with
custom format-shaping annotations, we can use Serde on the proto structures.
This commit sets up the infrastructure to do that, based on the approach used
in `tendermint-rs`:

- The `penumbra-proto` `build.rs` has machinery to inject Serde derives, or
  format-shaping annotations ("serialize as hex string", "serialize as base64
string", etc.) into the Rust types generated from the proto files;

- The domain type for some proto type has a `TryFrom` impl that performs all of
  the validation logic;

- The domain type `Foo` derives `Serialize, Deserialize` with
  `#[serde(try_from = "pb::Foo", into = "pb::Foo")]`, so that the domain type's
Serde implementations are determined by the proto type, and there's a common
data validation pathway for both Protobuf and Serde serialization.
