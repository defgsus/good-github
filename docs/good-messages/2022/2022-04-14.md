No, we don't want radiation getting released in large pipenets fuck you fuckr uyu! (#65212)

* Make it harder to release radiation in large pipenets. Squares the volume / 2,500 thingy, and adds the requirements to the proto-nitrate bz response and proto-nitrate tritium response gas reactions to release radiation. This will make it significantly harder to release radiation in large pipenets, because releasing radiation in large pipenets makes it harder for people to identify the cause on why they are getting irradiated, which is bad and goes against the modern radiation goals.

Squaring is not enough for deranged people that know we don't want radiation released in large pipenets. Cubes the requirement instead. If someone could get enough gases reacting at once after this, then there is a bigger problem with atmos.

Who had fun seeing everything green, then getting irradiated and not even knowing why? I don't know, because I don't know who put the gases in waste and why we must suffer.

Speed up case insensitive string comparisons (#3388)

Oh boy, never leave anything unbenchmarked.

Turns out the boost::algorithm functions we were relying on underneath
many Strutil "case-insensitive" comparisons were ridiculously slow.
We thought they were good enough because they allowed specification of
locale, so we could just pass the static classic locale, and so they
would be inexpensive because they didn't have to query the current
locale.  But this is wrong, they were still ghastly.

So here I rewrite Strutil::iequals, iless, starts_with, istarts_with,
ends_with, iends_with in terms of a new (internal) Strutil::strcasecmp
and strncasecmp (which underneath handle differences in platform, and
use the locale-independent versions). The net result is that most of
those case-independent comparisons speed up by a factor of
50-100x. Wow.

I still need to tackle the family of 'ifind' related functions. They
are a bit trickier. But I'll leave them for another time, because I
need to roll this present fix out right away to fix a real production
bottleneck.

(Worth noting: iequals is instrumental when you're searching a
ParamValueList for a particular name, which is what happens when you
look up attributes from an ImageSpec, which is what happens when you
call get_texture_info(), which is what underlies OSL gettextureinfo()
calls in the cases that they cannot be constant-folded during runtime
optimization. So this came to my attention when analyzing a slow scene
whose shaders had a pathological explosion of gettextureinfo calls that
couldn't be optimized away.)

[MIRROR] Makes Ants glow, puts a min on ant screaming & shoe permeability, & other ant-related things. [MDB IGNORE] (#11821)

* Makes Ants glow, puts a minimum on ant screaming and shoe permeability, and other ant-related things. (#64786)

I found out how emissives work and my first thought was "damn ants should glow that would look sick"
So now they do.

Also, having less than 5u ants in your body will make you not scream, so 0.0001u ants will no longer have that tiny chance of making someone scream for their life.

If an ant pile has a max damage value less than 1, then they won't be able to bite through your shoes. This is the same threshold as the second tier ant icon.

Makes the giant ant a hostile mob with the neutral faction, meaning they will attack anything not in the neutral faction.

Refactor and improve antimagic to be more robust (#64124)

This refactors the antimagic component to use and have bitflags, documentation, defines, code comments, named arguments, and renames variable names for clarity. 

- /obj/effect/proc_holder/spell/aoe_turf/conjure/creature/cult is not used anywhere and has been removed
- /obj/effect/proc_holder/spell/targeted/turf_teleport/blink/cult is not used anywhere and has been removed

- New sound effects are played when magic is blocked. Depending on the type of magic being used it will be either:

- Equipping antimagic now properly updates the magic buttons
- Any magic being blocked or restricting casting now displays a message
- MAGIC_RESISTANCE_MIND now properly blocks telepathy effects
- Removes blood splatter when fireball is blocked
- Magic projectiles for staff of locker no longer spawn lockers when blocked by antimagic
- Fire breath is no longer blocked by antimagic
- Spellcards are now blocked by antimagic

Any antimagic on a mob blocks that magic type from being casted. (certain spells such as mime abilities completely ignore antimagic)

- Foilhats prevent someone from casting mind magic (telepathy, mindswap, etc.)
- Bibles, ritual Totems, nullrods, holymelons, and TRAIT_HOLY prevent someone from casting unholy magic (cult spells, etc.)
- Nullrods, ritual totem, and holymelons prevent someone from casting wizard magic (fireball, magic missile, etc.)
- Immorality talismans, berserker suits, and TRAIT_ANTIMAGIC prevents all types of magic (except stuff like mime abilities)
- Touch of Madness and Mindswap is now blocked with MAGIC_RESISTANCE and MAGIC_RESISTANCE_MIND
- Voice of god is now blocked with MAGIC_RESISTANCE_HOLY and MAGIC_RESISTANCE_MIND

I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you.

Adding scripts from my collected fixes zip. The following is a changelog copied verbatim from the latest zip, but I have not included any of the jars with backported fixes.

2019-10-04 Changes:
    - Completely reworked the recipe NBT for energy cells and portable tanks.
        + Can now craft all recipes with portable tanks as an ingredient
          without having to place and break them.

        + Should now be possible to auto-craft a creative cell from scratch
          using JEI-filled patterns.
            - Just be careful not to charge the cells... If you do you'll
              need to NBTEdit the "Energy" tag off.

    - Fixed the NBT needed for the Vibrant Capacitor bank ingredient of the
      basic energy cell frame

    - Added an electrolyzer recipe for Magnesium Chloride, which is how it's
      actually processed.

    - Shapeless recipes to convert mob-dropped TE items into GT equivalents,
      courtesy of Grom PE.

    - Enabled recipes for Air Collectors though LuV (as high as it goes).
      + the higher tier ones are called "Atmosphere Collector"

2019-09-18 Changes:
    - Uncapped tiers of Fluid Canning Machines and Canning Machines (previously
      maxed at EV)

    - Restore Mote of Omnium -> Nugget implosion compressor recipe
      inadvertently disabled last time

    - Correct fix for 4x CEF IV recipe (thanks Briarsnarl for pointing this out)

2019-09-16 Changes:
    - Hot Draconium Ingots now have an ore dictionary entry!
      Now you can use ore dictionary filters for hot ingots like you'd expect.

    - Fixed the recipe collision for U235 clumps and conformed the recipes
      for U235 ingots/blocks to be consistent with U238

    - Assembler recipes for steel and titanium gear boxes now provide the
      correct number of outputs (3, same as hand tool recipe)

    - Fixed the file name for Enderium Heavy Plating's texture so it works on
      systems that are case-sensitive instead of being a pink square.

    - Commented out some broken recipes which cause errors to appear in the log.
      These have never worked so you aren't gonna be missing anything.

2019-09-15 Changes:

    - Backported Blood-Asp's fixes for Fusion Reactors in Shadows of Greg to
      our pack version, v2.8.0.
        + Note: recipe starting power is 100x the original in Omnifactory, but
          hatches also provide 100x as well. These are intended values.

    - GTCE Bugfix Roundup (all cherrypicked from official github):
        + assembler programmable circuit lag / inputs dirty after craft
        + fix log spam from recipe validation (e.g. multismelter)
        + sodium hydroxide from sodium and water recipe fix
        + quantum chest automation bugfixes (works with AE now)
        + pipe breaking random crash fix
        + turbines getting borked by ghost blocks like feral flare lantern
        + worldgen blockstate nullpointer crash fix
        + disable GT pump pipe rendering (idk if we have GT pumps in the pack
          but this is a small performance bugfix that was easy enough to
          include lol)
        + "fix getting wrong crushed ore variant when washing it" look at
          https://github.com/GregTechCE/GregTech/issues/880 for more info

    - Fixed Oxygen Vent, CO2 scrubber, and Carbon Collection Cartridge recipes
      so you can breathe on space stations

    - Fixed recipe for IV CEF 4x using a random vibrant conduit instead of all
      lumium ones

Older Changes:

Various proto-1.3 fixes uploaded to discord/github by pack Moderators

    - Molten Empowered Void Crystal fluid and Fluid Extractor recipe;
      solidifier recipes for block and gear.
    - Mote of Omnium solidifier recipe from liquid omnium
        ~ thank you Jimmy!

    - gtadditions.cfg tweaked to re-enable higher tiers of machines in the pack
      like Chemical Baths through UV

    - Language file for en_us locale that assigns the display name for
      Molten Empowered Void Crystal fluid

    - GTCE 1.8.4-Exa patched jar
        + backports official fixes from GTCE for Robot Arms and Machine Covers
          losing configuration on world reloads

builtin/stash: provide a way to export stashes to a ref

A common user problem is how to sync in-progress work to another
machine.  Users currently must use some sort of transfer of the working
tree, which poses security risks and also necessarily causes the index
to become dirty.  The experience is suboptimal and frustrating for
users.

A reasonable idea is to use the stash for this purpose, but the stash is
stored in the reflog, not in a ref, and as such it cannot be pushed or
pulled.  This also means that it cannot be saved into a bundle or
preserved elsewhere, which is a problem when using throwaway development
environments.

Let's solve this problem by allowing the user to export the stash to a
ref (or, to just write it into the repository and print the hash, à la
git commit-tree).  Introduce git stash export, which writes a chain of
commits where the first parent is always a chain to the previous stash,
or to a single, empty commit (for the final item) and the second is the
stash commit normally written to the reflog.

Iterate over each stash from topmost to bottomost, looking up the data
for each one, and then create the chain from the single empty commit
back up in reverse order.  Generate a predictable empty commit so our
behavior is reproducible.  Create a useful commit message, preserving
the author and committer information, to help users identify stash
commits when viewing them as normal commits.

If the user has specified specific stashes they'd like to export
instead, use those instead of iterating over all of the stashes.

As part of this, specifically request quiet behavior when looking up the
OID for a revision because we will eventually hit a revision that
doesn't exist and we don't want to die when that occurs.

Try to silently fall back to a local monarch (#12825)

This is a crazy idea Dustin and I had.

> we can't repro this at will. But we kinda have an idea of where the deref is. We don't know if the small patch (throw, and try again) will fix it. We're sure that the "just fall back to an isolated monarch" will work. I'd almost rather take a build testing the small patch first, to see if that works

> This might seem crazy
> in 1.12, isolated monarch. In 1.13, "small patch". In 1.14, we can wait and see

I can write more details in the morning. It's 5pm here so if we want this today, here it is.

fix: `New Releases` custom app for Spotify 1.1.81+ (#1563)

* Fix `New Releases` custom app for Spotify 1.1.81+

- Based on proposed fix for `Shuffle+` (#1559)
- Fixes #1539 #1530 

Notes:
- Can probably be written nicer - this is my scuffed attempt to fix it
- May or may not actually show all new releases for all followed artists - have over 665 of them but I don't think I'm getting all of them (see below)
- May or may not return `error 500` (added `.catch()` block keeps it from breaking whole custom app)

* Minimize `internal server error: 500`...

...for big libraries of followed artists.

Changes:
- Change `URL` to query only discographies
- Limit amount of queried albums to 5

Notes:
- This does **NOT** fixes erroring fully - it only maxes out amount of data you can query before getting rate limited
- The more options you select (ex. albums + EPs + podcasts), the less data you may receive
- To max number of albums received, I recommend to select only `Albums` (since `Singles and EPs` will probably get displayed anyway...)

* Add notifications when error occurred

Notifications added:
- Error code (`500`, `429` etc.)
- Amount of followed artists to fetch releases from
- Amount of followed artists failed to fetch releases from

I guess we have to get along with getting `500-ed` - one time it fetches everything instantly, second time it drops 60 artists...

* "Prettify" file to pass `Prettier` test

* Fix filtering, counter...

- Fixing filtering as no matter was what set in config, it always displayed everything as "Album"
- Fixing "Missing releases from..." counter - should properly reset now

What broke again:
- "Appears on" releases cannot be retrieved with that API endpoint - this filter is just there and doesn't do anything - this prevents from showing everything as "Appears on" etc.

Notes:
- There seem to be an API endpoint for retrieving "Related content" stuff - problem is that would query everything TWICE... which breaks everything even more (and we don't wanna do that)
- If someone knows how to query everything using separate endpoint without doing it 4 times, let me know...

* Forgor `( )`... Oops... :skull:

I forgor 💀

* Include requested changes

Changes:
- Properly encode URI including variables
- Make `limit` variable customizable via settings (set default to 5)
- Make error messages as "dev console only"

Notes:
- Errors displayed in console may be a little spammy - if we get error early, there may be lots of lines displaying it + counter...
   * I'm not too sure how to tackle this - just remove them altogether? Or is there a function that could "suppress" them?
   * Switching from normal `log` to `debug` may help a little as they will be only visible if user has set their console log level to include `Verbose`
- Making `limit` customizable may lead to even more errors but fuck it I guess - it's better to have a choice than not, right?
   * It can be manually input via custom app settings (same place where other options are) - there is no list etc. - it's just normal input field
- Set `offset` value as const `0` and not making it customizable (cause why would you want to start searching from ex. 3rd album instead of beginning, right?)
- Leaving `Fetching releases from...` notification cause it looks cool - it's fun to know how many followed artists you have 😆

usage API: make the "{usage,fatal,error,warning,BUG}: " translatable

In preceding commits the vreportf() function was made static, so we
know it's only being called with a limited set of fixed prefixes. Pass
an enum indicating the kind of usage message we're emitting instead,
which means that we can fold the BUG_vfl_common() functionality
directly into it.

Since we've now got one place were we're emitting these usage messages
we can make them translatable.

We need to be careful with this function to not malloc() anything, as
a failure in say a use of strbuf_vaddf() would call xmalloc(), which
would in turn call die(), but here we're using static strings, either
from libintl or not.

I was on the fence about making the "BUG: " message translatable, but
let's do it for consistency. Someone who doesn't speak a word of
English may not know what "BUG" means, but if it's translated they
might have an easier time knowing that they have to report a bug
upstream. Since we'll always emit the line number it's unlikely that
we're going to be confused by such a report.

As we've moved the BUG_vfl_common() code into vsnprintf() we can do
away with one of the two checks for buffer sizes added in
116d1fa6c69 (vreportf(): avoid relying on stdio buffering, 2019-10-30)
and ac4896f007a (fmt_with_err: add a comment that truncation is OK,
2018-05-18).

I.e. we're being overly paranoid if we define the fixed-size "prefix"
and "msg" buffers, are OK with the former being truncated, and then
effectively check if our 256-byte buffer is larger than our 4096-byte
buffer. I wondered about adding a:

    assert(sizeof(prefix) < sizeof(msg)); /* overly paranoid much? */

But I think that would be overdoing it. Anyone modifying this function
will keep these two buffer sizes in mind, so let's just remove one of
the checks instead.

usage API: add "core.usageAddSource" config to add <file>:<line>

Optionally extend the support that BUG() has had for emitting line
numbers to the {usage,fatal,error,warning}{,_errno}() functions.

Before we'd unconditionally get error messages like:

    $ git -c core.x=y config --get --bool core.x
    fatal: bad boolean config value 'y' for 'core.x'

Which can be changed with core.usageAddSource=true to include the file
and line numbers:

    $ git -c core.usageAddSource=true -c core.x=y config --get --bool core.x
    fatal: config.c:1241: bad boolean config value 'y' for 'core.x'

As the added documentation notes this is primarily intended to be
useful to developers of git itself, but is being exposed as a user
setting to e.g. help file better bug reports.

This also adds a "GIT_TEST_USAGE_ADD_SOURCE" setting intended to run
the test suite in this mode.

Currently it has a lot of failures. Most of those are rather trivial,
and can be "fixed" by pointing GIT_TEST_CMP to a "diff -u" that does a
s/^(usage|fatal|error|warning): [^:]+:[0-9]+/$1/g on its input files,
and likewise for a "grep" wrapper that does the same.

Even if we can't run the tests in this mode yet I'd like to have this
for ad-hoc debugging, and to make it easier to work towards running
the tests in this mode. If we can turn this on permanently it'll be
much easier to read test output, as we won't need to worry about the
indirection of looking up where an error might have been emitted,
which can be especially painful when the message being emitted isn't
unique within git.git.

This new code needs to be guarded by the "dying" variable for the
reasons explained in 2d3c02f5db6 (die(): stop hiding errors due to
overzealous recursion guard, 2017-06-21), and for those same reasons
it's racy under multi-threading.

Here the worst case is that incrementing the variable will run away
from us, and we won't get our desired <file>:<line> number. That's OK
in this case, those cases should be isolated to the config code (if we
can't parse the config), memory allocation etc, but we'll get it right
in the common cases.

Using GIT_TEST_USAGE_ADD_SOURCE should be immune from any racyness, as
it only needs a getenv() and git_parse_maybe_bool(), which won't die.

Add a repo_cfg_bool_env() wrapper to repo-settings.c for
GIT_TEST_USAGE_ADD_SOURCE, in 3050b6dfc75 (repo-settings.c: simplify
the setup, 2021-09-21) I indicated that the GIT_TEST_MULTI_PACK_INDEX
env variable/config pair in that file has odd semantics, but users of
repo_cfg_bool_env() have straightforward and expected semantics. If
the environment variable is set (true or false) we'll use it,
otherwise we'll use the config, and finally fall back on the
default (of "false", in this case).

Update 2.12.0

- Completely reworked the Mob Loot Fabricator (implemented by WaitingIdly). It's now available in Chapter 23 instead of 26 and it's much cheaper to build. The player can now choose to generate items from 18 different categories by inserting a "catalyst" item into its input slot. Instead of costing Mana, it now costs Life Essence to run. However one of the categories also generates Life Essence liquid back. It can also generate EvilCraft Blood, Vengeance Essence, Will, Gaia Spirits, DivineRPG Souls and boss drops, all Thaumcraft Vis Crystals, all Twilight Forest boss trophies, and more! Moved its quest to Chapter 23, explained the details there, and rearranged the Chapter.
- Updated version number and changelog.

[LIGO-212] Don't overlap Show with Pretty

Problem: We have a pretty annoying orphan instance where `Show` is
automatically derived for things with a `Pretty` instance. Normally,
it's a pain when we want to show something for debugging. I believe that
`Show` should be programmer-friendly, while `Pretty` should be
user-friendly, but this separation doesn't exist here.

Solution: Delete the overlapping instance. After this,
`ContractNotFoundException` broke, and I had to make some changes. I
changed it so that what was the old `Pretty` instance becomes the
`displayException` method of `Exception`, and `Show` is automatically
derived.

pset 6: DNA

dna.zip: Has the distribution code, containing the csv files for sequences and databases used within the program
dna.py: The function longest_match() was pre-defined, our task was to implement the sections in main() marked with TODO

In a file called dna.py, implement a program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs.

The program should require as its first command-line argument the name of a CSV file containing the STR counts for a list of individuals and should require as its second command-line argument the name of a text file containing the DNA sequence to identify.
    If your program is executed with the incorrect number of command-line arguments, your program should print an error message of your choice (with print). If the correct 
    number of arguments are provided, you may assume that the first argument is indeed the filename of a valid CSV file and that the second argument is the filename of a 
    valid text file.

Your program should open the CSV file and read its contents into memory.
    You may assume that the first row of the CSV file will be the column names. The first column will be the word name and the remaining columns will be the STR sequences 
    themselves.

Your program should open the DNA sequence and read its contents into memory.

For each of the STRs (from the first line of the CSV file), your program should compute the longest run of consecutive repeats of the STR in the DNA sequence to identify. Notice that we’ve defined a helper function for you, longest_match, which will do just that!

If the STR counts match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, your program should print out the name of the matching individual.
    You may assume that the STR counts will not match more than one individual.
    If the STR counts do not match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, your program should print No match.

Thoughts:
I missed that I needed len() of sys.argv for determining the number of arguments. I think I was thinking of argc from C that just gives the number of arguments.
I had an issue where the line: if  int(person[STR]) == int(longest[STR]): wasn't evaluating properly. I had originally had it without casting them as int. I'm assuming one was a string and the other an int but I didn't dig deeper into it after getting it to work properly.

Overall I'm fairly happy with how quickly I finished this exercise. None of the errors I was getting were catastrophic and were relatively easy to troubleshoot.

Reland: "free up dispatch key space (in C++)" (#74963)

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/74963

This is a re-land of D35192346 (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/commit/9872a06d77582e91e834103db75f774ca75f7fff) and D35192317 (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/commit/a9216cde6cc57f94586ea71a75a35aaabee720ff), which together are a diff that changes the internal representation of `DispatchKeySet` in pytorch core to free up the number of dispatch keys that we have available. See a more detailed description of the design in the original PR: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/69633.

The original PR broke Milan workflows, which use a pytorch mobile build, and manifested as a memory corruption bug inside of `liboacrmerged.so`.

**Background: Existing Mobile Optimization**
Pytorch mobile builds have an existing optimization (here https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/cc23725e89713138aa1c81ce5fb4a8dbcd440ccf/c10/core/DispatchKey.h#L382 and here https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/cc23725e89713138aa1c81ce5fb4a8dbcd440ccf/aten/src/ATen/core/dispatch/OperatorEntry.h#L214), which works as follows:

Every operator in pytorch has a "dispatch table" of function pointers, corresponding to all of the (up to 64) different kernels that we might dispatch to when we run an operator in pytorch (autograd, cpu, cuda, complex number support, etc).

In mobile builds, the size of that table is shrunk from 64 to 8 to save a bunch of space, because mobile doesn't end up using the functionality associated with most dispatch keys.

The dispatcher also has a notion of "fallback kernels", which are kernels that you can register to a particular dispatch key, but should be able to work for "any operator". The array of fallback kernels is defined here: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/cc23725e89713138aa1c81ce5fb4a8dbcd440ccf/aten/src/ATen/core/dispatch/Dispatcher.h#L294.

The mobile-optimization currently does **not** extend to this array (it wouldn't be that useful anyway because there is only one array of fallback kernels globally - vs. there is a separate dispatch table of function pointers per operator). So the per-operator tables on mobile are size 8, while the fallback table is size 64.

**The Bug**
This PR actually makes it difficult to enable that optimization separately for the per-operator arrays vs. the fallback array, and incidentally shrunk the size of the fallback array from 64 to 8 for mobile (that happened on this line: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/69633/files#diff-f735cd7aa68f15b624100cbc4bb3b5ea76ffc7c9d3bec3b0ccabaa09609e5319R294).

That isn't a problem by itself (since mobile doesn't actually use any of the fallbacks that can no longer be stored). However, pytorch core will still register all of those fallback kernels on startup in mobile builds, even if they aren't used. When we tried to register one of those fallbacks on startup, it would try to dump the kernel somewhere in memory past the bounds of the (now smaller) array inside of the `Dispatcher` object, `backendFallbackKernels_`.

**Why didn't this problem show up in OSS CI? Why didn't it break other internal mobile workflows aside from Milan?**

Ideally, this failure would show up as part of the OSS signal on GitHub, since we already have mobile OSS builds. Given that it was another memory corruption issue that only affected Milan (subset of mobile), I'm not sure what's specific about Milan's builds that caused it only to manifest there. dreiss I wonder if there's another flavor of mobile builds we could run in OSS CI that could potentially help catch this?

**The debugging experience was pretty difficult**

Debugging the Milan-specific failure was made difficult by the following:

(1) lack of CI
- the original Milan failure didn't surface on my original diff, because the Milan job(s) that failed weren't triggered to run on pytorch changes. There's probably a balance to strike here, since those jobs will only be useful if they aren't flaky, and if they can produce reliable failure logs for debugging.

(2) It's difficult to get a repro.
- my work laptop doesn't have the right specs to run the Milan development workflow (not enough disk space)
- There is an existing OnDemand workflow for Milan, but it appears to be relatively new, and after a bunch of help from MarcioPorto, we ran into issues forwarding the log output from Milan tests on the emulator back to the terminal (see the original discussion here: https://fb.workplace.com/groups/OnDemandFRL/permalink/1424937774645433/)

(3) Lack of stack-traces.
- Most Milan failures didn't include actionable stack traces. phding generously helped me debug by running my suggested patches locally, and reporting back if there were any failures. The failing test didn't include a stack trace though (just the line where the crash appeared), so I ended up making some educated guesses about what the issue was based on the area of the crash.

Test Plan: Confirmed with phding that the broken Milan workflow from the previous version of this diff is now passing.

finally found a reasonable pattern to have to ctors and assigners, at least with msvc. We need to verify that this pattern works on gcc as well and if it doesn't we can actually define the special ctors and friends to handle it. It should be able to function fully in this way. There are so many crappy things that happen under the hood with overload resolution and passing arguments and their types. For instance, it's impossible to designate a template constraint for lvalue and rvalue references without using the regular function overload symbols. That is to say you can't just use a concept to constrain to these things. Also, having const and not having const on the lvalue reference can actually make legitimate lvalues be resolved to the rvalue method, which I can't even being to fathom why that happens. Keep in mind, this is distinct from the expected behavior that an rvalue can resolve to the const lvalue method/ctor which is expected behavior (although perhaps bad design none-the-less.) There's no way in this insane language to explicitly say 'I will only accept lvalue references' or 'I will only accept rvalue references' or 'I will only accept values which are not references.' Absolutely insane. And then that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what in the world is going on such that a template ctor/assigner is being selected when there is an explict non-template function defined. I don't know if that is only msvc doing that or if somehow in the twisted logic of overload resolution that is what is supposed to happen under these bizarre circumstances, but it's happening. I've literally spent about 7 hours or so working on this problem. Additionally I went ahead and started adding more types of to operators to the tr syntax because I do think they can be useful even if under limited circumstances.

"9:50am. Got a PM by a party interested in potentially sponsoring Spiral. This put me in a good mood. I really am glad that my Reddit posting career was not all in vain.

I am going to learn from my previous experience and curb my enthusiasm until I see a proper offer. I know from experience that some parties might have wildly optimistic expectations of how low I'd be willing to work for.

So far, I haven't gotten a reply from machin3 regarding that source request so I do not have to think about that. Let me just reply and see how this develops over the coming days.

11:10pm. Replied to that PM. This current situtation with MESHmachine is such a drag. Rather than waste my time debugging the thing, I should just buy it for 30$ and have the author do it instead. It is one thing when you have no income, but when you do 30$ is literally nothing. Since I got that PM, my mentality has changed to potentially having a job. I wouldn't refuse an offer specifically to work on Spiral.

I am supposed to be a programmer first and artist second. Let's not forget what my mission is - to cause the Singularity. I wouldn't want to take on arbitrary jobs, but direct offers like these in the area of my interest are an exception.

The way I see job quality is simple - it is not the goal, but the approach that matters. Suppose I got an offer to clean toilets, that would be bad, right? It depends on the approach, maybe instead of cleaning them by hand, the path I need to take would be to build robots to do it. A low status task done in a classy manner is a high status task for me. That are many paths to transcendence beyond building game playing agents directly. Poker was just the most visible bait to me.

11:20am. Let me see if I can dad's laptop fixed. I'll just call him up and have him explain how to deal with the broken connection.

12pm. What a weird case. It felt like the laptop had some kind of malware preventing me from installing Firefox. I have no idea why Chrome and Chromium were not even displaying icons on some sites. When I tried downloading Firefox the downloads were breaking in the middle and I had to get the offline installer. Reinstalling Chrome did no good. So I got rid of them along with Internet Explorer. I am done with it now.

12:35pm. https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/09/strong-compute-wants-speed-up-your-ml-model-training/

It is this company I got a PM from, from the guy to the right most likely.

12:45pm. Cloud computing, huh? Not something I had dived into. It is skillset that is in demand and I do not have it simply due to the limitations of a NEET budget.

Let me chill for a bit.

1pm. This situation with unexpected things happening has thrown my mind in disarray. I am obsessed about MESHmachine, but I waffled on buying it and can only wait until my father gets back. I guess my goal for the day will be to try out UV Packmaster instead. I can only sigh with how that buggy plugin is behaving.

It is really is the missing essentials. It has put me in a spot where I do not feel like doing anything without it even though I do not really need it.

The Macrocosm Era

Right now I am reading this. None of the chink stuff ever caught my interest. The plot of this is not that good, but the art made me give it a chance.

1:45pm. Let me start.

First I have to decide: should I study art as planned, or should I make a detour and study Elixir for a bit?

Let me go with Elixir.

1:55pm. Installed it. Now do I get vscode-elixir or ElixirLS?

https://github.com/timmhirsens/vscode-elixir
> This project is no longer maintained. Please checkout https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakeBecker.elixir-ls as an alternative

The first one is no longer maintained. It seems it has not been updated in 4-5 years.

I'll go with the later then.

I have both Elixir and the plugin for it installed. I put 2+2 in an .exs file. Now how do I run it?

https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/lrx0ju/q_first_hour_with_elixir_how_to_run_in_vscode/

///

Just d/l and installed elixir (win auto installer) and added the ElixirLS extension to VSCode.

vscode recognizes my hello.ex file as elixir.

How do I compile/run my single line hello world via the IDE?

///

The comments in the Reddit thread are a bit confusing.

https://elixirforum.com/t/q-my-first-hour-how-to-run-in-vscode/37778

///

running “Hello, World!” is the hardest part in learning Elixir. Its a little crazy. But as soon as that is out of the way, I promise, It’ll be a fun ride.

If you created your project with mix new Hello there is a module Hello in lib.
In there is a comment that tells you to run:

    iex> Hello.hello()
        :world

what it doesn’t tell you is, that you have to start iex in this way

    iex -S mix

You can also run the function directly

    mix run -e Hello.hello

but you should add something that you can see on the console first, like

    def hello do
        IO.puts("hello")
    end

Note: If there are processes involved (later!) you’ll need to add --no-halt but then you’ll but build a Supervision-Tree (later!!) anyway (and you run an OTP-application and not just one function).

In the beginning I’d just put everything in tests and run

    mix test

To run the test with a vscode-hotkey look here:

https://pragdave.me/blog/2018/06/13/visual-studio-code-elixir-tests.html 30

///

12:25pm. Hmmm, why doesn't `iex -S mix` work in Powershell. I think that - is using to pass in named arguments. But in that case how do pass in regular ones.

It has been so long since I've used PS that is all faded from my memory, assuming I knew how to do it in the first place.

2:55pm. https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/pattern-matching.html

Pinned equality is interesting. I could put something like that into Spiral.

3:05pm. Ok, enough. If I get a good offer, I'll study Elixir all I want later. I do not want it to be like last time when I decided to go with Julia and studied it for 3 weeks, only to meet with disappointment. I am not a 500 year old reincarnated demon, so I can't see through the motivations of others at a glance. So I'll be on my guard and follow proper procedures regarding this sort of thing.

I put in a bit of effort in this direction just to satisfy my curiosity and that is enough for now.

Now, how about I try out UV packmaster?

3:15pm. Why did the install for it freeze?

3:30pm. Trying it a second time went through without a hitch. Maybe the Erlang process in the background did something weird. Nevermind that.

I did an auto UV project on the entire desk and the unpacking elements do not look too bad.

That having said, remember that Maya tutorial on UV corner smoothing? Yeah, I'll have to do an UV project after applying all the mods.

3:35pm. Yeah, the auto UVs are decent. I do not need to fuss with them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTbTbt87HRY
UVPackmaster tutorial for Blender - UV packing mode "Groups To Tiles"

Let me focus on this.

3:40pm. I haven't watched the video yet, and am just playing with the addon. UV packmaster is super easy to use. I can clearly see it giving better results than regular blender packing.

Let me watch the tutorial and then I'll try exporting the desk into Substance Painter.

I need to check out the UDIM workflow.

3:55pm. With heuristic search it does even better. Let me finally finish watching the thing.

4:05pm. This is a really good gain. If only everything can be like this.

Yeah, no matter how I look at it, to really becomfortable, I am missing two key things - offset cuts for booleans and the bevel control functionality mesh machines gives me. Mesh machine has offset cuts, but not the kind that would get autoapplied on bevels.

Literally all my modeling woes are around bevels it seems.

https://youtu.be/8qv6DbWr6zw

Let me just watch this for a bit and then I'll move into Pt.

4:20pm. I am quite impressed. I was not sure how to use geometry masks. It seems that when you don't export object groups, the geometry groups will be the the collections. If you do, then they will be the object names.

4:25pm. This is very good. I am thinking about the possibilities. Now I have just two tiles with 1.82 coverage, which would come to 91% for each. This is very good coverage. Much better than what I had before. Instead of having 17 different 2k tiles like before, I should be able to go with 2 4k ones and save space. In fact, this way of doing things would allow me to increase the quality.

Now let me investigate edge wear. I'll play around with the mask generator.

4:35pm. There is an UV texel density in substance. It looks quite good. There are some minor red spots, but it is quite even.

5:30pm. Ok, let me get my bearings.

Everything is good, but the seams are quite noticeable. So - quite bad then.

No, there is no way I feel like messing with placing seams on the subidivided mesh. I am going to go with the bevel style desk.

5:45pm. Let me take a break here.

Whatever the case is, I am going to have to redo the texturing. Packing UDIMs is a piece of cake and I've been playing with the curvature generator enough.

6:25pm. Let me take more of a break. All this has shattered my motivation for a bit, and I am trying to get a proper frame of mind again.

* First of all, bevel vs subdiv style. I should just ignore those concerns. Go with bevel, and if I really need curvy surfaces go with subdiv. MESHmachine and Hops do not matter.
* That annoying obligation to try and recompile from source is way more than I need. I am going to buy the plugin for 30$ and if it still does not work just pester the author until it fixes it. I should be saving my nerves instead of money in this scenario. What would I do if it did not exist. That is what I should be asking myself.
* That pending sponsorship opportunity, I'll do my best to not think about it until I get a real offer. Random people coming for a talk are just that. I can't let this distract me and sway me from my present course.
* The desk. I'll retexture it and move on to the rig and the monitor.

6:40pm. In other words, I should ignore everything except the desk. I'll retexture the bevel version again and do the rest in whatever way I feel like. Imagine if none of the plugins exist. They don't really change the characteristics of each style of modeling.

I need to focus on a single thing - only bevel style if I can, subdiv otherwise. And that is all that I need.

There is a transition point into one or the other style after the block out phase.

Just focus on the block out first. The beveling concerns can come after that.

The block out is important. The beveling is just the prettying up phase. That is how I should think about it.

6:55pm. Now...let me chill for a bit more.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qv6DbWr6zw&t=5s
26 Essential Blender Tips for UV Unwrapping Subdivision Surfaces

After that I'll watch this video and call it a day. Tomorrow I am going to dedicate another day to texturing the desk again.

7:30pm. Let me finally finish the video and I will call it a day. The BRS novel and the PriPri OVA are waiting for me.

https://youtu.be/8qv6DbWr6zw?t=178

I knew this on my own, but I really should have watched the video first.

7:45pm. I bought MESHmachine and can report that it works.

///

If that bug I reported was due to an anti piracy measure, then congratulations, it was successful in getting me to buy. I can report that the plugin on the pirate sites does not work, and I've tried several versions of them with different versions of Blender as well. Yet the one on BlenderMarket does.

I've never bought any software in my life, but I've bought yours. The missing essentials description is apt. It ate away at me until I caved.

///

This is what I sent to the author. Hopefully that gets a chuckle out of him.

7:55pm. With this, my capability to deal with bevels should go up drastically. The addon is certainly worth 30$ and more.

8:05pm. Done with lunch. Let me try recreating the desk piece that was so troublesome to me.

...It seems I accidentally erased it at some point so I am going to have to do that anyway.

8:40pm. https://youtu.be/wEiWdodIcSo
MESHmachine 0.6 - Fuse

Things are not going as planned. I thought it would be able to do this, but it is having trouble dealing with triangle corners. This is the same difficulty the original has.

https://youtu.be/wEiWdodIcSo

Hmm, wait, is this how he handles the corners? By fusing twice over them?

Nice. This gives really nice results. I was starting to fear I'd need a refund.

I am going to have to study this tool for a bit. I thought I'd just be able to use it skillfully off the bat, but I was wrongn. This guy's insight into beveling is superior to mine.

https://youtu.be/VPWYVWjou7c
MESHmachine 0.6 - Chamfer

Let me watch this.

9:40pm. https://youtu.be/mJMFuodYl1k
> Geometry produced in CAD modeling tools is by subd standards pretty bad topology and yet it shades perfectly despite the many triangles. It is doing that via custom normals which you can also do with MESHmachine.

9:50pm. https://youtu.be/jTTOpngFAhg?t=36
Poly modeling just got BETTER - Mesh Machine offset cut overview

Here he mentions Moi 3d.

Yeah, the offset cut is really great. I am trying out the regular offset and it does not conform to the underlying geometry, but the offset cut does. So I can imagine it bieng the preferred tool to clean up after a cut.

https://youtu.be/cEe57tKwUIA
So what exactly is NURBS modeling?

Let me watch this and then I am closing. Tomorrow I'll start with the desk piece and I'll finally deal with it properly.

10:05pm. I just realized something. Starting with a cube, if you select two opposite faces (instead of all of them) you get quads in the chamfered region. Then if you select one of the unchamfered sides, select the edge right and then chamfer that you get perfect quads on all sides of the cube. If you select all the edges and bever that you get triangles in the corners which can't be fused. I see.

Mesh machine's tooling is really something that should have come out of the box in Blender. Bevels are at least that important.

Let me watch the Moi 3d videos.

10:30pm. Let me close here. I didn't even touch the subdiv UV unwrappign one.

I guess I'll leave it for tomorrow. Even though it was through the power of money, I did solve my problem and got upgraded modeling capabilities as a result. I need to study MESHmachine more. I'll have to go through its doc videos in their entirety.

At this point I have no idea how long I've been stuck on the desk, but I should finish it soon and move on to the next thing. Just a tiny bit more and I will achieve complete satisfaction with my hard surface modeling capabilities.

The fact that I am the stage where I am feeling the limits of vanilla's Blender capabilities and am having to reach for addons to fulfill my needs shows how much I've advanced in this area. I'll keep going further."

[MIRROR] Almost halves airlock auto close delay [MDB IGNORE] (#12314)

* Almost halves airlock auto close delay (#65349)

We go from a delay of 15 seconds, to 8.

This has cheesed me off for a long time. Airlocks should lock, not just
stay open for a quarter of a minute.

This'll help with excited groups that stay permenantly connected at
highpop because of a slowed ssair and doors opening and closing
constantly

Also effects door chasing. I'm honestly just kinda eyeballing this, it
might be a bit much. Even if this goes through could totally be tweaked

Even if this is too low, 15 is way too damn high.

fix regex used in evil-tex-toggle-delim

Previously, it would match anything that had a slash followed optionally by a
balancing keyword followed optionally by l, which would mess up how it matched
things like \{ or \|

Currently, the regex it uses to decide if the delimiters are already
balanced (based just on the initial one) is:

"\\\\\\(?:left\\|big\\|bigg\\|Big\\|Bigg\\)?l?"

(note: all regexes here are taken from elisp so have extra backslashes for
string escapes)

The trouble is that this matches *anything* that has a slash, since everything
that follows is optional. For example, if you have math like $ \{ x \} $ and you
run evil-tex-toggle-delim, then this *will* match (just the literal backslash),
causing it to think that it is already size balanced, and then "toggling" will
just strip the backslash rather than prepending \left and \right.

This could be fixed by changing it to

"\\\\\\(?:\\(left\\|big\\|bigg\\|Big\\|Bigg\\)\\|l\\)"

This extra level of grouping means that it only matches if there is a literal
backslash followed by *either* one of the balancing keywords OR l. This way it
has to match something in the second part, and this will not match \{

However, I think that trailing (optional) l is perhaps a mistake. I assume it is
there to catch things like \langle, but this will then toggle \langle to
angle (which without the slash is not a macro). Moreover, \langle and
\rangle (or similarly \lvert and \rvert, etc) are paired delimiters but they do
not automatically resize (at least not for me), I instead need to do
\left\langle if I want that behavior. For that reason, I think the trailing l
should be cut, and the final regex is just

"\\\\\\(?:left\\|big\\|bigg\\|Big\\|Bigg\\)"

TUI FilterTreeView widget && new structure (again)

So I gave up on the separate state/display shit cause it was making my
brain cells slowly commit suicide one by one.

FilterTreeView is the first implementation of a "ContainedWidget" that
holds everything it needs to function within itself, minus the
framebuffer which it logically can't. It implements familiar new trait
Clickable with the same process_event(), and new new trait Scrollable,
which provides methods for scrolling the active pane.

Library has some new fns to help with this, and the Filter evt type now
has a bool wrapped stating whether or not the filters were resized. Im
torn on this, as it's also hypothetically possible for FilterTreeView to
figure this out on its own instead of using update_from_library on
resize, but that's to be explored later after cleanup

Theme now just has 8 styles instead of 4 styles and 2 mods.

TUI main has a lot of small rolling changes made as it was broken and
rebuilt with FilterTreeView. Volume keys are now "+-" and 'V' now uses
the fancy new selection fns from FilterTreeView.

Overall, it's 100% going to be less computationally efficient to have
everything query the library for a unique copy of filtered_tracks any
time it needs info on the filters, but the QoL in a coding sense
outweighs the extra few megs of memory used while clicking the ui.
Once Queue (and maybe Statusbar) are migrated to the new system and the
commented code is all removed, it's still possible to re-optimize by
exposing new fns in Library.

tl;dr: this is a lotta BS I worked on over the last few months so it's
very disjointed in thought and structure but I think it's coming
together maybe hopefully come and save me

Atmos Control Console Refactor (and syndiebase atmos tidyup) (#65372)

Main Takeaways For Mappers:

Use monitored pathed atmos devices very carefully. Also dont put atmos_sensors willy nilly. They are used to hook to atmos control monitors.

We want to keep at most one device broadcasting for each of the atmos sensor, inlets, and outlets. Run the mapping verb Check Atmos Chamber Devices to be sure, though this might not catch everything.

Some of the warning are pretty harmless. For example if you have reconnected the "station atmos monitor" and you get no listener for distro/waste loop warning, it's safe to ignore.

I don't know what the maptainer policy is on making new subtypes for offstation content, but if you do please branch off the general ones instead of the specific gas ones. If you aren't making a new subtype, varedit the general ones too.

About The Pull Request:

Need Would prefer this to be merged before #65271 (In game atmos guide).
Not strictly necessary, just makes me sleep better knowing the handbook wont die alongside the rest of the UI.

Fixes #36668 (Atmos Monitoring Consoles don't update it's sensors to the new tank after reconnect())
Fixes #32122 (Mix console fucked after reconnecting it)

Also made the distro meter thing broadcast more info instead of just the pressure, because I'm sure nobody would care and it would make my life easier.

A small high-level overview in case this breaks again in the future:

A signal datum (not DCS) is sent by the atmospheric devices (injectors and vents) and will be received by the atmos computers. The data is then stored at the monitor object and then passed to the UI. This initial signal is sent by `broadcast_signal()`, called by `atmos_init()`.

New sensors/vents (if you can actually get them in game, still only adminspawn/wrenchables afaik) will also initiate the conversation if atmos_init() is called, so it works fine. This means you need to unwrench and re-wrench the devices if you adminspawn them though, ugh.

In case of a newly built computer, it needs to be the one that prompt the data to the devices, so we send a request signal. This is a bit inefficient since it doesnt work off of callbacks and assocs like DCS, but won't really matter since we're doing this rarely.

We only talk with the injectors and vents when necessary here, while sensors and meters keep beeping with every process_atmos() tick so they rarely break.


Why It's Good For The Game:

Messy code gone (debatable).


Refactored the atmos control console devices. The ones that hook to the big turf chambers.
Distro meter now broadcast the whole gasmix info instead of just pressure to the monitors.
Lavaland syndie's atmos chamber vents are now actually configurable. Moved a few things around to accomodate this.
Lavalannd syndie chambers hooked to distro and moved distro pipe to layer2
atmos monitors can detect reactions now.
Some minor code changes to how anomaly refinery and implosion compressor show the gas info. No changes expected, report if bug.
recoded checks for atmos chamber abnormalities in debug verbs.
