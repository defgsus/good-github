Make the build work under more JDK versions.

(Guava is already _usable_ under plenty of verions. This change affects only people who build it themselves.)

And run CI under JDK17. Maybe this will make CI painfully slow, but we'll see what happens. If we want to drop something, we should consider whether to revert 17 or to drop 11 instead (so as to maintain coverage at the endpoints of \[8, 17\]).

## Notes on some of the versions

### JDK9

I expected Error Prone to work, but I saw `invalid flag: -Xep:NullArgumentForNonNullParameter:OFF`, even though that flag is [already](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/166d8c0d8733d40914fb24f368cb587a92bddfe0/pom.xml#L515) part of [the same `<arg>`](https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/1086#issuecomment-411544589), which works fine for other JDK versions. So I disabled Error Prone for that version.

Then I had a Javadoc problem with the `--no-module-directories` configuration from cl/413934851 (the fix for https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5457). After reading [JDK-8215582](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8215582) more carefully, I get the impression that that flag might not have been added until 11: "addressed in JDK 11, along with an option to revert to the old layout in case of need." So I disabled it for 9-10.

Then I ran into a problem similar to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6173 / [JDK-8184940](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8184940). I'm not sure exactly what tool produced a file with a month of 0, but it happened only when building `guava-tests`. At that point, I gave up, though I left the 2 above workarounds in place.

### JDK10

This fails with some kind of problem finding a Guice dependency inside Maven. I didn't investigate.

### JDK15 and JDK16

These fail with [the `TreeMap` bug](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8259622) that [our collection testers had detected](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issue-1068748849) but we never got around to reporting. Thankfully, it got reported and [fixed](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/2c8e337dff4c84fb435cafac8b571f94e161f074) for JDK17. We could consider suppressing the tests under that version.

### JDK18, JDK19, and JDK20-early-access

These fail with [`SecurityManager` trouble](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issuecomment-1293817701).

## Notes on the other actual changes

### `maven-javadoc-plugin`

I set up `maven-javadoc-plugin` to use `-source ${java.specification.version}`. Otherwise, it would [take the version from `maven-compiler-plugin`](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issuecomment-1314291284). That's typically fine: Guava's source code targets Java 8, so `-source 8` "ought" to work. But it doesn't actually work because we also pass Javadoc the _JDK_ sources (so that `{@inheritDoc}` works better), which naturally can target whichever version of the JDK we're building with.

### Error Prone

While Error Prone is mostly usable [on JDK11+](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation), some of its checks have [problems under some versions](https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3540), at least when they're reporting warnings.

This stems from its use of part of the Checker Framework, which [doesn't support JDKs in the gap between 11 and 17](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/blob/c2d16b3409000ac2e2ca95b8b81ae11e42195308/framework/src/main/java/org/checkerframework/framework/source/SourceChecker.java#L553-L554). And specifically,  it looks like the Checker Framework is [trying to look up `BindingPatternTree` under any JDK12+](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/blob/c2d16b3409000ac2e2ca95b8b81ae11e42195308/javacutil/src/main/java/org/checkerframework/javacutil/TreeUtils.java#L131-L144). But `BindingPatternTree` (besides not being present at all [until JDK14](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/229e0d16313b10932b9ce7506d84096696983699#diff-3db4b0ce4411c851bcf75d92ef4dadc7351debcf0f9b2c2623dc513923b45867R41)) didn't declare that method [until JDK16](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/18bc95ba51b6864150c28985e65b6f784ea8ee2c#diff-3db4b0ce4411c851bcf75d92ef4dadc7351debcf0f9b2c2623dc513923b45867R39).

Anyway, the problem we saw was [a `NoSuchMethodException` during the `AbstractReferenceEquality` call to `NullnessAnalysis.getNullness`](https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/log-a9d04aa2-8b5a-47ca-8066-7e6b38548064.txt), which uses Checker Framework dataflow.

To address that, I disabled Error Prone for the versions under which I'd expect the `BindingPatternTree` code to be a problem.

(I also disabled it for JDK10: As noted above, Error Prone [supports JDK11+](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation). And as noted further above, Maven doesn't get far enough with JDK10 to even start running Error Prone.)

mm: vmscan: fix extreme overreclaim and swap floods

During proactive reclaim, we sometimes observe severe overreclaim, with
several thousand times more pages reclaimed than requested.

This trace was obtained from shrink_lruvec() during such an instance:

    prio:0 anon_cost:1141521 file_cost:7767
    nr_reclaimed:4387406 nr_to_reclaim:1047 (or_factor:4190)
    nr=[7161123 345 578 1111]

While he reclaimer requested 4M, vmscan reclaimed close to 16G, most of it
by swapping.  These requests take over a minute, during which the write()
to memory.reclaim is unkillably stuck inside the kernel.

Digging into the source, this is caused by the proportional reclaim
bailout logic.  This code tries to resolve a fundamental conflict: to
reclaim roughly what was requested, while also aging all LRUs fairly and
in accordance to their size, swappiness, refault rates etc.  The way it
attempts fairness is that once the reclaim goal has been reached, it stops
scanning the LRUs with the smaller remaining scan targets, and adjusts the
remainder of the bigger LRUs according to how much of the smaller LRUs was
scanned.  It then finishes scanning that remainder regardless of the
reclaim goal.

This works fine if priority levels are low and the LRU lists are
comparable in size.  However, in this instance, the cgroup that is
targeted by proactive reclaim has almost no files left - they've already
been squeezed out by proactive reclaim earlier - and the remaining anon
pages are hot.  Anon rotations cause the priority level to drop to 0,
which results in reclaim targeting all of anon (a lot) and all of file
(almost nothing).  By the time reclaim decides to bail, it has scanned
most or all of the file target, and therefor must also scan most or all of
the enormous anon target.  This target is thousands of times larger than
the reclaim goal, thus causing the overreclaim.

The bailout code hasn't changed in years, why is this failing now?  The
most likely explanations are two other recent changes in anon reclaim:

1. Before the series starting with commit 5df741963d52 ("mm: fix LRU
   balancing effect of new transparent huge pages"), the VM was
   overall relatively reluctant to swap at all, even if swap was
   configured. This means the LRU balancing code didn't come into play
   as often as it does now, and mostly in high pressure situations
   where pronounced swap activity wouldn't be as surprising.

2. For historic reasons, shrink_lruvec() loops on the scan targets of
   all LRU lists except the active anon one, meaning it would bail if
   the only remaining pages to scan were active anon - even if there
   were a lot of them.

   Before the series starting with commit ccc5dc67340c ("mm/vmscan:
   make active/inactive ratio as 1:1 for anon lru"), most anon pages
   would live on the active LRU; the inactive one would contain only a
   handful of preselected reclaim candidates. After the series, anon
   gets aged similarly to file, and the inactive list is the default
   for new anon pages as well, making it often the much bigger list.

   As a result, the VM is now more likely to actually finish large
   anon targets than before.

Change the code such that only one SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX-sized nudge toward the
larger LRU lists is made before bailing out on a met reclaim goal.

This fixes the extreme overreclaim problem.

Fairness is more subtle and harder to evaluate.  No obvious misbehavior
was observed on the test workload, in any case.  Conceptually, fairness
should primarily be a cumulative effect from regular, lower priority
scans.  Once the VM is in trouble and needs to escalate scan targets to
make forward progress, fairness needs to take a backseat.  This is also
acknowledged by the myriad exceptions in get_scan_count().  This patch
makes fairness decrease gradually, as it keeps fairness work static over
increasing priority levels with growing scan targets.  This should make
more sense - although we may have to re-visit the exact values.

Clean up servers when all repos have been disposed

Summary:
We've seen cases on windows where people get stale cwds due to re-using repos. We actually need to fix that problem separately, but I think it's also a good idea to reduce how aggressively we re-use servers.

If someone is running `sl isl` on the CLI, we'll pop open a new browser window regardless. It doesn't impact startup time much if we DON'T re-use the server. The only potential impact of not re-using a server is that other servers already running would get killed.

So the idea here is that we use our refcounted repository to know when we're in the clear to shutdown the entire server. Then the next `sl isl` will get a fresh server no problem.

This has the benefit of making it more likely that people will not get stuck on stale versions of ISL if we update it (though we should add other mitigations for this, too, like an in-app warning if we see that the sl version has changed since spawning)

Miscellany:
- if you spawn with --foreground, we don't do this auto cleanup, since presumably your terminal should fully control this
- We need to  consider --no-open. The idea here is that we only try to clean up after a repo is disposed. So if spawned with --no-open, it won't try to clean itself up until at least one ws connection is started succcessfully.
- We don't have a great way to write to the log file, due to some ergonomics of how we create a file logger. Ideally we'd print a little "Shutting down ISL server due to no remaining repositories + inactivity"

NOTE: This change isn't strictly necessary, but I think it's better for us to err on the side of not re-using servers. Any thoughts on this?

PsychHID/OSX: Avoid calling PsychHIDWarnAccessDenied frequently.

The latest fix for the latest security bullshit, introduced sometime after macOS
10.15 Catalina. This was found when testing Octave on macOS 12.5 Monterey.

Apparently the call to IOHIDCheckAccess() by PsychHIDWarnAccessDenied()
is now extremely costly on macOS 12 (possibly also macOS 11 - untested) iff
the host application was launched from Terminal.app instead of standalone via
clicking a launch icon. This showed on Octave 6.4 after upgrade to macOS 12.5,
as octave is always launched from Terminal, regardless if in console mode or
GUI mode. Matlab appeared unaffected, as it is usually launched by clicking the
Matlab icon, but if one launches Matlab from a terminal, the same happens.

Why IOHIDCheckAccess() was suddenly turned into such an expensive operation
by the iDiots, i don't know, but our workaround is to no longer call it at each
invocation of KbCheck or KbQueueCreate, but only at PsychHID startup, and
hope this does not have other new bad effects.

Note access time exploded from way less than 1 msec to over 15 msecs! Great
work Apple!

Now we are back to identical performance on Matlab and Octave in both GUI
and commandline mode. Performance is bad compared to Linux or Windows,
but manageable at about 2.4 msecs on macOS 12.5 Monterey on a MBP 2017.
However, if run on a MacBook with touchbar, two PsychHID('KbCheck') calls
are needed for each KbCheck() call, because the touchbar is a separate HID
device, serving the important ESCape key and also function keys, so owners
of a shitty touchbar machine will have to live with execution times of KbCheck
on the order of 5 msecs on not that old hardware like the MBP 2017! This makes
animation loops with KbChecks difficult to run beyond 60-100 fps. Such is the
life of Apple customers...

When we are here, improve troubleshooting instructions for security bullshit
on macOS, and fix two compiler warnings new on macOS 12.

[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

Builds logic that manages turfs contained inside an area (#70966)

## About The Pull Request

Area contents isn't a real list, instead it involves filtering
everything in world
This is slow, and something we should have better support for.

So instead, lets manage a list of turfs inside our area. This is simple,
since we already move turfs by area contents anyway

This should speed up the uses I've found, and opens us up to using this
pattern more often, which should make dev work easier.

By nature this is a tad fragile, so I've added a unit test to double
check my work

Rather then instantly removing turfs from the contained_turfs list, we
enter them into a list of turfs to pull out, later.
Then we just use a getter for contained_turfs rather then a var read

This means we don't need to generate a lot of usage off removing turf by
turf from space, and can instead do it only when we need to

I've added a subsystem to manage this process as well, to ensure we
don't get any out of memory errors. It goes entry by entry, ensuring we
get no overtime.
This allows me to keep things like space clean, while keeping high
amounts of usage on a sepearate subsystem when convienient

As a part of this goal of keeping space's churn as low as possible, I've
setup code to ensure we do not add turfs to areas during a z level
increment adjacent mapload. this saves a LOT of time, but is a tad
messy

I've expanded where we use contained_turfs, including into some cases
that filter for objects in areas. need to see if this is sane or not.

Builds sortedAreas on demand, caching until we mark the cache as
violated

It's faster, and it also has the same behavior

I'm not posting speed changes cause frankly they're gonna be a bit
scattered and I'm scared to.
@Mothblocks if you'd like I can look into it. I think it'll pay for
itself just off `reg_in_areas_in_z` (I looked into it. it's really hard
to tell, sometimes it's a bit slower (0.7), sometimes it's 2 seconds
(0.5 if you use the old master figure) faster. life is pain.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Less stupid, more flexible, more speed

security enough to get into permabrig only to find out that they cant
even unwrench the equipment and move it to the church!!!

NOT ANYMORE!!!

Access to exercise equipment on some maps is limited to static positions
and is currently mostly only for prisoners as every map does not have
public exercise equipment. Expanding the access means that you can have
a Drill Sargent Head of Security or Captain who commands people use
these or allows a psychologist to prescribe healthy exercise habits to
their patients.

I think having the potential for exercise equipment on every map is more
fun and also if prisoners get their hands on tools they should be
allowed to mess with these to annoy security or aid in their escape.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: the punching bag, bench press, and chest press are all able to be
crafted and unanchored.
add: crafting recipes for the above
qol: changed a chat message into a balloon alert
qol: adds screentips to equipment (thanks for suggesting i do this
mothblocks!)

Renews a bunch of old roundend new reports that got lost. Plus, some roundend report QoL for cult and revs. (#71284)

## About The Pull Request

A few roundend reports got lost from moving to dynamic and other prs.
This PRs re-allows them to occur. Namely: "Wizard Killed" (lost in
dynamic), "Blob nuked" (lost in dynamic), "Cult escaped" (lost in cult
rework), and "Nuke Ops Victory" (station destroyed via nuke) (lost from,
what I can see, an oversight / accidental swap of report values).

Additionally, small roundend report QOL for cult: Removes antag datums
from spirit realm ghosts after being dusted, so they do not show up on
the report. And in reverse, heads of staff who were dusted / destroyed
in revolution rounds are now also shown in roundend reports.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Some of these reports are dead, which is is a shame because I think
they're cool and fun.

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
qol: Successfully fending off a blob now has a cross station news report
again. More pressing reports will take priority over it, though.
qol: Successfully killing a wizard (and all of their apprentices) now
has a cross station news report again.
qol: If more than half of a cultist team manages to escape on the
shuttle (rather than summoning Nar'sie), they will send a unique cross
station news report. This is still a loss, by the way. Summon Nar'sie!
qol: Nuclear Operatives successfully nuking the station now has its
unique cross station news report again, and no longer uses the generic
"The station was nuked" report.
qol: Nuking the station to stop a blob infection now has a unique cross
station news report again. Good luck convincing admins to allow this.
qol: Cult ghosts from "Spirit Realm" no longer persist on the cult's
team after being desummoned, meaning they will not show up on roundend
report.
qol: Heads of staff will now always show up on revolution roundend
report - even if their body was fully destroyed.

x86/nospec: Unwreck the RSB stuffing

commit 4e3aa9238277597c6c7624f302d81a7b568b6f2d upstream.

Commit 2b1299322016 ("x86/speculation: Add RSB VM Exit protections")
made a right mess of the RSB stuffing, rewrite the whole thing to not
suck.

Thanks to Andrew for the enlightening comment about Post-Barrier RSB
things so we can make this code less magical.

Retires explosive lance crafting to a nice farm upstate where it has plenty of room to run around (#71256)

## About The Pull Request

You can no longer craft explosive lances.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Explosive lances are unhealthy for the game in it's current iteration.
Many years ago when the game was more loose and we weren't dealing with
players who treat the game like competitive TTT or Town of Salem,

They are a one shot kill weapon, which is the most powerful kind of
weapon in every gamemode. @JohnFulpWillard likened it to 1f1, a concept
from Town of Salem players where the town trades 1 person for 1 bad guy.

Modern ss13 design includes a significantly heavier load of antagonists
that aren't fixed roundstart compared to when the e-lance went in.

When we added the e-lance, if nuke ops spawned, that was it, there was
nuke ops, if you e-lanced the nuke ops and died you were dead until the
next round.

Nowadays you're rolling for lone operative, blob, wizard, disease,
revenant, and every other fun enjoyable antagonist role under the sun.

I can e-lance a nuke op/cultist/traitor/revolutionary/any bad guy in the
game as a non-antag assistant, die, and have a good chance to roll
another, way more fun antag in deadchat.

My change to make the e-lance a proper "we both die" tool didn't
actually help because I didn't quite realize that to the modern SS13
player because of how we designed Dynamic and antagonists in the modern
era, death is, frankly, not a punishment anymore.

It's time we admit the facts, items designed in 2015 SS13 in #12389
simply don't hold up in a healthy manner in 2022 SS13. Dying in SS13 in
2015 was a significantly different experience with different
consequences than it has now, and right now "kills you when you use it"
is not the same massive downside it was 7-8 years ago.

## Changelog

del: You can no longer craft explosive lances.

From Paragraphs to Sentences

An Introduction to Sentence Segmentation

Sentence segmentation, means, to split a given paragraph of text into sentences, by identifying the sentence boundaries. In many cases, a full stop is all that is required to identify the end of a sentence, but the task is not all that simple.

This is an open ended challenge to which there are no perfect solutions. Try to break up given paragraphs into text into individual sentences. Even if you don't manage to segment the text perfectly, the more sentences you identify and display correctly, the more you will score.

Abbreviations: Dr. W. Watson is amazing. In this case, the first and second "." occurs after Dr (Doctor) and W (initial in the person's name) and should not be confused as the end of the sentence.

Sentences enclosed in quotes: "What good are they? They're led about just for show!" remarked another. All of this, should be identified as just one sentence.

Questions and exclamations: Who is it? -This is a question. This should be identified as a sentence. I am tired!: Something which has been exclaimed. This should also be identified as a sentence.

INPUT FORMAT

You will be given a chunk of text, containing several sentences, questions, statements and exclamations- all in 1 line.

Constraints

Number of characters in every input does not exceed 10000.
Number of words in every input does not exceed 1000. There will be more than 1 sentence in each input and this number does not exceed 30.
There will be more than 2 characters in every expected sentence and this number does not exceed 10000. There will be more than 2 characters in every test file and this number does not exceed 10000.

OUTPUT FORMAT

You will split the chunk of text into sentences, and display one sentence per line.

SAMPLE INPUT

In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master of the principal lodge. Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged, particularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierre's observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank, and of whom there were very many in the lodge.Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry, at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles. And so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order.What is to be done in these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow everything, repel force by force?No! We are very far from that. Every violent reform deserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no violence. "But what is there in running across it like that?" said Ilagin's groom. "Once she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take it," Ilagin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop and his excitement.

Add color support to Windows console output, properly

This adds color support to the output of the console on Windows. Now if
you're using Windows 10 build 1511 or later (I think it's build 1511
anyway; they added more VT sequence support in later versions), you will
see colors by default. This isn't due to Windows helping in any way;
this commit has to specifically enable it with SetConsoleMode() because
by default, Windows won't enable color support unless we enable it. (Or
if it's enabled in the registry, but having to go through the registry
to enable basic shit like that is completely fucking stupid.)

I tested this in my Windows 10 virtual machine and it's completely
working.

Use pipewire (not pulseaudio)

This fixes a persistent bug where if you tried to change volume while vlc was playing a video, sometimes (often!) pulseaudio would just crash.
pulseaudio would restart, but the already-open vlc would never make noises again.
To fix it you had to close and reopen vlc.

    pulseaudio:
    orc_code_region_allocate_codemem():
    Failed to create write and exec mmap regions.
    This is probably because SELinux execmem check is enabled (good) and $TMPDIR and $HOME are mounted noexec (bad).

Mike found that this is because Debian pipewire is compiled with --enable-orc.
That is https://github.com/GStreamer/orc and what it does is create new executables at runtime like
/tmp/orcexec.XXXXXX or /run/user/1000/orcexec.XXXXXX or ~/orcexec.XXXXXX
This is obviously banned on PrisonPC -- all user-writable areas are mounted -o noexec precisely to defeat this class of attack.

We probably could have solved this by recompiling pulseaudio with ./configure --disable-orc.

    https://sources.debian.org/src/pulseaudio/14.2-2/debian/control/#L26

However, we already had pipewire ready to go, and
we planned to switch to pipewire permanently in Debian 12.

The only reason to stick with pulseaudio for Debian 11 was that this commit is long and yukky.
But given that it fixes and actual user-visible and SUPER ANNOYING bug, fuck it, pipewire TODAY.

PS: pipewire does not use orc at all; it's not even in the codebase.

Pre-exam pooing

- As was always the intention, but I just hadn't bothered fixing it, the 8-direction enemies now don't change their firing angle based on where you are (meaning there's always safe positions at specific angles to the guys)
- 4-dir and 8-dir enemies now shoot slower.
- Stats on the UI are now rounded reasonably.
- Made it so you die if you're at less than 0.5 HP, cos otherwise it was possible to have like 0.00001 HP and be alive (despite UI saying 0 HP)
- Fixed cursed items giving enemies 2 of the item
- Made cursed items half as common
- The bonus food item now only activates on levels that are multiples of 4 as it used to essentially just be a free double item hack working 2022 no ads.

Simplifies SM damage calculation, tweaks the numbers. (#70347)


About The Pull Request

We apply the damage hardcap individually now, split off the old flat 1.8 into individual caps for heat, moles, and power.

Set it to 1.5 for heat, 1 for mole and 1 for power. This means for most delams it'll be a tad slower! But its possible to make SM delam nearly twice as fast if you combine all 3. (3.5). Be pretty hard tho.

Set the heat healing to -1 so you can counteract one factor at most (except heat since you'll never get both heat healing and heat damage at the same time anyway).

I'm not hell bent on any of the numbers, just picked round even ones and ones that i think will make sense. If you want them changed lmk.

Got rid of the cascade mole and power multipliers since there's probably like three people that are aware that it even exists. Ideally we just add another entry to the CIMS but its already pretty crowded. Figured nobody is gonna miss it anyway? Sorry ghil.

Got rid of the moles multiplier thing since its nicer to keep the temp damage fully based on temp damage instead of adding another multiplier. I just applied the .25 to the damage flatly, meaning it slows down delams again!

And some space exposure stuff: #70347 (comment)
Why It's Good For The Game

Hardcap: Discrete, less randomly interconnected factors are easier to present and remember. The calculation procs are also made to be additive so we had to hack a bit and do some rescaling to accomodate the old behavior in my original PR #69240. Can remove the hack if this pr goes through.

Cascade and mole multiplier: The rest are just getting rid of underutilized factors so we have a cleaner behavior to maintain, present, and understand. (In a perfect world modifiers that aren't visible to the players shouldn't have been merged in the first place smh smh)
Changelog

🆑
fix: Fixed sm space exposure damage going through walls
del: got rid of the molar multiplier for sm heating damage. It will now only impact molar damage and temp limit. We apply the lowest value directly so this slows down sm delams a tiny bit.
del: got rid of cascades making sm delam at 450 moles and 1250 mev. It delams normally now.
balance: Applied the sm damage hardcap of 1.8 individually to heat (1.5), moles (1), power (1). Meaning most sm delams are slower now, but the really bad ones can be faster.
balance: Halved sm temp healing across the board. Temp limits are still the same though so you shouldn't notice it that much.
balance: Halved SM power damage across the board.
balance: Changed sm space exposure damage to just check for the current tile and adjacent atmos connected tiles.

branch: gracefully handle '-d' on orphan HEAD

When deleting a branch, "git branch -d" has a safety check that ensures
the branch is merged to its upstream (if any), or to HEAD. To do that,
naturally we try to resolve HEAD to a commit object. If we're on an
orphan branch (i.e., HEAD points to a branch that does not yet exist),
that will fail, and we'll bail with an error:

  $ git branch -d to-delete
  fatal: Couldn't look up commit object for HEAD

This usually isn't that big of a deal. The deletion would fail anyway,
since the branch isn't merged to HEAD, and you'd need to use "-D" (or
"-f"). And doing so skips the HEAD resolution, courtesy of 67affd5173
(git-branch -D: make it work even when on a yet-to-be-born branch,
2006-11-24).

But there are still two problems:

  1. The error message isn't very helpful. We should give the usual "not
     fully merged" message, which points the user at "branch -D". That
     was a problem even back in 67affd5173.

  2. Even without a HEAD, these days it's still possible for the
     deletion to succeed. After 67affd5173, commit 99c419c915 (branch
     -d: base the "already-merged" safety on the branch it merges with,
     2009-12-29) made it OK to delete a branch if it is merged to its
     upstream.

We can fix both by removing the die() in delete_branches() completely,
leaving head_rev NULL in this case. It's tempting to stop there, as it
appears at first glance that the rest of the code does the right thing
with a NULL. But sadly, it's not quite true.

We end up feeding the NULL to repo_is_descendant_of(). In the
traditional code path there, we call repo_in_merge_bases_many(). It
feeds the NULL to repo_parse_commit(), which is smart enough to return
an error, and we immediately return "no, it's not a descendant".

But there's an alternate code path: if we have a commit graph with
generation numbers, we end up in can_all_from_reach(), which does
eventually try to set a flag on the NULL commit and segfaults.

So instead, we'll teach the local branch_merged() helper to treat a NULL
as "not merged". This would be a little more elegant in in_merge_bases()
itself, but that function is called in a lot of places, and it's not
clear that quietly returning "not merged" is the right thing everywhere
(I'd expect in many cases, feeding a NULL is a sign of a bug).

There are four tests here:

  a. The first one confirms that deletion succeeds with an orphaned HEAD
     when the branch is merged to its upstream. This is case (2) above.

  b. Same, but with commit graphs enabled. Even if it is merged to
     upstream, we still check head_rev so that we can say "deleting
     because it's merged to upstream, even though it's not merged to
     HEAD". Without the second hunk in branch_merged(), this test would
     segfault in can_all_from_reach().

  c. The third one confirms that we correctly say "not merged to HEAD"
     when we can't resolve HEAD, and reject the deletion.

  d. Same, but with commit graphs enabled. Without the first hunk in
     branch_merged(), this one would segfault.

maybe_send_to_registration: Don't reuse pre-existing PreregistraionUser.

There was the following bug here:
1. Send an email invite to a user.
2. Have the user sign up via social auth without going through that
   invite, meaning either going via a multiuse invite link or just
   straight-up Sign up if the org permissions allow.

That resulted in the PreregistrationUser that got generated in step (1)
having 2 Confirmations tied to it - because maybe_send_to_registration
grabbed the object and created a new confirmation link for it. That is a
corrupted state, Confirmation is supposed to be unique.

One could try to do fancy things with checking whether a
PreregistrationUser already have a Confirmation link, but to avoid races
between ConfirmationEmailWorker and maybe_send_to_registration, this
would require taking locks and so on - which gets needlessly
complicated. It's simpler to not have them compete for the same object.

The point of the PreregistrationUser re-use in
maybe_send_to_registration is that if an admin invites a user, setting
their initial streams and role, it'd be an annoying experience if the
user ends up signing up not via the invite and those initial streams
streams etc. don't get set up. But to handle this, we can just copy the
relevant values from the pre-existing prereg_user, rather than re-using
the object itself.

xorcism: remove rstest dependency (#1590)

rstest uses proc macros, which make the tests timeout due to long
compile times. Replace rstest with a custom declarative macro.

Brings test time from 7.5 seconds to 0.8 seconds on my machine.

Drawbacks:
* more indentation
* module structure of tests is flipped around

both of those seem minor to me. 

Although declarative macros can be hard to read for those unfamiliar, 
that was already somewhat the case with rstest's magic in my opinion. So
I personally don't think it's worse in terms of the students being able to
understand the tests.

The only other alternative I see is to disable the online tests 
altogether and leave a note about that in the exercise description. That
probably wouldn't be that bad, since people solving this hard exercise
most likely have a solid local setup. But it would still be cool to run
the tests online as well.

Support Node 14 (again) (#1112)

It appears that between 0.16.0 and 0.16.1, the minimum version of Node required
to use this package changed, from 14.x to 16.x. This was not explicit but seems
to have been caused by a couple of factors.

But first, what changed. If you look at `src/error.ts` in 0.16.0 you will see
[this line][1]:

```
return (cached ??= [failure, ...failures()])
```

In the [published version of this file in 0.16.0][2] this gets transpiled to:

```
return (_cached = cached) != null ? _cached : cached = [failure, ...failures()];
```

In 0.16.1, the [original line is unchanged][3], but in the [published
version][4] it is transpiled to:

```
return cached ??= [failure, ...failures()];
```

The `??=` syntax is not supported by Node 14, hence, developers are forced to
upgrade to at least Node 16 if they want to use v0.16.1 or greater.

After looking at the diff between these two versions and running some
experiments, I believe that there are two reasons why this line shows up
differently in these two published versions.

1. Different Node versions were used to build and publish these versions. It
appears that Node 14 was used for the former whereas Node 16 was used for the
latter. This assertion is supported by the fact that in the [Rollup
configuration][5], `@babel/preset-env` is configured with `node: true`, which
instructs Babel to [use the current version of Node as a target][6]. So if the
current Node version changes, so does the Babel config.
2. Between 0.16.0 and 0.16.1, [`browserslist` was updated from 4.20.3, to
4.21.4][7] (you will probably need to expand `yarn.lock`; if so, Cmd-F for
"browserslist"). In `browserslist` 4.21.0, [IE 11 was removed from the default
set of browsers][8] (which is being used in this case, since no explicit list is
provided). According to caniuse, [IE 11 does not support the `??=` syntax][9],
so its removal means that Babel doesn't need to transpile this syntax any
longer.

To address this problem, this PR:

* changes the Rollup configuration mentioned above to use `node: "14.0"` instead
of `node: true`, so that Node 14 is always used to compute the transpilation
rules regardless of the version of Node used locally to build and publish the
package
* updates the CI workflow to ensure that Node 14 is being tested (along with 16
and 18)
* adds Node >= 14 to the `engines` field to communicate that it is supported

---

One thing you may wonder is why this change is needed at all. Node 16 is the
current LTS, so shouldn't that be enough? True, but Node 14 hasn't hit
end-of-life yet, and many people are still using it, including my company. We
think this package is really great, but it would be even better if we didn't
have to have a workaround for our libraries that we still want to keep on Node
14.

Thanks for considering :)

## About The Pull Request

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->
Adds a huge ass crowbar to robotics (the mech removal tool), it deals 5
damage unwielded, or 19 wielded. (should be fine, considering robotics
also has the easiest access to the materials needed for a chainsaw)
You can use it while wielded on mechs to break the occupants out. This
takes 5 seconds (or 3 in an unenclosed mech like a ripley)
When you die in a mech you no longer automatically get ejected.
refactors fire axe cabinets to support more items than the fireaxe
makes some vehicle code better
closes #70845 (you can still enter a mech without limbs, i think thats
fine because you can use it to protect yourself from death in a
dangerous situation or something until someone breaks you out with the
really large crowbar)

Record dependencies of a cast on other casts that it requires.

When creating a cast that uses a conversion function, we've
historically allowed the input and result types to be
binary-compatible with the function's input and result types,
rather than necessarily being identical.  This means that the new
cast is logically dependent on the binary-compatible cast or casts
that it references: if those are defined by pg_cast entries, and you
try to restore the new cast without having defined them, it'll fail.
Hence, we should make pg_depend entries to record these dependencies
so that pg_dump knows that there is an ordering requirement.

This is not the only place where we allow such shortcuts; aggregate
functions for example are similarly lax, and in principle should gain
similar dependencies.  However, for now it seems sufficient to fix
the cast-versus-cast case, as pg_dump's other ordering heuristics
should keep it out of trouble for other object types.

Per report from David Turoň; thanks also to Robert Haas for
preliminary investigation.  I considered back-patching, but
seeing that this issue has existed for many years without
previous reports, it's not clear it's worth the trouble.
Moreover, back-patching wouldn't be enough to ensure that the
new pg_depend entries exist in existing databases anyway.

This is faster, if in theory more fragile. We should be safe since any
errors should be caught in compile since this is very close to a
"static" action. It does mean these atoms cannot use signals, etc.

* Potentially saves init time, mostly cleans up a silly pattern

We use sleeps and INVOKE_ASYNC to ensure that handing back turfs doesn't
block a space reservation, but this by nature consumes up to the
threshold and a bit more of whatever working block we were in.

This is silly. Should just be a subsystem, so I made it one, with
support for awaiting its finish if you want to

* Optimizes garbage/proc/Queue slightly

Queue takes about 1.6 seconds to process 26k items right now.
The MASSIVE majority of this time is spent on using \ref
This is because \ref returns a string, and that string requires being
inserted into the global cache of strings we store

What I'm doing is caching the result of ANY \ref on the datum it's
applied to. This ensures previous uses will never decay from the string
tree.

This saves about 0.2 seconds of init
