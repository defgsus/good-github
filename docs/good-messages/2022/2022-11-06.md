Slightly optimizes reagent splashing (#70709)

* Slightly optimizes reagent splashing

Ok so like, before, splashing a reagent performed a rudimentary
floodfill based off atmos connectivity.

This was really slow, because it did it using orange(), and repeated
orange()s to cut out JUST the rim, because we
needed to ensure things were ordered.

I've changed this to use floodfill. I've also moved some code that was
in a second loop into the first one, and replaced a repeated in check
with a single use of &

This is still not optimal for large ranges, because we filter by connectivity first
and THEN view, but it's faster for smaller ones.

BTW I'm also capping the max spread range at 40x40 tiles. If you want
more then 1600 you can rot in hell.

This takes the (uncapped range) cost of deconstructing a highcap tank
from 40 seconds to 0.16.

I hate this codebase

* god damn it

Builds logic that manages turfs contained inside an area (#70966)

## About The Pull Request

Area contents isn't a real list, instead it involves filtering
everything in world
This is slow, and something we should have better support for.

So instead, lets manage a list of turfs inside our area. This is simple,
since we already move turfs by area contents anyway

This should speed up the uses I've found, and opens us up to using this
pattern more often, which should make dev work easier.

By nature this is a tad fragile, so I've added a unit test to double
check my work

Rather then instantly removing turfs from the contained_turfs list, we
enter them into a list of turfs to pull out, later.
Then we just use a getter for contained_turfs rather then a var read

This means we don't need to generate a lot of usage off removing turf by
turf from space, and can instead do it only when we need to

I've added a subsystem to manage this process as well, to ensure we
don't get any out of memory errors. It goes entry by entry, ensuring we
get no overtime.
This allows me to keep things like space clean, while keeping high
amounts of usage on a sepearate subsystem when convienient

As a part of this goal of keeping space's churn as low as possible, I've
setup code to ensure we do not add turfs to areas during a z level
increment adjacent mapload. this saves a LOT of time, but is a tad
messy

I've expanded where we use contained_turfs, including into some cases
that filter for objects in areas. need to see if this is sane or not.

Builds sortedAreas on demand, caching until we mark the cache as
violated

It's faster, and it also has the same behavior

I'm not posting speed changes cause frankly they're gonna be a bit
scattered and I'm scared to.
@Mothblocks if you'd like I can look into it. I think it'll pay for
itself just off `reg_in_areas_in_z` (I looked into it. it's really hard
to tell, sometimes it's a bit slower (0.7), sometimes it's 2 seconds
(0.5 if you use the old master figure) faster. life is pain.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Less stupid, more flexible, more speed

[MIRROR] Simplifies SM damage calculation, tweaks the numbers. [MDB IGNORE] (#16733)

* Simplifies SM damage calculation, tweaks the numbers. (#70347)

About The Pull Request

We apply the damage hardcap individually now, split off the old flat 1.8 into individual caps for heat, moles, and power.

Set it to 1.5 for heat, 1 for mole and 1 for power. This means for most delams it'll be a tad slower! But its possible to make SM delam nearly twice as fast if you combine all 3. (3.5). Be pretty hard tho.

Set the heat healing to -1 so you can counteract one factor at most (except heat since you'll never get both heat healing and heat damage at the same time anyway).

I'm not hell bent on any of the numbers, just picked round even ones and ones that i think will make sense. If you want them changed lmk.

Got rid of the cascade mole and power multipliers since there's probably like three people that are aware that it even exists. Ideally we just add another entry to the CIMS but its already pretty crowded. Figured nobody is gonna miss it anyway? Sorry ghil.

Got rid of the moles multiplier thing since its nicer to keep the temp damage fully based on temp damage instead of adding another multiplier. I just applied the .25 to the damage flatly, meaning it slows down delams again!

And some space exposure stuff: #70347 (comment)
Why It's Good For The Game

Hardcap: Discrete, less randomly interconnected factors are easier to present and remember. The calculation procs are also made to be additive so we had to hack a bit and do some rescaling to accomodate the old behavior in my original PR #69240. Can remove the hack if this pr goes through.

Cascade and mole multiplier: The rest are just getting rid of underutilized factors so we have a cleaner behavior to maintain, present, and understand. (In a perfect world modifiers that aren't visible to the players shouldn't have been merged in the first place smh smh)
Changelog

🆑
fix: Fixed sm space exposure damage going through walls
del: got rid of the molar multiplier for sm heating damage. It will now only impact molar damage and temp limit. We apply the lowest value directly so this slows down sm delams a tiny bit.
del: got rid of cascades making sm delam at 450 moles and 1250 mev. It delams normally now.
balance: Applied the sm damage hardcap of 1.8 individually to heat (1.5), moles (1), power (1). Meaning most sm delams are slower now, but the really bad ones can be faster.
balance: Halved sm temp healing across the board. Temp limits are still the same though so you shouldn't notice it that much.
balance: Halved SM power damage across the board.
balance: Changed sm space exposure damage to just check for the current tile and adjacent atmos connected tiles.

working recursive command parser

inputted scheduler commands are recursively parsed by popping off the top of each command list and executing any remaining commands

this allows one to write strings such as degree, computer science, print, fulfillment, add, 1, dat str
and the program will execute each command one by one as if they were typed separately.

currently uses a lock to prevent simultaneous command execution but you need to remember to unlock it prior to every return statement which is probably a pain in the ass so I'll have to figure something out.

[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

    core: Refactor Pixel features

    * Magic Eraser is wonky and hard to
      enable and all this mess isn't really worth
      the trouble so just stick to the older setup.

    * Default Pixel 5 spoof for Photos and only switch
      to Pixel XL when spoof is toggled.

    * We will try to bypass 2021 features and Raven
      props for non-Pixel 2021 devices as apps usage
      requires TPU.

    * Remove P21 experience system feature check

[SDK][CMLIB] Implement log transaction writes & Resuscitation

=== DOCUMENTATION REMARKS ===

This implements (also enables some parts of code been decayed for years) the transacted writing of the registry. Transacted writing (or writing into registry in a transactional way) is an operation that ensures the successfulness can be achieved by monitoring two main points.
In CMLIB, such points are what we internally call them the primary and secondary sequences. A sequence is a numeric field that is incremented each time a writing operation (namely done with the FileWrite function and such) has successfully completed.

The primary sequence is incremented to suggest that the initial work of syncing the registry is in progress. During this phase, the base block header is written into the primary hive file and registry data is being written to said file in form of blocks. Afterwards the seconady sequence
is increment to report completion of the transactional writing of the registry. This operation occurs in HvpWriteHive function (invoked by HvSyncHive for syncing). If the transactional writing fails or if the lazy flushing of the registry fails, LOG files come into play.

Like HvpWriteHive, LOGs are updated by the HvpWriteLog which writes dirty data (base block header included) to the LOG themselves. These files serve for recovery and emergency purposes in case the primary machine hive has been damaged due to previous forced interruption of writing stuff into
the registry hive. With specific recovery algorithms, the data that's been gathered from a LOG will be applied to the primary hive, salvaging it. But if a LOG file is corrupt as well, then the system will perform resuscitation techniques by reconstructing the base block header to reasonable values,
reset the registry signature and whatnot.

This work is an inspiration from PR #3932 by mrmks04 (aka Max Korostil). I have continued his work by doing some more tweaks and whatnot. In addition to that, the whole transaction writing code is documented.

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===

HvpWriteLog -- Currently this function lacks the ability to grow the log file size since we pretty much lack the necessary code that deals with hive shrinking and log shrinking/growing as well. This part is not super critical for us so this shall be left as a TODO for future.

HvLoadHive -- Currently there's a hack that prevents us from refactoring this function in a proper way. That is, we should not be reading the whole and prepare the hive storage using HvpInitializeMemoryHive which is strictly used for HINIT_MEMORY but rather we must read the hive file block by block
and deconstruct the read buffer from the file so that we can get the bins that we read from the file. With the hive bins we got the hive storage will be prepared based on such bins. If one of the bins is corrupt, self healing is applied in such scenario.

For this matter, if in any case the hive we'll be reading is corrupt we could potentially read corrupt data and lead the system into failure. So we have to perform header and data recovery as well before reading the whole hive.

canUseTopic now uses TRUE/FALSE instead of defines that just say TRUE (#69790)

* canUseTopic now uses TRUE/FALSE instead of defines that just say TRUE

The most idiotic thing I've seen is canUseTopic's defines, they literally just define TRUE, you can use it however you want, it doesn't matter, it just means TRUE. You can mix and match the args and it will set that arg to true, despite the name.

It's so idiotic I decided to remove it, so now I can reclaim a little bit of my sanity.

gpiolib: acpi: use correct format characters

[ Upstream commit 213d266ebfb1621aab79cfe63388facc520a1381 ]

When compiling with -Wformat, clang emits the following warning:

  gpiolib-acpi.c:393:4: warning: format specifies type 'unsigned char' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]
                        pin);
                        ^~~

So warning that '%hhX' is paired with an 'int' is all just completely
mindless and wrong. Sadly, I can see a different bogus warning reason
why people would want to use '%02hhX'.

Again, the *sane* thing from a human perspective is to use '%02X. But
if the compiler doesn't do any range analysis at all, it could decide
that "Oh, that print format could need up to 8 bytes of space in the
result". Using '%02hhX' would cut that down to two.

And since we use

        char ev_name[5];

and currently use "_%c%02hhX" as the format string, even a compiler
that doesn't notice that "pin <= 255" test that guards this all will
go "OK, that's at most 4 bytes and the final NUL termination, so it's
fine".

While a compiler - like gcc - that only sees that the original source
of the 'pin' value is a 'unsigned short' array, and then doesn't take
the "pin <= 255" into account, will warn like this:

  gpiolib-acpi.c: In function 'acpi_gpiochip_request_interrupt':
  gpiolib-acpi.c:206:24: warning: '%02X' directive writing between 2 and 4 bytes into a region of size 3 [-Wformat-overflow=]
       sprintf(ev_name, "_%c%02X",
                            ^~~~
  gpiolib-acpi.c:206:20: note: directive argument in the range [0, 65535]

because gcc isn't being very good at that argument range analysis either.

In other words, the original use of 'hhx' was bogus to begin with, and
due to *another* compiler warning being bad, and we had that bad code
being written back in 2016 to work around _that_ compiler warning
(commit e40a3ae1f794: "gpio: acpi: work around false-positive
-Wstring-overflow warning").

Sadly, two different bad compiler warnings together does not make for
one good one.

It just makes for even more pain.

End result: I think the simplest and cleanest option is simply the
proposed change which undoes that '%hhX' change for gcc, and replaces
it with just using a slightly bigger stack allocation. It's not like
a 5-byte allocation is in any way likely to have saved any actual stack,
since all the other variables in that function are 'int' or bigger.

False-positive compiler warnings really do make people write worse
code, and that's a problem. But on a scale of bad code, I feel that
extending the buffer trivially is better than adding a pointless cast
that literally makes no sense.

At least in this case the end result isn't unreadable or buggy. We've
had several cases of bad compiler warnings that caused changes that
were actually horrendously wrong.

Make hooks use exceptions on error rather than bool returns

bool returns suck in general, but in most cases here they are also a
pain in the ass because *each* place that returns false is also issuing
a log statement.  If only there were a way to return error information
to the common caller to have the common caller handle it... oh wait,
there is!

Brimdemons & Lobstrosities drop (slightly) useful organs (#70546)



Goliaths, Legions, Watchers, and (as of recently) Bileworms all drop
something vaguely useful when they die.
Brimdemons and Lobstrosities do not. This PR aims to fix that, so that
there's at least some vague benefit to hunting them.

In this case it takes the form of organs you get when you butcher them,
similar to the regenerative core from Legions.
As they're similar to the regenerative core, I modified the regenerative
core to extend from a new common "monster core" typepath which these two
new organs also extend.
Like the regenerative core, both of these items do something when used
and something slightly different if you go to the effort of having
someone implant them into your body. They also decay over time, and you
can use stabilising serum to prevent this from happening.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967746-55a7d04d-224e-412d-aedc-3a0ec754db3d.mp4

The Rush Gland from the Lobstrosity lets you do a little impression of
their charging attack, making you run very fast for a handful of seconds
and ignoring slowdown effects. Unlike a lobstrosity you aren't actually
built to do this so if you run into a mob you will fall over, and if you
are doing this on the space station running into any dense object will
also make you fall over (it shouldn't make you _too_ much of a pain for
security to catch).
The idea here is that you use this to save time running back and forth
from the mining base.

The Brimdust Sac from the Brimdemon covers you in exploding dust. The
next three times you take Brute damage some of the dust will explode,
dealing damage equal to an unupgraded PKA shot to anything near you (but
not you).
If you do this in a space station not only is the damage proportionally
lower (still matching the PKA), but it _does_ effect you and also it
sets you on fire. You can remove the buff by showering it off.
The idea here is that you use this for minor revenge damage on enemies
whose attacks you don't manage to dodge.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967811-0b362ba9-2da0-42ac-bd55-3809473cbc74.mp4

If you implant the Rush Gland then you can use it once every 3 minutes
without consuming it, and the buff lasts very slightly longer. It will
automatically trigger itself if your health gets low, which might be
good (helps you escape a rough situation) or bad (didn't want to use it
yet).


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967888-f63f7cbd-60cd-4309-8004-203afc5b2153.mp4

If you implant the Brimdust Sac then you can use it once every 3 minutes
to shake off cloud of dust which gives the buff to everyone nearby, if
you want to kit out your miner squad. The dust cloud also makes you
cough if you stand in it, and it's opaque. If you catch fire with this
organ inside you and aren't in mining atmosphere then it will explode
inside of your abdomen, which should probably be avoided, resultingly it
is very risky to use this on the space station.

being able to view and compare all libraries from a centralized place is one of the main benefits of package managers. just being able to search "websocket" for example. I imagine jai could work without a real package manager but I think something to solve the problem of information centralization would still be necessary psdrndm — Today at 00:56 A searchable list of modules can be just that without all the negatives of a package manager MisterSkeltal — Today at 00:59 As soon as you have a searchable list of modules, you can run a script to download them, and then that list becomes a package manager, so I don't understand this comment. Maybe it doesn't do semantic versioning or whatever but that's an ancillary detail farzher — Today at 01:00 atm, sharing / using jai libraries is a huge mess that needs some solution. most installation instructions are: "download this code, rename the folder to JSON, and paste it into jai/modules directory" "oh and btw this code depends on the unicode_utils module, so do the same for that too" most people don't even store local copies because it's a bit too much effort to copy them everywhere manually, also then you're forced to use -import_dir or a metaprogram MisterSkeltal — Today at 01:02 JaIDE solves this farzher — Today at 01:02 if jai included -import_dir ./modules by default that'd be very useful, but still not enough psdrndm — Today at 01:20 I think there are more things than a list and a script to download items for it that are implicit in a thing called “package manager,” but maybe that’s just me Kuju — Today at 01:22 if youre arguing for no centralized management of repos at all itll just turn into the cpp free for all hellscape I thought at least it would be pretty agreed upon that the current method of download this repo and the dependencies and put them in the modules folder, isnt ideal MisterSkeltal — Today at 01:24 I am not arguing for that, I'm saying that the suggestion of "you don't need a package manager if you can look up code in a centralized location" is practically a package manager I agree that a package manager could be useful Kuju — Today at 01:27 ah thats not my preference. it feels like an awkward middle ground to me. I was adding onto what @psdrndm said that in the scenario described a searchable repo list is still a bonus (at the very least) almost feels like this whole discussion should be in syntax-suggestions or something :cool_think: MisterSkeltal — Today at 01:31 No, like, if you have a "searchable repo list" or whatever, and that searchable repo list has a canonical location of the source code of that repo, then someone can make a metaprogram which searches the repo list and downloads the source, recursing as necessary, and boom you have a package manager. It would probably be a good idea to have a package manager that is a bit better than this, because this is what will become the "package manager" once you have a repo list. I'm not a package manager expert, but I feel like this isn't going to be a good approach. It's likely just going to be like the current situation, but slightly more automated. ("but that's just all package managers!" har har) Andrew the hacker — Today at 04:07 Maybe it would be better to have the package manager integrated with version control rather than with the language. Something like a better version of git sub modules. So the language can stay agnostic to where any modules came from, and you don’t have two systems doing two layers of fetching and versioning.

Rocket Shrapnel & Other
- - -
New:
 - Rockets are now their own subclass of projectile, encompassing not just rockets, even though it's weird to say that and kinda wacky, but also grenade launcher projectiles.
 - Rocket classed projectiles can now have shrapnel magnitude and type attributed to them, permitting explosions identical to frag grenades on impact with their selected shrapnel and magnitude.
- - -
Balance:
 - A singular incendiary rocket replaces the high-yield HE round that the NCR Combat Engineer previously got in the rocket kit.
 - Chemical rockets are now absurdly powerful, to compensate for their otherwise useless nature. We'll probably adjust this as needed, if not outright nerf it again.
 - Chemical rockets can be made, but they're a PITA to craft and are likely to be more trouble than they're worth.
 - A singular unit of FEV is enough to OD someone. It's FEV. Stop drinking it.

That was... a long battle,
BUT a successful one at last
However there were sacrifices leading to victory
I lost my sanity, mental fortitude, belief in God, and don't know what else
And patryk ... I don;t know what he lost but something for sure
I don't want to do this ever again
So if docker breaks you know who not to call
Or better yet... I don't know I just wanted to white Or better yet
A think I am losing scraps that where left of my sanity
For your information this entire poem was written and spellchecked during build process in docker compose
I don't even remember why I stared writing it, but I have no plan to end for now
I am now starting to consider if it got stuck or time got dilated for me to write my maybe final maybe not masterpiece that will show my suffering which you can't imagine.
As I continue my OH my god it unstuck, So what I was at, ah I remember, I was tunneling my suffering and if you are still reading it then you to need to visit a doctor because it is not normal for people to be able to read this.
The build process is going and going, and I am still wandering if it will finish or crash , if it crashes I am not sure if I have a strength to suffer throughout repairing it That That That is jus too much for mortal or even immortal or God himself that is just too much
Why the hell am I even continuing to write this beautiful yet pointless poem, that brings pain and no there is no and it is just pain.
That build process is still running and i think it is close to an end. ......... it........ is ....... an ...................... (.*1000) freaking.......... er....r....o......r, but wait is just a copy. I fixed it? or did I?
WHY THE HELL IT IS GOING FROM THE DAEM BEGINIGN. FGEDGSDGDSG. OK lest freaking chill out that is just another few paintful INCRWDABLE PAITEFUL MUTNITED THAT YOU NEDD TO ENDURE. ... ....

Changed Supermatter Internal Math + UI Additions (#69240)

Basically all what I'm doing is categorize and display whatever modifiers are currently applying to the SM. This way players can see powerloss, temperature generation, damage taking, temp limit adjustment etc all in live instead of diving code or looking it up in the wiki.

I have taken the liberty of making most of these modifiers additive instead of multiplicative since it's easier to illustrate how much a given modifier is doing when they are all additive. E.G: The gas you added gave you an extra 2500 joules instead of the gas you added gave you a 1.2x multiplier.

To make this job not CBT there are a few gameplay changes that are needed to make things fall into the framework and some general cleanup. Most noteworthy might be:

    Space damage taking (opted for 

SM damage and balance #66692 instead of SM can explode on space tiles again #35275 just because it's newer. Wont mind changing if asked). Also removed the power gen see the edit in
Changed Supermatter Internal Math + UI Additions #69240 (comment). Wont mind bringing it back and tweaking if asked.
SM will now use the same heat limit for everything that once used variations of it. Unified healing temp limit (influenced by psychologist) with damage heat limit (influenced by gases and low moles, yeah that's a thing). In practice this means your rock will heal at higher temps instead of the old one.
Heat output production. See:

    Changed Supermatter Internal Math + UI Additions #69240 (comment) and heat penalty from gases.
    I'm really sorry for tacking this on to this PR, but there's no good way to present the heat output effect of gases to the SM in a way I'm satisfied with if I don't do this. Kinda hard to atomize too since it relies on the cleanup. Rolled back!

Work left:

    Oh and need to make the NTOS things work.
    Ntos Done! Since the active crystal is now deprecated and we use localstate, the notification system got changed a bit. SM will now ping you if you subscribed to it. Only works when minimized and not closed, like the old one.
    Oh and also documentation.
    Think its in an ok spot now.
    Reimplement transmission view and low pressure power bonus. Yeah thats a thing.
    Looks like the low pressure power bonus is actually broken. It evaluates to ~2 for pretty much any x given. So im axing it.
    Reimplement moles doubling heat resistance. Yep thats also a thing.
    Readd the pluox and miasma pressure scaling thing.
    Done, also multiplied the reaction rate by half but multiplied the mole manipulation by 2 for pluox gen. Did this so it's easier to understand.
    Dump shit into the changelog.

Why It's Good For The Game

Future coders will now need to write a bit more code when they want to add another modifier. Meaning it's a tad more rigid if someone wants to go out of the existing framework. Also demands a little bit of math but nothing more than basic algebra.

But on the flipside, this means future coders that want to add a brand new modifier to the SM will need to justify and document it (with only a single string descriptor so its not even that much work). Makes the work of people maintaining the code waaay easier at the expense of feature coders. Also makes whatever change they want to apply be relayed immediately to the players.

I mean jesus christ we didnt even know PN was really good for SM until it's added to the wiki.
Changelog

🆑
del: Removed the broken pressure power multiplier which always evaluates to 2. Multiplied base SM power production by 2.
del: SM will no longer gain power when exposed to space. It actually used to do that, but only when the tile it's on has gas so you don't really notice it.
qol: added the factor breakdowns to the SM ui.
qol: added the gas effect breakdowns to the SM ui.
qol: Made the supermatter selection in NT CIMS ui frontend based. Notifications will be based on you pressing the bell button instead of opening a SM page.
code: Instead of showing the environment breakdown of the SM tile, the NT CIMS will show you the exact gas mixture that it uses for calculation.
code: Total moles in NT CIMS will now be substituted with absorbed moles, which is the thing we use to calculate scrung delams. Scrungs at 1800.
balance: Unified the SM taking damage on space (last modified 2018) with SM taking damage around space (added 2020, last modified 2022). Chose the latter formula, it's significantly stronger.
balance: SM will start healing at the same damage at which it stops taking heat damage. Instead of the old fixed healing at ~313K.
balance: made the low mole heat resistance thing on SM not scale with heat resistant gases.
balance: Made the supermatter temperature power gain multiplier thing linear at 1/6 instead of 50/273 or 30/273.
balance: Psychologist heat reduction is weaker on high heat gas.
refactor: rerouted how external damage (bullets) and external power (emitter) is applied to SM.
refactor: restructured the internal power calculations for SM. Power should be applied on each atmos tick instead of separately.
refactor: restructured how the SM calculates the damage that it takes. No changes expected except for the low mole temp limit multiplier thing.
refactor: Restructured SM pluox generation and miasma consumption. No changes expected though.

[FIX] website, *: allow to re-edit company team snippet images

*: website_sale

Since [1], it was not possible to edit a company team snippet image
anymore as soon as the page was saved once. Indeed that commit added
o_not_editable/contenteditable="false" on the parent column to make sure
no text can be added in that column and contenteditable="true" on the
images so that they are still editable (even though HTML-specs-wise
adding contenteditable="true" on images probably does not mean much as
images are self-closing tags, our editor understand that as the ability
to edit the image anyway). That contenteditable="true" part is however
removed when leaving edit mode... and was not restored upon entering
edit mode again.

This fixes the problems with a specific JS patch, we'll review to see if
better can be done in master.

Funny enough, that bug was actually gone in 15.0... by mistake. A recent
bug fix actually reintroduced that isolated bug at [2] (by reintroducing
the fact that images in a non-editable environment are not possible to
edit). The 3 opened tickets this commit mentions were actually reported
for 15.0 immediately after that, while the 14.0 being broken about this
since the beginning apparently did not bother anyone.

Note: as a forward-ported fix, this also takes the opportunity to clean
a bit what was done at [3]. (calling `_super`, no duplicated code,
adding comments, ...).

Pneumonia, or lung infection, is a viral disease that affects lung tissue and interferes with the
normal oxygen exchange between air and blood. Inflammatory secretions that enter the air sacs of
the lungs do not allow the body to properly supply oxygen. And when the disease grabs most of the
lungs, acute respiratory failure develops. Pneumonia affects people with weak immunity, children
and the elderly. In Germany alone, 1.5 million people get the disease each year, 30% of whom are
infants and people over the age of 70. But pneumonia can be treated and needs to be treated! And
it’s a good idea to do this with an integrated approach. Treatment of the disease begins with a
correct diagnosis. Therefore, seek expert advice at the first signs of pathological development.Learn
what the first symptoms of pneumonia are, how to properly and comprehensively treat them, and
what you need to do to diagnose the disease. ## What is the aim of this notebook? I was hired
by a ”Medtronic” as a Data Scientist. Medtronic is a company that produces medical equipment
that ease the life of doctors by digital solutions. In July we start to develop a x-ray machine that
will be able to detect pneumonia. Now we are trying to develop a machine that makes the x-ray
and gives a diagnosis at the same time. By doing so we are planning to eliminate a human factor.

im depressed and exerting this small amount of power is the only control i have left in my life.
im joking but i do just want to have a completely plain, link-tree styled site with a short About section. it is harder than you would think to find something like this, especially with severely limited web design/dev knowledge - that I even got jekyll working in the first place is a miracle.

I think i'll still do blogs again in the future but they'll be on a specific platform like Medium where there's some hope of them being seen.

Refactoring summary list for each service (#8)

https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-team/issues/54

We wanted to make the layout for each repo consistent and relate things like jobs to the service they belong to. We then decided we'd report on 'apps' rather than just 'repos', as that is what is running on a server and which 'the service' is dependent on.

We tidied up the external services section, including adding the Charge Module API which we'd, though not in the existing /service-status page, should be. We also got them to return meaningful information.

All the calls for info are now robust. Even if all the other apps and external services were down the page would still display.

All this work meant some major refactoring of the `ServiceStatusService()`, for example, a single method for making HTTP requests to the other apps and services.

All of this is tested. To do this we needed to bring in [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) to mock our HTTP requests to the other services and [proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire) to allow us to stub our calls to `child_process.exec()`.

** Thoughts on the current state

Looking at the tests we see a copious amount of work needed to mock web requests and system calls. We also have a range of scenarios. In our opinion, they are telling us that our service is doing _too_ much. It is collecting data from different sources in different ways, which means it definitely doesn't just have a single responsibility.

It needs breaking up, which in turn means we can break up the tests and hopefully make them a damn sight less scary.

We didn't do those changes in this PR though, because we'd already clocked up more than 1000 changes, well beyond our working target of 100. So, we've agreed to merge and tackle the refactoring as a separate exercise.

** Rebuilding the package-lock.json

Because of how long this PR had been around and the fact it adds new dependencies, we ended up having major merge issues in the `package-lock.json`. We went for a 'delete-and-rebuild' approach but we know we shouldn't have 😳 .

Next time we'll endeavour to use `npm install --package-lock-only` which we [recently learned](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/solving-conflicts-in-package-lock-json) is a command added to npm to help rectify the package-lock.json in these 'merge-hell' situations.
