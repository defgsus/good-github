[READY] [KC13] Showing "The Derelict" some love: General updates, aesthetic changes and misc (#67696)

With this PR I aim to make KC13 (TheDerelict.dmm), or Russian Station (whatever you guys call it) a tad bit more flavorful with its environment as well as somethings on the mapping side (like adding area icons!).
To preface, no, I'm not remapping anything here extensively. The general layout should be relatively the same (or should be in theory).

Halfway through naming the area icons I checked the wiki page and found out it was KC not KS, so, its KS13 internally.

Readability for turf icons are cool.
Also just making the ruin more eye appealing would be better.
General cleanup and changes will give new life to this rather.. loved? Hated? Loot pinata? Ruin.
The ruin also now starts completely depowered, like Old Station (its a Derelict, it makes no sense for it to still be powered after so long). As for some mild compensation, a few more batteries were sprinkled in to offset any issues. If there is any concern of "But they'll open the vault faster!", there were always 5 batteries that people used to make the vault SMES.
Lastly, giving it some "visual story telling" is cool, as mapping fluff goes.

I also added a subtle OOC hint that the SMES in the northern most solar room needs a terminal with the following:

SMES Jumpscare
As an aside, I aim to try and keep the feel of this ruin being "dated" while at the same time having some of our newer things. With that, certain things I'll opt out of using in favor of more "generic" structures to give KC13 that true "Its old but not really" feel and look.

Revisiting The Goliath: Or, that time I dripped out the SBC Starfury just because (#68126)

Drips the SHIT out of the SBC Starfury while not completely overhauling it. Touches everything NOT in engineering or southward (because I love how scuffed that part is and refuse to touch it on principle) - Also converts one map varedit into a real boy subtype, and moves tiny fans to their own file.

Mandatory disclosure on the gameplay changes:
Fighters 1 and 3 are now NOT in the hangar, and are now attached to the formerly unused gunnery rooms.
Cryo now works. Yeah. I know.
You can actually open the anesthetic closet now.
Everyone now shares three spawners. This doesn't reduce the amount of people who can play when this rolls, as I've adjusted var/uses in accordance: it just reduces clutter.
A few of the horizontal double airlocks have been compacted into glass_large airlocks.
The bar windows now actually have grilles like they were meant to.
Four turbines have shown up. They aren't functional*, they just look like gunnery and conveniently fit in the spots. I'm sure this is space OSHA compliant.
The map is ever so slightly smaller, vertically. This should distance us from an edge case where somehow all space levels are too cluttered for this to spawn properly, for the time being.

*Technically there's nothing stopping you from using them besides the amount of time it'd take for the operatives to kick your ass

This map was originally designed wayyy back before we even had the computer sprites we have now, (#27760 if you want to see SOUL) and it shows. While it will never have it's SM again, we can at least make the thing much nicer to look at.

realtek-poe: Fix memory leak in poe_reply_consume()

When thinking "embedded", it's a good idea to stay the fuck away from
malloc(). Falling out of scope is a free garbage collector. Port
config and state arrays followed this advice, but for some reason, the
command queue did not.

No worries, free() is used in poe_reply_consume(). No problemo! Crisis
averted! Did you spot the several failure modes which return before
the free() call. In these modes, a malloc()d command is taken off the
queue, and not free()d. The pointer falls out of scope and memory lost.
Quod Erat Demonstratum.

To fix this, free() the command before hitting any exit paths.

Mapping Update : LCZ Medbay, CDC and Reeducation Center (#225)

* Update baystation12.dme

* 9mm/.45ACP Buff

Changes are as follow:
- Buffed 9mm dam from 8 to 25 (now it doesn't take a whole mag to take down an unarmoured man)
- Buffed .45 dam from 10 to 30
- Nerfed 9mm AP from 34 to 30
- Buffed 7,62 dam from 40 to 50 (It's supposed to be beefier than 5,56mm)

* Organ changes

Lower organ health value to make combat much deadlier.
Headshots are truly lethal now.

* Slight rebalance and renamings

List of changes :
- decreased brain health to 150 (instead of 200), it's high enough that medical assistance can be given if fast but low enough that you don't want to get shot
- increased damage values of weapons to baystation/nebula level (40 for a pistol for eg)
- increased adrenalin generation when hurt (less fading in and out, you can still use your gun when hit and pain won't be such a pain in the ass, but you're less likely to get back up once the final shot hits you)
- decreased relative size of lungs from 60% to 30% so that now, getting hit in the chest won't have as much chance of damaging your poor fucking lungs (yes 60% is the original baystation number.. it makes sense, it's a large organ, but it's a pain in the ass)
- changed some names and descriptions of certain weapons and firearms to better fit established naming convention
-made revolvers cycle the barrel instead of eject each shot (it's a revolver, not a damn rifle)
- slightly decreased firing delay for the mk9 revolver (slightly weaker than the mateba so slightly faster firing)
- decreased firing delay for the mk9 pistol (lower caliber, less recoil, easier to magdump)

* Mateba fix

Fixed a misstype for the mateba that incorrectly qualified its caliber.

* Mateba fix

Fixing typo

* The big Security Zone update

Main changes:
- Each zone have unique uniform and gears now (MTF is dressed tactically and well armoured to act as the toughest defense force for the critical area in HCZ and to pass as a rapid response team, EZ gets slightly formal but still utilitarian gears to accomplish their internal security and bodyguarding tasks, and LCZ largely remains the same)
- All security guards spawns with most of their gears on themselves and in their satchel (with the exception of webbings, thigh holster and rifle/p90)
- Nerfed Beanbag damage from 10 to 3 so that it will stop causing bleeding injuries to CDs, making it more usable as a non lethal ammunition
- Slightly nerfed rubber P90 agony damage

* Map change LCZ

* LCZ mapping update

various minor tweaks

- depth test is disabled (for personal reasons, I don't want it in my
 renderer right now as I'm doing z sorting myself.)
- fixed custom function RemoveConfigFlags to have the correct bit math
- switched window style_ex hack from noactivate to toolwindow. idk what the differences between these are and I forget why I made this change, I was kind of in a drunken stoopur (not literally) when I was experimenting with the windows API. I'm prob gonna need to find or hire a programming friend to help me out with the very last platform bugs because jesus christ I'm not sure if just me will be able to handle taming the windows API. (although to be fair it's not like I don't already have experience working with shitty apis. Looking at you discord...)

Readds Alien Vore

Aliens can now eat people again. Behavior was removed by #43991 (b6c41e3b328078b72bd0f88fd46719aa99c55be2)
because nasku thought it was weird, and the code was really bad.

I think it's funny, and I've made the code not trashtier.

Basically, an alien can agressive grab any living mob. If they stay next
to the mob, facing them for 13 seconds, they will "eat" the mob,
IE:insert them into a list on their custom stomach.

The xeno can then hit an action button to spit out the mob, alongside
some acid.

If the mob is alive enough to pull out a weapon inside the xeno/has one
on it, they can attack the xeno from inside, dealing damage to the
creature and its stomach. If the stomach drops below a threshold, the
mob gibs the xeno and escapes.

I've done my best to steer things away from horny and into gross, though
I'm aware you fucks do your best to blur that line.

Anyway something something balance change something something lets xenos
abduct people more easily, I'm mostly doing this cause I think it has
soul.

tegra: lcd: video: integrate display driver for t30

On popular request make the display driver from T20 work on T30 as
well. Turned out to be quite straight forward. However a few notes
about some things encountered during porting: Of course the T30 device
tree was completely missing host1x as well as PWM support but it turns
out this can simply be copied from T20. The only trouble compiling the
Tegra video driver for T30 had to do with some hard-coded PWM pin
muxing for T20 which is quite ugly anyway. On T30 this gets handled by
a board specific complete pin muxing table. The older Chromium U-Boot
2011.06 which to my knowledge was the only prior attempt at enabling a
display driver for T30 for whatever reason got some clocking stuff
mixed up. Turns out at least for a single display controller T20 and
T30 can be clocked quite similar. Enjoy.

Add utilities to more easily and robustly create types from DB queries

This was a pain point for a long time. We decided to go with the rather
low level `postgres` crate. It supports basically everything we need
and is well tested. However, using it basically always resulted in
having to keep track of indices manually. E.g. the `from_row` function
of many types had a ton `row.get($n)` where `$n` was some integer.
Adding a new column to the `select` part of the query would often result
in changing lots of these indices. It just felt so low level, error
prone and unnecessary.

Of course, `Row` always allowed us to get the row value by name. But
that only helps a bit, as it's still easy to introduce typos there or
forgetting to update a string. It is also slower, but it's unclear how
much of an impact that would have been.

Then there are crates like `sqlx` which are super cool by obtaining
field and type information about the query at compile time and return
an appropriate anonymous struct type from the query. It is cool and
Tobira might still want to use that in the future, but it does not
solve all of our problems. In particular, I don't see a good way to
not having to list all columns in every single query.

So I ended up with this home grown solution that goes the middle way
and supports more use cases of Tobira. It is not type-safe as it does
not get the type information of selected fields (that would require
talking to the database, very much out of scope). But it does get rid of
manually tracking indices and provides some helper stuff to repeat as
little as possible.

Maybe it's overkill, maybe we'll find a stupid limitations of this very
soon, maybe in 5 years someone will be angrily shout "who wrote this
shit?!", or maybe it will work great.

It still has two limitations that I'd like to still address in the
future:
- `FromDb` types cannot have arbitrary SQL expressions.
- `from_row` requires ownership of the row.

Manually copy trailing attributes on a resize (#12637)

## THE WHITE WHALE

This is a fairly naive fix for this bug. It's not terribly performant,
but neither is resize in the first place.

When the buffer gets resized, typically we only copy the text up to the
`MeasureRight` point, the last printable char in the row. Then we'd just
use the last char's attributes to fill the remainder of the row.

Instead, this PR changes how reflow behaves when it gets to the end of
the row. After we finish copying text, then manually walk through the
attributes at the end of the row, and copy them over. This ensures that
cells that just have a colored space in them get copied into the new
buffer as well, and we don't just blat the last character's attributes
into the rest of the row. We'll do a similar thing once we get to the
last printable char in the buffer, copying the remaining attributes.

This could DEFINITELY be more performant. I think this current
implementation walks the attrs _on every cell_, then appends the new
attrs to the new ATTR_ROW. That could be optimized by just using the
actual iterator. The copy after the last printable char bit is also
especially bad in this regard. That could likely be a blind copy - I
just wanted to get this into the world.

Finally, we now copy the final attributes to the correct buffer: the new
one.  We used to copy them to the _old_ buffer, which we were about to
destroy.

## Validation

I'll add more gifs in the morning, not enough time to finish spinning a
release Terminal build with this tonight.

Closes #32 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Closes #12567

i fucking hate youtube

youtube-related changes:
- fixed silly mistake that made all shorts download in default format instead of preferred one
- made youtube module return full video (audio + video) if it's available and matches selected quality (usually 720p)
- changed the order of streams in video render (now video is first)

other changes:
- hopefully fixed zoom in on input in safari
- moved match module from sub to main modules directory

For fiery terrain, targeted earthquakes, and curse removal, damage player last so messages are ordered properly if the player dies.  Avoids "You die. The lava burns you!" and "The ground shakes! The ceiling caves in! You die. The white jelly wails out in pain! The white jelly is embedded in the rock!".

Kaito  [author] Jul 1 @ 1:20pm 
No, I had not considered it yet. Feel free to have a look. I'm kinda busy irl right now, so it would be a while before I could look.

In theory it all runs on the client, but you'll have to check the API.

Doc1979 Jun 28 @ 4:37pm 
Does this use server only commands? If not, have you thought of making it into a PluginLoader plugin? I was thinking of looking at your github to see if I could convert it myself, but if its already on your todo list, I'll wait

Sprout EmbeddedForm independent of Space Registration (#620)

EmbeddedForms allow AirTable forms to be embedded directly into a Room.

Things like opinion polls, newsletter signups, comment boxes, etc.

If you can make an AirTable form for it, you can put it on your landing 
page!

Squashed commit of the following:

commit ede2fbff74f634756b5ba6dfa7a76f765ea20307
Author: Zee Spencer <zspencer@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 9 19:58:10 2022 -0800

    Sprout `EmbeddableForm` Furniture

    As we begin this, we thought that it makes sense to start down the path
    of using a generic piece of Furniture, so that we're catfooding what the
    customer experience for other Spaces look like.

    So we've sprouted a piece of furniture that can embed a form from
    Airtable right into a Space! MAGIC!

fix(mu4e): Support mu 1.8

Thanks to some combination of ignorance and obstinance, mu4e has thrown
compatibility to the wind and completely ignored the exitance of
define-obsolete-function-alias. Coupled with the inconsistent/partial
function renaming, this has made the mu4e 1.6⟶1.8 change particularly
annoying to deal with.

By suffering the pain of doing the mu4e author's work for them, we can
use defalias to give backwards compatibility a good shot for about 60
functions. Some mu4e~x functions are now mu4e--x, others are unchanged,
and then you've got a few odd changes like mu4e~proc -> mu4e--server and
mu4e-search-rerun. The form of message :from entries has also changed,
and a new (mu4e) entrypoint added supplanting mu4e~start.

Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215, 18.225 - do the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged concurrent sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>


  have a certificate of occupancy.<br>


  Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and security deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but how many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed, notwithstanding the legal matter <br>


of NYSCEF 153974_2020.<br>

Rework Reputation page UI

The previous design had several issues that made it hard to know what
your concrete progress was for reputations:

- There were red colors even when you had completed a reputation, which
  made it hard to quickly understand at a glance which things weren't
  exalted yet.
- The size of the reputation bars changed depending on the reputation
  tiers. Some special reputations with unusual tiers (Chromie,
  Fisherfriends, Ember Court etc) would have a progress bar with a
  smaller size, which made them stand out.
- There was a horrible hack to special-case the Tillers from MOP to
  properly display their friendship tiers by hardcoding their reputation
  IDs. However, this was partially broken and unusable for different
  tiers.

This commit tries to address these issues by doing several things.

1. Bars all have the same fixed max width. All the different friendship
   tiers make the bar widths automatically adjust as a ratio of
   the maximum reputation attainable.

2. The full bar is always shown, with all the reputation tiers.
   Obtaining reputation just makes the bar increasingly "fill" its
   background color.

3. The bar is now fully colored in the color of the maximum reputation
   attainable. This is easier to the eye, as it is easy to quickly check
   at a glance which reps are not completed yet.

4. Names of reputation tiers are only shown when hovering the individual
   bar segments. The current tier is shown to the right, in the same
   color as the bar itself.

Delimited string repos are easy to dump with tr, and fixed width are easy
with normal nio print, but the newer & most general length-prefixed format
is a pain.  So, add a mechanism to simplify life.  Basically, nio print
with -t \\n -a foo.LC will dump as newline terminated (or you could do
\\0 for NUL) { but yeah - you lose perfect generality since the target
format doesn't have it }.

So, yeah, there may be a few suspicious things about these numbers:

1. "pathological" numbers seem too high (both cpu and wall).

2. Other numbers seem too low.

3. I am, as noted in the comments, in a sense comparing "apples and
   oranges" because I don't think the Ruby tests pass a `limit` option.
   Having said that, if I _do_ pass one in, it doesn't seem to have a very
   big impact on the tests, which makes me wonder if I am even threading
   it through in all the right places... But I added logging and confirmed
   that without the limit, I get 15 results at most (ie. the default
   limit), and with a high limit (like 10,000), I get more... (eg. in the
   "command-t" tests I get 109 results for one of the queries). Who
   knows? Maybe LuaJIT is just insanely fast, or I am somehow
   "cheating" without knowing how. Or maybe I introduced a big bug in my
   porting... We'll see over time, I guess.

On the bright side, the difference between cpu and wall clock times does
appear to indicate that at least threading is working as expected. The
smaller tests see no difference because they are below the necessary
threshold for threading to kick in. But the bigger stests all show the
expected roughly 4x improvement.

Tidy up .../billing/services/transactions-csv.js (#2120)

https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/WATER-3586

We came across transactions-csv.js as part of working on altering the bill run download to handle SROC bill runs.

To say it angered and upset the current dev team is a bit of an understatement. You _could_ argue calling a function to pull a couple of fields from an object has value (though in our opinion you'd be wrong!)

But there is no reason for making an _utter_ mess of known conventions around `private` and `public` methods. It is a [common practice](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4484449/6117745) in JavaScript to prefix private module methods with an underscore. This singles intent to other developers; these methods are only used internally by the module, and those without it are for use elsewhere in the code.

So, after another day of struggling through the code imagine our consternation when we come across this

```javascript
exports._getInvoiceData = getInvoiceData
exports._getInvoiceAccountData = getInvoiceAccountData
exports._getTransactionData = getTransactionData
exports._getTransactionAmounts = getTransactionAmounts
exports.createCSV = createCSV
exports.getCSVFileName = getCSVFileName
```

We are making `private` methods `public` but when we do so we are identifying them as `private`. Arrrrgh!!! 🤬😠

As far as we can see this was _solely_ for the purpose of testing the methods. _They are not referenced anywhere else!!!_ So, added to our convention-breaking we're also directly testing methods intended to be private and making them public purely to allow those tests to run. 🤯🤦

We have no words. Just know this change attempts to make things a little better 🥹
