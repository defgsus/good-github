Dreams aren't bad, our heads are mad
I love the girl
But God only knows it's
Getting hard to see the sun coming through
I love you
But what are we going to do?

All Alone
Leviticus
Deuteronomy

Snatch a piece of my wonderin'
Distant, far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like, seat of my boot like
Fly in my soup like, where's the waitress?

Can't take this, really can't finish this
These airs and all these graces
It's my mistake, I make it
J-dub to the boom now make it

Bounce-wiggle, bounce-wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cut throats
Bound to blow the brain out

Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted Cain, I'll twist again
I'll push the blade as plain as day

Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
We shoot where who and you-know-where
We's about to take it there

We's about to make it clear
We happy or we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart
From start to finish

Guards against uplink failsafe code being the same as unlock code (#72113)

## About The Pull Request

There's probably a better way to do this to be honest, but I think it's
silly for both to potentially be the same and this should work alright.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes #71446.

I don't think the Syndicate is that stupid.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: After a recent mishap with a high-ranking Syndicate operative, the
uplink's unlock code and failsafe code (the one that makes it blow up if
you say it) should never turn out to be the same.

0.9.4.5

Characters
- Kaenbyou: now can toggle between her youkai (cat) or human forms. Cat form is smaller, slightly more nimble, and less loud, but carries less weight and deals reduced melee damage
- Mokou is now immortal. She can resurrect after dying, "resetting" her body. There's no limit to how many times she can do this, but there's a soft cap proportional to how many times she has died in a short time (say, a week), plus a long lasting small-ish pain debuff that ramps to discourage the player trying to savescum. Also, she's now immune to smoke, a qol for her spells burning stuff around her
- Reisen: now has the LUNARDIET trait which makes her intolerant to impure foodstuff, until she eates enough of it. This is linked to the addition of the Impurity mechanic (see Mechanics)
- Remi: now has blood thirst. She has to consume blood (or human flesh, with less effectiviness) in order to keep it at bay
- Sakuya: new spell "Maid's secret", a toggle-able aura that increases her movement speed and stamina regeneration as long as she is focused, becoming tired or hostiles getting close disables also toggles it off. Also tweaked some spell and effect values
- Yamame: now can toggle between her youkai (revealing her spider legs) or human forms. Her youkai form helps moving through difficult terrain, climbs walls and rappels, but is way more visible (and "ugly"), intimidatory and difficult to swim  with

Guns
- MIB weapons (previously added) are now fully functional

Mechanics
- Several new mechanics were integrated in different parts of the mod, read the patch notes to see which ones
- Impurity (WIP) and Blood thirst (see Characters). Impurity is currently a dummy mechanic: it increases naturally over time and also by consuming "impure" stuff (which is everything edible so far). It has no effect now, but will in the future

Misc/Fixes
- Added some missing cc debuffs to the list of what Reisen can cleanse with her cleansing spell
- Skinwalkers, banshee and White Lady demoralizing spell components are now working properly
- Several mutation numbers were rechecked/toned down
- Fixed some stuff from Udonge's aura spells, and slightly cleaned up the EOCs
- Minor description change to Tenko's pillar spell
- Touhou Scenarios EOCs now actually work

Bugs:
- Mokou's resurrection moves her 3 tiles to the right, every time she revives. I have no idea how or why this happens, still this is potentially very very bad

the app is starting to take form, added in some new programs, basically most programs can use the basic program prefab, but some programs have to do special things, like invisibility or armor. i also decided the utilities won't show on the list at all and don't need to be activated from "run program" instead having the utility enables a menu item to do it's thing (if you have re-rezz then when a program is de rezzed there will be a menu option for re-rezz for instance, will be adding something for unpacking packed programs and the necessary delay that produces)

i got messages showing when things happen, it's still a bit janky but it's not too bad, i do wish the action would stop until the message is done and that i could give some way for the player to interact with the action (like activating a shield when attacked, or rolling a die if they system is using dicewear instead of PRNG)

but i can activate some programs, my programs can fight other programs, programs can be destroyed, anti-program programs can attack my actrive programs (like armor or invisibility, which i THINK is correct RAW) i can take damage, the damage shows on the HUD, my BTM and armor can reduce damage, i imagine armor stacks, you could make yourself invulnerable with enough of em running at once. well invulnerable to cerain attacks anyways, just use a glogo rig be immune to most all attacks.

anyhow lots of stuff working better now, i think next i will focus on the main menu using the new ui builder (which is the dogs fucking bollocks btw)

and at some point i will rewrite the server for ASP.net Core and razor components. and then i will add a section for adding and editing programs, since a lot of them don't have their functions and options set up yet, just go through those and start plugging away.

2022 Day 24

Blizzard basin turns out to be a simple BFS/wave with conditions (free
paths) changing dynamically in time. My algorithm finds the solution
(earning me a a rank under 1000 :strong:)) but runs quite long (tens of
seconds on my PC).

However, spending whole morning behind a PC on Christmas Eve is not what
my family would appreciate so I decide it's good enough. Honestly, I'm
not sure whether I'd be able to speed it up massively anyway (without
copying some other smart solution).

Fixes parallax on >2 level maps going fucky with optimized multiz (#72169)

## About The Pull Request

We no longer always render parallax.
This was causing issues because we can't isolate the white of space from
the vaugely white of everything else.

So instead, if your parallax plane is out of view, we'll not only
disable it, but we'll disable the strand we send from the main plane TO
it.

Instead only blending against the bottom stack.

This does mean there's a possibility for fullwhite on z transition
borders (potentially fixable), or when hijacking the plane (also
fixable, but significantly more annoying).

This is enough to make large maps functional though, so I'm happy with
it

## Why It's Good For The Game

Allows for #71731 and other maps like it. Makes my code actually work

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Using optimized multiz on > 2 z layer maps will no longer cause
fucko bungo

Cargo ammo and ammo box mapping (re-up) (#1759)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

## About The Pull Request

Previous version of this PR ( #1650 ) claimed to have changed 384 files,
which would be impossible to review. So re-uploading this PR with
hopefully a sane amount of files changed...

---

When I was playing cargo I spent a good half an hour in a round just
mindlessly packing ammo magazines into boxes in squad prep. It didn't
put a dent in the squad prep supply, and I barely got a handful of
boxes. So I thought to myself that this is pretty much a waste of time
for cargo and decided to code a better solution:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnXcEYAV8P4

So now select vendors (opt-in via `VEND_LOAD_AMMO_BOXES`) support ammo
consolidation. They count the number of ammo magazines you have and from
that they derive the number of magazine boxes you can vend. If you vend
a magazine, it updates the number of boxes available, and if you vend a
box, it updates the number of magazines available (as well as all
derived boxes - see the 3 pack of grenades and 25 pack box).

The `item_to_box_mapping` tracks ammo boxes (minus loose ammo), grenade
boxes, grenade packets and mine boxes.

Most notable affected vendors - Requisition ammo vendor, Requisition
vendor that features grenades, Squad vendors that have ammo in them.

So now Requisition will be able to easily raid Squad Vendors to stock up
their ammo drops and save countless hours of mind-numbing cargo work.

This code ALSO correctly works when you're re-stocking a vendor with
either individual magazines or magazine boxes. Correct amounts are
updated everywhere. So you *could* take a magazine box, put it in a
vendor and thus let people vend 16 magazines out of it seemlessly.
Really useful just incase you need to restock Requisitions with
individual ammo or something...

Other notes:
- Boxes of magazines are put directly under the corresponding ammo so
you can vend them in larger amounts easier. Useful for 3-packs of
grenades
- We should add a Shotgun Shell Box Box so we can also handle those
easily...
- Nailgun ammo box had to be converted from being /smg/ since that
created an invalid ammo box that nobody used.
- Nulled out a magazine type for an intermediary box that later gets
used for MREs and all that

## Why It's Good For The Game

Gameplay around loading magazines into ammo boxes is not interesting, so
cutting it down to minimum is for the best.

:cl:
add: Added an automated ammo box management system to various vendors
stocking bulk ammo and grenades. It will automatically combine ammo
magazine into boxes, and divide boxes into individual magazines (or
grenades, MRE packets, etc.). The boxes will appear at the bottom of the
vendor (yes, this also includes the regular grenade boxes that used to
be higher).
qol: Cargo will no longer need to pack individual vended ammo magazines
into boxes thanks to the ammo box management system. Your chains have
been broken!
qol: Requisitions vendor now stocks 3-packs of grenades as well as
individual HEDP grenades.
qol: Requisitions ammo vendor now can vend a lot more individual
magazines (actual number of magazines remains unchanged, just the ammo
boxes have been consolidated into magazines).
qol: Requisition vendors now vend to floor when they are not vending to
the front desks. This will make filling crates of ammo boxes or rappels
easier.
code: Minor changes to code around some ammo boxes to remove one phantom
box and prevent intermediate box types from being indexed when they
shouldn't be.
code: Refactored the code that checks whether items are in mint enough
condition to re-stock.

Changes our map_format to SIDE_MAP (#70162)


## About The Pull Request

This does nothing currently, but will allow me to test for layering
issues on LIVE, rather then in just wallening.
Oh also I'm packaging in a fix to one of my macros that I wrote wrong,
as a joke

just means there's an uncontrollable black slate even if you have other

This just like, removes that, since it's silly

AI actions won't unassign each other's movement targets & Mice stop being scared of people if fed cheese  (#72130)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #72116 
I've had a persistent issue with basic mob actions reporting this error
and think I finally cracked it
When replanning with `AI_BEHAVIOR_CAN_PLAN_DURING_EXECUTION` it can run
`Setup` on one action leading to the plan changing, meaning that it runs
`finishCommand` to cancel all other existing commands
If you triggered a replan by setting up a movement action in the middle
of another movement action, cancelling the existing action would remove
the target already set by the current one.
We want actions to be able to remove _their own_ movement target but not
if it has been changed by something else in the intervening time.

I fixed this by passing a source every time you set a movement target
and adding a proc which only clears it if you are the source... but this
feels kind of ugly. I couldn't think of anything but if you have a
better idea let me know.

Also while I was doing this I turned it into a feature because I'm
crazy.
If you feed a mouse cheese by hand it will stop being scared of humans
and so will any other mice it attracts from eating more cheese. This is
mostly because I think industrial mouse farming to pass cargo bounties
is funny.
Mice controlled by a Regal Rat lose this behaviour and forget any past
loyalties they may have had.

Oh also I removed a block about cancelling if you have another target
from the "hunt" behaviour, everywhere using this already achieves that
simply by ordering the actions in expected priority order and it was
messing with how I expected mice to work.
Now if they happen to stop by some cheese they will correctly stop
fleeing in order to eat it before continuing to run away.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes a bug I kept running into.
Makes it possible to set up a mouse farm without them screaming
constantly.
Lets people more easily domesticate mice to support Ratatouille
gameplay.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Mice who are fed cheese by hand will accept humans as friends, at
least until reminded otherwise by their rightful lord.
fix: Fixed a runtime preventing mice from acting correctly when trying
to flee and also eat cheese at the same time.

2022 Day 22

This one was relatively painless, except for the fact that I made one
mistake on part two, that made it so that I had to do it later.

I had time pressure when solving this, as we where taking a plane to
Thailand that morning. So I only gave part 2 one try and then just
closed the program.

Part 1 is very easy, and I scored quite well on that. For part two I
thought it was going to be a massive headache to solve generically, and
I still think it will be, but I ended up going for something which was
just for my input. I decided on how to name the sides on my input and
drew it out on a piece of paper. Then I cut the paper to that shape, and
could fold it like a cube.

I had written the letter for each side on the cubes on the paper, so I
could track how their rotation ended up. Then it was an easy matter to
figure out which face I was currently on, and if a move would end up in
another face.

This is where things get a bit interesting. The transformation between
two faces is not trivial. But I drew it out on the paper and wrote a
transformation setup by hand. I decided I would have (new face,
direction entered on new face, reverse numbering, new direction).

This worked ALMOST perfectly, but with one mistake, which is that I had
ONE mistake in the whole thing, a single "L" that should have been an
"R" in the "new direction" column. The most annoying part, is that the
"new direction" is the only part of the solution, that is not needed at
all. It should always be the opposite of the side we enter. So I could
have just not hardcoded it and I would have been finished on time.

Either way, I'm now set for tomorrow. This is very nice as I was worried
that the mistake was going to be harder to track down. I can't wait to
see how other people have solved this in the reddit thread, but I will
first try to solve it generally on my own before looking.

2022 Day 23

Well, we finally got the mandatory "Conway's game of life" variation
puzzle. This one was fairly straight forward, except that I wasted A LOT
of time on part one, on a shitty bug in my "adjacency" function. I
forgot to exclude the "(0,0)" delta, and so I got 9 items, instead of
just the 8 squares surrounding.

I had to create a visualisation of this to figure it out and that took
some time. This is the 3rd time this year, that I wished I had an
unconstrained adjacency function, so I think that I'll include one like
that in next year.

Part two is not very fast, even when using pypy. I wonder if it's me
doing something stupid or if it's just a slow task. I will look in the
megathread to see if there are some smart ways of optimizing this.

The reason I was not able to deliver this when the contest started, was
that I was on a plane, with no elbow room to really work. So I decided
to wait until we had arrived at our AirBnB.

Gatfruit will no longer drop from ice portals. (#72048)

## About The Pull Request

For some god-forsaken reason, somebody decided that ice portals should
be able to drop one of the most disruptive items in the game. This PR
amends this by removing it from the drop pool.

## Why It's Good For The Game

In 2013 gatfruit was introduced in the following PR #2000 . This was
almost a decade ago at this point, repeatedly through the PR the creator
states his belief that this item should only ever be obtainable through
admin intervention due to its ridiculous capabilities. At the time
everyone in the PR agreed it was a reasonable item to add **as it was
unobtainable without admin intervention**. Over the years, it has crept
its way to become more prevalent and openly obtainable, the most
offensive of these options is the ice moon portal. As is, there is a 1
in 28 chance of obtaining the seeds, this sounds pretty inoffensive
right? That's just 3.44% probability. Now, let us search the instances
of the portal that spawns this.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16896032/208220173-bbefe604-0885-44a5-9add-b5f0c62067cc.png)

That is a big number, a lot of chances to get that seed packet and other
gamer looters. Now, let's take a look at the probability of being able
to get these seeds, assuming you wipe out all of the portals.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16896032/208220460-3f59a2ac-d936-4f3a-aa14-9c637af6a9d7.png)

92.8% chance to be able to get these seeds each shift if you focus
entirely on gaming the portals. That's a pretty insane probability of
being able to obtain the gatfruit seeds.

While I dislike people who sprint to the seed vault, there is at least
the possibility of a pod person telling them to fuck off when they
demand their _free_ gamer seed. There is also the fact that the ruin
isn't a guaranteed spawn every shift.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Gatfruit seeds will no longer drop from ice portals.

*hand, or That /One/ Emote You Always Felt Was Missing (#71600)

## About The Pull Request
It's happened to me _repeatedly_ that I'd see someone down on the floor,
and wanted to just, give them a hand, so they could take it and get up
that way, without just, directly clicking on them, since that's a little
bland. I've also wanted to just, offer my hand to someone so they could
grab it, so that I could pull them alongside me, rather than just
targeting one of their arms and ctrl-clicking them.

I've had this idea for a _long_ time, and only just decided to do this
today.

Now, I know what you might say. "Golden, that's a lot of code for
something this simple!" You're not wrong. _However_. I decided to go
along and to give some more love to the `/datum/status_effect/offering`
status effect and the offering-related alerts, to make them a lot more
versatile and a lot less hardcoded. Hence the whole "refactoring" part
of this.

Of course, when I add something, I don't do it half-way. So, the way the
emote works is much like the `*slap` emote, except that:

- When you click on someone, it does the exact same as if you were
offering the item to them, except that it's targeted (much like
ctrl-shift-click).
- If there's nobody directly adjacent to you, it won't do anything.
- If there's at least one person lying down around you, you will offer
them your help to get up. Should they take your hand and let you help
them up, you will both receive a simple memory about being helped up (or
helping up), as well as a 45-seconds-long small mood buff, because it
feels nice to be on either end of such a friendly gesture. If they get
up, they automatically get disqualified from being offered some help
standing up, and likewise, if you lie down, that offer goes away as
well.
- If there's at least one person around you, you will instead extend
your hand in their direction, for them to grab onto it. Should they do
so, you will then grab them by their arms and pull them.

I reworked the offering status effect to no longer have a hardcoded
`can_hold_items()` check, so that kisses and the hand offering would no
longer need you to have free hands to complete. The logic here is that
you can still pull someone even with both hands filled, so I figured I'd
leave it this way.

Note: If anyone would like to give the item a better sprite, by all
means, go ahead, that'd be amazing. I'm just not really a great spriter
and couldn't be bothered to waste hours making a very _meh_ hand.

## Why It's Good For The Game
It's fluff, and nice fluff at that. It makes it easier for people to be
nice to one-another without having to necessarily spend so long writing
up an emote that the person on the floor will already have gotten back
up. I'm sure the MRP folks will like it, and I'm certain the HRP
downstreams will love it too ;)

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Added the *hand emote, which you can offer to someone standing up
in order to give them the possibility to grab onto your hand and let you
drag them away, or to someone lying down to help them back up, which
always makes everyone involved a little happier!
refactor: De-hardcoded and genericized a lot of the offering status
effect and alert code, to make it require a lot less copy-paste to
handle new cases.
fix: Offering a kiss no longer requires the receiver to have free hands
to accept said kiss!

Smoothing groups optimization, save 265ms with configs, more on production & w/ space ruins (#71989)

This one is fun.

On every /turf/Initialize and /atom/Initialize, we try to set
`smoothing_groups` and `canSmoothWith` to a cached list of bitfields. At
the type level, these are specified as lists of IDs, which are then
`Join`ed in Initialize, and retrieved from the cache (or built from
there).

The problem is that the cache only misses about 60 times, but the cache
hits more than a hundred thousand times. This means we eat the cost of
`Join` (which is very very slow, because strings + BYOND), as well as
the preliminary `length` checks, for every single atom.

Furthermore, as you might remember, if you have any list variable set on
a type, it'll create a hidden `(init)` proc to create the list. On
turfs, that costs us about 60ms.

This PR does a cool trick where we can completely eliminate the `Join`
*and* the lists at the cost of a little more work when building the
cache.

The trick is that we replace the current type definitions with this:

```patch
- smoothing_groups = list(SMOOTH_GROUP_TURF_OPEN, SMOOTH_GROUP_FLOOR_ASH)
- canSmoothWith = list(SMOOTH_GROUP_FLOOR_ASH, SMOOTH_GROUP_CLOSED_TURFS)
+ smoothing_groups = SMOOTH_GROUP_TURF_OPEN + SMOOTH_GROUP_FLOOR_ASH
+ canSmoothWith = SMOOTH_GROUP_FLOOR_ASH + SMOOTH_GROUP_CLOSED_TURFS
```

These defines, instead of being numbers, are now segments of a string,
delimited by commas.

For instance, if ASH used to be 13, and CLOSED_TURFS used to be 37, this
used to equal `list(13, 37)`. Now, it equals `"13,37,"`.

Then, when the cache misses, we take that string, and treat it as part
of a JSON list, and decode it from there. Meaning:

```java
// Starting value
"13,37,"

// We have a trailing comma, so add a dummy value
"13,37,0"

// Make it an array
"[13,37,0]"

// Decode
list(13, 37, 0)

// Chop off the dummy value
list(13, 37) // Done!
```

This on its own eliminates 265ms *without space ruins*, with the
combined savings of turf/Initialize, atom/Initialize, and the hidden
(init) procs that no longer exist.

Furthermore, there's some other fun stuff we gain from this approach
emergently.

We previously had a difference between `S_TURF` and `S_OBJ`. The idea is
that if you have any smoothing groups with `S_OBJ`, then you will gain
the `SMOOTH_OBJ` bitflag (though note to self, I need to check that the
cost of adding this is actually worth it). This is achieved by the fact
that `S_OBJ` simply takes the last turf, and adds onto that, meaning
that if the biggest value in the sorting groups is greater than that,
then we know we're going to be smoothing to objects.

This new method provides a limitation here. BYOND has no way of
converting a number to a string at compile time, meaning that we can't
evaluate `MAX_S_TURF + offset` into a string. Instead, in order to
preserve the nice UX, `S_OBJ` now instead opts to make the numbers
negative. This means that what used to be something like:

```dm
smoothing_groups = list(SMOOTH_GROUP_ALIEN_RESIN, SMOOTH_GROUP_ALIEN_WEEDS)
```

...which may have been represented as

```dm
smoothing_groups = list(15, MAX_S_TURF + 3)
```

...will now become, at compile time:

```dm
smoothing_groups = "15,-3,"
```

Except! Because we guarantee smoothing groups are sorted through unit
testing, this is actually going to look like:

```dm
smoothing_groups = "-3,15,"
```

Meaning that we can now check if we're smoothing with objects just by
checking if `smoothing_groups[1] == "-"`, as that's the only way that is
possible. Neat!

Furthermore, though much simpler, what used to be `if
(length(smoothing_groups))` (and canSmoothWith) on every single
atom/Initialize and turf/Initialize can now be `if (smoothing_groups)`,
since empty strings are falsy. `length` is about 15% slower than doing
nothing, so in procs as hot as this, this gives some nice gains just on
its own.

For developers, very little changes. Instead of using `list`, you now
use `+`. The order might change, as `S_OBJ` now needs to come first, but
unit tests will catch you if you mess up. Also, you will notice that all
`S_OBJ` have been increased by one. This is because we used to have
`S_TURF(0)` and `S_OBJ(0)`, but with this new trick, -0 == 0, and so
they conflicted and needed to be changed.

I knokw - this never happened, you don't exist

unlike Stephen Curry I am ot lead by blind into the hole

like Rich Roll before we was dead - I want to be light and performant game

I listen to Jesus - I know about salt and trampled under foot, enemies and feet, gather and scatter, sow reap store labour spin

let me be Heroes of Might and Maigc 3 game - without sugar
like Neo I choose red pill
like when we gather the dish and see caesar's dish of bread mixed with fruit - we gather bread from it nad leave the rest
let me do the same to Heroes 3 - take the 7 castles, creatures, artifacts, numbers - all the bread of the game and leave music and graphics out
let me use words - I follow Jesus I know about Word - and symbols and characters - text, and colors, light soft calm
I will not make sure to have all the errors of Heroes 3 - but will program it's world the way it is and see how numbers are without mistakes
like Morpheus - I want to just get Neo out
I am not a new game - I am Heroes of Might and Magic 3, gathered free, no Money evil, open source and without sugar - the chess essence without elders
I listen to Jesus I know about elders and high places
those who compete in Heroes 3 - when I am ready - will be able to continue playing the same game but light and Money disease free

:Zach-Galifianakis people say you are not aging - is that why your mivies feel like eternity?

[MIRROR] Create a guide for atomization that includes a new allowance to pull requests that might add dead code [MDB IGNORE] (#17839)

* Create a guide for atomization that includes a new allowance to pull requests that might add dead code (#71429)

@ tgstation/commit-access

I'm proposing a new use for the Atomic tag that we currently virtually
never use.

We have countless pull requests over time, and plenty of which open now,
that are enormous refactors over tens of files with thousands of
additions. We are historically pretty slow to review and merge these,
and it definitely scares a lot of maintainers off. I think part of the
reason is that we do not like dead code being added, which is completely
reasonable at our scale.

However, I propose that, for refactors/purely code stuff, we ease up on
this a lot, and encourage (not require) people to make smaller pull
requests, even to the extent that it creates APIs we do not use yet.

As an example, https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/71421 does a
massive refactor to carp. It also does some balance changes, which I
think we could agree could be split off if it was enough of a pain.
However, there's a bunch of other stuff that could have been individual
pull requests here with this new allowance.

- The new basic AI behaviors
- The regenerator component
- Pet commands component

These are things that:

- Would not be used until the transition from simple to basic, but are
easily reviewable on their own
- Are easy to REMOVE if the OP does not follow up
- Are easy to FINISH if the OP does not follow up

(I suspect even, for instance, that there are parts of Wallening we
could be merging right now, that's probably gonna be hundreds or
thousands of files long...)

Pros:
- PRs are more often easily reviewable
- PRs are quicker to merge, since we don't have conflicts from editing
one of the 70 files they changed
- Cleanups can be more easily finished by other people. I don't suspect
this will be likely, but it's not easily possible today

Cons:
- We have to mark the PRs as atomic
- Someone needs to look through every so often (I'm thinking like, once
a month or something) to see if the code ended up being used, or if the
committer still plans to use it
- If the PR is adding a complex enough API that isn't modular, it might
be very hard to remove. I suspect for PRs like this that we ask them to
have an implementer before merging.

NL voice would love your thoughts on this

Adds a preference that disables intensive rendering on different multiz layers (#71218)

## About The Pull Request

It's kinda hacky, but it is nearly the same as just rendering one z
layer.
We allow people to ENTIRELY REMOVE most plane masters from their screen.
This has the side effect of disabling most visual effects (AO is a big
one) which saves a LOT of gpu.

We rely on planes being essentially layers to ensure things render in
the proper order. (outside of some hackyness required to make parallax
work)

I've kept parallax and lighting enabled, so visuals will still look
better then multiz pre plane cube.
It does also mean that things like FOV don't work, but honestly they
didn't work PRE plane cube, and FOV's implementation makes me mad so I
have a hard time caring.

Reduces gpu usage on my machine on tram from 47% to 32%, just above the
27% I get on meta.

I'm happy with this.

Oh also turns out the parallaxing had almost no cost. Need to remove it
as a side effect of what I'm doing but if I could keep it I would.

There's still room for in between performance options, like disabling
things like AO on lower z layers, but I didn't expect it to make a huge
impact, so I left things as is

Also fixes a bug with paper bins not respecting z layer. It came up in
testing and annoyed me

## Why It's Good For The Game

Ensures we can make multiz maps without running into client performance
issues, allows users to customize performance and visual quality.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Adds a new rendering option to the gameplay preferences. You can
now limit the rendering intensity of multiz levels. This will make
things look a bit worse, but run a LOT better. Try it out if your
machine chokes on icebox or somethin.

Fixes attempting to offset floating planes (#71490)

## About The Pull Request

This is a dumb idea, and leads to fucked rendering on occasion

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes another portion of #70258, a player will no longer have a hidden
antag hud if they move down a z level after getting an antag. We were
trying to offset the floating plane of their image, and it went to shit.
Also fixes a bug with observers not having antag huds for the combo hud
to see. We were only giving them one on mind.on_transfer, rather then on
mind assignment. I hate mindcode

Hotkey-based inventory management now applies the click cooldown to prevent it from being abusable in combat scenarios. (#71325)


About The Pull Request

Hotkey-based inventory management now applies the click cooldown to prevent it from being abusable in combat scenarios.
Why It's Good For The Game

Players have been deploying unbelievable levels of abuse with these hotkeys having completely uncapped speeds.
I watched one cheater do automated inventory management using storage items and weirdly named empty pills to use as inventory delimiters.
Resolves people being able to have a baton hidden in their backpack and then activate and baton someone with it in 0.1 seconds without moving their mouse cursor off of their target.

Players should not be able to interact with their inventory faster than someone moving a mouse and clicking the left mouse button. This cripples the game balance and puts anyone with a worse internet connection, slower reaction speeds, or laggier computer at a distinct disadvantage against people who can macro their inventory management.

I can set up autohotkey so that I can withdraw a stun baton from my backpack, turn it on, and then click someone by just holding down a key and pressing M1 over someone. This shit needs to stop.

If a do_after() on hotkey management is too harsh, we can apply a combat click cooldown every time you use the hotkeys instead to discourage combat macro abuse.
Swapped it over to a click cooldown.
Changelog

cl
balance: Hotkey-based inventory management now applies the click cooldown to prevent it from being abusable in combat scenarios.

[MIRROR] Drinking singulo ignores supermatter hallucinations and pulls nearby objects [MDB IGNORE] (#18157)

* Drinking singulo ignores supermatter hallucinations and pulls nearby objects (#71927)

## About The Pull Request
Drinking a singulo will now:

- Give immunity to supermatter hallucinations
- Pulls objects to you based on the total volume in your system (20u =
1x1, 45u = 2x2, 80u = 3x3)
- Makes a burp and supermatter rays/sound when objects are pulled

The new ingredient is:

- Vokda 5u
- Wine 5u
- Liquid Dark Matter 1u (replaces Radium)

## Why It's Good For The Game
More cool effects for drinks. Singularity is all about gravity and the
drink should have a theme around that.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Drinking singulo will now ignore supermatter hallucinations and
pull objects to you
balance: Change singulo drink recipe to require liquid dark matter
instead of radium.

includes my La Lu pack run from today.

My goal was to not fall, and I didn't, so that was nice.  However, I
got too spooked by the cold weather that other people are experiencing
and so I went out wearing arm sleeves and a fleece hat (under my ice
hat), which was silly.  My truck thermometer said it was 28F, so I
should have known better.  Additionally, I wore my microspikes which
was foolish since there was no snow all the way up to the plate.  To
round out my errors, I also didn't blow the liquid out of the line
coming out of my bladder, nor did I do a test draw to make sure things
weren't kinked and--not surprisingly--could not get anything from my
bladder and I didn't even test it before I got to the turnaround.

So, at the top, I took off my pack, removed my microspikes, hat and
arm sleeves, put them into my pack and put my pack on, only to find out
a little later that my bladder was useless.  Oops.

I do believe I got a useful training effect today.  I also believe
that my stats are "good enough" considering everything that was
holding me back (which is why my average HR was only 130bpm).
However, I believe that had I done a little more prep the night before
and paid a little more attention to the weather, I would have been
able to push myself harder and also not had the big pause at the top.

I did not do this training in two out of the last four training
seasons due to being sick.  It's too early for me to be sure, but I
suspect that with me not drinking alcohol until after Western States,
I will avoid some of the sickness I've had in previous years.

Transpile packages on demand, validate all TS projects (#146212)

## Dearest Reviewers ðŸ‘‹ 

I've been working on this branch with @mistic and @tylersmalley and
we're really confident in these changes. Additionally, this changes code
in nearly every package in the repo so we don't plan to wait for reviews
to get in before merging this. If you'd like to have a concern
addressed, please feel free to leave a review, but assuming that nobody
raises a blocker in the next 24 hours we plan to merge this EOD pacific
tomorrow, 12/22.

We'll be paying close attention to any issues this causes after merging
and work on getting those fixed ASAP. ðŸš€

---

The operations team is not confident that we'll have the time to achieve
what we originally set out to accomplish by moving to Bazel with the
time and resources we have available. We have also bought ourselves some
headroom with improvements to babel-register, optimizer caching, and
typescript project structure.

In order to make sure we deliver packages as quickly as possible (many
teams really want them), with a usable and familiar developer
experience, this PR removes Bazel for building packages in favor of
using the same JIT transpilation we use for plugins.

Additionally, packages now use `kbn_references` (again, just copying the
dx from plugins to packages).

Because of the complex relationships between packages/plugins and in
order to prepare ourselves for automatic dependency detection tools we
plan to use in the future, this PR also introduces a "TS Project Linter"
which will validate that every tsconfig.json file meets a few
requirements:

1. the chain of base config files extended by each config includes
`tsconfig.base.json` and not `tsconfig.json`
1. the `include` config is used, and not `files`
2. the `exclude` config includes `target/**/*`
3. the `outDir` compiler option is specified as `target/types`
1. none of these compiler options are specified: `declaration`,
`declarationMap`, `emitDeclarationOnly`, `skipLibCheck`, `target`,
`paths`

4. all references to other packages/plugins use their pkg id, ie:
	
	```js
    // valid
    {
      "kbn_references": ["@kbn/core"]
    }
    // not valid
    {
      "kbn_references": [{ "path": "../../../src/core/tsconfig.json" }]
    }
    ```

5. only packages/plugins which are imported somewhere in the ts code are
listed in `kbn_references`

This linter is not only validating all of the tsconfig.json files, but
it also will fix these config files to deal with just about any
violation that can be produced. Just run `node scripts/ts_project_linter
--fix` locally to apply these fixes, or let CI take care of
automatically fixing things and pushing the changes to your PR.

> **Example:** [`64e93e5`
(#146212)](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/146212/commits/64e93e580679dd55f4fdf19bd01402bc478a1a75)
When I merged main into my PR it included a change which removed the
`@kbn/core-injected-metadata-browser` package. After resolving the
conflicts I missed a few tsconfig files which included references to the
now removed package. The TS Project Linter identified that these
references were removed from the code and pushed a change to the PR to
remove them from the tsconfig.json files.

## No bazel? Does that mean no packages??
Nope! We're still doing packages but we're pretty sure now that we won't
be using Bazel to accomplish the 'distributed caching' and 'change-based
tasks' portions of the packages project.

This PR actually makes packages much easier to work with and will be
followed up with the bundling benefits described by the original
packages RFC. Then we'll work on documentation and advocacy for using
packages for any and all new code.

We're pretty confident that implementing distributed caching and
change-based tasks will be necessary in the future, but because of
recent improvements in the repo we think we can live without them for
**at least** a year.

## Wait, there are still BUILD.bazel files in the repo
Yes, there are still three webpack bundles which are built by Bazel: the
`@kbn/ui-shared-deps-npm` DLL, `@kbn/ui-shared-deps-src` externals, and
the `@kbn/monaco` workers. These three webpack bundles are still created
during bootstrap and remotely cached using bazel. The next phase of this
project is to figure out how to get the package bundling features
described in the RFC with the current optimizer, and we expect these
bundles to go away then. Until then any package that is used in those
three bundles still needs to have a BUILD.bazel file so that they can be
referenced by the remaining webpack builds.

Refactor op pool for speed and correctness (#3312)

## Proposed Changes

This PR has two aims: to speed up attestation packing in the op pool, and to fix bugs in the verification of attester slashings, proposer slashings and voluntary exits. The changes are bundled into a single database schema upgrade (v12).

Attestation packing is sped up by removing several inefficiencies: 

- No more recalculation of `attesting_indices` during packing.
- No (unnecessary) examination of the `ParticipationFlags`: a bitfield suffices. See `RewardCache`.
- No re-checking of attestation validity during packing: the `AttestationMap` provides attestations which are "correct by construction" (I have checked this using Hydra).
- No SSZ re-serialization for the clunky `AttestationId` type (it can be removed in a future release).

So far the speed-up seems to be roughly 2-10x, from 500ms down to 50-100ms.

Verification of attester slashings, proposer slashings and voluntary exits is fixed by:

- Tracking the `ForkVersion`s that were used to verify each message inside the `SigVerifiedOp`. This allows us to quickly re-verify that they match the head state's opinion of what the `ForkVersion` should be at the epoch(s) relevant to the message.
- Storing the `SigVerifiedOp` on disk rather than the raw operation. This allows us to continue track the fork versions after a reboot.

This is mostly contained in this commit 52bb1840ae5c4356a8fc3a51e5df23ed65ed2c7f.

## Additional Info

The schema upgrade uses the justified state to re-verify attestations and compute `attesting_indices` for them. It will drop any attestations that fail to verify, by the logic that attestations are most valuable in the few slots after they're observed, and are probably stale and useless by the time a node restarts. Exits and proposer slashings and similarly re-verified to obtain `SigVerifiedOp`s.

This PR contains a runtime killswitch `--paranoid-block-proposal` which opts out of all the optimisations in favour of closely verifying every included message. Although I'm quite sure that the optimisations are correct this flag could be useful in the event of an unforeseen emergency.

Finally, you might notice that the `RewardCache` appears quite useless in its current form because it is only updated on the hot-path immediately before proposal. My hope is that in future we can shift calls to `RewardCache::update` into the background, e.g. while performing the state advance. It is also forward-looking to `tree-states` compatibility, where iterating and indexing `state.{previous,current}_epoch_participation` is expensive and needs to be minimised.

Bodypart code cleanup, robotic limbs can actually be disabled through damage again. (#71739)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Cleans up various variables and code comments in bodypart code so that
it is easier to understand (hopefully) what the fuck is happening there.

Fixes a hilarious oversight. For what may have been an entire 2 year
span, robotic limbs were unable to be disabled whatsoever. Good stuff.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Lost all your limbs and now have only surplus prosthetics?
Congratulations! You're now more durable than even someone with proper
robotic limbs, as your arms do not contribute anything more than 10
damage (or 15 stamina) to your overall damage taken. Furthermore, taking
the maximum amount of damage is actually entirely meaningless to you.

Laugh as someone attempting to shoot your arms does almost no meaningful
damage once you hit the cap! It's all sunk cost! You can't have it blown
off anyway, because dismembering surplus limbs is gone!

Who knew getting into a horrible bluespace/goliath accident could have
such an impact on your combat prowess. Thanks Nanotrasen!

Anyway, these vars are ugly.

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags

all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
code: Makes a lot of the bodypart variables clearer as to what they do.
Includes more detailed code comments.
fix: Robotic limbs are no longer immune to being disabled through
reaching maximum damage.

                               .zsh/hash.private

I am not too worried about the Raycast ones, because I'll always decrypt
on macOS, and that's the only place I use Raycast.

But ".gitconfig.d" could be a problem. If we include such a file without
decrypting it, Git will complain about bad config.

Likewise if we source the ".zsh" items and they are full of gibberish
because they're still encrypted, that will cause problems.

So, as mitigation:

1. In the ".zsh" files, we avoid sourcing them if we detect a magic
   header indicating that the file is still encrypted. I didn't want to
   call out to `git-cipher is-encrypted` from my shell startup files,
   because I want shell startup to be fast.

2. In the ".gitconfig.d" files, we'll skip over them if they aren't
   decrypted. Note that if you then do a `git-cipher lock`, the link
   will start pointing at ciphertext that Git will consider to be
   invalid garbage. In practice, we already have this problem with lots
   of other dotfiles; you're not really supposed to lock a repository
   that you're actively using to provide configuration to your machine.

In the "ssh" aspect,  we have similar stuff going on. The main
"~/.ssh/config" file is templated out, and we won't do that if it is not
decrypted. It itself includes files that are links to (hopefully)
decrypted files. We skip creating those links if things aren't
decrypted, with the same results: if you later lock, they will suddenly
become invalid, and you probably shouldn't do that.

Includes submodule update:

* vendor/git-cipher 35ab0b5...17e05c5 (5):
  > style: format more docs
  > feat(add): staged new files in Git index
  > docs: clean out old documentation
  > refactor: uncomment some code
  > refactor: remove dead code

Make the quick sketch UI less clunky. #743

Let the map be panned even when we're snapped to an intersection.
Previously it's super obnoxious to start drawing a route in a huge map.
Also I'd love to switch to the new World API and stop with this ad-hoc
logic, but slightly confused about how to do that here...

Also add a reset button, otherwise I just switch tabs to force a reset,
which is silly.

## About The Pull Request

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->
Adds a huge ass crowbar to robotics (the mech removal tool), it deals 5
damage unwielded, or 19 wielded. (should be fine, considering robotics
also has the easiest access to the materials needed for a chainsaw)
You can use it while wielded on mechs to break the occupants out. This
takes 5 seconds (or 3 in an unenclosed mech like a ripley)
When you die in a mech you no longer automatically get ejected.
refactors fire axe cabinets to support more items than the fireaxe
makes some vehicle code better
closes #70845 (you can still enter a mech without limbs, i think thats
fine because you can use it to protect yourself from death in a
dangerous situation or something until someone breaks you out with the
really large crowbar)

## Why It's Good For The Game

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->
robotics having a giant ass crowbar to break people out of mechs seems
like a fun idea
you currently cant exit a mech if youre incapacitated inside it unless
you DIE

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,

converts contraband file into poster file, makes holiday posters work (kind of) (#72131)

## About The Pull Request

The first part of this is just something that bothered me when I was
messing around with something that I will PR in the new year,
contraband.dm and dmi is ONLY posters. There's nothing else in there and
there are plenty of official posters, and if with #71717 we will also
add holiday posters to the mix then I think that its time to retire
contraband and make it poster.

Some small things I did while messing with it was change some variables
that were single letters into actual variable names, but overall this
part of the pr is not a player facing change.

That said, speaking of #71717 I think that it didn't work? Or didn't
work the way that it was supposed to? All of the spawned posters aren't
instances of festive posters, they are instances of normal posters, so
the code on initialize was not doing anything and the only reason the
holiday_none poster was showing up was because of the proc in randomize
spawning the posters in as those other posters. Because it didn't
actually _become_ poster/official/festive it never could do the proc
that turns it into a poster for the holiday that is actually occurring.

But then when I made it work and it turned into the generic posters I
decided that it would be better if instead of 30% of all posters being a
half finished mess, that if there wasn't a holiday poster it just
wouldn't replace them at all. I have poster Ideas and Dreams so I will
try to help with adding to more holiday posters but not in this PR.

What IS in this PR though, is a new traitor poster that appears during
the holidays.

This is a generic evil holiday poster that will replace normal evil
posters in the evil poster objective, because I agree with #72003 that
it should be a feature.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Contraband file is just posters already, this is easier for people to
find the posters.
I like holiday posters and think that we should have them and add more,
it is a fun easy thing to add to a lot of the microholidays to make them
more visible in addition to the name generation, but I don't want to see
the unfinished holiday poster so I do think that it's better to only
have them spawn if the holiday actually has a poster. Looking forward to
febuary!

## Changelog

:cl:
add: during holidays the spread syndicate propaganda through posters
objective has a chance of spawning evil holiday poster
fix: framework for holiday posters is more functional and modular
code: contraband.dm file and contraband.dmi file are both now poster.dm
and poster.dmi
