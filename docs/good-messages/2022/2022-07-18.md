Update db.py

* Change enter and exit for DBConnection
    - Initially was thinking to have a single persistent session and the instance would be transient
   - Changed my mind to make the entire connection transient, but I was tired and... yea...
    - Illogical to check for an existing session if it's supposed to create a new one each time??? like
    - Even worse was that, since exit only called `session.close`, the check for a session would actually return True, and so it wouldn't ever make a new one omg
    - Now, it disposes of the engine and the session on exit. Is the engine part needed? I literally don't know. But better safe than sorry? ü§°
    - Overall it's kind of a mess, like why am I still using a class variable? It's there to prevent creating multiple sessions, but if I don't want to reuse sessions then...?

* Basically, I don't know what I really want this class to do yet
    - I'm sure it will become clearer when I learn more about databases
    - But for now it's gonna be ugly messy and questionable
        * In other words, no different than the rest of my work  (:

* Add docstrings
* Delete models.py since it was all moved into db.py

To verify this violation and molestation of my privacy, at all relevant times were upon knowledge and belief conducted in the County of New York. As to the full scope of artifacts available on the internet, have not been viewed, distributed and tampered, however certain of those were at all relevant times without my consent exhibited in the annex of exhibits which verify and are aligned with all allegations in this COMPLAINT. For reasonable cause demonstrates the molestation of my sanctity while I resided at the STUDIO apartment and under the auspice and supervision of the ZUCKERS, YUZERS and ELSERS as furthered hereunder are all located in the County of New York whereby the Clerk McKenzie is no longer available for the evening LISTSERV emails as well, has requested that not to enjoin himself henceforth furthered in the affairs of the ZUCKERS, YUZERS, ELSERS, and their ACCESSORIES who are named hereunder and in the MATERIAL FACTS for reasonable cause are liable jointly and severally for each cause of action as set forth.

Thanks again to the Courts for your assistance.

DID NOT CONCENT TO THE FILMING OF THE INTERIOR OF MY APARTMENT ‚Äì SORRY.

1.
https://github.com/BSCPGROUPHOLDINGSLLC/ELSER-AND-DICKER/pull/5


2. entered by the Zuckers, and for the Zuckers by their counselor (the Ingram Law Firm and the Elsear Law Firms)
- without consent at all times was filming the interior (see also: ladder) mounting the camera‚Ä¶

________________________________________

BTW.. How does this read Ricki? Did you tell your associate counselors ‚Äúthe YUZERS‚Äù as enjoined 
ÔÇß	They ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù enjoyed the occasional crack a little too frequently, maybe they smoked together with the ZUCKERS?
ÔÇß	Something to save them ‚Äì other than that‚Ä¶
ÔÇß	 I would like to know where I was positioned on the radiator on or around the 27th of April in 2020‚Ä¶ peeping from the corridor I see as well?
Now‚Ä¶ about those tapes??? 
Where are the videos, are they still on the internet? 
ÔÇß	I had a quick question: now where exactly are my tapes exactly being held? 
ÔÇß	I promise I did not BCC any authority here, as requested by your client (which means I definitely did). 

Mrs. Hanrahan? Mr. Rubin? Do you also no longer want to participate like the Clerk in the PRYOR?
ÔÇß	Did you see any checkbox on the lease Mrs. Hanrahan - on page 21 for instance also Rickie is that the Polk stereo corporation I was having difficulties understandings to the fine prints as well.

Readds buckshot to the autolathe

I used the shotgun. You know why? Cause the shot gun doesn't miss, and unlike the shitty hybrid taser it stops a criminal in their tracks in two hits. Bang, bang, and they're fucking done. I use four shots just to make damn sure. Because, once again, I'm not there to coddle a buncha criminal scum sucking faggots, I'm there to 1) Survive the fucking round. 2) Guard the armory. So you can absolutely get fucked. If I get unbanned, which I won't, you can guarantee I will continue to use the shotgun to apprehend criminals. Because it's quick, clean and effective as fuck. Why in the seven hells would I fuck around with the disabler shots, which take half a clip just to bring someone down, or with the tazer bolts which are slow as balls, impossible to aim and do about next to jack shit, fuck all. The shotgun is the superior law enforcement weapon. Because it stops crime. And it stops crime by reducing the number of criminals roaming the fucking halls.

	(c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

	(b) receives any benefit from the organisation.
(4) For the purposes of this section, facilitation of an offence does not require knowledge of a particular offence the commission of which is facilitated, or that an offence actually be committed.

I have taken the entirety of a day to ponder if anyone actually uses Rave anymore

so I removed it
if you genuinely use rave as a genuine play mode in OutFox I am so sorry

also new wheel thanks @Jousway!!!! I'm working on not making it like lag like shit going to the wheel and stuff like removing the need to press start once before you can press start to initially open a folder, and removing the background and making the header/footer go above the wheel but outside of that yeah it's nice and I like it!

fix: Removed "tsukene" as the name of the base stage, using now just "base" as the name.

"tsukene" sounded bad, to be honest. Like something that some joke project such as Ataraxia would do -- after all, "look, I watch animes and read some Nietzche, I'm so smart and superior to you guys uWu".

Thank God my japanese culture references are sane, but anyway, let use something that comes from Latin. Nobiscum Deus :^) üôè

vroummmmmmmm (#44)

* vroummmmmmmm fix and remove unused import of turtle.up which was causing all sorts of problems with starting the bot, you know, not everyone configures their python for tkinter just for the fun of it, some people just want to run a dumb bot without having to get into computer graphics, after all, we live in a free country, don't we. In any case, this commit message is already quite a bit longer than the commit itself so I shall end it here, wish you a lovely day, and thank you for reading until the end.
* vroum vroum, i was so focused on writing my long and intricated commit message that I forgot to remove the line which I had originally commented for testing. It's been a long day, I hope you can forgive this oversight, I promise I will try to be more careful in the future, I wouldn't want to pollutte the commit history with dozens of unnecessary commits with ridiculous messages, that would just be hard to read and make it confusing for the next guy. I care about the future maintaineers of this project and that is why I solemnly vow to produce only the highest quality commits, I will work according to the highest standards, fully compliant with ISO 5055. No longer shall commits affect just one line of code! No longer shall commit messages be long yet uninformative! No longer shall developer time be wasted on stupid jokes! Our mission is clear: produce good code, that is all. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, and have a wonderful evening.

If you're reading this, I hope you're having at least a decent 3rd weekend of December. Hopefully next year won't be such a trashfire. #miracles ; Thanks to all the people who have helped make this year be not a _complete_ clusterfuck; small update. more backlog clearing. Next will hopefully be exec/evasion cleanup, then the redteam page and adding actual 'team' content to it. Shoutout agin to S for the much appreciated criticism. Here's to hoping for no new pandemics/genocides/wars/complete collapse of society for at least the next year. #smallmiracles

MGMT-10973: Enable DNS validations if coredns or keepalived static pod manifests in day-2 connectivity-check ignition

For context, this is a service-side follow-up to:

https://github.com/openshift/assisted-installer-agent/pull/388

and also this small agent fix https://github.com/openshift/assisted-installer-agent/pull/403

# Goal

During day-2 installations, we want the service to optionally perform
DNS validations when the worker attempts to join none-platform clusters.

# Issue

When the cluster is imported via our `.../v2/clusters/import` endpoint,
we have no way to know whether that cluster is a none-platform cluster
or cluster with managed networking (e.g. baremetal), so we have no way
to know whether we should perform the DNS validation or not. We wouldn't
like to have that validation on all the time, because it's unnecessarily
annoying for clusters with managed networking.

# Background

As part of our existing API connectivity-check, the service asks the
agent to download the worker.ign file from the to-be-joined-cluster's
machine-config-server, then send that back to the service.

# Solution

The contents of that file include information that will allow the
service to make an educated guess about whether the ignition originated
from a cluster with managed networking or not.

Also, a new "imported" column has been added to clusters, to indicate
whether they were created through a conversion or through being
imported. This is important because the solution should only be
applied for imported clusters, and this will provide a good way
to tell apart imported from non-imported clusters.

Also, when a user imports a cluster, we will inspect the `params.NewImportClusterParams.APIVipDnsname`
parameter and extract:

- The cluster name
- The cluster base domain

The cluster name will override the name given in `params.NewImportClusterParams.Name`,
see diff comment for more information on why.

The cluster base domain will be used to set the `BaseDNSDomain` of the
cluster, because up until now we didn't set it for imported cluster.

The reason `BaseDNSDomain` and `Name` have to be correctly set is
because the DNS validations use them to construct the domain names
that are being validated.

Also updated some validation messages for the API connectivity check and
DNS validations.

Also, the clusterdeployments_controller can now import SNO clusters,
it was an oversight that should have been done as part of 4cda26533d377f453f68783e8b2eae438734555d (#3404)

# Ignition Files

The ignition files we currently look at are:

```
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/coredns.yaml
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/keepalived.yaml
```

This is a hack - since we have no official way to know whether a worker
ignition file originated from a cluster with managed networking or not,
we instead rely on the presence of coredns and keepalived pod manifests
to indicate that. We only expect those to be present in clusters with
managed networking. To be a bit more robust, the service will consider
the presence of any one of them to mean that the cluster has managed
networking. This gives us better forwards compatibility if one of them
gets renamed / replaced with other technologies in future OCP versions.

Another way in which this is hacky is that users could manually create
static pods with the same name as part of their machine-configs, in
which case we would have a false-positive detection. But that is
admittedly very unlikely.

Hopefully we can negotiate with the relevant OCP teams to have a more
official, stable way to have this detection - like a magic empty file
placed somewhere in the ignition that we can check for the presence of.
Once we have such file, we can slowly deprecate this detection mechanism
and fully move to the new one by inspecting that file instead.

[clang] Implement ElaboratedType sugaring for types written bare

Without this patch, clang will not wrap in an ElaboratedType node types written
without a keyword and nested name qualifier, which goes against the intent that
we should produce an AST which retains enough details to recover how things are
written.

The lack of this sugar is incompatible with the intent of the type printer
default policy, which is to print types as written, but to fall back and print
them fully qualified when they are desugared.

An ElaboratedTypeLoc without keyword / NNS uses no storage by itself, but still
requires pointer alignment due to pre-existing bug in the TypeLoc buffer
handling.

---

Troubleshooting list to deal with any breakage seen with this patch:

1) The most likely effect one would see by this patch is a change in how
   a type is printed. The type printer will, by design and default,
   print types as written. There are customization options there, but
   not that many, and they mainly apply to how to print a type that we
   somehow failed to track how it was written. This patch fixes a
   problem where we failed to distinguish between a type
   that was written without any elaborated-type qualifiers,
   such as a 'struct'/'class' tags and name spacifiers such as 'std::',
   and one that has been stripped of any 'metadata' that identifies such,
   the so called canonical types.
   Example:
   ```
   namespace foo {
     struct A {};
     A a;
   };
   ```
   If one were to print the type of `foo::a`, prior to this patch, this
   would result in `foo::A`. This is how the type printer would have,
   by default, printed the canonical type of A as well.
   As soon as you add any name qualifiers to A, the type printer would
   suddenly start accurately printing the type as written. This patch
   will make it print it accurately even when written without
   qualifiers, so we will just print `A` for the initial example, as
   the user did not really write that `foo::` namespace qualifier.

2) This patch could expose a bug in some AST matcher. Matching types
   is harder to get right when there is sugar involved. For example,
   if you want to match a type against being a pointer to some type A,
   then you have to account for getting a type that is sugar for a
   pointer to A, or being a pointer to sugar to A, or both! Usually
   you would get the second part wrong, and this would work for a
   very simple test where you don't use any name qualifiers, but
   you would discover is broken when you do. The usual fix is to
   either use the matcher which strips sugar, which is annoying
   to use as for example if you match an N level pointer, you have
   to put N+1 such matchers in there, beginning to end and between
   all those levels. But in a lot of cases, if the property you want
   to match is present in the canonical type, it's easier and faster
   to just match on that... This goes with what is said in 1), if
   you want to match against the name of a type, and you want
   the name string to be something stable, perhaps matching on
   the name of the canonical type is the better choice.

3) This patch could exposed a bug in how you get the source range of some
   TypeLoc. For some reason, a lot of code is using getLocalSourceRange(),
   which only looks at the given TypeLoc node. This patch introduces a new,
   and more common TypeLoc node which contains no source locations on itself.
   This is not an inovation here, and some other, more rare TypeLoc nodes could
   also have this property, but if you use getLocalSourceRange on them, it's not
   going to return any valid locations, because it doesn't have any. The right fix
   here is to always use getSourceRange() or getBeginLoc/getEndLoc which will dive
   into the inner TypeLoc to get the source range if it doesn't find it on the
   top level one. You can use getLocalSourceRange if you are really into
   micro-optimizations and you have some outside knowledge that the TypeLocs you are
   dealing with will always include some source location.

4) Exposed a bug somewhere in the use of the normal clang type class API, where you
   have some type, you want to see if that type is some particular kind, you try a
   `dyn_cast` such as `dyn_cast<TypedefType>` and that fails because now you have an
   ElaboratedType which has a TypeDefType inside of it, which is what you wanted to match.
   Again, like 2), this would usually have been tested poorly with some simple tests with
   no qualifications, and would have been broken had there been any other kind of type sugar,
   be it an ElaboratedType or a TemplateSpecializationType or a SubstTemplateParmType.
   The usual fix here is to use `getAs` instead of `dyn_cast`, which will look deeper
   into the type. Or use `getAsAdjusted` when dealing with TypeLocs.
   For some reason the API is inconsistent there and on TypeLocs getAs behaves like a dyn_cast.

5) It could be a bug in this patch perhaps.

Let me know if you need any help!

fix(mu4e): support mu 1.8

Thanks to some combination of ignorance and obstinance, mu4e has thrown
compatibility to the wind and completely ignored the exitance of
define-obsolete-function-alias. Coupled with the inconsistent/partial
function renaming, this has made the mu4e 1.6‚ü∂1.8 change particularly
annoying to deal with.

By suffering the pain of doing the mu4e author's work for them, we can
use defalias to give backwards compatibility a good shot for about 60
functions. Some mu4e~x functions are now mu4e--x, others are unchanged,
and then you've got a few odd changes like mu4e~proc -> mu4e--server and
mu4e-search-rerun. The form of message :from entries has also changed,
and a new (mu4e) entrypoint added supplanting mu4e~start.

Cosmetic changes to numerous recipes

This commit only touches recipes whose `:files' property contains an
`:exclude' element, because I had to look at all those recipes for an
only marginally related reason.

To an extend these changes only reflect my own personal preference, so
I will explain the types of changes I have made.  This should serve as
a starting point for a future discussion in case we want to encourage
a certain style or even enforce it.

- Lines should be intended as `indent-for-tab-command' would, except
  in special-cases such as in the recipe of `use-package', which is
  also a macro with special indentation rules; we override those
  because the `use-package' in use-package's recipe is not that macro,
  it is just a symbol appearing as the first element of a data list.

- I prefer it if there is a newline between the package symbol (the
  car) and the plist that follows, but usually only add it to existing
  recipes when lines would otherwise get to long.  I also do not
  change this if I am not making any other changes that affect more
  than one line.

- Either the complete list should be on a single line or each line
  should contain only one key/value pair.  The first pair may share a
  line with the package symbol (see previous point).  If the recipe
  needs more than one line, then two key/value pairs should never
  appear on one line.  Newline characters are cheap enough these days.

- `:fetcher' should come before `:url' or `:repo', not least because
  the former dictates which of the latter two is required/valid.  You
  can also think of the fetcher as the type or class of the recipe,
  which IMO should come first, like in code: (git-fetcher :url val).

- The most common keywords should be specified in this order:
  `:fetcher', `:url'/`:repo', `:files'.  Other keywords should go
  either before or after `:files' (but preferable not on both sides
  of that for any given recipe).

- A common value of `:files' is: (:defaults (:exclude "...")).
  This could be split across multiple lines, but writing everything
  on one line makes it easier to read it as 'use the defaults, except
  exclude "..."':

    :files (:defaults (:exclude "..."))

- If the value of `:files' is too long for one line, then place
  newlines "semantically", instead of trying to "save space".  For
  example any element that is a list should appear on its own line.
  Two sibling lists should never appear on the same line.  String
  siblings should also not appear on one line in many cases, though
  it might makes sense (but isn't my preference) to group them by
  "type" as in:

    (:defaults
     "foo/*.el" "bar/*.el"
     "docs/foo/*.texi" "docs/bar/*.texi"
     (:exclude "..."))

- While there may be multiple (:exclude ...) elements, I've merged
  them into one.  Mostly for future proofing.

- The position of `:exclude' elements in `:files' value is significant
  in theory.  However in most cases it already appears at the very end
  and I have moved it there in cases where the order is not
  significant.  Mostly for future proofing.

Use QML SelectionSizeToolTip

remove hideWindow

don't make window transparent

not needed

use isGuiIntitiated

use new window sizing code paths

moved some stuff around to make it easier to get the timing for window
sizing right and also make stuff happening to the window happen in the
window class.

shorten code line

do touchEvent later

set up window color

dialog size/positioning

clean up

stuff I forgot

set cursors via hoverMoveEvent

make SelectionEditor a FocusScope

remove unneeded files

use native text rendering by default

add border and transparency to info box

Selection: add rect, rectItersectsRect, rectContainsRect, fix setX/setY

SelectionEditor: add dragLocation property

SelectionEditor: add dprRound

remove qpainter size tooltip

cleanup

InfoBackground -> FloatingBackground

temp: disable mandatory clang-format

god it's annoying. will remove this change later

add placeholder floating toolbar

will use for future functionality

SelectionEditor: add handlesRect property, clean/fix up painting

- exposes the area where the handles are to QML
- fixes some visual glitches
- makes the visual selection area slightly more accurate to what the
actual selected area is
- no longer changes stored data while painting

update overlay

Selection: add qDebug output

Selection: add dpr to debug output

clean up painting

SelectionEditor: Always use QPointF for mouse positions

If you don't, then you will lose precision when the GUI is scaled up.

SelectionEditor: combine size tooltip with toolbar when they overlap

SelectionEditor: redorder some functions for my convenience

Add SpectacleImageProvider

clean up

might delete this file later

cleanup and fix clazy/clang-tidy warnings

move invokable dprRound to SpectacleWindow, rename some qml files

add ImageView

SelectionEditor: comment formatting

SpectacleWindow: set max size in setGeometryFromScreensRect

SpectacleWindow: testing max DPR hack

theoretically, this should allow Spectacle to always use the max DPR on
Wayland so that higher DPR screens never have low resolution graphics.
Will likely cause serious performance issues until we switch to using
more QSG stuff for the SelectionEditor.

SpectacleWindow: use base/view background color for image view

Polish ImageView, add save/copy functions, make positioning work on wayland

really disable pre-commit hooks

missed this. it's temporary.

ensure image is always only just as big as it needs to be

clip ImageView toolbar while resizing, fix up padding

Focus qml item when not in selection mode

Add OptionsMenu

keep settings dialog above parent window

make acceptSelection public again

put rectangle selection first

ExportMenu: Add open screenshot folder and print actions

Change menus to just Export, Options and Help

Remove window state changing stuff

It works very poorly with Wayland

Fill image selection toolbar with real buttons

OptionsMenu: add all the actions

OptionsMenu: make showPreferencesDialog public

Allow window to be transparent for video recording UI

Show stats for different times & days of week

Added a dropdown for Sunday morning, Saturday evening, and Friday
evening. If you click it then we change the stats in the table. Popups
show stats for that time too.

We had to fix some bugs about how we were getting driving times from
Google. We have to pass `departure_time` not `arrival_time` because
`arrival_time` is ignored for everything but `transit` (i.e. bus, train,
etc.). We still need to update some variables and the database column to
say `departure_time` not `arrival_time`. Also we should probably move
the times we're asking about by about thirty seconds, so they correctly
capture that you'll be leaving during rush hour.

Also if Google is giving you traffic-based drive times, their result
includes both a `duration` value and a `duration_in_traffic` value. So
we should use the `duration_in_traffic` one.

But we had *one* element in the driving time grid where that attribute
was missing. (We don't know why it was missing. I guess that is only one
family/church combo, so not even all results for a family or all results
for a church.) In that case, just fall back to `duration`. Perhaps we
should be printing a warning, but the output is already pretty noisy.

We fixed another bug where calling `(t / 60).toFixed(0)` was giving "-0"
for small negative `t`. Calling `Math.round(t / 60).toString()` doesn't
do that.

"12:05pm. Today Kaiji, Fabiniku, AyaTri, Dong Bai and are out. I finished Kaiji before I left, Fabiniku just now and only the last two are left.

Let me finish those two as well as desert and I will get some work done. Let me update VS 2019 in the background...I was wrong. It is already up to date.

Hmmm, Davaeorn made a weapon guide.

https://youtu.be/5bWIgBtZdZE
Baldur's Gate Class Guide

He has this one too.

1:25pm. What the hell, just how long was I listening to the guy talk about axes and classes? Let me finally finish my reads and then I will start.

2pm. Let me start. I'll put in a few hours today.

Let me check out that paper.

2:10pm. Enough, let me move to the Youtube courses.

Cloud Computing Full Course In 11 Hours | Cloud Computing Tutorial For Beginners | Edureka

I am interested if it has any hands on stuff.

https://youtu.be/2LaAJq1lB1Q?t=3411

Let me check out the salary part.

Looking at the TOC, this seems like a contentless course.

...Forget it. This course is a waste of time. Let me check out the other ones.

These courses are basically programming, for people with 0 programming talent.

2:15pm. I really suspect that I did art wrong. I spent a lot of time watching tutorials for art, probably even more than I did for programming. This is a consequence of lack of talent. With talent you'd spend your time practicing, but instead I spent most of my time getting technical with 3d applications.

I think the main problem is - I am simply to lazy to get the necessary quality that I want out of 3d. It simply takes too long. Talent influences time and cost effectiveness of a particular path. In the end I got some skills and now I am back doing what I am really good at.

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification Course (CLF-C01) - Pass the Exam!

Having exams on how to use online services. I've never heard of something so ridiculous.

https://youtu.be/SOTamWNgDKc?t=1819

These courses are useless. The best way to learn AWS is to do some projects on it. You certainly would not cram a 13h course for something such as this.

The particular part where he talks about cloud provider tiers is a bit interesting. Let me just skim the course and then I will try some web/networking courses. Maybe I'll do an AWS ap as an exercise.

2:35pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q33KBiDriJY
Web Development Full Course - 10 Hours | Learn Web Development from Scratch | Edureka

Does this interest me? Well, HTML,CSS and JS is easy enough to grasp, but I am wondering towards the end how it is done. I keep hearing about the REST APIs and am wondering how those are used.

I have a certain vision - I want to know how to create an app and then scale in on the cloud.

These courses are instead buring me in trivia. If it was only 20m I would watch them, but I do not have time for all of this.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=27974

Let me watch this part towards the end just for a bit.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=28064

Actually this might be sligthly interesting to me. I wanted to see an example of a database in use.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=28170

Let me pause here for a bit. I want to go back and see what does he mean by MEAN app.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=27693
> MEAN is an acronym for MongoDC, Express, Angular and Node.js.

2:50pm. Right now I am having a mini-break. I've decided, even though this is 2.5 hours, it might be worth watching. I've never really looked into how regular CRUD apps are done. I am wondering whether he will do something to scale them.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=scalable+application

Maybe I should be watching tutorials on this?

I know concurrency, but it is a mystery to me how you would go from having a webapp to scaling it across 100s of servers. The same goes for databases. I've yet to really learn this aspect of web development.

Rather than being concerned about networking, maybe if I set my goal as scalable apps, it will bring me to an answer.

3:05pm. Oh right. This should be obvious to anybody. I am thinking why use databases instead of story everything to memory or read or write to hard drive?

Doing everything in memory would be fast, but would require a lot of expensive hardware. As for the hard drive, the naive approach would have you reading and writing for every single update. That would be extremely slow.

So databases offer a solution of how to make use of hard drive space effectively.

3:10pm. This is not something that the video covered, but this is something I need to keep in mind when forming my goals and establishing my motivation. Just why do I need databases - it is exactly for this reason. I certainly would not want to start writing my own way of loading a storing data.

3:15pm. This is the basic motivation for why I need databases. But even knowing that, the way to scale databases across machines is something else. I need to get familiar with patterns of scalability and relate that to the skills I already have.

...Not today, but later when I am studying ASP.NET I should approach it from the angle of how to scale it to 100s of machines. That way when I get to AWS cloud a week later, I'll be able to compare the two.

Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach

I'll reserve this course for tomorrow. These basics I should get familiar in more depth. I already know a lot, but I've never covered this material systematically.

3:25pm. https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#connect-to-mongodb

So this thing runs as a service in the background, much like Spiral's language server.

...I won't look through the docs as to how it is used right now. Let me get back to the course. I'll figure out when I see the guy doing it. I wonder what he will use to interface with the service? Probably not ZeroMQ.

3:35pm. https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=28572

Doing an exercise like this once in my life would not be bad. Doing a CRUD app is easy, but has some interesting challenges to it.

One challenge which I've surmounted in the past few years is UI abstraction. Rx is really good wrapping around legacy UI frameworks. And there are newer libraries and even reactive languages like Svelte and Elm.

Another challenge is scaling them out. I know I could use Erlang-style frameworks for this. ZeroMQ could be used as well if you want to write your own protocols. This would be viable in Spiral, but not something I want to deal with in C#/F# code.

But what would be the best to do here? There are two subquestions to that:

* What would be the best for servers?
* What would be the best for databases?

How could databases be distributed, I should look for an answer to that. It should not be too hard to answer given all the information out there. When I get to AWS and Azure I'll contrast my book learning here with hands on experience there. Once I finish these little projects here, I'll be ready to challenge the interviews.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=28655

Here is the usual binding to port numbers. ZeroMQ does that as well. Everyone does.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=28774

This is the minimalist approach. It is easy enough to understand. You set the serve to listen on a port, and when it gets a request, it sends text back.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=28956

I am thinking about what this does.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors

4pm. Nevermind figuring it out right now. I can't tell based on the examples what this is supposed to be doing. Let me just play along.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=29010

Seeing it being done hands on like this feels a lot more hands-on than the ASP.NET blob that gets dumped on you.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=29061

This might seem confusing, but note how close this code is pattern matching on a case, or using channels. It is the same principle. Being perplexed by this is wholy unecessary.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=29204

I see, so this is how it works.

4:15pm. https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=29257

Focus me, let me go on for a while longer. I still have 2:20h left and I will have to by necessity leave some for tomorrow.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=29500

Let me start speeding it up. This code is mostly self explanatory.

In fact, this is how it goes with web dev - there is a happy path, but if I am not careful I can get hung up about getting trying to really *understand* things. Unless I want to build networking libraries, I should avoid that impulse and stick to the happy path.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=29578

It turns out, connecting to the MongoDB server is a piece of cake.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=30135

This is straightforward. I am familiar with PostMan from my studies in 2020.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=30330

I think I get it. The backend is basically just what commnicates with the server. It parses the request and routes them to where they should go. The frontend will then be between the client and the server.

4:30pm. I think back in 2020, I didn't understand why Microsoft SQL came as a separate app. I expected the database to be some library run on the server, but it turns out it is a service.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=30513

These gives me traumatic flashbacks back to when I tried learning ASP.NET.

But it is fine. Assuming I can factor the frontend stuff, from the backend stuff, I can grok it.

I mean if you just run a database as some service which you message, just what is there to not understand? It is the easiest thing in the world. Presumably all the difficulty with webdev in the past was dealing with the physical stuff.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=30722

This is really putting me to sleep. This is just as bad as any of the .NET framework crap.

Nevermind, let me just speed through the Angular stuff. I do not really care about this. I just want to get a gist of how these app work in general.

After I have that, then I might want to try making some kind of web app that has a frontend, backend and uses a database as an exercise.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=31140

Is this right? Does it not have to assign in TS constructors?

https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html

...Maybe he will assign the contructor later. Nevermind that right now.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68242121/typescript-constructor-shorthand-when-parameters-are-passed-as-object

Ah, this is a shorthand notation. Note how it has private. Yes.

Let me resume.

4:50pm. Right now I am struggling not to fall asleep. I played BG2 till 1am yesterday and even woke up earlier than usual. I'll sleep like a rock tonight. But there is no excuse. I'll do it till 6pm.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=31628

Is this really regular HTML? I think it had something to do with Angular.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=32309

Note the subscribe here. Is this Rx?

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=32343

I should mention, all the big 3 frameworks, Angular, Reach and Vue are fairly messy. This is not high quality code by any means, but it is not the fault of the lecturer. The tools he is using are simply poor.

The right way is to use something like Elm or Svelte.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=32437

Oh this is the whole app. What are the last 1:20h for?

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=32476

Another app, this one is with GraphQL.

Anyway, the skeleton of the previous application is quite similar to Spiral's language server. Instead of the frontend, I have some TS code communicating with VS Code using its API. It is all concurrenct, and I am using ZeroMQ to communicate with the server.

Even though he is not using ZeroMQ for the communication, it is just sending messages around. As long as I focus on that, I won't get lost in the jungle of things.

I'll apply the same mindset when I am learning ASP.NET.

Forget the complicate stuff, and just focus on message routing. That is what you control. The other stuff will necessarily have to improvised, either by copying code from the internet or by the relevant framework's docs. It just boils down to random API calls.

I really shudder to think how much time I wasted trying to get a deeper insight back in 2020. What a waste of time.

No rather than calling it a waste of time, I was 100% successful in finding that deeper insight in the end. So I can use that experience to accelerate my learning here by 100 fold.

5:05pm. Let take a look at the second tutorial. GraphQL should be of some interest.

In this tutorial they will be using React.

https://graphql.org/

I thought he was going to use a graph based database, but graphql is something else.

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=32887

Is this not using Express?

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=32938
> We are not using Express directly, but under the hood GraphQL uses Express.

5:35pm. Let me take a short break here. This is pretty boring, but it did expand my view a little.

I think I understand what this is all about.

5:50pm. https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=33705

I am back, let me back up a bit. Just where was Todo defined?

https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=33222

Ah here. It is a MongoseDB model.

5:50pm. https://youtu.be/Q33KBiDriJY?t=33801

Ok, enough. Let me stop this here. It is not important. I definitely get the gist of it.

The only hard part of this is dealing with JS's poor syntax and general type unsafety.

Dependently typed languages could really revolutionize this kind of work. Spiral itself could do a lot to make this work easier.

Now...scalability. I want to watch some tutorials on that. Today I'll just icebreak for another 10m.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=scalable+application

Nothing really catches my eye here.

https://youtu.be/b449l8Vfu0A
How to Build Scalable Websites and Apps

This is the latest and it is only 9m. Tomorrow, I'll look into scaling ASP.NET applications. That will allow me to kill two birds with one stone.

https://youtu.be/b449l8Vfu0A?t=61
> Frontends are fundamentally scalable.

Yeah, makes sense.

https://youtu.be/b449l8Vfu0A?t=151
> The core is that the backend should not contain state.

I see. This makes sense, but is new to me. I was wondering how it would work if the backend had state, and it is informative to just be told that it should not. It makes thinking about the problem a lot easier.

https://youtu.be/b449l8Vfu0A?t=211

So you have to centralize it in the end. But wouldn't that ruin the benefits of horizontal scaling?

https://youtu.be/b449l8Vfu0A?t=266

This is actually a pretty good video.

https://youtu.be/b449l8Vfu0A?t=286
> You can use a distributed database.

This is the answer to my earlier question.

https://youtu.be/b449l8Vfu0A?t=455

I'll keep managed databases in mind. I had no idea they existed.

https://youtu.be/b449l8Vfu0A?t=474
> Always prefer S3 compared to storing files on your own. Always prefer lambda compared to upscaling, downscaling on your own.

6:10pm. https://youtu.be/b449l8Vfu0A?t=506
> When you are trying to design a backend that needs to be scaled, the stateless part is super important. Once you get that the management is relatively easier.

This advice plays 100% to my strengths as a programmer.

This is huge. I really was wondering how pros would scale backends given that state is a thing, but the advice I got is to just make it stateless. It gives me a key idea to focus on.

I was wondering about how databases could be distributed, but it turns out until you get to a certain size, you just don't.

I suppose if you get to a certain size, you could do database memoization. For example, have a separate database for every city or something like that, if you do not want to use distributed databases. But forget that. That is not something for me to worry about.

6:15pm. I'll close here for the day.

I'll want to watch a few other vids on this subject, they are all small.

I am thinking about it...

Yeah, there is no easy way to deal with tabular data once it reaches a certain size. You know what does a good job of that? The brain.

To get a real distributed database, you need proper distributed representations. Though the AWS course did say you can run warehousing databases with exabytes of data stored, so the limit could be higher than I expect.

6:20pm. Forget this stupid tangent. I am done for the day.

Tomorrow I will wrap this up and then play with ASP.NET after that. I want to redeem myself for 2020. I'll do a toy app that interfaces with a database and internalize that aspect of programming."

[READY] [KC13] Showing "The Derelict" some love: General updates, aesthetic changes and misc (#67696)

With this PR I aim to make KC13 (TheDerelict.dmm), or Russian Station (whatever you guys call it) a tad bit more flavorful with its environment as well as somethings on the mapping side (like adding area icons!).
To preface, no, I'm not remapping anything here extensively. The general layout should be relatively the same (or should be in theory).

Halfway through naming the area icons I checked the wiki page and found out it was KC not KS, so, its KS13 internally.

Readability for turf icons are cool.
Also just making the ruin more eye appealing would be better.
General cleanup and changes will give new life to this rather.. loved? Hated? Loot pinata? Ruin.
The ruin also now starts completely depowered, like Old Station (its a Derelict, it makes no sense for it to still be powered after so long). As for some mild compensation, a few more batteries were sprinkled in to offset any issues. If there is any concern of "But they'll open the vault faster!", there were always 5 batteries that people used to make the vault SMES.
Lastly, giving it some "visual story telling" is cool, as mapping fluff goes.

I also added a subtle OOC hint that the SMES in the northern most solar room needs a terminal with the following:

SMES Jumpscare
As an aside, I aim to try and keep the feel of this ruin being "dated" while at the same time having some of our newer things. With that, certain things I'll opt out of using in favor of more "generic" structures to give KC13 that true "Its old but not really" feel and look.

SmartSim Singularity Integration (#204)

[committed by @ben-albrecht]
[reviewed by @ashao]

This PR adds the ability for SmartSim to launch workloads in Singularity (Apptainer) as described in https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/issues/101. It also lays the groundwork for supporting other container runtimes such as docker, shifter, and podman in the future, as well as launching the orchestrator in a container.

## Design Variations

During development, it became clear that a few design changes from the original proposal were required. I have documented them below with their rationale:

#### 1. Argument name: `bind_paths` -> `mount`

The terms bind path and mount are mostly used interchangeably across different container runtimes. When writing tests, I kept forgetting if it was `bind_path` or `bind_paths`, which hinted to me that it was not a great arg name, so I swapped it out for the more succinct and easy to remember `mount`.

#### 2. `create_run_settings(..., container: str)` -> `create_run_settings(..., container: Container)`

We originally thought it would be easier for users to get started with containers by allowing them to pass a string into `create_run_settings(container='singularity')` instead of having to create a Container object. While writing tests, I realized that this was potentially very confusing for users because 1) the `container` arg types change between `create_run_settings` and `RunSettings`, and 2) if you need to add other metadata such as container args or container mount paths, you have to switch from using `create_run_settings` to `RunSettings` in your code, which is very annoying. Because creating Containers is so lightweight, I think it is best to keep the container interface consistent across all functions that accept them.

#### 3. dropped getter/setter methods

Because command generation and validation happens upon execution, users can freely modify `Container.args` and `Container.mount` without getter/setter methods to update any other state. Therefore, I dropped these methods from the interface.

## Testing

Added 2 test suites for containers: One for WLM testing and one for local testing. The local testing suite runs in GitHub actions. Due to the added time from building Singularity and pulling the `container-testing` image, the singularity testing only happens on one configuration of the build matrix: python 3.9 + redisai 1.2.5 on linux

Create H√´√§v√ø M√´t√§l √úml√§√ºts

Your retro heavy metal band, V√Ñx√´n, originally started as kind of a joke, just because why would anyone want to use the crappy foosball table in your startup's game room when they could be rocking out at top volume in there instead? Yes, a joke, but now all the top tech companies are paying you top dollar to play at their conferences and big product-release events. And just as how in the early days of the Internet companies were naming everything "i"-this and "e"-that, now that V√Ñx√´nm√§n√Ø√§ has conquered the tech world, any company that doesn't use H√´√§v√ø M√´t√§l √úml√§√ºts in √´v√´ry p√∂ss√Øbl√´ pl√§c√´ is looking hopelessly behind the times.

Well, with great power chords there must also come great responsibility! You need to help these companies out by writing a function that will guarantee that their web sites and ads and everything else will R√ñCK √ÑS M√úCH √ÑS P√ñSS√èBL√ã! Just think about it -- with the licensing fees you'll be getting from G√∂√∂gl√´, F√§c√´b√∂√∂k, √Ñppl√´, and √Ñm√§z√∂n alone, you'll probably be able to end world hunger, make college and Marshall stacks free to all, and invent self-driving bumper cars. S√∂ l√´t's g√´t r√∂ck√Øng and r√∂ll√Øng! P√´dal t√∂ th√´ M√ãT√ÑL!

Here's a little cheatsheet that will help you write your function to replace the so-last-year letters a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-y with the following totally rocking letters:

A = √Ñ = \u00c4     E = √ã = \u00cb     I = √è = \u00cf
O = √ñ = \u00d6     U = √ú = \u00dc     Y = ≈∏ = \u0178
a = √§ = \u00e4     e = √´ = \u00eb     i = √Ø = \u00ef
o = √∂ = \u00f6     u = √º = \u00fc     y = √ø = \u00ff

Rollup merge of #98717 - RalfJung:make-tidy-less-annoying, r=jyn514

get rid of tidy 'unnecessarily ignored' warnings

I think these warnings are quite pointless: when I say `allow(foo)` in my code, that doesn't necessarily mean that I expect `foo` to happen -- it just means that I am okay with `foo` happening.

For example, having to add and remove `ignore-tidy-linelength` as the longest line in the file keeps growing and shrinking is just annoying and doesn't benefit anyone, IMO. This usually incurs *two* CI roundtrips: first CI tells you that line lengths in your test file are ignored unnecessarily, so you go and remove that attribute; then CI tells you that now your line numbers changed, so you re-bless your tests (often takes >5min if parts of rustc need rebuilding because `./x.py fmt` changed something somewhere). That's just a lot of wasted effort and time and patience.

Revisiting The Goliath: Or, that time I dripped out the SBC Starfury just because (#68126)

Drips the SHIT out of the SBC Starfury while not completely overhauling it. Touches everything NOT in engineering or southward (because I love how scuffed that part is and refuse to touch it on principle) - Also converts one map varedit into a real boy subtype, and moves tiny fans to their own file.

Mandatory disclosure on the gameplay changes:
Fighters 1 and 3 are now NOT in the hangar, and are now attached to the formerly unused gunnery rooms.
Cryo now works. Yeah. I know.
You can actually open the anesthetic closet now.
Everyone now shares three spawners. This doesn't reduce the amount of people who can play when this rolls, as I've adjusted var/uses in accordance: it just reduces clutter.
A few of the horizontal double airlocks have been compacted into glass_large airlocks.
The bar windows now actually have grilles like they were meant to.
Four turbines have shown up. They aren't functional*, they just look like gunnery and conveniently fit in the spots. I'm sure this is space OSHA compliant.
The map is ever so slightly smaller, vertically. This should distance us from an edge case where somehow all space levels are too cluttered for this to spawn properly, for the time being.

*Technically there's nothing stopping you from using them besides the amount of time it'd take for the operatives to kick your ass

This map was originally designed wayyy back before we even had the computer sprites we have now, (#27760 if you want to see SOUL) and it shows. While it will never have it's SM again, we can at least make the thing much nicer to look at.
