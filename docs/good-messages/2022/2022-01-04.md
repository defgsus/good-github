Formatted copy paste errors in the devops file. I can honestly say I have never once in my life wanted to copy formatting first, and this is a hill I'm happy to die on by myself but I can't stand that feature and I'd wish it never ever existed ever in any multiverse if I ever found a djinn lamp

Add CodingFantasy's CSS coding interactive games (#5490)

* Add "Knights of the Flexbox table" game

Welcome to the Knights of the Flexbox table. A game where you can help Sir Frederic Flexbox and his friends to uncover the treasures hidden in the Tailwind CSS dungeons.
You can navigate the knight through the dungeon by changing his position within the dungeon using Flexbox and Tailwind CSS.

* Add "Flex Box Adventure" game

Once upon a time, there was a King Arthur. He ruled his kingdom fair and square. But Arthur had one problem. He was a very naive person. So one sunny day, three alchemist brothers offered Arthur to exchange all his Gold Coins for coins made of a more valuable new metal that they had invented - Bit Coins.

Arthur believed them and gave them all his gold. The brothers took the gold and promised to give the bit coins back to Arthur in seven days.

Seven days passed. The brothers have not turned up. Arthur realized he had been scammed. He is angry and intends to take revenge on them. Let's help him do it with our weapon – CSS Flex Box!

We made this game for You
1. You often stumble and try to figure out which combination of Flex Box properties makes the browser do what you want it to do.

2. You want to create complex web layouts without constantly looking at the web page after every Cmd/Ctrl+S press in the code editor.

3. You have tried to learn Flex Box with video tutorials and articles but still don't fully understand how some parts of it work.

4*. Or, if you are a master of CSS Flex Box, we have something interesting and for you too (read further).

Have you found yourself there? Then you definitely want to learn or improve your Flex Box skills. So we have good news for you, really good news...

Learn Flex Box by Playing Game
No more boring videos, tutorials and courses. Learn Flex Box in a completely new, fun, effective and revolutionary way. By playing Flex Box coding game!

* Add "Grid Attack" coding game

In an ancient Elvish prophecy, it was said that one day a man would be born with an incredible power that predicts the future – "Marketi Predictori." And another will come to take this power. But the years went by and nothing happened. Until one day, a little elf was born. He was named Luke.

From an early age, he surprised his parents and his sister Rey by guessing the price of apples at the farmer's market before they even reached it. Every year his power rose and his predictions became more and more accurate. But there was one thing Luke could not predict. The coming of the demon Valcorian. It was the one from the prophecy that was to come and take Luke's power. One day Valcorian and his army attacked the town where Luke had lived and kidnapped him to make a ritual of stealing his power.

Go on a dangerous quest with Luke's sister Rey and find her brother. Defeat Valcorian and all his demons using a secret weapon – CSS Grid.

We made this game for You?
1. You often stumble and try to figure out which combination of Grid properties makes the browser do what you want it to do.

2. You are scared by the number of properties a CSS Grid has, and you feel uncomfortable when you need to create a grid layout.

3. You want to create complex web layouts using Grid, but without constantly looking at the web page after every "Cmd/Ctrl+S" press in the code editor.

4. You have tried to learn CSS Grid with video tutorials and articles but still don't fully understand how some parts of it work.

5. You use a Flex Box where Grid is required because you don't feel confident in using it.

Have you found yourself there? Then you definitely want to learn or improve your Grid skills. So we have good news for you, really good news...

Learn Grid by Playing CSS Game
No more boring videos, courses and articles. Learn Grid in a revolutionary new, fun, and effective way. By playing a Grid coding game!

wounded legs fixes

Document 'HWounded_legs' vs 'EWounded_legs'; they aren't used the way
other properties use their intrinsic and extrinsic values.  And they
switch from hero to steed when riding.  (Can't start riding when
hero's legs are wounded and the steed's legs magically heal when hero
dismounts, so existing wounds never transfer from one to the other.)

Having one leg become injured when the other already was would cure
the other leg but keep the longer of their two timeouts for the new
injury.  Eliminate that mystery cure.  Since their timeouts aren't
tracked separately, the best that can be done is to make both legs
eventually recover at the same time.

Make ^X report which leg is the wounded one when only one of them is.
(It already implicitly reports the both-legs case by using plural.)

When zapping a wand of probing downward while riding, include wounded
leg feedback for the steed.

Simplify wounded leg feedback when probing self a little bit.

Make drinking blessed potions of full healing cure wounded legs for
hero when not mounted or for steed when mounted.  (The latter is a
bit strange--hero drinks potion, steed gets affected--but it's magic.)

Make drinking uncursed potions of full healing or blessed potions of
extra healing cure wounded legs for hero (but not steed; the magic
either isn't that strong or maybe not that reliable...).

highlighted the first half of "Splitting the Soul"

indigence and defiance. war. here we rage against soul, and perhaps miss something of what soul is telling us. our lust for battle, our internal scream _to be free_, to defy obstacles in our path; all this blinds us from Truth and Light.

the soul is of a place of infinities. its nature is the being-of-all-things. our worldly minds cannot perceive all things simultaneously; many of us struggle with the seeing of even _one thing_ with clarity. if the soul presents some face, some personality, some archetype to us, this does not equate to the nature of the soul. it is a mask.

in this chapter we believe we rage against _soul,_ yet we merely rage against _mask._

is war against _mask_ worthwhile? perhaps. could it be _civil_ war? could we rage against the _mask_ that controls and subordinates us? could we become _peer_ instead of _serf_? could we stand *boldly,* _unyielding_ against such oppression? could we fight while hating the fight? _wrestle_ and not _kill_? minimize suffering, resolve the dispute, heal, _thrive._

Ender knows of this (and of trickery):

> In the moment when I truly _understand_ my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that _very moment_ I also _love_ him. I think it’s impossible to really _understand_ somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them... _I destroy them._

> I need you to be clever, Bean. I need you to think of solutions to problems we haven't seen yet. I want you to try things that no one has ever tried because they're absolutely stupid.

> The enemy's gate is _down._

> And always Ender carried with him a dry white cocoon, looking for a place where the hive-queen could awaken and thrive in peace. He looked a long time.

serial: core: Allow processing sysrq at port unlock time

[ Upstream commit d6e1935819db0c91ce4a5af82466f3ab50d17346 ]

Right now serial drivers process sysrq keys deep in their character
receiving code.  This means that they've already grabbed their
port->lock spinlock.  This can end up getting in the way if we've go
to do serial stuff (especially kgdb) in response to the sysrq.

Serial drivers have various hacks in them to handle this.  Looking at
'8250_port.c' you can see that the console_write() skips locking if
we're in the sysrq handler.  Looking at 'msm_serial.c' you can see
that the port lock is dropped around uart_handle_sysrq_char().

It turns out that these hacks aren't exactly perfect.  If you have
lockdep turned on and use something like the 8250_port hack you'll get
a splat that looks like:

  WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
  [...] is trying to acquire lock:
  ... (console_owner){-.-.}, at: console_unlock+0x2e0/0x5e4

  but task is already holding lock:
  ... (&port_lock_key){-.-.}, at: serial8250_handle_irq+0x30/0xe4

  which lock already depends on the new lock.

  the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:

         serial8250_interrupt+0x50/0xe8
         ...

  other info that might help us debug this:

   Possible unsafe locking scenario:

         CPU0                    CPU1
         ----                    ----
    lock(&port_lock_key);
                                 lock(console_owner);
                                 lock(&port_lock_key);
    lock(console_owner);

   *** DEADLOCK ***

The hack used in 'msm_serial.c' doesn't cause the above splats but it
seems a bit ugly to unlock / lock our spinlock deep in our irq
handler.

It seems like we could defer processing the sysrq until the end of the
interrupt handler right after we've unlocked the port.  With this
scheme if a whole batch of sysrq characters comes in one irq then we
won't handle them all, but that seems like it should be a fine
compromise.

[docs] Improve the chapter on debugging FE in doc.  (#7309)

At present, there are defects in the chapter on debugging FE in doc. My colleagues and I stepped on the pit when 
building the debugging environment, so I want to improve this chapter in combination with my own stepping on the pit 
experience.

The following is my explanation of the changes: 

1. mkdir -p ./thirdparty/installed/bin
explain: When I downloaded versions 0.14 and 0.15, there were no files under thirdparty, so I didn't know whether to 
create it myself or what to do. Finally, I decided to create it myself. I think it's necessary to add instructions here.

2. Add installation thrift@0.13.0 Failed handling method. 
explain: My colleagues and I failed to find the installation package when executing the installation command, and finally 
found a solution on GitHub. Therefore, I added the handling method of the problem to avoid other Mac users from 
getting stuck in this place.

3. Fixed an error in the generated code description.
explain: Before I finished building the code, I debugged FE, and I failed all the time. Idea hints that no files can be found. 
Later, after consulting with morningman in wechat group, it was understood that `mvn install -DskipTests` does not 
need to execute `mvn generate-sources` after execution. This is inconsistent with the description in the document and 
needs to be corrected.

as for the highlighting... a fortunate pairing: long effort on _Undertow_,  the briefest of chapter-topics. 

must the arrow have a direction? how long can we last before it points our way?

make it easier to understand how each cost is computed (#4733)

Ready to review!

This is a huge change which overhauls how parameter estimator works. Previously, we were running a bunch of estimations in order, which created interference between estimations (as they sometimes were re-using the same state), made it hard to run only subset of estimations (existing `--metrics-to-measure` flag partially alleviates the problem), and forced using a specific way to estimate all the costs (ie, if we wanted to use something else than "run a block with transactions" for estimation, that required ad-hoc code).

In the new setup, each cost is estimated by a single rust function. That function can do whatever, but there are helpers for common estimation methods, like the "run a block of transactions"  one. So, the end result looks like this: 

```rust
fn action_stake(ctx: &mut Ctx) -> GasCost {
    let total_cost = {
        let test_bed = ctx.test_bed();

        let mut make_transaction = |tb: &mut TransactionBuilder| -> SignedTransaction {
            let sender = tb.random_unused_account();
            let receiver = sender.clone();

            let actions = vec![Action::Stake(StakeAction {
                stake: 1,
                public_key: "22skMptHjFWNyuEWY22ftn2AbLPSYpmYwGJRGwpNHbTV".parse().unwrap(),
            })];
            tb.transaction_from_actions(sender, receiver, actions)
        };
        transaction_cost(test_bed, &mut make_transaction)
    };

    let base_cost = action_sir_receipt_creation(ctx);

    total_cost - base_cost
}
```

Notable changes in behavior: 

* we now prepare testbed with estimator contracts deployed. Previously, we prepared testbed with some trivial contract, and had a separate logic to populate it with estimator contracts. 
* we no-longer use `mean + 4*stddev` as the estimation. Instead, we just use `mean` but flag the cost as suspicious if we observe deviations of more than 15% during estimation. The two problems with stddev is that:
  *  it gives you *some* number instead of saying "hey, your measures are highly inconsistent and I can't give a sensible estimate"
  * it's not entirely statistically sound, as we are calculating stdev over blocks, and block already aggregates many transactions. 

But overall I've tried to preserve existing behavior as much as possible. I don't have a guarantee that I didn't make some stupid mistake for every specific cost, but I generally cross-referenced new results with old estimator and with current costs, and didn't find anything super weird except for #4836. After this is merged, I want to go through each cost and make sure it actually gives a reasonable, reproducible result which accounts for IO costs and matches our currently reployed cost table.

A new novel is born

...from the trash heap of the old one. This one wants to be written in
Present Tense because my subconscious latches on to PI novels... which I
am technically writing. Also the subheader with the resources is because
I'm playing Night Road right now. A little video game-y, but Cyberpunk
mostly is, I think. Started surrealistic, went criticism of society,
devolved into Black Mirror wrapped into rule of cool and here we are.

Export callUseQuery or support a multi-client environment

I have two GraphQL APIs in my app
I need to be able to provide myself two urql instances
As a consequence, I can't use useQuery as it injects the first (or last?!) provideClient client arg

I need to be able to create my own useThisApiQuery and useAnotherApiQuery functions with the respective client, and having this function exposed is a way for me to stich things together

A better solution may be to improve the provideClient and useClient functions with an optional argument that defaults to the currently used `'$urql'`, then improve the useQuery function with a second optional argument to select the correct client to run the query against
In this particular case, it would be trivial to reuse the functions provided by this library by doing so

```
provideClient(client, '$myApiIdentifier');
```

```
export function useMyApiQuery<T = any, V = object>(args: UseQueryArgs<T, V>) {
    return useQuery(args, '$myApiIdentifier');
}
```

To be honest, I may very well need to execute queries and it seems that the client's `executeQuery` function isn't very friendly towards executing a string-query, as I'd need to call `createRequest`, etc, so I'd still expose `callUseQuery` to the public API of the library. Even with my second idea, the `useQuery` wrapper function will not help because if I want to call the API in my app bootstrap files (in order to start some requests very early on), it will try to inject the client, as opposed to directly using one. In that case, we could make the parameter accept both an identifier or a client, but that will unnecessarily increase the complexity, and IMO that's undesirable when one could simply expose `callUseQuery`

As for my second suggestion, that'd make for much cleaner code in my app

PR only includes exposing `callUseQuery` as that'll do for me at this point and I'd like to know your thoughts on my second suggestion.
And before you flame me on how to do GQL, the frontend app will connect to two completely distinct GQL APIs

Multiparam config set (#9748)

We can now do: `config set maxmemory 10m repl-backlog-size 5m`

## Basic algorithm to support "transaction like" config sets:

1. Backup all relevant current values (via get).
2. Run "verify" and "set" on everything, if we fail run "restore".
3. Run "apply" on everything (optional optimization: skip functions already run). If we fail run "restore".
4. Return success.

### restore
1. Run set on everything in backup. If we fail log it and continue (this puts us in an undefined
   state but we decided it's better than the alternative of panicking). This indicates either a bug
   or some unsupported external state.
2. Run apply on everything in backup (optimization: skip functions already run). If we fail log
   it (see comment above).
3. Return error.

## Implementation/design changes:
* Apply function are idempotent (have no effect if they are run more than once for the same config).
* No indication in set functions if we're reading the config or running from the `CONFIG SET` command
   (removed `update` argument).
* Set function should set some config variable and assume an (optional) apply function will use that
   later to apply. If we know this setting can be safely applied immediately and can always be reverted
   and doesn't depend on any other configuration we can apply immediately from within the set function
   (and not store the setting anywhere). This is the case of this `dir` config, for example, which has no
   apply function. No apply function is need also in the case that setting the variable in the `server` struct
   is all that needs to be done to make the configuration take effect. Note that the original concept of `update_fn`,
   which received the old and new values was removed and replaced by the optional apply function.
* Apply functions use settings written to the `server` struct and don't receive any inputs.
* I take care that for the generic (non-special) configs if there's no change I avoid calling the setter (possible
   optimization: avoid calling the apply function as well).
* Passing the same config parameter more than once to `config set` will fail. You can't do `config set my-setting
   value1 my-setting value2`.

Note that getting `save` in the context of the conf file parsing to work here as before was a pain.
The conf file supports an aggregate `save` definition, where each `save` line is added to the server's
save params. This is unlike any other line in the config file where each line overwrites any previous
configuration. Since we now support passing multiple save params in a single line (see top comments
about `save` in https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/9644) we should deprecate the aggregate nature of
this config line and perhaps reduce this ugly code in the future.

AlreadyChecked: handle early returns.

Also, use WellKnownMutability again to assume that _instance_ methods on immutable types are pure.

i.e., for the remainder of the method body in

```
void foo(boolean a) {
  if (a) {
    return;
  }
  // ...
}
```

`a` is known to be false.

Implementing tests for this made me realise my thinking was a bit flawed when looking for occurrences of known truths/falsehoods; really, we should be checking for all boolean expressions which might be known (and hence misleading).

I've done this instead, but in turn it inspired a heursitic to avoid annoying findings for stuff like:

```
if (isEmpty) {
  message.setIsEmpty(isEmpty);
}
```

Because that finding is quite low-value, and what would you suggest instead? If it's more than just a setter, you'd want a parameter comment.

Add snap-layouts support to the Terminal (#11680)

Adds snap layout support to the Terminal's maximize button. This PR is
full of BODGY, so brace yourselves.

Big thanks to Chris Swan in #11134 for building the prototype.
I don't believe this solves #8795, because XAML islands can't get
nchittest messages

- The window procedure for the drag bar forwards clicks on its client
  area to its parent as non-client clicks.
- BODGY: It also _manually_ handles the caption buttons. They exist in
  the titlebar, and work reasonably well with just XAML, if the drag bar
  isn't covering them.
- However, to get snap layout support, we need to actually return
  `HTMAXBUTTON` where the maximize button is. If the drag bar doesn't
  cover the caption buttons, then the core input site (which takes up
  the entirety of the XAML island) will steal the `WM_NCHITTEST` before
  we get a chance to handle it.
- So, the drag bar covers the caption buttons, and manually handles
  hovering and pressing them when needed. This gives the impression that
  they're getting input as they normally would, even if they're not
  _really_ getting input via XAML.
- We also need to manually display the button tooltips now, because XAML
  doesn't know when they've been hovered for long enough. Hence, the
  `_displayToolTip` `ThrottledFuncTrailing`

## Validation
Minimized, maximized, restored down, hovered the buttons slowly, moved
the mouse over them quickly, they feel the same as before. But now with
snap layouts appearing.

## TODO!
* [x] I'm working on getting the ToolTips on the caption buttons back. Alas, I needed a demo of this _today_, so I'll fix that tomorrow morning.
* [x] mild concern: I should probably test Win 10 to make sure there wasn't weird changes to the message loop in win11 that means this is broken on win10.
* [x] I think I used the wrong issue number for tons of my comments throughout this PR. Double check that. Should be #9443, not #9447. 

Closes #9443
I thought this took care of #8587 ~as a bonus, because I was here, and the fix is _now_ trivial~, but looking at the latest commit that regressed.

Fixes the wapproj fast-up-to-date check (#11806)

I'm working on making the FastUpToDate check in Vs work for the Terminal project. This is one of a few PRs in this area.

FastUpToDate lets vs check quickly determine that it doesn't need to do anything for a given project. 

However, a few of our projects don't produce all the right artifacts, or check too many things, and this eventually causes the `wapproj` to rebuild, EVERY TIME YOU F5 in VS. 

This third PR deals with the Actual fast up to date check for the CascadiaPackage.wapproj. When #11804, #11805 and this PR are all merged, you should be able to just F5 the Terminal in VS, and then change NOTHING, and F5 it again, without doing a build at all. 




The wapproj `GetResolvedWinMD` target tries to get a winmd from every cppwinrt
executable we put in the package. But we DON'T produce a winmd. This makes the
FastUpToDate check fail every time, and leads to the whole wapproj build
running even if you're just f5'ing the package. EVEN AFTER A SUCCESSFUL BUILD.

Setting GenerateWindowsMetadata=false is enough to tell the build system that
we don't produce one, and get it off our backs.

### teams chat where we figured this out

[3:38 PM] Dustin Howett
however, that's not the only thing that "GetTargetPath" checks.

[3:38 PM] Dustin Howett
oh yeah more info: wapproj calls GetTargetPath on all projects it references

[3:38 PM] Dustin Howett
when it calls GTP on WindowsTerminal.vcxproj it is getting back a winmd (!)

NET-614: StreamID nominal type (#337)

## Summary
Add new [nominal type](https://betterprogramming.pub/nominal-typescript-eee36e9432d2), aka branded string, `StreamID` to protocol package and use throughout codebase wherever stream ids are referred to.

## Nominal types and `StreamID`
Nominal typing isn't supported by TypeScript in an official capacity for the time being. In order to get such behavior from the compiler, the following pattern / hack in used.
```ts
export type StreamID = string & { readonly __brand: 'streamId' } // Nominal typing
```
The property `__brand` isn't actually used or assigned in runtime code. Instead it is there as marker to make the compiler raise an error in case you attempt to assign a `string` (or anything else incompatible) directly to a `StreamID`. Notice that instances of type `StreamID` are effectively `string`(s) in runtime code and can be used and passed as such anywhere a plain string would be expected.

Nominal types themselves don't incur a runtime cost as they only introduce additional compile-time checks, hence they can be considered a "zero-cost abstraction". 

## Motivation
There are at least two benefits to using such nominal types instead of just plain strings. 

If we have something like `publish(streamId: StreamID, content: string)` and then attempt to call it with the arguments in the wrong order, e.g. `publish('{ "hello": "world" }', streamId)`, the compiler will throw an error due to first argument `'{ "hello": "world" }'` not being assignable to `StreamID`. Thus we get a stricter level of type checking from the compiler.

Secondly, we can enforce and validate things when converting a string into a `StreamID`. In this PR, I introduce the method `toStreamID(s: string, ...): StreamID`, which is the primary way of receiving instances of type `StreamID`. This method will validate a few things about its string parameter, throwing an error if they don't hold, and also make sure the address part of the passed stream id  is lower-cased. The advantage of doing all this, is that anytime you see a `StreamID` type in the code, you can rely on the before-mentioned validation rules to have been already checked. Thus you don't need to re-validate (or re-lower-case) things! 

PS. The benefits of nominal typing are very similar to those of [value objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object) in Java, however it seems that value objects don't fit in so neatly with JavaScript.

## Usage
- When writing new code, favor `StreamID` type over plain strings when referring to a stream id.
    - Exception: public-facing streamr-client API methods should still use plain strings. Reason: We don't want to force our users to call `toStreamID()`, instead they should be able to pass just strings as is for a nicer API experience. Therefore, one of the first things the client should probably due upon receiving such a plain string is to call `toStreamID()` to convert the user passed string into a `StreamID` and then in internal code deal exclusively only with `StreamID`(s).
- Use `toStreamID(streamIdOrPathAsStr: string, baseAddress?: string): StreamID` to convert a string into a `StreamID`. It also supports path-only stream format when given 2nd argument `baseAddress`.
    - Exception: in the rare case where (a) we are in a performance critical section of the code and (b) `toStreamID()` would be called repeatedly way too often and (c) you can be 100% sure that the string(s) in question conforms to the `StreamID` validation rules, you can do an explicit cast `str as StreamID`.
    - Best practice: avoid having to call `toStreamID` again and again for the same string, ideally it should only be called once for a given string. The best way to achieve this is to use `StreamID` type everywhere and avoid cases where a `StreamID` would be downcasted back to a plain string.
    
## Future considerations
- Consider making `SPID` into a nominal string type. This would harmonize the behavior to be similar to that of `StreamID`, and one big advantage is that we could use `SPID` itself as a key in es6 map without having to deal with the whole `toKey()` / `fromKey()` situation. Another advantage is avoiding instantiating extra objects.
- Adding more nominal types to represent other domain concepts, e.g. EthereumAddress? The idea is to avoid [primitive obsession](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrimitiveObsession), one of the main advantages is type safety and ensuring validating happens once.

## TODO
- Make tests pass

sched/fair: Fix low cpu usage with high throttling by removing expiration of cpu-local slices

commit de53fd7aedb100f03e5d2231cfce0e4993282425 upstream.

It has been observed, that highly-threaded, non-cpu-bound applications
running under cpu.cfs_quota_us constraints can hit a high percentage of
periods throttled while simultaneously not consuming the allocated
amount of quota. This use case is typical of user-interactive non-cpu
bound applications, such as those running in kubernetes or mesos when
run on multiple cpu cores.

This has been root caused to cpu-local run queue being allocated per cpu
bandwidth slices, and then not fully using that slice within the period.
At which point the slice and quota expires. This expiration of unused
slice results in applications not being able to utilize the quota for
which they are allocated.

The non-expiration of per-cpu slices was recently fixed by
'commit 512ac999d275 ("sched/fair: Fix bandwidth timer clock drift
condition")'. Prior to that it appears that this had been broken since
at least 'commit 51f2176d74ac ("sched/fair: Fix unlocked reads of some
cfs_b->quota/period")' which was introduced in v3.16-rc1 in 2014. That
added the following conditional which resulted in slices never being
expired.

if (cfs_rq->runtime_expires != cfs_b->runtime_expires) {
	/* extend local deadline, drift is bounded above by 2 ticks */
	cfs_rq->runtime_expires += TICK_NSEC;

Because this was broken for nearly 5 years, and has recently been fixed
and is now being noticed by many users running kubernetes
(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577) it is my opinion
that the mechanisms around expiring runtime should be removed
altogether.

This allows quota already allocated to per-cpu run-queues to live longer
than the period boundary. This allows threads on runqueues that do not
use much CPU to continue to use their remaining slice over a longer
period of time than cpu.cfs_period_us. However, this helps prevent the
above condition of hitting throttling while also not fully utilizing
your cpu quota.

This theoretically allows a machine to use slightly more than its
allotted quota in some periods. This overflow would be bounded by the
remaining quota left on each per-cpu runqueueu. This is typically no
more than min_cfs_rq_runtime=1ms per cpu. For CPU bound tasks this will
change nothing, as they should theoretically fully utilize all of their
quota in each period. For user-interactive tasks as described above this
provides a much better user/application experience as their cpu
utilization will more closely match the amount they requested when they
hit throttling. This means that cpu limits no longer strictly apply per
period for non-cpu bound applications, but that they are still accurate
over longer timeframes.

This greatly improves performance of high-thread-count, non-cpu bound
applications with low cfs_quota_us allocation on high-core-count
machines. In the case of an artificial testcase (10ms/100ms of quota on
80 CPU machine), this commit resulted in almost 30x performance
improvement, while still maintaining correct cpu quota restrictions.
That testcase is available at https://github.com/indeedeng/fibtest.

I've never had some many movies back to back in my life.

Finally done with the first vid. I'll have braekfast here and then deal with the rest after that.

12:35pm. I need to focus instead of wasting my time lurking the art boards. This time would even be better spent by watching anime.

2pm. Done with breakfast and chores. I'll leave the PriPri movie for later. I just do not feel right watching this while there are things that need doing. I'll do it as usual.

Let me watch chapter 2 of the rigid body tutorial.

Applying a forcefield to a curve is a good idea.

Come to think of it, I never figured out how he did the can dust. I am guessing it is just brown smoke, but how did he do a draw in effect? Particles that go towards the center?

Also I've been thinking about this before, but it might be worth looking at how geometry nodes can do physics. I am betting that should be possible, though it is not necessary for me right now.

Breaking things with Cell Fracture in Blender - RBD Simulation -Last Chapter

Let me finally watch this. It is taking me too long to get through a single video. I am really pushing myself here.

https://youtu.be/ErM_qJV5FwQ?list=PLgO2ChD7acqFmA0Upn6VQ5tcyzWDpiP7I&t=123

I've had an idea. Would it be possible to make fractures with some kind of modifier? Hmmm, probably not. Rigid body works on whole objects.

https://youtu.be/ErM_qJV5FwQ?list=PLgO2ChD7acqFmA0Upn6VQ5tcyzWDpiP7I&t=463

Interesting how easy it is to make a pawn.

https://youtu.be/ErM_qJV5FwQ?list=PLgO2ChD7acqFmA0Upn6VQ5tcyzWDpiP7I&t=658

Finally the constraints come into play. It seems they are used to connect the pieces.

https://youtu.be/ErM_qJV5FwQ?list=PLgO2ChD7acqFmA0Upn6VQ5tcyzWDpiP7I&t=742

I need to keep in mind that I can set the settings for all the selected objects by holding alt.

3:55pm. FInally done. I really had enough of this, but I need to cover it all.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+rigid+body+constraints

Let me cover the constraitns.

4pm. Hmmm, quick explode literally cuts a mesh in half without creating any new fragments. I wonder how that works? I see no physics constraints being applied to the object. Nevermind that for now. Let me watch the vids above.

Let me watch this.

https://youtu.be/YW_6WqFiAIw?t=304

This could be useful. It is not hard to grasp.

4:25pm. I'll leave the rest of the constraints for later.

Focus me.

I need to cover soft body, collision and cloth simulations.

Let me do the soft body.

At this point it is really hard to stay awake, but as the pool is the next scene I need to persevere.

https://youtu.be/ZRZa9PpYZfc
Softbody Is FINALLY usable

Let me watch this.

https://youtu.be/ZRZa9PpYZfc?t=188

He set the floor to be a colission object. Why not a passive rigid body?

https://youtu.be/ZRZa9PpYZfc?t=604

This is a pretty good tutorial. Not only does it teach me about the soft body, it shows me how to connect geomtry nodes and shading.

https://youtu.be/ZRZa9PpYZfc?t=889

Ohh, it is possibble to add random values like this. I didn't know that random value had a vector option.

Hmmm, it never occured to me before, but does vector always have 3 fields? I guess I should have been thinking about it as a 3 float tuple.

How to make RIGID BODIES and CLOTH interact with Blender Physics!

Let me watch this.

> Can't you see that your method doesn't work? Before you apply the cloth modifier to the plane, make the plane larger and make more subdivide(еo make the fabric sag more in the simulation)
Turn on the shadows in the viewport and see that the objects are not touching each other.

https://youtu.be/CYNVcWsmR-s
SOFT BODY COLLISIONS WITH OTHER OBJECTS FOR BEGINNERS IN BLENDER 2.81

Let me watch this.

https://youtu.be/CYNVcWsmR-s?t=195

Ctrl + Alt + 0 sets the camera at the current viewport. This is a good trick. I had no idea about it. I wanted to do this several times in the past.

https://youtu.be/CYNVcWsmR-s?t=317

Looking at this, it seems that soft body can interact with a collision, but in the previous video, the rigid body required a passive object.

Still the previous video feels a bit shaky and convoluted. Should rigid bodies and cloth really interact like that. I am not sure, but probably not.

5:15pm. Let me take a break here and then I'll watch more vids.

5:35pm. Let me resume. Cloth tutorial go.

Blender Tutorial - Cloth Simulation | Advance Simulation | Blender 2.9

I'll leave this for tomorrow. I am exhausted from watching all these videos. At any rate, making panties and a simple red dress for Luna should not be too hard thanks to all of this. I need just a bit more knowledge. I also want to figure out how to make rigid bodies and cloth interact. The one tutorial that I watched is quite lacking.

https://www.youtube.com/c/Iridesium/videos

Let me bring this here.

7:20pm. I've started relaxing so let me close here. Tomorrow I should wrap up the tutorials and get back to modeling. I'll want to start work on the pool segment and the pathways. As well as put that suitcase.

It really bothers me how I had to pull the couch backwards for the sake of getting a good shot. Maybe I should have played with lenses instead. I am not sure.

But either way I need to keep going forward.

The accumulation of 3d knowledge and skill will eventually lead to a qualitative tranformation in my art. I am going to get speed and versatility.

I just need to keep going until I cover all that I need.

If I really need time to master visuals, then I can sacrifice music.

Maybe I should take a break from visuals and study music for a few days just to get a rough estimate of how difficult making music would be.

My hunch is that it should not be as hard as art, but I might be underestimating it.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=digitial+music+composition+beginner

https://youtu.be/x7uQReA6o8M
Ultimate Beginner's Guide To Music Production

I'll watch this tomorrow.

7:35pm. I took a peek at /mu/, and it does not seem like the stuff I'll need for digital music is anywhere as broad as Blender. Maybe there is hope in this quest.

7:40pm. Nevermind music. I should just focus on visuals. Visuals are most important and I should put as much effort as I need to get them to an exceptional level.

If I can master them, combined with my programming ability, my money troubles will become a thing of the past. For music it is not like I have really inspired ideas for more than two tracks. I could always find good music online and ask for permission to include. Maybe that would involve paying a part of the royalties to those artists. I'd really like to avoid that, since it could lead to large losses on my side.

Using up the whole of 2022 to master art is perfectly fine. After I deal with this I will have a skill that will last me past the Singularity. Even if it gets transfered, it will never become useless. So the loss of this time should be perfectly fine."

FROMGIT: bpf: Do not change gso_size during bpf_skb_change_proto()

This is technically a backwards incompatible change in behaviour, but I'm
going to argue that it is very unlikely to break things, and likely to fix
*far* more then it breaks.

In no particular order, various reasons follow:

(a) I've long had a bug assigned to myself to debug a super rare kernel crash
on Android Pixel phones which can (per stacktrace) be traced back to BPF clat
IPv6 to IPv4 protocol conversion causing some sort of ugly failure much later
on during transmit deep in the GSO engine, AFAICT precisely because of this
change to gso_size, though I've never been able to manually reproduce it. I
believe it may be related to the particular network offload support of attached
USB ethernet dongle being used for tethering off of an IPv6-only cellular
connection. The reason might be we end up with more segments than max permitted,
or with a GSO packet with only one segment... (either way we break some
assumption and hit a BUG_ON)

(b) There is no check that the gso_size is > 20 when reducing it by 20, so we
might end up with a negative (or underflowing) gso_size or a gso_size of 0.
This can't possibly be good. Indeed this is probably somehow exploitable (or
at least can result in a kernel crash) by delivering crafted packets and perhaps
triggering an infinite loop or a divide by zero... As a reminder: gso_size (MSS)
is related to MTU, but not directly derived from it: gso_size/MSS may be
significantly smaller then one would get by deriving from local MTU. And on
some NICs (which do loose MTU checking on receive, it may even potentially be
larger, for example my work pc with 1500 MTU can receive 1520 byte frames [and
sometimes does due to bugs in a vendor plat46 implementation]). Indeed even just
going from 21 to 1 is potentially problematic because it increases the number
of segments by a factor of 21 (think DoS, or some other crash due to too many
segments).

(c) It's always safe to not increase the gso_size, because it doesn't result in
the max packet size increasing.  So the skb_increase_gso_size() call was always
unnecessary for correctness (and outright undesirable, see later). As such the
only part which is potentially dangerous (ie. could cause backwards compatibility
issues) is the removal of the skb_decrease_gso_size() call.

(d) If the packets are ultimately destined to the local device, then there is
absolutely no benefit to playing around with gso_size. It only matters if the
packets will egress the device. ie. we're either forwarding, or transmitting
from the device.

(e) This logic only triggers for packets which are GSO. It does not trigger for
skbs which are not GSO. It will not convert a non-GSO MTU sized packet into a
GSO packet (and you don't even know what the MTU is, so you can't even fix it).
As such your transmit path must *already* be able to handle an MTU 20 bytes
larger then your receive path (for IPv4 to IPv6 translation) - and indeed 28
bytes larger due to IPv4 fragments. Thus removing the skb_decrease_gso_size()
call doesn't actually increase the size of the packets your transmit side must
be able to handle. ie. to handle non-GSO max-MTU packets, the IPv4/IPv6 device/
route MTUs must already be set correctly. Since for example with an IPv4 egress
MTU of 1500, IPv4 to IPv6 translation will already build 1520 byte IPv6 frames,
so you need a 1520 byte device MTU. This means if your IPv6 device's egress
MTU is 1280, your IPv4 route must be 1260 (and actually 1252, because of the
need to handle fragments). This is to handle normal non-GSO packets. Thus the
reduction is simply not needed for GSO packets, because when they're correctly
built, they will already be the right size.

(f) TSO/GSO should be able to exactly undo GRO: the number of packets (TCP
segments) should not be modified, so that TCP's MSS counting works correctly
(this matters for congestion control). If protocol conversion changes the
gso_size, then the number of TCP segments may increase or decrease. Packet loss
after protocol conversion can result in partial loss of MSS segments that the
sender sent. How's the sending TCP stack going to react to receiving ACKs/SACKs
in the middle of the segments it sent?

(g) skb_{decrease,increase}_gso_size() are already no-ops for GSO_BY_FRAGS
case (besides triggering WARN_ON_ONCE). This means you already cannot guarantee
that gso_size (and thus resulting packet MTU) is changed. ie. you must assume
it won't be changed.

(h) changing gso_size is outright buggy for UDP GSO packets, where framing
matters (I believe that's also the case for SCTP, but it's already excluded
by [g]).  So the only remaining case is TCP, which also doesn't want it
(see [f]).

(i) see also the reasoning on the previous attempt at fixing this
(commit fa7b83bf3b156c767f3e4a25bbf3817b08f3ff8e) which shows that the current
behaviour causes TCP packet loss:

  In the forwarding path GRO -> BPF 6 to 4 -> GSO for TCP traffic, the
  coalesced packet payload can be > MSS, but < MSS + 20.

  bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4() will upgrade the MSS and it can be > the payload
  length. After then tcp_gso_segment checks for the payload length if it
  is <= MSS. The condition is causing the packet to be dropped.

  tcp_gso_segment():
    [...]
    mss = skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size;
    if (unlikely(skb->len <= mss)) goto out;
    [...]

Thus changing the gso_size is simply a very bad idea. Increasing is unnecessary
and buggy, and decreasing can go negative.

Remove role for setting up printers

Added approved change to clarify intent is not to chill speech

"CppCon strives to be a respectful, kind, diverse, and inclusive environment. Participants are expected to not be offensive or disrespectful toward others. They are also encouraged to not be too quick to take offense when none is intended but assume good faith when interacting with persons of different cultures, life experiences, and backgrounds who may have diverse ways of expression. The CoC exists to ensure we have a welcoming atmosphere, not to chill communication by trying to control how people express themselves as long as they are respectful."

[new-env] Use new environment to power checking

Summary:
This is where we start to link everything together.

This diff makes `statement.ml` use the new environment module to handle checking when the new env is enabled. We do this by functorizing `statement`, `type_inference_js`, and many similar modules over `Env`, and providing the new env as an alternate implementation of the env signature. By doing this, we don't need to change the API used by statement.ml to access the environment much, other than passing in locations in some places where we didn't before. (Nearly all of the changes to `statement` in this diff are just the result of formatting changes by indenting the entire module one level.) When `type_inference_js`'s API is used, callers now need to choose between the old and new env implementations.

The meat of the actual changes in this diff is `new_env.ml` itself. The new env now has to do a number of things: it needs to use the env_builder to find writes for variables that the env builder is aware of, but it also needs to be able to handle internal variables, which don't exist from the env builder's perspective. It also needs to handle heap refinements (which at this point aren't handled by the env builder, though that will change), types (likewise), and contextual information about scope (e.g. are we currently at the module toplevel). Since the original env.ml already handles these things, the new env itself actually `include`s the entire implementation from the original env. It then shadows the definitions of functions relevant to the new env's behavior, e.g. `var_ref`, `set_var`, etc. In many cases, it needs to decide whether to use the new_env's infrastructure or the old env, by checking if the variable to be modified is internal or ordinary; that's why there's a lot of branching on the kind of Reason.name is passed in. (In cases where we don't branch on the name, it's because the name is a `string` and will always be an ordinary variable. That's an annoying inconsistency in the API but this isn't the place to solve it.)

Why not build a new implementation to handle internal vars etc? It sounded like a good idea, since it's pretty unwieldy to include the entire behavior of the old environment to handle a few internal variables and some state-tracking that could be handled elsewhere. However, it turns out that some internal variables really do depend on the complex behavior of the environment. For example, `super` and `this` are considered to be undeclared let-bound variables in derived class constructors, which are declared when `super()` is called, and accessing them (other than calling `super()`) before that is a TDZ error. `maybe_exhaustively_checked` also depends on the behavior of `merge_env`/`copy_env` to determine whether it's definitely initialized or not, which affects the result of exhaustiveness checks. Eventually, all of the internal variables will need to be handled of course, but they'll be handled in different ways--`maybe_exhaustively_checked` will probably go away, `this`/`super`/probably `exports` can be handled by the `env_builder`, and `return`/`yield` likely should be treated, not as variables, but as other unrelated contextual information (especially since they'll need to be locally inferred). So for now I think maintaining the original env's behavior is the best way to maintain support for these features while we work on the early stages of LTI.

All that said, with this diff we can now actually do some checking of programs using the new env, woohoo! This diff includes some test cases. There are differences between the new env's behavior here and the old env, as a result of combining provider-checks and open tvars. In particular, this part of `test.ml` causes an error:
```
var x = c ? 42 : "a'";

var y = 42

if (typeof x === 'string') {
  (x: string);
  y = x;
}
```
With the new env, when we assign `x` to `y`, we get an error. The assignment does a subtyping check against the type of the provider for `y`, which is 42, and since `x` is a string we blame the assignment. This is, of course, the desired behavior for us to eventually reach, but it's currently inconsistent--if `y`'s initializer was a function call instead, we wouldn't get the error, but `x` would instead flow into the function's tout:

```

var x2 = f(42); // where f : number => string
(x2: string); // <- error: number (from y below) is incompatible with string
x2 = y; // where y : number
```

With LTI, this will be fixed since the tout for the function will be resolved, and we'll get an error when we try to write to `x2`. However, to land this without LTI, the fix will be to have a separate tvar for the general type of a variable, which will happen in another diff.

Lastly, this diff creates a new_env mode for ./runtests, with -e. this results in the following:
`Passed: 148, Failed: 157, Skipped: 264, Errored: 159`
which is pretty decent for where we're at imo (it skips annotate_exports and friends)
