Did_she_say_hallo

You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening?

Write a simple function to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.

These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:

hello - english
ciao - italian
salut - french
hallo - german
hola - spanish
ahoj - czech republic
czesc - polish
Notes

you can assume the input is a string.
to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word (Hallowen can pass the test)
function should be case insensitive to pass the tests

Makes glass floors override platings. Fixes glass floor openspace bug. (#66301) (#696)

About The Pull Request

Fixes #63868. Actual one liner fix for this one here. If this pr dies feel free to atomize this one.
AND it turns out to not be tim's fault.

Fixes #63548. But i really shouldnt say fixed. The original implementation was causing the invincible plating bug. When tim's refactor got in it instead relies on the element state, which was broken from the get go, removing the invincible plating bug which was in a sense "intended" its all messy man I hate this code. Thats why im removing the plating thing. Let the turf handle the turf change themselves this complicates things.

Mapped in glass floors have openspace (now baseturf bottom) as their baseturfs, while built ones have plating under them. Which doesnt make sense to be honest. Why would things be visible if a plating is under the glass. They are also crowbarrable on top of this, which to be fair is my main reasoning behind the PR.

To solve this, I am instead making glass floors replace the plating instead of building over it. This is made to be generalizable for every tile in game, as long as their initial baseturf is the same and the tile wants it to happen.

do after of three seconds is completely arbitrary. If any maint want it changed let me know.
Why It's Good For The Game

First one solves a bug
Second one makes more sense
And er, icebox is currently using the glass floors in sec, they can be crowbarred very easily. This might be a good idea from a gameplay perspective.
Changelog

cl
del: Removed adding glass floors to plating
balance: Allows you to replace plating with glass floors instead. 3 second timer.
del: Removed deconstructing the glass floors. No replacement for this one, use a rcd.
fix: Fixed metastation glassfloor spawning a weird turf when crowbarred.

[MIRROR] Fixes an error sprites on medical wintercoat's allowed list. [MDB IGNORE] (#13566)

* Goodbye stack/medical (#66898)

Okay, why removing instead of giving it a sprite?

Simply put, those items are all small and there is no reason that you need to quick draw a suture/ointment and if you do, the medical belt can carry 7.
Allowed/exoslot items should be either medium/big/bulky sized items (Syringe gun) to make it worth inventory wise or items that you can quickdraw multiple times (Health Analyzer) to make your life easier.
Medical stacks are neither and would just get in the way if you try to quickly put them into a bag/pocket/belt and instead it goes into your exoslot where you would normally want to carry more valuable things like the syringe gun.

This doesn't feel big enough for a fix, spending 5 seconds making a list alphabetical doesn't few worth of code improvement, I will label this as QoL and if someone say it is a balance change I will follow you in game and keep placing shitty small items in your inventory via reverse pickpocketing.

Remove trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace is not harmful, but unnecessary and ugly in my
opinion. I configured my editor to highlight it, so I see it all the
time, which is a bit annoying. Let's get rid of it.

Actually regenerating the filter produces some slightly different code
with my installed version of cococpp (Coco/R Jan 02, 2012), so I just
kept the old code and removed the trailing spaces and tabulators.

`make fmt` now also removes trailing whitespace from all the text files.
Since not only source files but any text files might be subject to
introducing new trailing whitespace, CI will not skip that formatting
task anmyore for documentation-, translation-, contribution- and/or
snap-only changes. It's now unconditionally executed all the time.

'xargs -r' is not supported everywhere, so we need to use a loop
instead. That will guard against no files necessary to be rewritten.

Remove `@Beta` from uncontroversial `Futures` methods:

- `submit`
- `submitAsync`
- `scheduleAsync`
- `nonCancellationPropagating`
- `inCompletionOrder`

I did also add a TODO to potentially make the return type of `scheduleAsync` more specific in the future. However, to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever asked for this. (That's not surprising: `ScheduledFuture` isn't any more useful than `Future` unless you're implementing a `ScheduledExecutorService`, and even then, access to its timeout is unavoidably racy.) Plus, should we ever need to do it, we can do it compatibly by injecting a bridge method with the old signature.

(I didn't see any discussion of the return type in the API Review doc or the CL review thread. It probably just didn't come up, or maybe we all independently concluded that it wasn't worth the trouble, given that `MoreExecutors.listeningDecorator(ScheduledExecutorService)` is a bit of a pain? But I'm guessing `scheduleAsync` would be easier.)

RELNOTES=`util.concurrent`: Removed `@Beta` from `Futures` methods: `submit`, `submitAsync`, `scheduleAsync`, `nonCancellationPropagating`, `inCompletionOrder`.

Fix rowcount estimate for SubqueryScan that's under a Gather.

SubqueryScan was always getting labeled with a rowcount estimate
appropriate for non-parallel cases.  However, nodes that are
underneath a Gather should be treated as processing only one
worker's share of the rows, whether the particular node is explicitly
parallel-aware or not.  Most non-scan-level node types get this
right automatically because they base their rowcount estimate on
that of their input sub-Path(s).  But SubqueryScan didn't do that,
instead using the whole-relation rowcount estimate as if it were
a non-parallel-aware scan node.  If there is a parallel-aware node
below the SubqueryScan, this is wrong, and it results in inflating
the cost estimates for nodes above the SubqueryScan, which can cause
us to not choose a parallel plan, or choose a silly one --- as indeed
is visible in the one regression test whose results change with this
patch.  (Although that plan tree appears to contain no SubqueryScans,
there were some in it before setrefs.c deleted them.)

To fix, use path->subpath->rows not baserel->tuples as the number
of input tuples we'll process.  This requires estimating the quals'
selectivity afresh, which is slightly annoying; but it shouldn't
really add much cost thanks to the caching done in RestrictInfo.

This is pretty clearly a bug fix, but I'll refrain from back-patching
as people might not appreciate plan choices changing in stable branches.
The fact that it took us this long to identify the bug suggests that
it's not a major problem.

Per report from bucoo, though this is not his proposed patch.

"8:50am. I actually went to bed at 9am. I am not sure whether I feel more rested today, but I guess this kind of schedule will serve to unclutter my mind.

8:55am. Let me start instead of browsing /a/.

9am. Got a refil, ok. Let me get out the pen stylus and get ready.

9:15am. Getting that cube was a drag. I just now figured out that once I make a box, I can edit its proportions afterwards.

10:05am. I have a thing I want to ask of the Moi guys.

https://moi3d.com/forum/discussion.php?webtag=MOI&msg=10695.1

Well here it is. For now let me just go with scaling it by 1.001. I need to split the balcony door into two.

11:05am. Yeah, this isn't so bad. I feel like I am getting a hang of Moi. I'll never be able to go back to modeling in Blender after this. Moi is so much better.

11:10am. Had to take a short break. Let me resume. Now apart from detailing, I have the last part of the balcony door left, the wooden grill doors. I suppose I could also do the knobs. Wouldn't hurt.

11:35am. Did the door handle. Now let me do the grill door. How is it placed exactly?

12:50pm. Finally done with the doorway. I did the most salient features...

Agh, let me do the latch at the top. Whatever.

1:05pm. Now I am deliberating whether or not to do an extra detail. Forget it. I am done here. The other latch isn't really visible so I don't need to do it.

1:10pm. I might have overdone it as it is. Ok, let me go forward with this. I'll bring this into the scene and do the bar for the curtains. That one I should be able to hack in Blender. After that I'll bring in the rig, the desk and the monitor. I should also do the other door leading into the room, but as that one won't be visible, it can just be a slice for the time being.

I won't redo the bed. Maybe I'll just bevel big edges, but that is it for now.

After I go through this, I'll try painting it over. This scene is a decent amount more complex than the couch scene I did last year. It will be the truest test of my skill.

Maybe it will turn out that doing more in Blender would be beneficial whether that be rendering, modeling or texturing. I'll find the right balance as I go along.

2pm. Let me read a bit of the hiki vampire countess novel which I got yesterday off Nyaa and I will resume.

2:20pm. Let me resume. Let me make the curtain in Mo after all. It would be a pain to do it in Blender. After that I'll start bringing things in.

2:50pm. Finally done with the wooden curtain bar. Now let me work on getting this into Blender.

2:55pm. I am exhausted here. During the modeling process I've been in the zone the whole time.

3:25pm. Fuck. Setting things up in Blender is such a chore.

4:10pm. I am still messing with it. Let me think. How do I rotate the doors along the hinges without messing up everything?

Should I join the individal grill pieces?

No, that would unlink it and increase the poly count significantly.

Hmmm, I have an idea. Why don't I make an empty, and parent the main grill door to it. Than if I ever unparent that, I can just undo the transform.

Great, great, great...this is the solution I was looking for. It is perfect. Back when I modeled the door in Blender I did a destructive rotate and couldn't get the door back without significant effort.

4:20pm. Enough, enough. Let me not mess with the bed bevels.

The reason why I dunked over an hour here because I did not follow the right process and parented the door pieces immediatelly. Next time I'll know better.

Now let me bring in the detailed right.

4:35pm. Not bad. Let me bring in the desk as well.

4:50pm. Brought in the desk.

5pm. Ok, I've setup the the perspective. Now I can bring in the screenshot into CSP and give it a try.

Let me take a break here. I've been going full throttle all day. I am not sure I have the steam needed to paint.

5:30pm. Did a /wip/ post. Right now I've imported it into CSP and am staring at it. I've definitely no will to do any painting right now. I've been doing art for 7.5 months now. Today's session was the closest it has ever been to an average programming day session.

I've really moved from learning to actually doing.

3d isn't so bad. It is not as skill dependent as 2d is, you can get steadily better results the more effort you put in. What I will have to do now is check out whether that holds true when it comes to painting.

It should. I have a good baseline for what a workflow should be from doing that couch. Masks, edge control, gradient maps. I am going to have to try something else this time instead of gradient maps. Instead of them I'll try to make the bottom layer grayscale, and the upper one a color layer and mix the two data points that way. That way I can have the flats in one place and their shades in another. That should be pretty effective.

6pm. Let me close here. Just when was the time I ever closed at 6pm. It was always just trying to get more and more knoweldge during the past 7.5 months. How many times have I been so obsessed to go past 12am.

Right now let me read the hikivamp novel and relax for a while. Summer is here.

Once I finish my first real illustration I can pat myself on the back. I will have done something remarkable as an artist."

gpiolib: acpi: use correct format characters

When compiling with -Wformat, clang emits the following warning:

  gpiolib-acpi.c:393:4: warning: format specifies type 'unsigned char' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]
                        pin);
                        ^~~

So warning that '%hhX' is paired with an 'int' is all just completely
mindless and wrong. Sadly, I can see a different bogus warning reason
why people would want to use '%02hhX'.

Again, the *sane* thing from a human perspective is to use '%02X. But
if the compiler doesn't do any range analysis at all, it could decide
that "Oh, that print format could need up to 8 bytes of space in the
result". Using '%02hhX' would cut that down to two.

And since we use

        char ev_name[5];

and currently use "_%c%02hhX" as the format string, even a compiler
that doesn't notice that "pin <= 255" test that guards this all will
go "OK, that's at most 4 bytes and the final NUL termination, so it's
fine".

While a compiler - like gcc - that only sees that the original source
of the 'pin' value is a 'unsigned short' array, and then doesn't take
the "pin <= 255" into account, will warn like this:

  gpiolib-acpi.c: In function 'acpi_gpiochip_request_interrupt':
  gpiolib-acpi.c:206:24: warning: '%02X' directive writing between 2 and 4 bytes into a region of size 3 [-Wformat-overflow=]
       sprintf(ev_name, "_%c%02X",
                            ^~~~
  gpiolib-acpi.c:206:20: note: directive argument in the range [0, 65535]

because gcc isn't being very good at that argument range analysis either.

In other words, the original use of 'hhx' was bogus to begin with, and
due to *another* compiler warning being bad, and we had that bad code
being written back in 2016 to work around _that_ compiler warning
(commit e40a3ae1f794: "gpio: acpi: work around false-positive
-Wstring-overflow warning").

Sadly, two different bad compiler warnings together does not make for
one good one.

It just makes for even more pain.

End result: I think the simplest and cleanest option is simply the
proposed change which undoes that '%hhX' change for gcc, and replaces
it with just using a slightly bigger stack allocation. It's not like
a 5-byte allocation is in any way likely to have saved any actual stack,
since all the other variables in that function are 'int' or bigger.

False-positive compiler warnings really do make people write worse
code, and that's a problem. But on a scale of bad code, I feel that
extending the buffer trivially is better than adding a pointless cast
that literally makes no sense.

At least in this case the end result isn't unreadable or buggy. We've
had several cases of bad compiler warnings that caused changes that
were actually horrendously wrong.

New species: Star

Time pressure often creates exciting gameplay and interesting
tradeoffs. Baseline Dungeon Crawl uses the Zot Clock to add a
very weak form of time pressure, but there's so much variety
between the playstyles of different species and backgrounds
that a tight clock for some would be almost impossible for
others.

So, let's try limiting that gameplay to just one species! Stars
have an exciting variety of bonuses - good attributes and
aptitudes across the board, passive mapping, damage shaving (ala
Deep Dwarves), and eventually innate MP and HP regen. In
exchange, they have one big downside: instead of getting 6,000
turns of Zot clock for each floor, they get 600!

The big concern here is whether this species can be made fun
without also being made wildly, boringly 'overpowered'. Lots of
levers and knobs to tweak, so let's give it a shot!

Extra notes:
- Stars are humanoid beings. (In the night sky, they look like
  dots because they're very far up.) Hat tip to Neil Gaiman's
  Stardust.
- This commit has a silly 'flavour' gimmick where Stars' LOS
  radius decreases by 2 when they have less than 50 turns left
  of Zot clock, and again when they have less than 10. Darkness
  is closing in...
- A future commit will make stars shine.

crashdumper seems a huge investement in storage space, hence that link fail. idk.

there is UNCHECKED CRASH after bopeebo! pls debug crash why crash! crashdumper cannot be here at all AAAAAAAAAA

wow, there's a bug in the Local server test we have here, the disable 1 click gb filedaddy werror 404 somehow, despite the file being there. maybe it's trouble with certain part of the browser??

peck! I forgot what do I want to fix. I wish I can write now despite were doing üöΩüöæ.

for now, we can only render with final configuration `lime test windows -final` because of that pecking lnk error unresolved external symbol

woups! we forgot to filter out what cannot do modcore in the platform cannot modcore.

bagui

Now, how do we supposed to redesign our IONIQ Sky here? Initially, way before KitsuneSkulls expose (last e has accent line up right), I thought how about she wears um.. this zipped motorcycle jacket tight shirt thingy, colored black with emblem of LFM logo. Yeah uh, the LFM logo is Umnaga family crest. If me has Perkedel logo as the crest, Latsufir x Sky has this logo. So, it's there. and also, maybe I keep the... skirt. idk. BUT still has, umm, PECK! umm... this tight spandex black pants.. aa gyeah..
idk, I already decided for her hair, the blue cyan is natural. like bf is. And uh Yolaine's hair is uh.. purple.. lilac purple. yess. sorry, I'm sorry, not to do bad thigns, Sr. Pelo, no no, your character cool and good! I just have random thoughts.

HAAARGH!!! PECKING POOPS!!!! I WISH I HAVE WORKING EASY 3D CHARACTER GENERATOR HERE!!! Oh yeah, we have MB labs, BUT THEY HAVE FATAL LIMITATIONS!!! NO!! I'd rather sculpt one on my own, ugh..

TODO: Yoink Week 7. use luckydog7 android port, they got one.

Right, we have successfully & finally installed Redsty Phoenix standalone GF. both v2 & legacy. And shut up, the game was supposedly for higher ages as been stated somewhere. And UOH!! MAN!! Sorry, not to simp here, but I can't deny how impressive these are.

TODO: install AjTheFunky heartbreak gf. but due to pibby not allowed, how about disqualify & make it a separate mod LFM-kade-modcore instead? okay maybe not. Because they can yoink that out, they still have to ask permission because that's how Earth copyright works, We're not in Dasandim where permissionless yoink but credit are defaultly enforced. OAH!! SHUSH!!! Forget about this. treat this paragraph like it's nothing. okay, give me time.

we still have to complete all the rest of the Week overbuse kevin macleod man! c'mon!

avoid using `@sync_add` on remotecalls (#44671)

* avoid using `@sync_add` on remotecalls

It seems like @sync_add adds the Futures to a queue (Channel) for @sync, which
in turn calls wait() for all the futures synchronously. Not only that is
slightly detrimental for network operations (latencies add up), but in case of
Distributed the call to wait() may actually cause some compilation on remote
processes, which is also wait()ed for. In result, some operations took a great
amount of "serial" processing time if executed on many workers at once.

For me, this closes #44645.

The major change can be illustrated as follows: First add some workers:

```
using Distributed
addprocs(10)
```

and then trigger something that, for example, causes package imports on the
workers:

```
using SomeTinyPackage
```

In my case (importing UnicodePlots on 10 workers), this improves the loading
time over 10 workers from ~11s to ~5.5s.

This is a far bigger issue when worker count gets high. The time of the
processing on each worker is usually around 0.3s, so triggering this problem
even on a relatively small cluster (64 workers) causes a really annoying delay,
and running `@everywhere` for the first time on reasonable clusters (I tested
with 1024 workers, see #44645) usually takes more than 5 minutes. Which sucks.

Anyway, on 64 workers this reduces the "first import" time from ~30s to ~6s,
and on 1024 workers this seems to reduce the time from over 5 minutes (I didn't
bother to measure that precisely now, sorry) to ~11s.

Related issues:
- Probably fixes #39291.
- #42156 is a kinda complementary -- it removes the most painful source of
  slowness (the 0.3s precompilation on the workers), but the fact that the
  wait()ing is serial remains a problem if the network latencies are high.

May help with #38931
