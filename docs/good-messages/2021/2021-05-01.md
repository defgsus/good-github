Add Madman role
-Start with telepathy
-Start with mind blast (fixes inconsistency where player mind blasts were still restricted in range)
--Note that this means you can blast those pesky mind flayers if they bother you!
--Madmen gain dice as they level up.
-Can summon their pet, which grows with insight (currently uses domakedog, this is probably dumb).
-Start with low alignment (can enter quest at 4)
-Start with 1 anger in all gods (ouch)
-Start with Delusions and 75 sanity
-Start with 30 points of drunkenness
-Have a "maniac" unarmed attack flag that gives increased die size.
-Slightly faster than average HP regen (sub martial role)
-Fast power regen rate (almost at wizard level)
-Start stuck in straitjackets
--Counts as welded hands, and disables many attack forms.


Kick changes: when stuck in a straitjacket, the PC kicks automatically if all their normal attacks are blocked. This required the introduction of dokick_core(), which is able to take dx and dy.


Monsters:
Contaminated patients transform into other monsters when injured.
Dream leach:
-have mind blasts
Fulvous monsters:
-Similar to Zombies in most respects
Coiling brawn: blobs with owlbear-like attacks.
Fungal brain: Fungus with mind blasts and psionic magic



Quest:
-The formal quest leader isn't encountered until deeper in the quest.
-The "calls for aid" message is overridden.
-The quest nemesis doesn't have the quest artifact.
-Touching the quest artifact gets the KiYellow's attention.
--Causes occasional wizard-like interventions
--The palid stranger folows between levels
-Furnature: writing desks: comfortable to sit on, contain scrolls and sometimes books.

Quest artifact: Star of Hypernotus ("Beyond the south wind, ie, Antarctica)
-Star saphire amulet versus curses
-Engraved with an elder sign ward (appliable and readable like a ring)
-Cary for clear thoughts (blocks sanity effects) and block confusion

MISC:
dungeon.h:
introduce qhome to deal with cases where the first level is not the home level.
Madmen's whole quest is the quest town

mondata.h
Shackles equipped to a monster's foot slot make them immoble
Not all blobs are vegan.

allmain.c
Monsters that are sleeping or paralized don't laugh.

quest.c
Don't bug out if the quest leader is on an unexpected level in the quest.

Day 13 of 365 days of Python on ML

 BILL DIVISION

Two friends Anna and Brian, are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. Each will only pay for the items they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion. You must determine if his calculation is correct.

For example, assume the bill has the following prices: bill = [2,4,6]. Anna declines to eat item k = bill[2] which costs 6. If Brian calculates the bill correctly, Anna will pay (2+4)/2=3. If he includes the cost of bill[2], he will calculate (2+4+2)/2=6. In the second case, he should refund to 3 Anna.

Create README.md Hello üëã to all of you from Marignano 1515, Metropolitan Milan, üáÆüáπ üá™üá∫ ‚ù§ 

Giorgio & FriendS would enjoy to share their vision and mission with you since nothing can be improved without your support and your SCOPE might help improve our own ones, at once. It is some kind of reciprocal win-win game and you may like the fun our beat and gain may add to each other's respect for the efforts the odds perform on our behalf. They support us, thus we have to support them, isn't it wise or fair enough?!

Uhm no Seth (read on to find out more!)

Ok so I don't have the time or effort to actually make this work, I
have already been stuck on this for a while now, lemme explain what
the issue is:

- First of all, it says that I have 9 commits here, that's actually
  untrue, I just merged the `beta` branch into this separate branch
  so that I could have the most updated changes, but the changes that
  I did make are reflected in this commit
- Your MathJax 2.7 is loading correctly but it is not TYPESETTING any
  of the math which is the most important part, and MathJax 3.x WAS
  typesetting all the math (to typeset means to render the math all
  fancy-schmancy like how you wanted it)
- After spending two hours on this, I have found no way to actually
  take what we have and reinvent the wheel so that anything renders,
  I can't find a way to typeset the math so I don't know what kind of
  voodoo magic you worked to get it to run on your end, but it ain't
  working here, whereas the 3.x does
- If you can find the mistake then by all means fix it, I'll keep the
  branch alive but I am closing the pull request, I do not know how you
  got 2.7 to work on your machine but it is not working on mine (even
  with the Python Server)
- I have decided that we should not fix what is not broken, and so what
  if our users can't copy and paste our formulas, 3.x works and I've
  already put enough effort into rewriting my math thing for that
- However I will be taking the configuration changes into account in
  the `beta` branch

Anyways sorry for "flaming" or whatever that was, I'm just tired, let's
add some images/diagrams to this bad boy and then publish to the public
