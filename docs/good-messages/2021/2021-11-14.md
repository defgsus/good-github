"11:55am. As usual my wakeup times are all over the place.

I'll have breakfast, do the chores and then start.

1:15pm. Done with breakfast and chores. It is time to finally start. Let me put a dent into the traditional art section. Though I might not be doing any drawing right now for the sake of expedience, I am doing mental simulation. Now that I've broken the ice and understand why my drawing has been so poor I'll be able to make rapid progress.

Actually, before I start, let me play with the vectors a bit in CSP. If I want proper curves I should not be drawing lines myself. Also using vectors will allow me to relieve the stress on my hand. It is easier to poke around than to drag lines everywhere. It will also result in less wear on the nib.

CLIP STUDIO PAINT useful features : Drawing with vectors

Let me try doing that spoon with vectors as an experiment. I only got it to click for me once I put down some lines and started erasing and adjusting them yesterday. I am yet to get into the groove with vectors yet.

The functionality of this is quite remarkable. Though for regular brushes I feel it put down too many points for me to deal with.

https://youtu.be/j4UopyLEIYU?t=95

Just where the hell is this option?

https://youtu.be/3kgoFFmAbOE?t=50

Argh, it is really annoying to work with vectors in CSP. Let me try doing it in the Illustrator. It is not working for me here.

...I completely forgot how to work in Illustrator. What the hell? I can even draw a single line. What am I missing?

2:10pm. it was set to the damn eraser. I hate the pen buttons. They are hard to use and I keep pressing them by accident.

How do I join two paths in the Illustrator again?

Ai trick - Merge two anchor points into one. Shapes cleaning

Maybe I could average them?

2:30pm. Sigh, why did I even spent time last month studying the Illustrator. I forgot everything.

Gah, how do I turn a corner into a curve. Fuck.

https://youtu.be/JUVjDcoRI60?t=129

it has a bunch of tools which look similar and do different things.

I have to admit, working the Illustrator is quite annoying. This is not as convenient as I imagined it to be. The reason is that messing with curves results in non-local changes.

2:55pm. Sigh, how long am I going to mess with that shitty spoon? Let me move forward instead. I just have no idea how he can draw two smooth arcs next to each other. When I try focusing on matching the other one it actually causes the result to worsen.

3:10pm. I am still working on it. No, doing it with the hand is impossible for me. But putting in tiny scratches results in something fairly messy once you zoom in.

A spoon is actually a good first thing to try. As it really challenges my ability to put in parallel curves.

Clean Line Art! Digital Inking Tips

Today I got massively derailed by this. Yeah, by laying down small lines I can smooth things out and get to my target shape, but it nothing close to having a smooth vector curve.

https://youtu.be/NBE-RTFkXDk?t=230

I am doing this right now. Maybe I should just do my shit in the illustrator.

How to Create Smooth Lines in Your Digital Art

Let me watch this as well.

https://youtu.be/nUlkxjUYY9I?t=140

This thing is interesting. How does it work?

https://lazynezumi.com/

Too bad this is not free.

4:25pm. I am still messing with trying to figure out how to get the curve right. While I am much more dexterous than before, I still do not have much room to manuver. I can't really use the shoulder for anything. At most I can use my elbow.

https://youtu.be/Uel2DS8L9zA?t=42

Huh, what is this?

5:15pm. Had to take a break. At any rate, I am getting a grip on the vector editing tools in CSP. Contrary to my initial impression I can use them to clean up lines. Using simplify you can get rid of most control points and move them in place. When you have a lot of scratches you can use the join tool to merge them all into a single line. You can easily move between corners and smooth points. Right now the only thing  Ido not understand is how line opacity tool works. It does not seem to be doing anything for me.

5:25pm. https://www.clip-studio.com/site/gd_en/csp/userguide/csp_userguide/500_menu/500_menu_layer_new_vector_edit_senshusei.htm

Ok, I got it to effect something, but it seems the opacity of a line is not linked directly to what I have here. But this kind of workflow is different. I wonder if I could get something like this in Illustrator?

In Illustrator I am using to messing with control points by hand, so now I am wondering if there is a tool to connect them and get a more dinamic workflow.

Today I feel like I've made significant gains. Just sitting here and practicing is not really a choice. Just scribbling things down will not make me better. When I learned programming, I did not sit down and do 100 hello world programs every day. Rather the way to get better is to get better tools. If I have the talent, my line work will get more efficient and if not I still have the vector tools to fall back on.

Using vector tools to get clean line work is absolutely a viable choice. Let me play in the Illustrator a bit more.

I've been doing it all wrong. Just why am I hooked on Bezier curves when putting down actual points is way easier?

5:50pm. No, Illustrator is trach. It is only good for laying things down directly. Its vectors do not work the same as CSPs.

5:55pm. Ok, so now I have a solution, but it is not good enough for me yet. I want to do more research on this.

Let me have lunch here.

6:15pm. Now let me watch some of these vids.

[TUTORIAL] How To Draw Cleaner Lineart!

The vector idea is good, but I am not sure how widely applicable it would be.

https://youtu.be/FSijwEQ95hU?t=35
> First of all, work on a nice big canvas. Yeah, I get the sense that my tablet is just too small for this kind of work. But is that all.

https://youtu.be/FSijwEQ95hU?t=136

He explains here that he overshoots so that none of the stopping jiggled get caught in the finished lineart. That is interesting. I never thought of doing something like that on purpose.

Curvature Tool in Illustrator CC 2018

This reminds me of programming tutorials and how I spent time thinking through each and every little thing. Well, curves aren't a little thing though.

7:45pm. Knowing what the Alt key does makes creating curves so much easier.

7:55pm. I am enlightened. The curve tool in Illustrator is really good. To make it work, you really do need a good mix of corners and curves. Let me play with it in Clip Studio.

8:10pm. Ok, I feel it. I think I have enough understanding to deal with curves. That will allow me to make clean line work. CSP is hardly exceptional, all art software seems to have some ability to deal with vectors.

It is very easy to start with a straight line, and add some control points and turn it into a curve.

8:15pm. That having said, the default brushes produce too many control points even when I do quick strokes.

Clean Line Art! Clip Studio Paint Inking Tips for Beginners | Saturday Wars

This popped up while I was looking at how to simplify the vector line automatically.

///

>>5734236
Is there a way, some brush setting maybe, to simply the amount of control points automatically in Clip Studio?

Pic related. The left is default, and the right curve is after dragging the simplify vector line tool over it. This quantity of control points happens even for straight lines.

So far most of the advice on Youtube that I've seen on how to get clean line art is to get good, but undoing and redoing a dozens times to get just the right curve is the stupid way of doing it. Vector manipulation is the smart way. If it is really meant to be, I'll get efficient at drawing lines as I go along, but there is no need to bash my head against this right now.

///

8:50pm. I asked this on /ic/. If I do not get an asnwer I'll ask on the official CSP site.

Now what is next? I feel satisfied in how far I've come in understanding of how to do line art.

Today I was really meant to be going through the Ctrl + Paint tutorials. Let me dive into them now. At least let me finish the section I wanted to do today.

Clean Line Art! Clip Studio Paint Inking Tips for Beginners | Saturday Wars

Ah, I forgot I had this open. Let me watch it. It is 25m. After that I should just stop for the day.

9:40pm. I did a little experiment when overlaying lines. As it turns out, I am actually quite accurate with that. A common advice it to do the curves quickly in order for them to come out smooth, but that makes the precision drop significantly. Now that I know how the smooth tool works, I admit that I am tempted to try it out for real.

Hmmm, is it possible to make a cuve from the mid anchor point rather than just the end.

This Art Software Is Absolutely Amazing - Lazy Nezumi Pro Review (REUPLOAD)

Let me watch this.

10:20pm. I have a problem. I drew the tip of the finger in my scribbling style and then traced the lines using the curve tool. The curves lack charm. Maybe it is the little bit of shading that my handy work has that is tricking my brain. But it does not at all appreciate the perfection of the curves. Maybe they are too simplistic for it.

10:25pm. I'll skip gaming for tonight. Let me watch the Ctrl + Paint lectures. Though I haven't done anything significant, I've been quite into this.

If necessary I'll make the scratching style work. I should also give Lazy Nezumi a try.

Ah, let me try it. Where is that spoon. Let me try it again.

https://youtu.be/3kgoFFmAbOE?t=50

This one I mean.

12:05am. It is past midnight and what I am doing is just draging lines across the canvas.

My verdict is that Lazy Nezumi is amazing. Just use max moving average smoothing and drawing long smooth lines using slow movements becomes viable! I am definitely going to get a crack for this.

I am wary of trying those Lazy Nezumi cracked versions. Since they are exe intallers that could easily be a virus instead.

12:25pm. Silky Shark is a failure. It does not work with the pen.

12:50am. Actually even the inbuilt stabilizer is pretty good. Marc is a moron for suggesting to me I turn it off. Why did I listen to him?

Unfortunately, it is not strong enough. I mean I might be able to make do with some practice, but I want that extra hit.

12:55am. It is really annoying how easy it is to mess up tracing a line. I can be off by 20 pixels and the wobble will show.

1am. No for those long smooth lines, I just need a bit stronger stabilizer and it would be perfect. It is really difficult to trace those thin lines exactly.

1:40am. Let me go to bed here. I had enough for one day. With this, I have a solution to the line art problem. Seriously screw that guy who told me to turn off stabilization, what an imbecile."

Refactor tbprobe.cpp

This involves:
 * replacing the union hacks with simply reusing the EntryPiece arrays
   for the no-pawns case
 * merging the PairsData structure with the EntryPiece/-Pawn structs
   (with credit to Marco: @mcostalba)
 * simplifying some HashTable functions
 * thanks to previous changes, removing the ugly memsets
 * simplifying the template logic for WDL/DTZ distinction
   (now we distinguish based on an enum type, not the entry classes)
 * removing the unneeded Atomic wrapper

-----------------------------

For reference, here is a manual way to check that patches concerning
table bases code are non-functional changes:

0) Download the Syzygy table bases (up to 6 men).
1) Make sure you have branches master and the pull request pointing to
   the right commits.
2) Download the bench calculation scripts from the following URL:

        https://gist.github.com/WOnder93/b5fcf9c989b4a1715684d5c82367cdbe

   and copy into src inside your Stockfish repo.
3) Make the scripts executable (chmod +x *.sh).
4) Run the following command to use TBs located at <path>:

       export SYZYGY_PATH='<path>'

5) After that, run this (it will take a long time, this is a deep bench):

       BENCH_ARGS='128 1 22' ./check_benches.sh master tbprobe_cleanup 2>/dev/null`

==> You should see two equal numbers printed.
    (Of course, now we have to trust that the script itself is correct :)

-----------------------------

Closes https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/1477

No functional change.

790 -> 800

It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found
Something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not
How can I try to explain?
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go
It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
All the times that I've cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
If they were right I'd agree
But it's them they know, not me
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

Show more user friendly error message if the output file path is a dir

This also avoids potentially doing a lot of useless work only for it to
go to waste due to an usage error.

The added check is only meant to improve user experience under common
usage failures. PackSquash should work correctly even if the output file
path somehow becomes a directory during its execution. In fact, the
output file path will be considered valid even if its parent directory
does not exist, and other similar failure scenarios. An attempt to avert
these is not made for the following reasons:

- The most proper way to deal with these situations is eagerly creating
  the output file, not at the end of the process. However, doing so has
  the bad side effect of nuking the already existing output file if
  something goes wrong (this can still happen if some I/O error occurs
  after opening the output file, while writing to it, but that is less
  common than the whole process going wrong because there is an error
  with the pack). I think it's better to risk wasting time than
  increasing the chance of unexpected data loss, even if it is the
  user's fault.
- Trying to anticipate other potential, less egregious failures in a
  portable way is fundamentally flawed. Anything can go wrong at any
  time. I think this hits the diminishing returns point, and further
  anticipations would cost too much resources or complexity compared to
  the benefits provided. For example, checking that the parent directory
  exists implies canonicalizing the path, which requires a buffer
  allocation (because the path can be relative, and getting the parent
  of relative paths is ugly), additional system calls and failure
  handling.

Added new yeti AI, please see the description! / Refactored prefab names

--
EXPLANATION / "WHAT ON EARTH WHY ARE THERE 132 FILE CHANGES??"
--

(Please note I'm extremely tired because it's extremely late so if anything doesn't make sense here that's why, but I'm more than happy to explain stuff in person later)

The existing yeti AI script simply checked to see if a snowball existed, and if not, created one. The snowball itself then did everything from finding the location and launching itself at it. The locations themselves were randomly instantiated at x interval by another object - the Game Manager, which as far as I know should only be responsible for core game stuff like the pause menu, rather than one particular part of an enemy AI.

Anna reported that the yeti's throw animation did not sync up with the actual snowball instantiation - this makes perfect sense, as the scripting didn't link up the throwing with the snowball spawning at all. The yeti's animator simply played an unconditional loop of idle -> throw -> idle, and the snowballs were spawned completely independently.

This resulted in AI that was very limited in what it could do, and was not very extensible (Early in the planning process I remember us talking about the yeti walking around, or hiding in the trees. This script was not capable of that, because again, the yeti itself didn't actually have any logic applied to it, all the logic was in the snowball launching itself and spawning a snow pile).

The AI also didn't have a lot of error handling (that I noticed at least), and where it did have error handling they were just null checks that quietly returned the method and didn't log anything. This worried me, because again, if I were to try and fix the throw animation problem that was initially reported, or if anyone were to try and extend the AI from this point, any number of things could go wrong and it would be very hard to debug.

Hence; I would have liked to build off of the existing scripts because I do feel like I've overstepped (well, I have), but in the state they were in it simply wasn't feasible to fix the initial issue with the animation that I had volunteered to fix (I had assumed it would be a quick animation fix, or I wouldn't have volunteered to mess with it. I only decided to rebuild the AI after I got home late at night and looked at the project).

As a result, I ended up rebuilding the AI from scratch in order to better fit what we had originally planned for - a yeti that wanders around in the forest, sometimes emerging and throwing snowballs to interfere with the player. I do apologise for overstepping, but I didn't feel like I had a choice as we only have 2 weeks left and I'd like to have at least one obstacle complete before the 5th week officially starts. I also felt like it would just be easier this way.

Overall, though, this new AI is much more extensible and (in my opinion) easier to understand. If we want to add more AI states to him - more things he can do, whatever they may be - we easily can by just adding a new enum value and updating the switch statements and evaluation logic in the decision making method. Adding new animations should also be very easy.

Anyway, features of the new yeti AI.

AI FEATURES:
--

- Yeti will choose between a set of AI states;
- AI State #1: Retreat: The Yeti will retreat and hide in a random place within the trees.
- AI State #2: Engage: The Yeti will either emerge from the trees, or simply reposition in the open, and wait to decide on the next state.
- AI State #3: Throw snowball: The Yeti will stop and throw a snowball at a random point within the rink, which will create a snow pile.

- The throw animation now properly syncs up with the snowball being thrown, as the mechanics of the snowball creation and launching are now actually linked with what the Yeti is doing. In this case, the method that instantiates the snowball is called from within the throw animation itself, meaning the player can see the Yeti wind up, anticipate that he is about to throw a snowball, and THEN the snowball will actually spawn. The logic for the snowball moving towards its target and spawning a snow pile is within its own script.

- There is currently no moving animation.

- The Yeti has a "Cowardice" stat, which increases every time he engages or retreats. When he hits max Cowardice, he will go into AI State #4: Forced Engage. This is identical to a normal engage, however the next decision will always be a snowball throw.
- This exists because his decisions are otherwise random; which means he could potentially engage/retreat forever, without actually providing any hindrance to the player. This forces the yeti to throw a snowball at least once every x AI polls.

- All of the relevant yeti's values can be modified in the Inspector. Rather than on the snowball, the speed and arc of the snowball the yeti throws is also modified in the Inspector on his script, to allow for easier playtesting (no switching between objects to change values), and because it just makes more sense to me; after all, HE'S the one throwing the snowball. HE decides how hard he throws it and the arc he throws it in.

- The yeti's AI script also has relatively extensive logging which can be toggled off with a checkbox in the Inspector. Warnings will still be logged.

- Values that can be changed in the Inspector during gameplay are as follows;
- The polling interval; IE, how quickly the Yeti makes new decisions, or in other words, how aggressive his AI is overall.
- An initial time period from the start of the game during which the Yeti's AI will not do anything.
- The max cowardice (Written as "Max Neutral Actions")
- The current and last state the AI is/was in. I'm not sure if anything will break if you change these manually, but you can. Otherwise it's just there to see what he's doing.
- His movement speed
- The snowball speed and arc height
- A button to manually refresh the Yeti's AI if he gets stuck. In my testing this didn't happen, but this kind of stuff is good to include regardless.
- Transform slots used for defining the zones that the Yeti considers "forest" versus "engagement zone" (the open area in front of the forest, in our case). Use empty GameObjects to define these zones; bottom/top-left/right refer to the environment from a birds eye view.

EXTRA NOTES:
--

- As a disclaimer, please note that it is now almost 6 AM, since I got home very late and started working on this only a couple hours after - so there could very well be bugs I haven't noticed.

- Also, I'm sorry for the mammoth commit. I also refactored many prefab names to start with PF_ instead of SK_ or SM_, as it didn't make any sense, made for an unclear naming scheme, and they were just the default names from creating the prefab. I also cleaned up the main game scene a fair bit while I was at it since it the hierarchy had been bugging me. I basically just unpacked and deleted unnecessary prefabs and reordered some parenting. Nothing about the actual scene or gameplay is changed (aside from the Yeti stuff obviously). Anyway, all of that is why there are so many file changes.

- The script to spawn the marker objects for the old snowballs to target themselves at is still there, I just disabled it. It should probably be deleted at a later stage, but for now I'm leaving it to make it easy to re-use later if we find a different use for it. I don't know what will happen if we re-enable it right now.

refactor: fix all the issues linted by new eslint config

As I have set up new eslint config to lint the issues, most of the files
started to scream and beg for correction, I have pressed that magic ctrl
+ s to fix each one of them, as I have that amazing autosave option ofc
configured, and then scared as hell prayed to all gods possible that my
app still works. And it WORKS!
