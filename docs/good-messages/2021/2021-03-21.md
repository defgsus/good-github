Added Grettel to this list

I only wish I knew her better. She has lovely feet.

I want to be under them.

I would not say no to letting her drive over me, either.

Though, I can't say I really WANT that, obviously. I mean, that would
be really, really stupid. But then again...
most of this is.

New data: 2021-03-20. See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (MB, ON, SK).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “7 new deaths, for a total of 10,594 deaths: 1 death in the last 24 hours, 4 deaths between March 13 and March 18, 2 deaths before March 13.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

input_text = """Bloomington Normal is almost laughably cliché for a midwestern city. Vast swathes of corn envelop winding roads and the heady smell of BBQ smoke pervades the countryside every summer. Yet, underlying the trite norms of Normal is the prescriptive force of tradition—the expectation to fulfill my role as a female Filipino by playing Debussy in the yearly piano festival and enrolling in multivariable calculus instead of political philosophy.So when I discovered the technical demand of bebop, the triplet groove, and the intricacies of chordal harmony after ten years of grueling classical piano, I was fascinated by the music's novelty. Jazz guitar was not only evocative and creative, but also strangely liberating. I began to explore different pedagogical methods, transcribe solos from the greats, and experiment with various approaches until my own unique sound began to develop. And, although I did not know what would be the 'best' route for me to follow as a musician, the freedom to forge whatever path I felt was right seemed to be exactly what I needed; there were no expectations for me to continue in any particular way—only the way that suited my own desires.While journeying this trail, I found myself at Interlochen Arts Camp the summer before my junior year. Never before had I been immersed in an environment so conducive to musical growth: I was surrounded by people intensely passionate about pursuing all kinds of art with no regard for ideas of what art 'should' be. I knew immediately that this would be a perfect opportunity to cultivate my sound, unbounded by the limits of confining tradition. On the first day of camp, I found that my peer guitarist in big band was another Filipino girl from Illinois. Until that moment, my endeavors in jazz guitar had been a solitary effort; I had no one with whom to collaborate and no one against whom I could compare myself, much less someone from a background mirroring my own. I was eager to play with her, but while I quickly recognized a slew of differences between us—different heights, guitars, and even playing styles—others seemed to have trouble making that distinction during performances. Some even went as far as calling me 'other-Francesca.' Thus, amidst the glittering lakes and musky pine needles of Interlochen, I once again confronted Bloomington's frustrating expectations.After being mistaken for her several times, I could not help but view Francesca as a standard of what the 'female Filipino jazz guitarist' should embody. Her improvisatory language, comping style and even personal qualities loomed above me as something I had to live up to. Nevertheless, as Francesca and I continued to play together, it was not long before we connected through our creative pursuit. In time, I learned to draw inspiration from her instead of feeling pressured to follow whatever precedent I thought she set. I found that I grew because of, rather than in spite of, her presence; I could find solace in our similarities and even a sense of comfort in an unfamiliar environment without being trapped by expectation. Though the pressure to conform was still present—and will likely remain present in my life no matter what genre I'm playing or what pursuits I engage in—I learned to eschew its corrosive influence and enjoy the rewards that it brings. While my encounter with Francesca at first sparked a feeling of pressure to conform in a setting where I never thought I would feel its presence, it also carried the warmth of finding someone with whom I could connect. Like the admittedly trite conditions of my hometown, the resemblances between us provided comfort to me through their familiarity. I ultimately found that I can embrace this warmth while still rejecting the pressure to succumb to expectations, and that, in the careful balance between these elements, I can grow in a way that feels both like discove"""

Update project3.html

Please advise if anything I need to improve for this particular assignment.

for (c=0; c<5; c++){
myDice[c] = new Die(6); 
myDice[c].poker();
}
I suspected this is incorrect before, however, the result came out undefined when I change to 6, 
so, i went to correct the for loops to change <= in order to create 6 sides. Then can't get the A
for (i= 0; i<this.sides; i++)
Thanks for pointing out the Math.ceil. Now it makes total sense.
I feel the .poker function is the assign the values array to the pokerSide array. Correct?
however, if the length of arrays are different, then it will be  some unexpected result, am I thinking right?
But this should be out of the scope of this assignment.
one thing I still don't understand, if values array already assigned to the pokerSide array, then, when I call alert(myDice[0].poker), it should show the same result as alert(myDice[0].values)?
I may have some more questions to ask you, but I will save it for later after all my finals.

Thanks so much for your help!

\section{Introduction}

The given Bomberman game is obviously (as discussed in the lecture) a Markov model, which is fully observable and thus our policy, on which our agent acts, fulfills the prerequisites of a Marcov decision process. In the earlier stages of the project (the first two tasks without enemies) we have a deterministic world in theory. %%Macht Sinn??

This means we could have used a model to learn our world and the 'transition probabilities' (delta functions) to train our agent on this world. However, when thinking about the tournament where we would have other agents acting on their own accord, the world loses the deterministic property in our agents perspective. This is why we went for a model free Q learning approach from the get go, because in the end we would end up with a world non deterministic transition probabilities and also would not want to learn those. We also do not need to understand what our agent is doing as long as it is beating the others, so being a blackbox seemed to be a small disadvantage here.

??The first Q learning approach that came to our minds is of course the 'exploration-exploitation trade-off', which we discussed in the lecture.??

To help us with evaluating our agent's learning process, we wrote a script 'analysis.py', which allows us to monitor different variables during the training process, i.e. the total rewards our agent gained throughout each single episode. This is one of the methods we used to rate the learning success or rate, but we will explain more on that, in the respective tasks where the script was used.
\newpage
\noindent
The common hyperparameters used in this report will be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\epsilon$ : The probability of choosing a random action in the $\epsilon$ greedy algorithm
    \item $\alpha$ : The arbitrary learning rate we use when updating our action value function in Q learning
    \item $\gamma$ : The discount factor that determines how much significance we give to the subsequent gamestates when updating our action value function in Q learning
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\section{Task 1: Collecting Coins in an Open Labyrinth}
Before even thinking about setting features, hyperparameters or rewards for collecting coins in an open maze, we had to decide which method of reinforcement learning we would go with. After being overwhelmed by the sheer amount of possibilities in the beginning, we tried to settle for the simplest approach given in the lecture: The $\epsilon$ greedy policy. So our basic algorithm was going to be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Make an initial guess for our matrix Q %%MATRIX ODER TENSOR?
        which gives the agent an easier entrance to the learning process}
    \item{Let the agent play an episode where in every move it plays the highest value action in the current state (meaning with the given features) with a probability of $1 -\epsilon$ and does a random (sometimes weighted) action with a probability $\epsilon$}
    \item{When an episode is over, we evaluate every combination of action and gamestate we encountered in the specific episode and compare our action value function $Q$ with the actual rewards earned to adapt our $Q$ accordingly}
    \item Repeat this until the desired success is achieved by the agent
\end{itemize}

After understanding this basic setup, we started thinking about

\textbf{Moin!} Ich hab meine erlebnisse beim ausprobieren hier ziemlich ungefiltert reinschmiert. Ich denke mal sowas wie eine beispielhafte behandlung von unseren daily struggles würde Sinn ergeben im Report?
\section{Hyperparameter learning (Context is regression with LVA (LVE?)}
Implementing a new algorithmic approach doesn't lead to results right away. In order to confirm a working implementation one seeks to see learning results. However, there is some time needed to tune the hyperparameters that enable learning.
The learning setup is characterized by the algorithm, its learning parameters and the rewards that the agent ought to use as purpose of each action.
To be specific, [I use right now] 4 step temporal difference Q learning with regression by linear value approximation. I just copy the json here to save time...  \\

When choosing initial values one has to rely on guessing. By repeatedly training and observing the results we can conjecture what went wrong and build an intuition for reasonable auxiliary rewards. We observed, that the agent can easily get stuck in a local optimum. In finding good rewards we are faced with two main challenges:
\textbf{The final game rewards are to sparse}
If rewards occur very rarely most of the training time is lost by random behavior that doesn't give any feedback for updating the model. Most actions lead to nothing.
\textbf{Auxiliary rewards lead to ultimately unwanted behavior}
Auxiliary rewards meant to nudge the model towards a desired behavior can instead alter the behavior in an unforeseen way.
We have to rely on auxiliary rewards to give our model enough feedback to learn, so we have to try to minimize the biases that come with them.
As the auxiliary rewards are meant to nudge rather than to repurpose the agent we could call the unwanted behavior \textit{auxiliary reward abuse} (??? what u think ???)

I suspect it might be helpful to only use auxiliary rewards in the early stages of training and drop them in the end, but this will have to be investigated later.

At an early stage, we can directly observe said \textit{auxiliary reward abuse}. For example going for a somewhat minimal approach proved to be unsatisfactory. Rewarding only destroyed crates and collected coins while punishing invalid actions and killing itself was thought to be a good initial idea, because it would give some auxiliary rewards, but only for events with undoubted value in any game regardless of specific situation.
However, being punished repeatedly for trying to move or placing bombs, the agent soon learned to do nothing and just wait.
We tried two things:
Punishing waiting lead to an agent tending to walk back and forth unproductively. This is a more sophisticated waiting agent and fundamentally suffers from the same flaw.
The next trial was to reward the agent to visit new places. [As I write this I am not sure anymore if this was dumb, Im not sure anymore if this changes anything, u got an idea?]

This seemed to provide a good enough basis for a longer training session, so set it up to train 30000 rounds and regularly checked in to see what the agent was doing in between.

During the training the agent appeared to have learned a specific move, namely placing a bomb, going around a corner and waiting there. In certain settings this strategy can  very effectively destroy crates. However, oftentimes the agent fails doing this, because it tries to move into a wall where it hoped to find a hiding place. Then the bomb goes off and it dies.
Overall, it rarely works out, so it should be punished by the learning process and eventually adapt to become more reliable or vanish completely. In this case it the behavior vanished.

Overall, the agents actions appeared to be more diverse as before the rewards had been tweaked (specifically the visit new places reward), but it still showed both the waiting and stepping back and forth

It is suspected, that a higher epsilon (0.3) a lower N (3) a lower punishment for self kill (-0.1)[due to the fact that a small test proved to frighten the agent to drop bombs at all] and a additional reward for placed bombs (0.1) would be better.

Nobomb punishment makes a lot of sense, because it specifically punishes boring waiters and hopefully nudges towards better exploration. This should work as it is worse to live 150 steps than to try to bomb a crate and die in the process.

hypothesis: nstep td with high N makes more sense for longer training sessions, because it otherwise relies on those random exploration actions that don't get integrated in Q...

Good night my lovely diary ;)

More NPCs and talking

New NPC - Randal the rat morph.  Think he'll be a janitor or something,
not entirely sure.
Added dialogue stuff so you can talk to Steve.
Updated Sonja so she has a schedule like other NPCs and removed early
attempt of clothing change.
Changed Sonja's start location to the barracks because her icon on the
secretary is annoying me.
Changed Morwen a bit - changed to be like other firehouse NPCs, added
schedule, changed fetishes
fixed the pronouns in Steve's responses in FireHouse.java so it's "Talk
to this guy." instead of "Talk to this lady."
Changed Cyrilla to be more like other firehouse NPCs, added schedule
Added Morwen to ParserTarget
Added Morwen to Game.java - thanks to deboucher for helping me figure
out an error I was getting with her.
Added Cyrilla to Game.java
Created a new section in Game.java just for fire house NPCs and put them
in alphabetical order

things that still need to be done:
need to fix the dialogue button after ending sex.  Currently doesn't
have a tooltip and there might be a problem with the set location.
implement conversations with all proper NPCs
Interrupt system so NPCs stop sex if they're about to go on shift
Have fire fighters be more frisky/have sex during arcane storms
Add schedule so fire fighters take a shower before working and making
sure that all debuffs are removed
Need to finish adding NPCs
Need to write for NPCs so that they each have their own character and
personality
Need to figure out how to ask NPCs to have sex privately in case the
player doesn't want people watching
Need to implement some sort of system so the player can avoid certain
gender pairings if they don't want to see them
Finish adding rooms
probably some sex behavior based on if dom or sub
enable dialogue flags so the NPCs only do the intro once
NPC affection stuff
NPC relationships/dating
Quests
writing
Fire fighter equipment and uniforms
Fire fighter background perk

"9:55am. Let me chill a bit and I will start. I think I understand what my problem is now and where the dissonance is.

10:50am. Right now I am watching the Processing tuts. Let me elaborate what the problem is. The source of the dissonance is the difference between imagining an image and actually drawing it.

In the past week, I've thought about the data flow in depth. This is my expertise. I am good at managing and simplifying complex currents of data.

I've made the Lithe library and am pretending things are easy now, but that is not true. Things are only starting at this point.

Once the library is there, and it is not - these recent examples which refer to one another's properties are blowing a hole in my conception, once the library is there, I need to work on the UI in isolation.

Yesterday I asked whether I should write a game intepreter for the states.

Why am I even asking myself that? Really that is the easy part.

The hard part is working on the UI.

I should make and test all the components in isolation first. That is what I should be doing. It will be easy to ferry and transform the data once that is done. So what if I have to write a bit extra code to do it.

11am. What bothers me the most right now is how nasty the interop is.

In Spiral I do not get the benefit of Intellisense, and I had not anticipated some of the needs of the library.

I need to make more thorough bindings. Instead of just setters, I'll need both setters and getters. Let me resume the processing videos.

https://processing.org/tutorials/

Let me go through the text tutorials. I just want to do this. I want inspiration for my UI work. Maybe I'll download Processing for Python later.

https://processing.org/tutorials/overview/

> At the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and simplicity of use. If we didn't care about speed, it might make sense to use Python, Ruby, or many other scripting languages. This is especially true for the education side. If we didn't care about making a transition to more advanced languages, we'd probably avoid a C++ or Java-style syntax. But Java makes a nice starting point for a sketching language because it's far more forgiving than C/C++ and also allows users to export sketches for distribution via the web.

So that is how it is.

11:40am. https://processing.org/tutorials/interactivity/

I am just skimming these right now to get a sense of it. I'll do some programming Spiral after the break. I am still thinking about things on the side.

11:50am. https://processing.org/tutorials/typography/

This is of interest to me. So far, Processing seems like half of UI library. I really am interested in what it offers for advanced use cases.

12:05pm. https://processing.org/tutorials/text/

Processing is based on an old version of Java with manifest typing.

12:15pm. https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels/

I did not think the tutorials would cover such low level details.

12:45pm. Ok, I get what Processing is about. I'll have to investigate the drawing capabilities of the Kivy library later.

Let me stop here for the time being.

I am in the right mindset to start drawing things. I'll play with the Kivy canvas and animations next.

I need to up my affinity with this. I need to make proper UIs, but for that I need to stop thinking about the backend stuff. So far this has been my focus, but this is not what I should be thinking about now that my focus are UIs themselves."

Aww hating on the Repo!

The Two images up there says most of this, but frankly I don't give a fuck if she hates on this. Like I said there are copies of this all over, not including what I have currently sent to James, via a flash drive of her bullshit. Which included: 
All of the background checks several of us have done
All the Pedo shit, both her talk of him, and the actual files from what could be found via a google search, and everything about him she spewed from the old disney forums. Which mind you is what brought our attention upon that. Her screams of background checks and such, led us right to that sicko. 
Her hallucinations that were occurring on the old Disney Forums, IE Royal Hitler, her relation to Cleopatra and other rants. And so much more. 

And she seems to forget there is Squirrels Repo as well that has more sitting there, and the Trollorist Forums, as well as several blogs. 

But her hate on this is to get MY Attention. And the most it has got was a chuckle and me going back to playing Pokemon Go with my actual go outside with them and hang out friends! And well this little blurb.

Ensure multiple extra_attrs without blocks work correctly

Two pieces of context needed:

First, there's a bunch of logic around serializer attributes:
subclassing resources, explicit serializers, defaults, overrides, etc.
And all of this gets dicey considering it all wraps and hacks an
external library, `jsonapi-serializable`.  So we're pretty dumb about
saying "any time we're doing something that can affect serialization,
re-configure everything".

Second, we recently accommodated the scenario where a parent resource
class guards an attribute, and a subclass removes that guard. The logic
added says "if this was previously guarded, remove the guard - as we're
adding the property again, the guard will get added again if it needs to
be".

These two scenarios conflicted. If you had two `extra_attribute` calls,
the second would cause the first to be re-applied as part of the
"reconfigure everything" approach. And when re-applied, we remove the
prior guard...expecting it to be added again as part of the idempotent
nature of the call.

This worked as expected if you passed a block, because you'd end up back
[here](https://github.com/graphiti-api/graphiti/blob/master/lib/graphiti/util/serializer_attributes.rb#L20).
But if you didn't pass a block, you'd end up [here](https://github.com/graphiti-api/graphiti/blob/master/lib/graphiti/util/serializer_attributes.rb#L24),
with the logic being "the only thing we need to do here is add the guard
back.

This was dumb! If you're going to do the "reconfigure everything"
approach, you need to ensure you're following the same codepath - not
this special codepath that was added. This had the adverse effect that
no guard was re-added (for extra attributes, the conditional [is added
in a different way](https://github.com/graphiti-api/graphiti/blob/master/lib/graphiti/extensions/extra_attribute.rb#L43) than a normal guard).

So the fix is to ensure we always follow the same codepath, which will
now correctly re-apply the guard. And added tests for the scenario where
multiple `extra_attributes` are added with and without blocks.

Finally, I'm not so sure about the wisdom of "reconfigure everything".
This was added 3 years ago as part of the major refactor that replaced
`jsonapi_suite` and became the `graphiti` we know and love today. It's
possible that the scenarios we were worried about are no longer
relevant, and this is more of a hindrance than a help. For now, simplest
fix.

"2pm. Done with breakfast, but let me chill a bit more. I'll do the chores next. I am actually pretty depressed right now. I do not feel like starting just yet.

I am not sure completely what triggered it, but I get pessimistic when things do not go my way. I think the latest redesign had something to do with it. Or maybe the way some patterns would quire the components to communicate by ids.

When I redesigned the two on_x functions, it wrecked the design I intended. I am going to have to expand on it. Or maybe having to use macros in a place I had not intended. Or the string interpolation thing. Or the realization that the UI itself would not come so easily to me.

2:10pm. Maybe I need a vacation. My push to redesign the editor support was great, but maybe I do need some time to steady my heart for the next part.

I've planned things out. I know the steps I need to do to make DREAM. I know how to put in RNNs. I can handle that in due time. I am even making plans for reverse UIs.

But that I've been taken off my guard regarding regular UIs shows that maybe I need to think some more about this. I need to think and think, and then I need to work at overcoming my mental block.

The worst thing I can do in this situation is pressure myself even more over wasting time by not doing the UI.

3:25pm. Done with chores.

Right now I really aren't in the mood for programming. Maybe I'll watch that OpenCV course for a bit. Let me finish the chapter of the story I am reading and then I'll do just a bit.

Actually, let me do some refactoring first. That might get me in the mood a little.

///

        "-ExecutionPolicy", "ByPass", "-NoExit", "-Command", "& 'C:/Users/Marko/anaconda3/shell/condabin/conda-hook.ps1' ; conda activate 'C:/Users/Marko/anaconda3'"
    ],

///

Having to toggle this off whenever I start the extension host is such a pain in the ass.

I'll also want to add a command to start the Cython file after it finished compiling.

TODO: Command: Build File And Run.
TODO: Personal: Figure out how to start the Anaconda env properly.

```
@on_texture_size (fun (l,(_,v)) => $"!l.height = !v")
```

Is this really so bad?

```
import numpy as np
import pyximport
pyximport.install(language_level=3,setup_args={"include_dirs":np.get_include()})
from main import main
print(main())
```

If only I could do this from the command line...

3:40pm.

```
open kivy
open lithe

type player = {
    stack : u32
    pot : u32
    card : string
    }

type state = {
    p1 : player
    p2 : player
    }

inl view dispatch (state : rx.observable _) =
    inl (~+) x = +state x
    boxlayout [
        -orientation Vertical
        children [
            ]
        ]

inl main () =
    inl app = appm.create()
    inl p1 = agent.neural_random.create()
    inl p2 = agent.uniform_random.create()
    inl text = ""
    inl _ = rx.subscribe (loop {p1 p2 text} model view) (appm.root app)
    appm.run app
```

Let me start things off like this. My goal will be to make a poker table. But let me not mess with this right now.

Even though I feel a bit better now that I've started...

I need to think. How do I make the chip? How do I make the stack of chips? How do I animate the transitions from stack to pot?

Having to write bindings as I worked on the UI itself is just so rough. No wonder I do not feel like it.

I should prototype this in Python. The lack of any kind of autocomplete is really hitting me here.

Remember those Processing tutorials. Making a one line change and then compiling right away to see the effect of that is really not Spiral's strong suit.

With both F# and Spiral I am used to writing code for days and even weeks without running it once.

I should really consider writing it in Python first before rewriting it in Spiral. I already want to go back to .NET and Avalonia. Sigh.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o
OpenCV Course

Let me check this out for a bit.

4:05pm. https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?t=912

Spiral Python interop is such a pain in the ass when it comes to tuples. I made my custom ones, but was that a mistake? It might have been.

4:10pm. Let me watch for 20 more minutes and then I will gather my thoughts. I am leaning towards leaving Spiral aside for a while and doing the initial UI work in Python.

There is no doubt that to make the complete RL systme, I am going to need Spiral. Imagine wrting something big in Python. But all these trivial interop issues and all sorts of annoyances are eating away at me from the inside.

There are a shitload of items on the TODO list, there is always work to be done, but somehow the things I want to do keep eluding me. That is how I feel right now.

Since I am partnering with it for the time being, maybe giving into it a little would not be a bad idea?

I do not have to swallow Python right away.

4:35pm. https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?t=1911

Let me stop here with the course.

Just imagine doing all this in Spiral. Interfacing through macros.

I am really feeling the pain of fighting Python. My regret has never been as strong as it is now.

Imagine if I could do 1000x as much work in a day that I can now.

day 1 : Spiral v0.09 is done
day 2 : Spiral v2 is done
day 3 : Spiral v2 is perfected and all its libraries are there

How much could I do in a 100 days? Future superintelligents are going to be able to do much more than 1000x in a day.

5:15pm. Had to leave for lunch.

To continue on that earlier spiel, consider PyTorch. Just what is it to me?

If I had 3 years in a day, I could take a day to do everything I need on my own.

ML libraries are such a vital part of ML, that expertise in building them would really be a prerequisite. Time doing that would be well spent. But as a human I just do not have it. I am pressured at every turn.

5:20pm. The Lithe Rx library is better architecturally that Kivy Language. It is better than doing things by hand, that is for sure.

But I can't afford to do my exploration in it.

When I first tried writing the Spiral editor support plugin, my first choices were functional programming langs like ReasonML and Fable. Eventually I dumped both of them for Typescript. It seems to be in the past now, but at the time it was emotional. Remember how mad I got at Fable for its None being null? I was mad enough to drop it. Eventually I grew a spine and did what I had to do.

I don't mind TS now.

Python needs to go the same way for me.

I mean, I clearly should not be doing games in it. But when it comes to interop heavy work like the UI library, my impulse should be to do as much as possible in Python, rather than Spiral. It is not that Python is better than functional languages at UIs, but I can't afford to keep switching back and forth between designing the Lithe library, writing the bindings and working on the UI itself. It is too distruptive to my workflow.

5:25pm. For the next few days, forget Spiral. Forget even touching it. I should program in Python for a while.

5:30pm. Functional abstractions matter, but even more than that it is important that programming be comfortable. I really can't fault Python for short programs.

I am just lacking this ability as a programmer, to just let go. Do I want to impress other people or do I want to do what is needed? Spiral and join points will get recognized eventually, my job is to move out of the cardboard box under a bridge that I live in.

5:35pm. You can really tell the difference in smoothness when programming in Python directly, and using Spiral macros.

Using Python on the side, writing bindings, and using Spiral is something I should factor into different passes as much as possible.

More than UIs themselves or OpenCV in the future, this is the skill I need to develop. I might be a good programmer, but the way I am acting now by going into depression is the opposite of good. It is a huge strategic mistake rather than some bug in need of fixing.

5:40pm. I need to get better at Python. The most important way in which I need to get better is to accept both it and Spiral.

I think balancing the two languages will be my biggest challenge, not doing the agents or anything else.

Yes, this is root of my discomfort. I am not too happy with my PyTorch bindings to begin with. This is the weak point of Spiral.

As a functional language, F# is much more comfortable to work in. Even with the editor support advantage of v2, Spiral is just at the threeshold where it is worth using. It does not mean it is better than the alternatives.

I still haven't gotten to the point where its strengths shine through.

This is why the current situation is suppressing me so much. I need to keep my head down until I am ready to strike.

5:50pm. Let me stop here for the day. Tomorrow, my goal will be to do what I meant to do today, but I'll endeavor to do it in Python.

Days like this happen. I don't spend them slacking on the side. The way to overcome blocks and depression is to grind away at them and face them head on. If I can't face them face on, I still obsess about the issue. That kind of autistic focus will make miracles happen. I am going to try to gather my pace tomorrow.

If I can display the same strength of momentum that I'd shown when doing editor support, both RL and the agents won't take long to do."

- Added sister's reaction on nude/topless main character. It works as brother's since they have almost identical schedules
- Fixed some misprints and made text improvements
= Fixed (/finished) global variables showing positions of sister
- Now sister can notice semen on you. Two reactions: when semen on/in pussy and when it's everywhere
- Improved both Problem Solver and Daily Check Problem Solver. I don't want to touch something that works, so I just made them a bit faster and more efficient
- Added new text by Rachael to the Threesome event (when you are whoring via Smartphone, and a family member wants to join). Now, sister is available, too. Like always, there's a scene for the first time and another one for other times
- Fixed the error you get when you go to JobHunters from the Bedroom link and then back
- I removed all useless books from the Library
- Added a new rule to the HaveASexWidget now beasts can cum in you without getting you pregnant! Already added this ability to existing scenes
- Added limit for Ralf's relationship points (from 0 to 100)
- Now, you can mate with Ralf in Family Bitch mode. Enable it in Dog girl magazine (requires 80 FB Corruption). Later I'll add his reaction to Canine lube to make it not so useless

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Rollup merge of #80771 - thomcc:nonnull-refmut, r=dtolnay

Make NonNull::as_ref (and friends) return refs with unbound lifetimes

# Rationale:

1. The documentation for all of these functions claims that this is what the functions already do, as they all come with this comment:

    > You must enforce Rust's aliasing rules, *since the returned lifetime 'a is arbitrarily chosen* and does not necessarily reflect the actual lifetime of the data...

    So I think it's just a bug that they weren't this way already. Note that had it not been for this part, I wouldn't be making this PR, so if we decide we won't take this change, I'll follow it up with a docs PR to fix this.

2. This is how the equivalent raw pointer functions behave.

    They also take `self` and not `&self`/`&mut self`, but that can't be changed compatibly at this point. This is the next best thing.

3. Without this fix, often code that uses these methods will find it has to expand the lifetime of the result.

    (I can't speak for others but even in unsafe-heavy code, needing to do this unexpectedly is a huge red flag -- if Rust thinks something should have a specific lifetime, I assume it's for a reason)

### Can this cause existing code to be unsound?

I'm confident this can't cause new unsoundness since the reference exists for at most its lifetime, but you get a borrow checker error if you do something that would require/allow the reference to exist past its lifetime.

Additionally, the aliasing rules of a reference only applies while the reference exists.

This *must* be the case, as it is required by the rules used by safe code. (That said, the documentation in this file sort of contradicts it, but I think it's just ambiguity between the lifetime `'a` in `&'a T` and lifetime of the `&'a T` reference itself...)

We are increasing the lifetime of these references, but they should already have hard bounds on that lifetime, or they'd have borrow checker errors.

(CC `@RalfJung` because I have gone and done the mistake where I say something definitive about aliasing in Rust which is honestly outside the group of things I should make definitive comments about).

# Caveats

1. This is insta-stable (except for on the unstable functions ofc). I don't think there's any other alternative.

2. I don't believe this is a breaking change in practice. In theory someone could be assigning `NonNull::as_ref` to a function pointer of type `fn(&NonNull<T>) -> &T`. Now they'd need to use a slightly different function pointer type which is (probably) incompatible. This seems pathological, but I guess crater could be used if there are concerns.

3. This has no tests. The old version didn't either that I saw. I could add some stuff that fails to compile without it, if that would be useful.

4. Sometimes the NLL borrow checker gives up and decides lifetimes live till the end of the scope, as opposed to the range where they're used. If this change can cause this to happen more, then my soundness rationale is wrong, and it's likely breaking.

    In practice this seems super unlikely.

Anyway. That was a lot of typing.
