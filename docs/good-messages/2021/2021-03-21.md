input_text = """Bloomington Normal is almost laughably cliché for a midwestern city. Vast swathes of corn envelop winding roads and the heady smell of BBQ smoke pervades the countryside every summer. Yet, underlying the trite norms of Normal is the prescriptive force of tradition—the expectation to fulfill my role as a female Filipino by playing Debussy in the yearly piano festival and enrolling in multivariable calculus instead of political philosophy.So when I discovered the technical demand of bebop, the triplet groove, and the intricacies of chordal harmony after ten years of grueling classical piano, I was fascinated by the music's novelty. Jazz guitar was not only evocative and creative, but also strangely liberating. I began to explore different pedagogical methods, transcribe solos from the greats, and experiment with various approaches until my own unique sound began to develop. And, although I did not know what would be the 'best' route for me to follow as a musician, the freedom to forge whatever path I felt was right seemed to be exactly what I needed; there were no expectations for me to continue in any particular way—only the way that suited my own desires.While journeying this trail, I found myself at Interlochen Arts Camp the summer before my junior year. Never before had I been immersed in an environment so conducive to musical growth: I was surrounded by people intensely passionate about pursuing all kinds of art with no regard for ideas of what art 'should' be. I knew immediately that this would be a perfect opportunity to cultivate my sound, unbounded by the limits of confining tradition. On the first day of camp, I found that my peer guitarist in big band was another Filipino girl from Illinois. Until that moment, my endeavors in jazz guitar had been a solitary effort; I had no one with whom to collaborate and no one against whom I could compare myself, much less someone from a background mirroring my own. I was eager to play with her, but while I quickly recognized a slew of differences between us—different heights, guitars, and even playing styles—others seemed to have trouble making that distinction during performances. Some even went as far as calling me 'other-Francesca.' Thus, amidst the glittering lakes and musky pine needles of Interlochen, I once again confronted Bloomington's frustrating expectations.After being mistaken for her several times, I could not help but view Francesca as a standard of what the 'female Filipino jazz guitarist' should embody. Her improvisatory language, comping style and even personal qualities loomed above me as something I had to live up to. Nevertheless, as Francesca and I continued to play together, it was not long before we connected through our creative pursuit. In time, I learned to draw inspiration from her instead of feeling pressured to follow whatever precedent I thought she set. I found that I grew because of, rather than in spite of, her presence; I could find solace in our similarities and even a sense of comfort in an unfamiliar environment without being trapped by expectation. Though the pressure to conform was still present—and will likely remain present in my life no matter what genre I'm playing or what pursuits I engage in—I learned to eschew its corrosive influence and enjoy the rewards that it brings. While my encounter with Francesca at first sparked a feeling of pressure to conform in a setting where I never thought I would feel its presence, it also carried the warmth of finding someone with whom I could connect. Like the admittedly trite conditions of my hometown, the resemblances between us provided comfort to me through their familiarity. I ultimately found that I can embrace this warmth while still rejecting the pressure to succumb to expectations, and that, in the careful balance between these elements, I can grow in a way that feels both like discove"""

"9:55am. Let me chill a bit and I will start. I think I understand what my problem is now and where the dissonance is.

10:50am. Right now I am watching the Processing tuts. Let me elaborate what the problem is. The source of the dissonance is the difference between imagining an image and actually drawing it.

In the past week, I've thought about the data flow in depth. This is my expertise. I am good at managing and simplifying complex currents of data.

I've made the Lithe library and am pretending things are easy now, but that is not true. Things are only starting at this point.

Once the library is there, and it is not - these recent examples which refer to one another's properties are blowing a hole in my conception, once the library is there, I need to work on the UI in isolation.

Yesterday I asked whether I should write a game intepreter for the states.

Why am I even asking myself that? Really that is the easy part.

The hard part is working on the UI.

I should make and test all the components in isolation first. That is what I should be doing. It will be easy to ferry and transform the data once that is done. So what if I have to write a bit extra code to do it.

11am. What bothers me the most right now is how nasty the interop is.

In Spiral I do not get the benefit of Intellisense, and I had not anticipated some of the needs of the library.

I need to make more thorough bindings. Instead of just setters, I'll need both setters and getters. Let me resume the processing videos.

https://processing.org/tutorials/

Let me go through the text tutorials. I just want to do this. I want inspiration for my UI work. Maybe I'll download Processing for Python later.

https://processing.org/tutorials/overview/

> At the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and simplicity of use. If we didn't care about speed, it might make sense to use Python, Ruby, or many other scripting languages. This is especially true for the education side. If we didn't care about making a transition to more advanced languages, we'd probably avoid a C++ or Java-style syntax. But Java makes a nice starting point for a sketching language because it's far more forgiving than C/C++ and also allows users to export sketches for distribution via the web.

So that is how it is.

11:40am. https://processing.org/tutorials/interactivity/

I am just skimming these right now to get a sense of it. I'll do some programming Spiral after the break. I am still thinking about things on the side.

11:50am. https://processing.org/tutorials/typography/

This is of interest to me. So far, Processing seems like half of UI library. I really am interested in what it offers for advanced use cases.

12:05pm. https://processing.org/tutorials/text/

Processing is based on an old version of Java with manifest typing.

12:15pm. https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels/

I did not think the tutorials would cover such low level details.

12:45pm. Ok, I get what Processing is about. I'll have to investigate the drawing capabilities of the Kivy library later.

Let me stop here for the time being.

I am in the right mindset to start drawing things. I'll play with the Kivy canvas and animations next.

I need to up my affinity with this. I need to make proper UIs, but for that I need to stop thinking about the backend stuff. So far this has been my focus, but this is not what I should be thinking about now that my focus are UIs themselves."

Aww hating on the Repo!

The Two images up there says most of this, but frankly I don't give a fuck if she hates on this. Like I said there are copies of this all over, not including what I have currently sent to James, via a flash drive of her bullshit. Which included: 
All of the background checks several of us have done
All the Pedo shit, both her talk of him, and the actual files from what could be found via a google search, and everything about him she spewed from the old disney forums. Which mind you is what brought our attention upon that. Her screams of background checks and such, led us right to that sicko. 
Her hallucinations that were occurring on the old Disney Forums, IE Royal Hitler, her relation to Cleopatra and other rants. And so much more. 

And she seems to forget there is Squirrels Repo as well that has more sitting there, and the Trollorist Forums, as well as several blogs. 

But her hate on this is to get MY Attention. And the most it has got was a chuckle and me going back to playing Pokemon Go with my actual go outside with them and hang out friends! And well this little blurb.

"2pm. Done with breakfast, but let me chill a bit more. I'll do the chores next. I am actually pretty depressed right now. I do not feel like starting just yet.

I am not sure completely what triggered it, but I get pessimistic when things do not go my way. I think the latest redesign had something to do with it. Or maybe the way some patterns would quire the components to communicate by ids.

When I redesigned the two on_x functions, it wrecked the design I intended. I am going to have to expand on it. Or maybe having to use macros in a place I had not intended. Or the string interpolation thing. Or the realization that the UI itself would not come so easily to me.

2:10pm. Maybe I need a vacation. My push to redesign the editor support was great, but maybe I do need some time to steady my heart for the next part.

I've planned things out. I know the steps I need to do to make DREAM. I know how to put in RNNs. I can handle that in due time. I am even making plans for reverse UIs.

But that I've been taken off my guard regarding regular UIs shows that maybe I need to think some more about this. I need to think and think, and then I need to work at overcoming my mental block.

The worst thing I can do in this situation is pressure myself even more over wasting time by not doing the UI.

3:25pm. Done with chores.

Right now I really aren't in the mood for programming. Maybe I'll watch that OpenCV course for a bit. Let me finish the chapter of the story I am reading and then I'll do just a bit.

Actually, let me do some refactoring first. That might get me in the mood a little.

///

    "terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows": [
        "-ExecutionPolicy", "ByPass", "-NoExit", "-Command", "& 'C:/Users/Marko/anaconda3/shell/condabin/conda-hook.ps1' ; conda activate 'C:/Users/Marko/anaconda3'"
    ],

///

Having to toggle this off whenever I start the extension host is such a pain in the ass.

I'll also want to add a command to start the Cython file after it finished compiling.

TODO: Command: Build File And Run.
TODO: Personal: Figure out how to start the Anaconda env properly.

```
@on_texture_size (fun (l,(_,v)) => $"!l.height = !v")
```

Is this really so bad?

```
import numpy as np
import pyximport
pyximport.install(language_level=3,setup_args={"include_dirs":np.get_include()})
from main import main
print(main())
```

If only I could do this from the command line...

3:40pm.

```
open kivy
open lithe

type player = {
    stack : u32
    pot : u32
    card : string
    }

type state = {
    p1 : player
    p2 : player
    }

inl view dispatch (state : rx.observable _) =
    inl (~+) x = +state x
    boxlayout [
        -orientation Vertical
        children [
            ]
        ]

inl main () =
    inl app = appm.create()
    inl p1 = agent.neural_random.create()
    inl p2 = agent.uniform_random.create()
    inl text = ""
    inl _ = rx.subscribe (loop {p1 p2 text} model view) (appm.root app)
    appm.run app
```

Let me start things off like this. My goal will be to make a poker table. But let me not mess with this right now.

Even though I feel a bit better now that I've started...

I need to think. How do I make the chip? How do I make the stack of chips? How do I animate the transitions from stack to pot?

Having to write bindings as I worked on the UI itself is just so rough. No wonder I do not feel like it.

I should prototype this in Python. The lack of any kind of autocomplete is really hitting me here.

Remember those Processing tutorials. Making a one line change and then compiling right away to see the effect of that is really not Spiral's strong suit.

With both F# and Spiral I am used to writing code for days and even weeks without running it once.

I should really consider writing it in Python first before rewriting it in Spiral. I already want to go back to .NET and Avalonia. Sigh.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o
OpenCV Course

Let me check this out for a bit.

4:05pm. https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?t=912

Spiral Python interop is such a pain in the ass when it comes to tuples. I made my custom ones, but was that a mistake? It might have been.

4:10pm. Let me watch for 20 more minutes and then I will gather my thoughts. I am leaning towards leaving Spiral aside for a while and doing the initial UI work in Python.

There is no doubt that to make the complete RL systme, I am going to need Spiral. Imagine wrting something big in Python. But all these trivial interop issues and all sorts of annoyances are eating away at me from the inside.

There are a shitload of items on the TODO list, there is always work to be done, but somehow the things I want to do keep eluding me. That is how I feel right now.

Since I am partnering with it for the time being, maybe giving into it a little would not be a bad idea?

I do not have to swallow Python right away.

4:35pm. https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?t=1911

Let me stop here with the course.

Just imagine doing all this in Spiral. Interfacing through macros.

I am really feeling the pain of fighting Python. My regret has never been as strong as it is now.

Imagine if I could do 1000x as much work in a day that I can now.

day 1 : Spiral v0.09 is done
day 2 : Spiral v2 is done
day 3 : Spiral v2 is perfected and all its libraries are there

How much could I do in a 100 days? Future superintelligents are going to be able to do much more than 1000x in a day.

5:15pm. Had to leave for lunch.

To continue on that earlier spiel, consider PyTorch. Just what is it to me?

If I had 3 years in a day, I could take a day to do everything I need on my own.

ML libraries are such a vital part of ML, that expertise in building them would really be a prerequisite. Time doing that would be well spent. But as a human I just do not have it. I am pressured at every turn.

5:20pm. The Lithe Rx library is better architecturally that Kivy Language. It is better than doing things by hand, that is for sure.

But I can't afford to do my exploration in it.

When I first tried writing the Spiral editor support plugin, my first choices were functional programming langs like ReasonML and Fable. Eventually I dumped both of them for Typescript. It seems to be in the past now, but at the time it was emotional. Remember how mad I got at Fable for its None being null? I was mad enough to drop it. Eventually I grew a spine and did what I had to do.

I don't mind TS now.

Python needs to go the same way for me.

I mean, I clearly should not be doing games in it. But when it comes to interop heavy work like the UI library, my impulse should be to do as much as possible in Python, rather than Spiral. It is not that Python is better than functional languages at UIs, but I can't afford to keep switching back and forth between designing the Lithe library, writing the bindings and working on the UI itself. It is too distruptive to my workflow.

5:25pm. For the next few days, forget Spiral. Forget even touching it. I should program in Python for a while.

5:30pm. Functional abstractions matter, but even more than that it is important that programming be comfortable. I really can't fault Python for short programs.

I am just lacking this ability as a programmer, to just let go. Do I want to impress other people or do I want to do what is needed? Spiral and join points will get recognized eventually, my job is to move out of the cardboard box under a bridge that I live in.

5:35pm. You can really tell the difference in smoothness when programming in Python directly, and using Spiral macros.

Using Python on the side, writing bindings, and using Spiral is something I should factor into different passes as much as possible.

More than UIs themselves or OpenCV in the future, this is the skill I need to develop. I might be a good programmer, but the way I am acting now by going into depression is the opposite of good. It is a huge strategic mistake rather than some bug in need of fixing.

5:40pm. I need to get better at Python. The most important way in which I need to get better is to accept both it and Spiral.

I think balancing the two languages will be my biggest challenge, not doing the agents or anything else.

Yes, this is root of my discomfort. I am not too happy with my PyTorch bindings to begin with. This is the weak point of Spiral.

As a functional language, F# is much more comfortable to work in. Even with the editor support advantage of v2, Spiral is just at the threeshold where it is worth using. It does not mean it is better than the alternatives.

I still haven't gotten to the point where its strengths shine through.

This is why the current situation is suppressing me so much. I need to keep my head down until I am ready to strike.

5:50pm. Let me stop here for the day. Tomorrow, my goal will be to do what I meant to do today, but I'll endeavor to do it in Python.

Days like this happen. I don't spend them slacking on the side. The way to overcome blocks and depression is to grind away at them and face them head on. If I can't face them face on, I still obsess about the issue. That kind of autistic focus will make miracles happen. I am going to try to gather my pace tomorrow.

If I can display the same strength of momentum that I'd shown when doing editor support, both RL and the agents won't take long to do."

audio: fix stream-silence with push AOs (somewhat)

--audio-stream-silence is a shitty feature compensating for awful
consumer garbage, that mutes PCM at first to check whether it's
compressed audio, using formats advocated and owned by malicious patent
troll companies (who spend more money on their lawyers than paying any
technicians), wrapped in a wasteful way to make it constant bitrate
using a standard whose text is not freely available, and only rude users
want it. This feature has been carelessly broken, because it's
complicated and stupid. What would Jesus do? If not getting an aneurysm,
or pushing over tables with expensive A/V receivers on top of them, he'd
probably fix the feature. So let's take inspiration from Jesus Christ
himself, and do something as dumb as wasting some of our limited
lifetime on this incredibly stupid fucking shit.

This is tricky, because state changes like end-of-audio are supposed to
be driven by the AO driver, while playing silence precludes this. But it
seems code paths for "untimed" AOs can be reused.

But there are still problems. For example, underruns will just happen
normally (and stop audio streaming), because we don't have a separate
heuristic to check whether the buffer is "low enough" (as a consequence
of a network stall, but before the audio output itself underruns).

Add files via upload

- I spent a lot of time fixing Paper Doll. It should work properly for mobile players now. Also, I added some variables to add pieces of clothes easier in the future
- Freed up space in Twine in the top left corner by moving all Story Help menu-related passages into one. Players won't notice any changes (I hope)
- I created a new schedule for the sister. Added it to the help menu. Spoiler: it is similar to brother's one
- Created a style for sister's dialog boxes. Feel free to submit your ideas about the color combination
- Added sister's reaction on nude/topless main character. It works as brother's since they have almost identical schedules
- Fixed some misprints and made text improvements
= Fixed (/finished) global variables showing positions of sister
- Now sister can notice semen on you. Two reactions: when semen on/in pussy and when it's everywhere
- Improved both Problem Solver and Daily Check Problem Solver. I don't want to touch something that works, so I just made them a bit faster and more efficient
- Added new text by Rachael to the Threesome event (when you are whoring via Smartphone, and a family member wants to join). Now, sister is available, too. Like always, there's a scene for the first time and another one for other times
- Fixed the error you get when you go to JobHunters from the Bedroom link and then back
- I removed all useless books from the Library
- Added a new rule to the HaveASexWidget now beasts can cum in you without getting you pregnant! Already added this ability to existing scenes
- Added limit for Ralf's relationship points (from 0 to 100)
- Now, you can mate with Ralf in Family Bitch mode. Enable it in Dog girl magazine (requires 80 FB Corruption). Later I'll add his reaction to Canine lube to make it not so useless
