I have no issues/changes for your project or code. I've been playing around with this for a little while and you have done an amazing job. I love the option for a 'random' place and I've already saved a few restaurants to my Fav's. Great job!

Adjusted ConnOpener API to fix several problems

1. Many ConnOpener users are witten to keep a ConnectionPointer to the
   destination given to ConnOpener. This means that their connection
   magically opens when ConnOpener successfully connects, before
   ConnOpener has a chance to notify the user about the changes. Having
   multiple concurrent connection owners is always dangerous, and the
   user cannot even have a close handler registered for its now-open
   connection. When something happens to ConnOpener or its answer, the
   user job may be in trouble.

   ConnOpener now clones the destination parameter, refusing to tie
   ConnOpener connection to the ConnOpener creator connection. This
   addresses the concern, but requires adjustment 2.

2. Refactored ConnOpener users to stop assuming that the answer contains
   a pointer to their connection object. After adjustment 1 above, it
   does not. HappyConnOpener relied on that assumption quite a bit so we
   had to refactor to use two custom callback methods instead of one
   with a complicated if-statement distinguishing prime from spare
   attempts. This refactoring is an overall improvement because it
   simplifies the code. Other ConnOpener users just needed to remove a
   few no longer valid paranoid assertions/Musts.

3. ConnOpener users were forced to remember to close params.conn when
   processing negative answers. Some, naturally, forgot, triggering
   warnings about orphaned connections (e.g., Ident and TcpLogger).
   ConnOpener now closes its open connection before sending a negative
   answer.

4. ConnOpener would trigger orphan connection warnings if the job ended
   after opening the connection but without supplying the connection to
   the requestor (e.g., because the requestor has gone away). Now,
   ConnOpener explicitly closes its open connection if it has not been
   sent to the requestor.

Also fixed Comm::ConnOpener::cleanFd() debugging that was incorrectly
saying that the method closes the temporary descriptor.

Also added Comm::Connection::cloneDestinationDetails() debugging to
simplify tracking dependencies between half-baked Connection objects
carrying destination/flags/other metadata and open Connection objects
created by ConnOpener using that metadata (which are later delivered to
ConnOpener users and, in some cases, replace those half-baked
connections mentioned earlier. Long-term, we need to find a better way
to express these and other Connection states/stages than comments and
debugging messages.

A. Hulk

Dr. Bruce Banner hates his enemies (like others don't). As we all know, he can barely talk when he turns into the incredible Hulk. That's why he asked you to help him to express his feelings.

Hulk likes the Inception so much, and like that his feelings are complicated. They have n layers. The first layer is hate, second one is love, third one is hate and so on...

For example if n = 1, then his feeling is "I hate it" or if n = 2 it's "I hate that I love it", and if n = 3 it's "I hate that I love that I hate it" and so on.

Please help Dr. Banner.

Input
The only line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of layers of love and hate.

Output
Print Dr.Banner's feeling in one line.

Examples

Fix potential ball and chain issue

At least I hope this does the right thing. Yes, I know, I announced that I would be retiring and not do anything to the repo again and now I did so anyway. Everyone who has a problem with that gets a middle finger, I can make my own decisions and also change them again, fuck you very much! Either way, the big nethack community is permanently dead for me now, and I'm actually glad I got out of that hellhole. From now on, I'll develop this game mainly for myself.

make api a bit more consistent

hdhfjfkghjhjfkhf if i have to work with bukkit item api
again i am going to DIE. the amount of inconsistencies is
insane. look, i *know* that bukkit ain't exactly the pinnacle
of good api design, but i mean come on. like, for example,
wanna remove simple items for a list? sure! there are some
methods that look like removeItem(Item item), some that are
removeItem(Item... item) and some that are removeItems(Item... item).
i. am. aaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. the entire
thing is just such a gross and abhorrent mess of legacy code dating
back YEARS. i mean, the api still has SpawnEggMeta for frick's sake,
meanwhile, that *doesn't even exist in the base game*. i knooooow
bukkit has to support legacy plugins. and i will respect that.
it's just still freakin ANNOYING.
i put this rant here because i know no one will see it. i just
need to let out this frustration somewhere. hopefully now that
corn itembuilder stuff exists, i will never have to use
bukkit's horrendous item api ever again

Remove CreateEstablishClaim service object (#16557)

(This is not a sprint story. It is related to [CASEFLOW-2024](https://vajira.max.gov/browse/CASEFLOW-2024) in that it's removing untested code, but it's just a general cleanup task.)

### Description
This code:
* Has not been touched in more than 2 years (not an indictment on its own), and
* Has zero test coverage, and,
* Is never called anywhere in Caseflow (which is why its lack of test coverage went unnoticed), and
* Is not referenced in the caseflow or appeals-deployment wikis as something that may be manually used.

Pushing this PR to spark a discussion&mdash;I'd love to get consensus that it's not used at all before merging. (In theory we can bring it back from git history if we decide it's needed, but working backwards from "I think we used to have code to do this" may be tricky.)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] We're comfortable with the fact that nothing uses this

### Testing Plan
🤷 Good question!

sched/core: Implement new approach to scale select_idle_cpu()

Hackbench recently suffered a bunch of pain, first by commit:

  4c77b18cf8b7 ("sched/fair: Make select_idle_cpu() more aggressive")

and then by commit:

  c743f0a5c50f ("sched/fair, cpumask: Export for_each_cpu_wrap()")

which fixed a bug in the initial for_each_cpu_wrap() implementation
that made select_idle_cpu() even more expensive. The bug was that it
would skip over CPUs when bits were consequtive in the bitmask.

This however gave me an idea to fix select_idle_cpu(); where the old
scheme was a cliff-edge throttle on idle scanning, this introduces a
more gradual approach. Instead of stopping to scan entirely, we limit
how many CPUs we scan.

Initial benchmarks show that it mostly recovers hackbench while not
hurting anything else, except Mason's schbench, but not as bad as the
old thing.

It also appears to recover the tbench high-end, which also suffered like
hackbench.

Plenty of waystones can be found in world. This mostly limits obtaining personal teleportation from anywhere. Blood Magic felt like a good place to stick it. Before this, Ars offers great teleportation options earlier on.

Auto merge of #7525 - xFrednet:7172-update-define-conf-macro, r=flip1995

Updated `define_Conf!` to support multi-line doc comments

Updated the `define_Conf!` macro to support multi-line doc comments for readability. This also enables configuration documentation to have multiple paragraphs.

I've also added the `metadata-collector-lint` feature to the CI build and testing tasks. (I would think that we want this, now that we officially switched over)

Now a small informal explanation what this PR changes (just for fun):

* *Once upon a time there was a monster. It was handsome, supportive and happy to dig through the best source code it has ever seen. Spanning over hundreds of lines and reading over complete crates, it was purely marvels!*

    *However, there was one region in its territory that wasn't clean and well formatted like the rest. That was the mighty `define_Conf` macro. The monster would have cleaned it up a long time ago but, the previous ruler of this kingdom a powerful Python script was prohibiting it. But now that the old king was slain in the great battle of rust-1.54.0, everything was possible again. Our lovely monster was now able to grab its cleaning equipment and get some nice formatting into the now unprotected area.*

    *Said and done! Let this day go down in history!*

(I'll be the first to admit, that I'm a bit lost today. And I'm also procrastinating on some other discussions where I have some catching up to do... Oh, well, this was fun)

I FUCKING FIGURED IT OUTgit add .! fucking shit bro hahaha. All it took was to go straight to the source. I reached out to so many people trying to ask for help (paid) and no one took me up. But all I needed to do was go straight to the truffle documentation to understand the root of my issue. I'm gonna break it all down right here so grab some popcorn. ||| As it stands, CreatorContract creates an instance of VotingContract, and that VC is what the user will interact with when submitting a ballot or casting a vote. Bceause of this, I had a problem within my javascript tests for Voting... How do I grab that instance?? And so to work around this, I used web3 to connect to that VC instance. And this worked fine until I had a function change the Contract's state variables one too many times. This reallllly frustrated me, wasn't exactly sure what was going on. So I broke up createPoll() into a couple functions (addOption & addOptionResult, as you can see in this commit) and I called each function independently within the test. But obviously this solution doesn't have much integrity. So it took me to perusing the Truffle docs to find that I can call 'VotingContract.at(addr)' to save that instance as an artifact instead of an abi. Took me a whole weekend to realize that lol. PHAT learnings out here hehe
