Fixes a fuck ton more harddels (#58779)

Redoes how geese handle eating shit, it was fucking stupid and caused harddels, and while this method is technically slower in the best case, it's a fucking goose
Fixes action related harddels, I hate how they work but at least this way they won't hold refs.
Fixes the hierophont causing its beacon to harddel
Removes the M variable from megafauna actions, it was used like a typed owner and caused harddels, so I burned it
Fixes target and targets_from harddels, replaces all setters of target with LoseTarget and GiveTarget, which should help maintain behavior. I'm not sure if this breaks anything, but if it does we should fix the assumptions that code makes instead of reverting this change
Fixes more area_senstive_contents related harddels, we need to allow the mob to move before clearing out its list.
Fixes marked object harddels (I'm coming for you admin team)
Fixes a language based human harddel
Fixes managed overlay related harddels (This was just emissive blockers, but I think this is a good safety net to have. If we clear the overlay list we should clear this one as well)
Fixes bot core harddels, I hate the fact that this exists but it has no reason to know who its owner is
Adds a walk(src, 0) to simple_animal destroy, it's the best bang for the buck in terms of stopping spurious harddels. Walk related harddels aren't that expensive in the first place, since byond does the same thing I'm doing here, but this makes finding mob harddels easier, so let's go with it
I fixed another source of part harddels, I hate fullupgrade so much
Fixes all the sound loop harddels

[PATCH] inotify

inotify is intended to correct the deficiencies of dnotify, particularly
its inability to scale and its terrible user interface:

        * dnotify requires the opening of one fd per each directory
          that you intend to watch. This quickly results in too many
          open files and pins removable media, preventing unmount.
        * dnotify is directory-based. You only learn about changes to
          directories. Sure, a change to a file in a directory affects
          the directory, but you are then forced to keep a cache of
          stat structures.
        * dnotify's interface to user-space is awful.  Signals?

inotify provides a more usable, simple, powerful solution to file change
notification:

        * inotify's interface is a system call that returns a fd, not SIGIO.
	  You get a single fd, which is select()-able.
        * inotify has an event that says "the filesystem that the item
          you were watching is on was unmounted."
        * inotify can watch directories or files.

Inotify is currently used by Beagle (a desktop search infrastructure),
Gamin (a FAM replacement), and other projects.

Create Medical Education from Russian MBBS colleges 2021-22 Twinkle InstituteAB

Russia may be a fine destination for medical aspirants United Nations agency would like to pursue MBBS. Its well-being and quality of life attract students from everywhere in the world. The MBBS course period in Russia is of five years and eight months. following MBBS in Russia is taken into account one amongst the most effective choices for medical students United Nations agency need to check drugs abroad. The explanation why it’s thought-about collectively of the most effective choices is that the advantage of obtaining high-quality education at a really cheap price. The majority of Russia Medical College square measure recognized by MCI, WHO, UNESCO, etc. Students square measure keen to require associate MBBS seat in Russia, thanks to the Russian service provided, and therefore the students United Nations agency get MBBS Admission In Russia square measure commendable. Doing MBBS in Russia may be a nice chance for Indian medical students. The Russian medical universities occupy the highest thirty within the world’s ranking medical faculties.

It is nearly a dream of undergraduates to occupy their seats in high medical universities in Russia and become specialists inside 5.8 years of their MBBS study. Students from everywhere the world take MBBS Abroad in Russia for his or her study of drugs. The graduates from Russia observe clinical fields and hospitals all over across the world. These square measure the particular reasons that attract students to a rustic like Russia. The Russian service provided to the Indian students and therefore the medical coaching profit the scholars in an exceedingly welcome boost which helps them in creating their career fruitful. Russia may be a famous destination for medical students to check MBBS abroad. Aside from Russia there square measure alternative countries like China, Nepal, Germany, the Philippines, Ukraine, Bangladesh, and Kirgiz that supply MBBS study. These countries additionally give a reasonable MBBS course for medical students. despite the fact that the period of the MBBS study is five.8 years, the international students United Nations agency enter to check in Russia don’t seem to be needed to bear one year of the preceding course to induce admission.

Pursuing Medicine In Russia is straightforward as a result of students don’t seem to be needed to clear any entrance examination. Also, the Russian government provides subsidies for education thus that makes the fee of medical universities relatively low. Students will get medical insurance and medical treatment whenever they’re in want. MBBS is instructed in each English and Russian language. They additionally teach the Russian language aboard the medical students in order that it’s straightforward to speak with the native patients and other people living there. Russia has advanced teaching techniques in medical universities, and that they have well-equipped, efficient techniques for the event of medical students each in theory and much.

When we compare the climatic condition of Russia with India, the climate of Russia is sort of completely different from India. Because it lays within the torrid region, the climate is chilly for pretty much six months, which is snug for individuals living in Russia. The country encompasses a terribly completely different climate than changes wholly supported geographical region. The typical winter temperature remains -20 degrees uranologist, throughout fall and summer they rise to a most of twenty-five degrees uranologist. Every house in Russia has fitted with a heating facility thanks to chilly weather. in order that it makes it snug for people to remain inside throughout that season.

Russian medical universities square measure counted among the highest medical universities within the world. They need the leading hospitals and a globally recognized degree, stocked and louvered accommodation, Indian food mess, advanced teaching, and reasonable learning, high-quality education, etc. Russia has the foremost originative medical universities and most of the medical universities in Russia square measure giving a sponsored fee structure. The necessity to hunt when the clinical specification is that the most outstanding expense of a numerous variety of medical organizations.

Indian medical students wish to check MBBS abroad square measure at associate incomparable high. nowadays the planet has shifted towards a high study parameter from selecting the suitable school for higher studies that yield most come on investments (ROI), globally recognized and many of opportunities, and especially, the all-inclusive course of study. The highlight is that the low price of living and therefore the reasonable fees of MBBS in Russia produces Russia the foremost most well-liked destination for MBBS study among Indian medical students. Students will take scholarships yet. The typical fee for MBBS in Russia is between a pair of 4.5 lakhs once a year. Another profit for medical students is when finishing their study they’ll observe drugs anyplace within the world.

Russia provides top-notch medical education and sensible data to students, which is incredibly helpful for today’s generation. Also, students get smart accommodation with recent and quality food on the university field itself. Every year, Russia welcomes over 2 100000 foreign medical students from across the world to check within the high medical faculties in Russia.

[PATCH] proc: Use sane permission checks on the /proc/<pid>/fd/ symlinks

Since 2.2 we have been doing a chroot check to see if it is appropriate to
return a read or follow one of these magic symlinks.  The chroot check was
asking a question about the visibility of files to the calling process and
it was actually checking the destination process, and not the files
themselves.  That test was clearly bogus.

In my first pass through I simply fixed the test to check the visibility of
the files themselves.  That naive approach to fixing the permissions was
too strict and resulted in cases where a task could not even see all of
it's file descriptors.

What has disturbed me about relaxing this check is that file descriptors
are per-process private things, and they are occasionaly used a user space
capability tokens.  Looking a little farther into the symlink path on /proc
I did find userid checks and a check for capability (CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE) so
there were permissions checking this.

But I was still concerned about privacy.  Besides /proc there is only one
other way to find out this kind of information, and that is ptrace.  ptrace
has been around for a long time and it has a well established security
model.

So after thinking about it I finally realized that the permission checks
that make sense are the permission checks applied to ptrace_attach.  The
checks are simple per process, and won't cause nasty surprises for people
coming from less capable unices.

Unfortunately there is one case that the current ptrace_attach test does
not cover: Zombies and kernel threads.  Single stepping those kinds of
processes is impossible.  Being able to see which file descriptors are open
on these tasks is important to lsof, fuser and friends.  So for these
special processes I made the rule you can't find out unless you have
CAP_SYS_PTRACE.

These proc permission checks should now conform to the principle of least
surprise.  As well as using much less code to implement :)

[PATCH] pi-futex: futex code cleanups

We are pleased to announce "lightweight userspace priority inheritance" (PI)
support for futexes.  The following patchset and glibc patch implements it,
ontop of the robust-futexes patchset which is included in 2.6.16-mm1.

We are calling it lightweight for 3 reasons:

 - in the user-space fastpath a PI-enabled futex involves no kernel work
   (or any other PI complexity) at all.  No registration, no extra kernel
   calls - just pure fast atomic ops in userspace.

 - in the slowpath (in the lock-contention case), the system call and
   scheduling pattern is in fact better than that of normal futexes, due to
   the 'integrated' nature of FUTEX_LOCK_PI.  [more about that further down]

 - the in-kernel PI implementation is streamlined around the mutex
   abstraction, with strict rules that keep the implementation relatively
   simple: only a single owner may own a lock (i.e.  no read-write lock
   support), only the owner may unlock a lock, no recursive locking, etc.

  Priority Inheritance - why, oh why???
  -------------------------------------

Many of you heard the horror stories about the evil PI code circling Linux for
years, which makes no real sense at all and is only used by buggy applications
and which has horrible overhead.  Some of you have dreaded this very moment,
when someone actually submits working PI code ;-)

So why would we like to see PI support for futexes?

We'd like to see it done purely for technological reasons.  We dont think it's
a buggy concept, we think it's useful functionality to offer to applications,
which functionality cannot be achieved in other ways.  We also think it's the
right thing to do, and we think we've got the right arguments and the right
numbers to prove that.  We also believe that we can address all the
counter-arguments as well.  For these reasons (and the reasons outlined below)
we are submitting this patch-set for upstream kernel inclusion.

What are the benefits of PI?

  The short reply:
  ----------------

User-space PI helps achieving/improving determinism for user-space
applications.  In the best-case, it can help achieve determinism and
well-bound latencies.  Even in the worst-case, PI will improve the statistical
distribution of locking related application delays.

  The longer reply:
  -----------------

Firstly, sharing locks between multiple tasks is a common programming
technique that often cannot be replaced with lockless algorithms.  As we can
see it in the kernel [which is a quite complex program in itself], lockless
structures are rather the exception than the norm - the current ratio of
lockless vs.  locky code for shared data structures is somewhere between 1:10
and 1:100.  Lockless is hard, and the complexity of lockless algorithms often
endangers to ability to do robust reviews of said code.  I.e.  critical RT
apps often choose lock structures to protect critical data structures, instead
of lockless algorithms.  Furthermore, there are cases (like shared hardware,
or other resource limits) where lockless access is mathematically impossible.

Media players (such as Jack) are an example of reasonable application design
with multiple tasks (with multiple priority levels) sharing short-held locks:
for example, a highprio audio playback thread is combined with medium-prio
construct-audio-data threads and low-prio display-colory-stuff threads.  Add
video and decoding to the mix and we've got even more priority levels.

So once we accept that synchronization objects (locks) are an unavoidable fact
of life, and once we accept that multi-task userspace apps have a very fair
expectation of being able to use locks, we've got to think about how to offer
the option of a deterministic locking implementation to user-space.

Most of the technical counter-arguments against doing priority inheritance
only apply to kernel-space locks.  But user-space locks are different, there
we cannot disable interrupts or make the task non-preemptible in a critical
section, so the 'use spinlocks' argument does not apply (user-space spinlocks
have the same priority inversion problems as other user-space locking
constructs).  Fact is, pretty much the only technique that currently enables
good determinism for userspace locks (such as futex-based pthread mutexes) is
priority inheritance:

Currently (without PI), if a high-prio and a low-prio task shares a lock [this
is a quite common scenario for most non-trivial RT applications], even if all
critical sections are coded carefully to be deterministic (i.e.  all critical
sections are short in duration and only execute a limited number of
instructions), the kernel cannot guarantee any deterministic execution of the
high-prio task: any medium-priority task could preempt the low-prio task while
it holds the shared lock and executes the critical section, and could delay it
indefinitely.

  Implementation:
  ---------------

As mentioned before, the userspace fastpath of PI-enabled pthread mutexes
involves no kernel work at all - they behave quite similarly to normal
futex-based locks: a 0 value means unlocked, and a value==TID means locked.
(This is the same method as used by list-based robust futexes.) Userspace uses
atomic ops to lock/unlock these mutexes without entering the kernel.

To handle the slowpath, we have added two new futex ops:

  FUTEX_LOCK_PI
  FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI

If the lock-acquire fastpath fails, [i.e.  an atomic transition from 0 to TID
fails], then FUTEX_LOCK_PI is called.  The kernel does all the remaining work:
if there is no futex-queue attached to the futex address yet then the code
looks up the task that owns the futex [it has put its own TID into the futex
value], and attaches a 'PI state' structure to the futex-queue.  The pi_state
includes an rt-mutex, which is a PI-aware, kernel-based synchronization
object.  The 'other' task is made the owner of the rt-mutex, and the
FUTEX_WAITERS bit is atomically set in the futex value.  Then this task tries
to lock the rt-mutex, on which it blocks.  Once it returns, it has the mutex
acquired, and it sets the futex value to its own TID and returns.  Userspace
has no other work to perform - it now owns the lock, and futex value contains
FUTEX_WAITERS|TID.

If the unlock side fastpath succeeds, [i.e.  userspace manages to do a TID ->
0 atomic transition of the futex value], then no kernel work is triggered.

If the unlock fastpath fails (because the FUTEX_WAITERS bit is set), then
FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI is called, and the kernel unlocks the futex on the behalf of
userspace - and it also unlocks the attached pi_state->rt_mutex and thus wakes
up any potential waiters.

Note that under this approach, contrary to other PI-futex approaches, there is
no prior 'registration' of a PI-futex.  [which is not quite possible anyway,
due to existing ABI properties of pthread mutexes.]

Also, under this scheme, 'robustness' and 'PI' are two orthogonal properties
of futexes, and all four combinations are possible: futex, robust-futex,
PI-futex, robust+PI-futex.

  glibc support:
  --------------

Ulrich Drepper and Jakub Jelinek have written glibc support for PI-futexes
(and robust futexes), enabling robust and PI (PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT) POSIX
mutexes.  (PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT support will be added later on too, no
additional kernel changes are needed for that).  [NOTE: The glibc patch is
obviously inofficial and unsupported without matching upstream kernel
functionality.]

the patch-queue and the glibc patch can also be downloaded from:

  http://redhat.com/~mingo/PI-futex-patches/

Many thanks go to the people who helped us create this kernel feature: Steven
Rostedt, Esben Nielsen, Benedikt Spranger, Daniel Walker, John Cooper, Arjan
van de Ven, Oleg Nesterov and others.  Credits for related prior projects goes
to Dirk Grambow, Inaky Perez-Gonzalez, Bill Huey and many others.

Clean up the futex code, before adding more features to it:

 - use u32 as the futex field type - that's the ABI
 - use __user and pointers to u32 instead of unsigned long
 - code style / comment style cleanups
 - rename hash-bucket name from 'bh' to 'hb'.

I checked the pre and post futex.o object files to make sure this
patch has no code effects.

"9:05am. I am up. Right now, it is not the tedium blocking me. I've made progress on that front.

What is blocking me is simply fear. Pure, irrational fear.

I gave it my all to come up with that optimization scheme. Rescaling the gradients, rebalancing them, and also the replay buffer trickery. There is no way to improve backprop past this point.

Usually when I feel this way I'd seek out more information, but I know that there is nothing out there that can help me anymore.

9:10am. I have to go forward and take fate into my own hands. The shame of not having unlimited inspiration is something I will make up for once I enter the self improvement loop.

There are just too many things I cannot immitate with my programming talent alone at this juncture.

9:15am. The answer exists for quite a lot of things. For long term memory, I said that it needs to be figured out, but the TD function has an answer for how to transfer value across arbitrary time. So it is not like there isn't an answer for that either. Ilya did point out that weights can serve as long term memory.

Maybe I was too rough yesterday in saying that the interview is worthless. I did learn just a bit from all of them.

But I am not going to find an answer to my fear in them.

9:30am. I am definitely still missing skill. The pieces needed to handle the nets in a trully modular fashion aren't here yet. I cannot become an expert with just this. But that is fine.

The work I will do in the present will compose with what will come in the future.

9:35am. Let me do my chilling and then I will start. The programming I will be doing here is purely for overcoming my fright.

I might have regrets, but all the mistakes I did were due to acting according to some emotion. I can put on the brakes and I can accelerate, but I cannot change what I feel. If I could, I would no longer be human. So I won't pretend that I am something greater. I won't chastise myself over my weakness, as that will result in nothing.

All I have to do is get closer to my goal. That is it.

10:05am. Done with the break. Today and from here on out, even if I have to write 10 lines a day, I will try to move forward.

There is nothing wrong with my knowledge or my programming skill.

It is my spirit that is weak here. It is not that I am too lazy to work. It is not that I cannot overcome the tedious parts. It is that I am intimidated by the grandness of the task.

10:10am. I need to overcome it. If I can do this, I could attain for the first time in my life actual power. Am I really going to stumble right before the finish line?

My biggest enemy is myself here.

Forget the pride and the path traveled to get here. I did not have to make a language. I did not have to do all of this.

I could have thought of this scheme and done it in Python. Forget the extraneous thoughts.

Right now, I am once again a bare beginner. Throw away the current power. Go back to what I were.

If I cannot write 100 lines, write 50. If I cannot do 50, do 20. Do as much as you can even when you do not feel like it.

Eventually the ice will break and the momentum will start to build.

A true expert could do the challenge of implementing the ideas in the review in a week or two. So what if it takes me 4 times as long. I should be struggling here.

10:30am.

```
inl nodes_2p forall game_state o a. is_choice (player_funs fp1, player_funs fp2)
        : game2p game_state o a (pl2 o a -> r2) = game2p {
    terminal = fun (s1,s2) r (chance_prob,p1,p2) =>
        fp1.terminal {chance_prob game_state=s1; id=0; player=p1; reward=r} . fp2.terminal {chance_prob game_state=s2; id=1; player=p2; reward=r}
        r
    action = fun s pid ar f (chance_prob,p1,p2) =>
        let f (a : a) (b : pl2 o a) : r2 = real real_core.unbox a (fun _ => f a b)
        if pid = 0 then fp1.action {chance_prob game_state=s; id=0; player=p1; player'=prob p2; actions=ar; next=fun (_,a as cs) => f a (chance_prob,apply_changes p1 cs,apply_action p2 a)}
        else fp2.action {chance_prob game_state=s; player=p2; id=1; player'=prob p1; actions=ar; next=fun (_,a as cs) => f a (chance_prob,apply_action p1 a,apply_changes p2 cs)}
    draw = (if is_choice then choice else iter) draw
    sample = (if is_choice then choice else iter) sample
    }
```

What do I do about this? There is just too much stuff here.

Ok, the main idea that springs to mind is that I should ignore the parallel processing considerations. How should only a single thread of this work? What should I focus on?

```
union rec compiled_node obs act =
    | Reward: r2
    | Action: obs * a u64 act * (act -> compiled_node obs act)
```

Would this be right?

For the time being I am going to forget what obs should be here. In other places it means a `list obs act`, but here it can be more generic.

10:50am.

```
union observation o a = Observation: o | Action: a
nominal player o a = { prob : log_prob; observations : list (observation o a) }
inl init forall observation action. : player observation action = player {prob=Log_prob_one; observations=Nil} |> dyn
nominal player_funs game_state obs act r = {
    action : {game_state : game_state; id : u8; player : player obs act;  player' : log_prob; chance_prob : log_prob; actions : a u64 act; next : log_prob * act -> r} -> r
    terminal : {game_state : game_state; id : u8; player : player obs act; chance_prob : log_prob; reward : r2} -> ()
    }
type pl2 o a = log_prob * player o a * player o a
type pl2_compiled = {chance : log_prob; p1 : log_prob; p2 : log_prob}
```

Let me add pl2_compiled to the mix.

10:55am. Hahhh...

```
type pl2_compiled = {chance : log_prob; p1 : log_prob; p2 : log_prob}

inl prob (player {prob}) = prob
inl observations (player {observations}) = observations
inl apply_action (player x) a = player {x with observations#=(::) (Action: a)}
inl apply_observation (player x) o = player {x with observations#=(::) (Observation: o)}
inl apply_changes (player x) (prob,a) = player {x with observations#=(::) (Action: a); prob#=(+@) prob}

inl sample_players_update pid (prob,x) (chance_prob,p1,p2) =
    prob +@ chance_prob,
    match pid with
    | Some: pid =>
        inl update pid' p = if pid = pid' then apply_observation p x else p
        update 0 p1, update 1 p2
    | None =>
        inl update p = apply_observation p x
        update p1, update p2

// Indexes randomly into an uniform categorical distrbution, weighting the choice by its probability.

I don't know. The original version makes a lot of sense, especially for tabular players. But my addons do not really fit into the framework.

11:05am. I said I would not redesign all of this, but should I just wipe and start anew? I am not really inspired right now, and the old material is hindering me more than it is helping me. I need to redo my reasoning.

But I do feel it is a major step forward to ignore the parallel considerations. This will simplify my thinking a lot.

I haven't really though on how I am going to do this first step in the past couple of days. Instead I've more been working through the mental obstacles preventing me from starting.

I know that at its root, I need to rewrite all of this so it is interpretable.

...Let me take a short break here.

11:40am. My focus really is not on programming once again. Instead I am again fighting my demons. Let me get breakfast. If necessary I will step away from the screen.

I need to beat my past regrets and overcome my fear. Whatever sparse inspiration bubbles to the surface gets taken over by the thoughts of them. I should gather the resolve and redo the whole project from scratch in line with what I will need for a tree version."

Pima Indian Diabetes

Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Inspiration
Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

Andromeda and Perry

 Both of these people are mad scientists and geniuses. Unfortunately, they have a less than average sister named Aurora who writes mean things about herself because her younger brother thinks it's soooooooooooooooooooo funny.

feat(Buttons): ColorModes + Props + Refactor + Refs Oh My! [GM-211] [REACH-856] [GM-192]

* Buttons now use `ButtonBase` to match with `Anchor`.
* Removes extra tagged templates to reduce Emotion Label spam and reduces internal style overhead.
* Button Colors are now serialized as variables inside of the base component depending on which mode they are.
* Buttons will now default to the current ColorMode if they have not been passed a prop.
* Also fixes a prop forwarding bug with CTAButton where inner component was not getting props forwarded.
* Adds all button types to the ColorMode example (small and large).
* Buttons now will use the current mode in context unless specified otherwise. Since all dark mode buttons are specifically configured this way there should be no changes to ANY existing button colors.
* Buttons now come with a few system props to make life easier including spacing layout and positioning. See prop reference here https://gamut.codecademy.com/storybook/?path=/docs/foundations-system-props--layout. Please note that these will cause issues with behavior if used incorrectly. Changes to display and padding may break button styles in some cases.
* All Buttons now accept a ref!

I hate closure so, so much. I can't even get this pos project to build. Yes, ok I'm missing a jarfile, let me get that so I can fucking build. Oh wait but literally every way I try to get it fails miserably and no one on github can help me. Closure, soy, gulp, all of it, it's all a piece of shit we framework that I am 100000% certain will fade into oblivion. Good riddance.

added 2 new lua files for the map.

added a new storyline. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"A special event was happening at Fattywood Elementary.
Gregory's class is going on a field trip to the mines. as they got their, their tour
guide was waiting. the other kids as always were casually name-calling Gregory, and the teacher's like always barely notice.
after many shits and gigs, a friend dared a shy kid to find the biggest rock he could find and chuck it at Gregory's ass while they filmed it. The little kid
threw a nice huge rock which hit Gregory. Gregory saw the kids laughing, which caused something in his mind to snap, perhaps it was his high-end autism? or maybe it was just
the fact his fatass hasn't aten for two fucking hours. Either way, he started eating his fellow classmates in a murderous rampage of gluttony..."
