New data: 2021-03-16: See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (MB, ON, SK).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “8 new deaths, for a total of 10,558 deaths: 3 deaths in the last 24 hours, 3 deaths between March 9 and March 14, 2 deaths at an unknown date.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

Damage reduction for percentage damage spells

* Damage reduction for the following spells have been reduced from 100% to 97.75%:
1) Death Prophet Spirit Siphon
2) Doom Infernal Blade
3) Huskar Life Break
4) Winter Wyvern Arctic Burn
* Damage reduction for the following spells have been increased from 0% to 97.75%:
1) Bloodseeker Blood Rage (with Shard)
2) Tinker Laser (with Scepter)
* Necrophos Reaper's Scythe damage against bosses is now reduced by 97.75%.
* Interaction of Veil of Discord debuff and boss base damage reduction stays the same as before.
* General rule: If a spell does hp percentage based dmg and doesn't work on vanilla Roshan, it will either not work on OAA bosses or the dmg will be reduced by 97.75%. This reduction can be partially mitigated with Veil of Discord debuff.

Allow accessing preferences on models that do not have any set

We may have models that are supposed to have preferences but are not
defining them explicitly because they are not needed.

For example, when defining a custom calculator that does not need any
preference. Core code expects that preferences still responds with a
Hash instead of nil because that's how it worked before b947015bc28c.

That commit is needed because otherwise Rails would serialize the object
differently on models that do not use preferences, because seralize is
now lazy executed. Example of the wrong serialization without it:

       expected: #<Spree::Address id: 4, firstname: "John", lastname: "Von Doe", address1: "10 Lovely Street", address...00 +0000", updated_at: "2021-03-17 08:09:00.244459000 +0000", name: "John Von Doe", preferences: {}>
            got: #<Spree::Address id: 4, firstname: "John", lastname: "Von Doe", address1: "10 Lovely Street", address...0 +0000", updated_at: "2021-03-17 08:09:00.244459000 +0000", name: "John Von Doe", preferences: nil>

This commit introduces a hack to have both things. When preferences is
empty at database level, it's safe to always return a Hash, because
that's how the data would have been deserialized anyway. This allows
us to call `preferences[:something]` on models that do not explicitly
define any preference.

Compete in TopCoder Humblefool'21 Prelims

successful challenges: 2/3 (50+50-25=75 pts) ^_^

rank in the room: 7/9 (~10 competing, 12 present)

rank in the division: 109/714 (~109/139 present??)
-> 85th PERCENTILE (22nd PERCENTILE??)
<- 3 blue coders below me !
<- 1 yellow coder below me !!

Notes:
- could have been 102/714 (~102/139??) of the division w/o the failed challenge :-/
-> would have been 85th PERCENTILE (27th PERCENTILE??)

Blunders:
- wrong original approach in 300
  - tried to iterate over divisors a*b==N
  - fails on the last test
  -> successful challenge of utkar5h_7 (same approach!)
- infinite while-loop somewhere in 450
  - had to restart my laptop twice -> lost shitload of time :-(
  -> don't use while-loop, always prefer for-loop
     - or add a timeout variable
  -> COMPETE ON DESKTOP from now on, if possible
- tried to challenge a red coder w/o understanding really his code
  - only saw ++ in a while -> tried :-/
  - ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE CODE
  - if you risk, don't risk against yellow and higher
- the challenge of the red coder: same code as the other successful
challenge
  - mystery!

[MIRROR] Removes the foam finger rocket launcher (#4217)

* Remove the foam finger rocket launcher (#57763)

It's baaaaad. Very bad. There are way better ways to do this but I
don't honestly have the capacity to do them. The sprite states are all
fucked up, it's an odd case of something not being snowflake enough in
the right places, the goddamn thing breaks if you drop it... For fuck's
sake, Ryll tried to fix it and even they couldn't. No, fuck it, get rid
of it, we'll rewrite it later.
