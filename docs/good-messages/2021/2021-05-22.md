Update models path because I absolutely detest the `app\Models` directory.
It completely misunderstands and deafeats any sense of DDD in Laravel.
The Models (nouns) should be at the root of the app directory
Respectively, conceptually, they are also the root of your problem/business domain.
I also dislike the removal of the artisan command for creating custom namespaces for our Laravel apps.
If we have a thousand apps all namespaced as `App` how well are they going to interoperate with one another?
Not fucking well, likely.
Some of the new Laravel stuff (Livewire) makes me love it more than ever
Removing custom namespace command and adding the `app/Models` directory are both bad moves.
I could go on.

more logspam killing.  it is pointless to warn me about shit that is proprietary and undocumented due to a developer-unfriendly company that pretends to give a shit about open source while pissing on its spirit

Cracked the code!

Through much effort, I have finally figured out the glazed ice, I've also put together, what I think is a fairly nice site. Will I make modifications to it? Probably? Do I hate myself? That is the only logical conclusion I can derive.

Ive:
- Notated my homepage.html file while also completing the elements I wanted to in there for the site to work relatively close to as envisioned.

-Updated the CSS substantially to include the ability to load glazed ice on the site and some other stuff, like a background and I changed my profile pic and made it circular

I now need to:
- Create a 2nd page to link to the main one
-Make that 2nd page link back to the homepage.
-Sleep.
-Eat.

checkpatch: look for symbolic permissions and suggest octal instead

S_<FOO> uses should be avoided where octal is more intelligible.

Linus didst say:

: It's *much* easier to parse and understand the octal numbers, while the
: symbolic macro names are just random line noise and hard as hell to
: understand.  You really have to think about it.
:
: So we should rather go the other way: convert existing bad symbolic
: permission bit macro use to just use the octal numbers.
:
: The symbolic names are good for the *other* bits (ie sticky bit, and the
: inode mode _type_ numbers etc), but for the permission bits, the symbolic
: names are just insane crap.  Nobody sane should ever use them.  Not in the
: kernel, not in user space.

Add pom.xml to build with Maven

If I'm completely honest I never figured out how to build this project
manually. I stopped learning Java years ago and always relied on the
Eclipse IDE to get the work done for me. I did however always feel bad
for anyone out there trying to build this project without having to
install a specific IDE.

Maven finally unlocked this for me. It took me about an hour of
tutorials and examples, but now building the project is easy as pie.

I also moved the files to adhere to the expected / recommended folder
structure for Maven.

I'm very happy that I finally got this right. I seem to come back to
this project every two years or so (the current trigger was a toy my
little kid got that plays an earily familiar cat sound) and trying to
build it up until now was always a pain in the ass.

Update

Added a Less Restrictive Blacklist which allows for words like: 'fuck', 'shit', 'damn', etc.

Also, removed all spellings of 'lesbian' and 'gay' while keeping the sexualized & slurs in there since being gay or lesbian isn't bad.

I also renamed 'blacklist.txt' to 'Ultimate Blaclist' then I added more versions of profanities.

And more!
