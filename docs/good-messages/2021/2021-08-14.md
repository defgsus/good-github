sched/tune: Switch Dynamic Schedtune Boost to a slot-based tracking system

Switch from a counter-based system to a slot-based system for managing
multiple dynamic Schedtune boost requests.

The primary limitations of the counter-based system was that it could
only keep track of two boost values at a time: the current dynamic boost
value and the default boost value. When more than one boost request is
issued, the system would only remember the highest value of them all.
Even if the task that requested the highest value had unboosted, this
value is still maintained as long as there are other active boosts that
are still running. A more ideal outcome would be for the system to
unboost to the maximum boost value of the remaining active boosts.

The slot-based system provides a solution to the problem by keeping
track of the boost values of all ongoing active boosts. It ensures that
the current boost value will be equal to the maximum boost value of
all ongoing active boosts. This is achieved with two linked lists
(active_boost_slots and available_boost_slots), which assign and keep
track of boost slot numbers for each successful boost request. The boost
value of each request is stored in an array (slot_boost[]), at an index
value equal to the assigned boost slot number.

For now we limit the number of active boost slots to 5 per Schedtune
group.

I love this tool!  and here is gentle nudge 

github makes it super easy to change from using the master nomenclature to 'main' instead.  In fact, it's been the default for 'main' to be the main branch for repos for a while now.  The instructions to migrate old repos are pretty pain free https://github.com/github/renaming .Even if you don't choose to, I think it does, or soon will be the case potential users would expect to see 'main' used in docs relevant to how to install in their own repos. 

Thank you--

* That took a ridiculous amount of time, but I've finally gotten Grafana to actually show data from Prometheus now!

The steps in my discovery process:
1) While browsing through the service and pods for prometheus-k8s[/-0/-1], I noticed an ip-address (on a pod) of "10.42.0.21:9090", rather than than regular type "10.42.124.239:9090". I decided I might as well try pasting it into the data-source url in Grafana, and I was surprised when Grafana finally showed its first panel of data from it!
2) I then checked, and confirmed that the Grafana default data source was set up to try to reference the service, through "prometheus-k8s.monitoring.svc". I read up on how services can have domain-names redirected to them.
3) So, the service was somehow just failing to proxy the requests properly to the pods, it seemed. I started searching on how to fix this.
4) I realized one way would be to retrieve the pod ips dynamically, and use that in grafana. But there didn't seem to be an easy way to do that from in a pod. Also, that would mean having to dynamically update grafana's data-source url, which seemed difficult.
5) While reading lots of general documentation around services, I noticed this wonderful gem of a paragraph: "But, what if a headless service was created and was managing more than one pod? In this case, any query to the service’s DNS name will return a list of all the pods managed by this service. The request will accept the first IP address returned." Bingo!
6) What the above means is that the Grafana pod, when it tries to resolve "prometheus-k8s.monitoring.svc" from the local dns, will have a list of ips returned -- of the actual pods! This is exactly what I want, because after a long time of trying things out, I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the service layer acting as a proxy, but I knew the direct pod addresses worked.
7) I tried to apply the change (of making the service headless), but I wasted a lot of time because I was editing the wrong file. :facepalm: Such is what can happen when you spend to many tens of hours straight working on a problem. [you lose energy and so don't do as much "high-level sanity checking" as you should]

Anyway, it was a painful series of debugging attempts, the dragged on for many hours. I still don't know what was wrong with that service layer -- and, someday, it will probably come back to bite me. But, for now, at least it's working -- and I also learned a little more about services in the process.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Fixes: c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

Update README.md

Here we are again!
last days I have been busy with covid-19 virus :)) we met each other, drank tea together and now I feel great! (I would miss my little friend!)
As a nice cute come back to data science world, I started to learn data cleaning better.
But for now, I did a simple data cleaning for a kaggle sample data. 
The missed valued were replaced with mean value and then beautiful graphs showed us the relation behind our data!
Hope you enjoy it!

Hi everyone!
last days I have been busy with my little friend(covid-19 virus). we met each other , drank tea together and now it seems that our future paths are separated :)
As a come back to coding world, I decided to run a simple data cleaning on a random data. 
Today we learn how to face with missing values(numeric, categorical) and also the beautiful heat maps teach us about hidden relation between numbers :)
Hope you all enjoy it

Update 14/08/2021 – Fixing NavMesh destination jittering, future non-AI plans

I think I fixed the pathfinding glitching issue I mentioned in previous update logs.

As I mentioned earlier, I noticed that NavMesh.CalculatePath, a function for determining whether an agent can actually reach a desired destination, cannot reliably produce such a result on its own. The function returns a bool value, so if it returns false it’s obvious that the path is faulty. But even if it returns true, the path can still be invalid. Fortunately, it is possible to easily check the true status of a path by storing it as a variable, and checking its status enum for one of three values – completed, partial and invalid. I added another if statement to my AI’s pathfinding checking sequence, that after using NavMesh.CalculatePath to get the path value, checks the status and only continues if it returns as complete.

This seems to have fixed the issue! I haven’t encountered a single issue of the AI’s pathfinding glitching out, and once it finds a position it will continually go there without jittering around. As of right now I’m pleased enough with my AI that I think I need to presently work on other parts of the game. But I might as well list some other adjustments I plan on making.

I think I need to add some kind of cooldown between finding new positions. If the player is moving at all, the enemy will often take too long to start properly attacking them. In short-ranged skirmishes, it is easy for the enemy to be constantly adjusting its position because the player moved just out of range, even though if the enemy continued moving on their path they would run into the player anyway. While the current movement system would work very well for a fast-moving, glass-cannon type enemy with low health, there are obviously many elements I want to implement.

I also want to implement some kind of stagger mechanic. While I am admittedly not the most skilled when it comes to precision aiming in first-person shooters, my AI enemy is proving annoyingly difficult even by those standards, since it moves around so frequently and dodges almost instantly. I believe I should add an ability for the player to stop them from moving temporarily. I may also implement a reaction time feature to the enemy dodge mechanic, so the player can potentially get attacks in before dodging.

While I want to come back to this later, I think my biggest priority right now is making the game more polished and presentable, as this was something I was doing to my enemies before I found so many bugs in the AI. I anticipate a lot of my updates for the foreseeable future will consist of cosmetic updates such as adding new models and animations, and appropriately linking them up to the gameplay mechanics.

  - modifying/updating result[ne] already when relaxing
    - instead of just enqueueing relaxed value `time+S[id]` to the PQ
    -> would break `if (umin(result[id], time))`
       <- because result[id] set to optimal already when it was `ne`
    => UPDATE RESULT(S) ONLY AT ONE PLACE IN THE CODE, NOT TWICE!!
