turns out i never installed json5

seems I was using the one from @babel/core or like one of the many versions of loader-utils or something, fucking hell this isnt even funny anymore like seriously i hate this hoisting thing it causes too many problems

ok yea maybe ur probably right idk maybe i should go back to npm or maybe consider yarn or smth lol, idk maybe not, because i do think its better to fix these problems now than to later realise that all the versions of loader-utils and @babel/core no longer depend on json5 and then im doomed to run `npm i json5` or `yarn add json5` which is like bruh idk i rather do that now than later, and i like strict dependencies and knowing which version of json5 i'm using (like previously was i using latest (2.2.0), old (1.0.1) or super fucking archaic (0.5.1)? i dont know! i'd rather know! thatd be great thank you!) also like what if the typings don't match up??? like that version 0 or version 1 bound to have some sort of breaking change in them or something, idk

##### 2021-04-11 10:30:55 by Marko Grdinić

"10:50am. Sleepless night, again. Yesterday's gaming session was great, but my mind decided to kick it up a notch after I had gone to bed. I hate going to bed at 1am and then going into overdrive.

Well, my mind might be dull, but my soul is burning bright.

Here is what I've deduced, even with the recent gains in understanding, I am not even 1% there yet in matching nature's mastery of intelligence engineering. Just what level of skill would I need to do the same thing nature did in the brain? It seems unimaginable that I would be ever capable of it.

So I need to be humble and keep my eyes and ears open for clues.

I've made great advance in my understanding of CFR, not by reasoning about the algorithm directly, but by imagining simple graph and running not the actual algorithms itself, but pieces of it.

Compared to my usual sharpness in programming, the proof technique here is poor since I am not even proving things on the original program. But it is imaginative and it is generating insights for me.

It was just so difficult to get to this point. I spent so much time 2019 trying to master math. Then banging against CFR again, not getting anywhere. Month of effort.

I have no idea why I haven't been able to do back then what I did now. It is not like the insight I have now is in any way revolutionary.

There is something I have to take away from this episode - unlike with standard algorithms, anything involving rational (float) quantities is incredibly difficult to reason about.

I had the algorithm in front of me for months, and I still could not figure it out until now. It is absolutely beyond my ability to figure out the algorithms involved in general intelligence with just the power of my imagination. The only way I am going to be able to win is if somebody gives me the algorithm. Then at most I might have sufficient skill to recognize it in a partial form and then extend it like I did with the CFR algorithm.

I doubt I could have made it myself.

I could have done what I did now in 2008 and got a heads up on the samling and neural versions of the algorithm. I probably could not have made the original CFR.

11:10am. My skills are inadequate, but that is offset by the ubquity of intelligence in nature and the large research community looking into it.

11:15am. I think back in 2015, I really blew that Probabilistic Graphical Models course.

Here is what I need to do. I need to accept that CFR is my limit when it comes to NNs. That ensemble method I had thought about in Jan 2019? Forget it, it cannot handle environmental changes. I could train an ensemble of value nets, use that to drive exploration during the initial segment, but after the opponent changes policy then ensembles will have narrowed their epistemic errors and will have started moving in tandem making them useless for that purpose.

It would not work. The intrinsic motivation scheme I came up with falls apart as soon the environment starts changing in response to the agent's self optimization.

CFR kills my ensemble idea, which might be a good thing as it gives me less work to do. The way I had intended to do it would be dumb, as backproping through a sampled Gaussian random value would make the variance extreme.

11:20am. Involved in the creation of AI will be a new kind of language. Nature found it, and is taking advantage of it to shape the neural passageways in biological brains.

Predictive coding, Bayesian inference...there is more to go in that direction. There is more to go before I can understand how algorithm like CFR are derived from first principles.

If I am trully serious, that is what I should go after.

11:20am. Let me implement CFR, put it to work making money in the real world and then I will do research seriously. I will try to learn as many algorithms as I can and study them. Only that way can I increase my skill.

I've greatly cleaned up the tabular CFR algorithm. I am good at dealing with what is.

Back in high school I looked at the solutions to some of the olympiad problems and found them absolutely perplexing, but just how much effort did I put into understanding CFR? Had I obsessed about those problems to the degreed that I did CFR, my skills would not have rotted and my momentum would not waned.

I was too egoistic after my victory. I thought my own ability should allow me to do anything in the real world and was disappointed when that was not the case.

I should have known that to make progress is to steal. And that to fight seriously is to run.

11:45am. Had I been really serious about fighting rather than just daydreaming about it, I would have recognized and accepted that I needed to run rather than wait for the power to develop in me. All my life was built on delusions.

In the real world, go into flight mode. In the programming sphere, steal as much as you can.

CFR is just the first gain.

I am going to get my ML skills to from 3/5 to 5/5 and master the true language of intelligence. That is the only thing that will satisfy my ambitions and allow me to move on with my regrets, both past and future.

First requirement is money though. I'll have to put my parents into cold sleep eventually and cryogenic freezing is not something I'll be able to afford with 3k per month kind of jobs. I might need to do this for myself if the Singularity date gets skipped and goes past my lifespan.

11:50am. I am going to put everything together eventually. But that is for the future, and I can't turn away from the present.

I need to thoroughly master CFR and leave other concerns aside.

Forget ensembles. Forget AI chips. Forget anything else. Master the value networks. Master the simplest thing possible.

I'll look into predictive coding and probabilistic programming at a later date. Ensembles are the wrong way to go about this. Even if they worked in unchanging env circumstances, trying to push them will hinder my understanding of how beliefs are formed and propagated in the actual brain.

11:55am. When I have a thorough mastery of ML on par with nature, I will be able to say that I am mature as a programmer. I don't know whether that is achievable, but that is what should be my goal.

Money and recognition will come and go, but skills and algorithms are the true gain. They are actual power.

They are what will allow me to move with absolute assurance once I get them.

I won't get to that level by just trying to push NN models with backprop. I should strike out and look widely at different kinds of algorithms and master that just like CFR.

12pm. Right now I should be good to beat poker, but my ability is still inconsequential as far as real world is concerned.

12:05pm. I finally opened the editor.

Yeah, the last step before I resume the journey is to kill my Jan 2019 post. It is just daydreaming. It is not the way to go Bayesian. The real system might end up using NNs and backprop under the hood, but they will be composed using something else. It won't be possible to make human level intelligence using end-to-end supervised learning of the sort employed today.

12:10pm. I wonder if my CFR insight regarding how to do hierarchical RL would translate to GANs? I mean they do the same kind of min max thing as two player games do.

What CFR does is split the optimization levels into proper hierarchies and then does some kind of Bayesian thing to average out the cycles induced by such an optimization process. Maybe modifying the generator so its optimization is not path probability dependant, even if it is memory dependent on the discriminator would bear fruit.

It is something to think about.

I think that I should master CFR in the real world and then look into all the Bayesian and discrete optimization algorithms that are out there and master the interesting ones.

12:20pm. If I could enhance the breadth of my knowledge, that might provide fuel for the qualitative breakthrough that I need to reach the next level.

Let close this rant here with one observation.

The neural CFR update should be tried in games like Go and Chess. I strongly suspect it will work better than what is Deepmind's grand achievement. The inner loop it is optimizing is good for driving exploration and since those game are perfect information it won't be necessary to average out the cycles at all in the outer loop. So the outer policy averaging loop can be left out.

Optimizing just the inner loop should be a lot faster than optimizing the full path like in policy gradient methods.

Let me get breakfast here.

I am definitely going to work on the UIs today."

Among Us ruined my life (from r/amogus)
I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. "Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than "sus." I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is "red sus" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word "among" is ruined. The phrase "among us" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence.
