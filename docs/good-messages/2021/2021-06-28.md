(core): Add org directory as a sub-module

I've come to the realisation that dropbox isn't a reliable platform for
persistent notes. It works well enough but so much of it is hidden behind
paywalls or obfuscated APIs that're intentionally designed to be usable
only from within the Dropbox ecosystem. So for example earlier today I
used a batch `sed` process to try and change a link type in my org-brain.
I was worried my regexp might not've matched properly and so some
information was lost so I wanted to recover my previous changes. Turns
out dropbox allows you to recover a single file change under a free
plan, but not an entire directory change. So I can painstakingly go
through each file and remove the changes one by one (through an online
platform that seems allergic to any sort of automation in this regard)
or pay-up for an upgrade, make the change, and then promptly cancel my
subscription cause frankly £9.99 a month is an insane price tag. In the
end I had to pay to revert, but I could've just used a git-repo and not
had to deal with all this hassle.

Merge branch 'work.openat2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs

Pull openat2 support from Al Viro:
 "This is the openat2() series from Aleksa Sarai.

  I'm afraid that the rest of namei stuff will have to wait - it got
  zero review the last time I'd posted #work.namei, and there had been a
  leak in the posted series I'd caught only last weekend. I was going to
  repost it on Monday, but the window opened and the odds of getting any
  review during that... Oh, well.

  Anyway, openat2 part should be ready; that _did_ get sane amount of
  review and public testing, so here it comes"

From Aleksa's description of the series:
 "For a very long time, extending openat(2) with new features has been
  incredibly frustrating. This stems from the fact that openat(2) is
  possibly the most famous counter-example to the mantra "don't silently
  accept garbage from userspace" -- it doesn't check whether unknown
  flags are present[1].

  This means that (generally) the addition of new flags to openat(2) has
  been fraught with backwards-compatibility issues (O_TMPFILE has to be
  defined as __O_TMPFILE|O_DIRECTORY|[O_RDWR or O_WRONLY] to ensure old
  kernels gave errors, since it's insecure to silently ignore the
  flag[2]). All new security-related flags therefore have a tough road
  to being added to openat(2).

  Furthermore, the need for some sort of control over VFS's path
  resolution (to avoid malicious paths resulting in inadvertent
  breakouts) has been a very long-standing desire of many userspace
  applications.

  This patchset is a revival of Al Viro's old AT_NO_JUMPS[3] patchset
  (which was a variant of David Drysdale's O_BENEATH patchset[4] which
  was a spin-off of the Capsicum project[5]) with a few additions and
  changes made based on the previous discussion within [6] as well as
  others I felt were useful.

  In line with the conclusions of the original discussion of
  AT_NO_JUMPS, the flag has been split up into separate flags. However,
  instead of being an openat(2) flag it is provided through a new
  syscall openat2(2) which provides several other improvements to the
  openat(2) interface (see the patch description for more details). The
  following new LOOKUP_* flags are added:

  LOOKUP_NO_XDEV:

     Blocks all mountpoint crossings (upwards, downwards, or through
     absolute links). Absolute pathnames alone in openat(2) do not
     trigger this. Magic-link traversal which implies a vfsmount jump is
     also blocked (though magic-link jumps on the same vfsmount are
     permitted).

  LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS:

     Blocks resolution through /proc/$pid/fd-style links. This is done
     by blocking the usage of nd_jump_link() during resolution in a
     filesystem. The term "magic-links" is used to match with the only
     reference to these links in Documentation/, but I'm happy to change
     the name.

     It should be noted that this is different to the scope of
     ~LOOKUP_FOLLOW in that it applies to all path components. However,
     you can do openat2(NO_FOLLOW|NO_MAGICLINKS) on a magic-link and it
     will *not* fail (assuming that no parent component was a
     magic-link), and you will have an fd for the magic-link.

     In order to correctly detect magic-links, the introduction of a new
     LOOKUP_MAGICLINK_JUMPED state flag was required.

  LOOKUP_BENEATH:

     Disallows escapes to outside the starting dirfd's
     tree, using techniques such as ".." or absolute links. Absolute
     paths in openat(2) are also disallowed.

     Conceptually this flag is to ensure you "stay below" a certain
     point in the filesystem tree -- but this requires some additional
     to protect against various races that would allow escape using
     "..".

     Currently LOOKUP_BENEATH implies LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS, because it
     can trivially beam you around the filesystem (breaking the
     protection). In future, there might be similar safety checks done
     as in LOOKUP_IN_ROOT, but that requires more discussion.

  In addition, two new flags are added that expand on the above ideas:

  LOOKUP_NO_SYMLINKS:

     Does what it says on the tin. No symlink resolution is allowed at
     all, including magic-links. Just as with LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS this
     can still be used with NOFOLLOW to open an fd for the symlink as
     long as no parent path had a symlink component.

  LOOKUP_IN_ROOT:

     This is an extension of LOOKUP_BENEATH that, rather than blocking
     attempts to move past the root, forces all such movements to be
     scoped to the starting point. This provides chroot(2)-like
     protection but without the cost of a chroot(2) for each filesystem
     operation, as well as being safe against race attacks that
     chroot(2) is not.

     If a race is detected (as with LOOKUP_BENEATH) then an error is
     generated, and similar to LOOKUP_BENEATH it is not permitted to
     cross magic-links with LOOKUP_IN_ROOT.

     The primary need for this is from container runtimes, which
     currently need to do symlink scoping in userspace[7] when opening
     paths in a potentially malicious container.

     There is a long list of CVEs that could have bene mitigated by
     having RESOLVE_THIS_ROOT (such as CVE-2017-1002101,
     CVE-2017-1002102, CVE-2018-15664, and CVE-2019-5736, just to name a
     few).

  In order to make all of the above more usable, I'm working on
  libpathrs[8] which is a C-friendly library for safe path resolution.
  It features a userspace-emulated backend if the kernel doesn't support
  openat2(2). Hopefully we can get userspace to switch to using it, and
  thus get openat2(2) support for free once it's ready.

  Future work would include implementing things like
  RESOLVE_NO_AUTOMOUNT and possibly a RESOLVE_NO_REMOTE (to allow
  programs to be sure they don't hit DoSes though stale NFS handles)"

* 'work.openat2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs:
  Documentation: path-lookup: include new LOOKUP flags
  selftests: add openat2(2) selftests
  open: introduce openat2(2) syscall
  namei: LOOKUP_{IN_ROOT,BENEATH}: permit limited ".." resolution

input
standard input
output
standard output

What joy! Petya's parents went on a business trip for the whole year and the playful kid is left all by himself. Petya got absolutely happy. He jumped on the bed and threw pillows all day long, until...

Today Petya opened the cupboard and found a scary note there. His parents had left him with duties: he should water their favourite flower all year, each day, in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening. "Wait a second!" — thought Petya. He know for a fact that if he fulfills the parents' task in the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ 12) month of the year, then the flower will grow by ai centimeters, and if he doesn't water the flower in the i-th month, then the flower won't grow this month. Petya also knows that try as he might, his parents won't believe that he has been watering the flower if it grows strictly less than by k centimeters.

Help Petya choose the minimum number of months when he will water the flower, given that the flower should grow no less than by k centimeters.
Input

The first line contains exactly one integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 100). The next line contains twelve space-separated integers: the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ 12) number in the line represents ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100).
Output

Print the only integer — the minimum number of months when Petya has to water the flower so that the flower grows no less than by k centimeters. If the flower can't grow by k centimeters in a year, print -1.

dwarf_loader: No need to strdup() what dwarf_formstring() returns

Conversation with Mark Wieelard, elfutils developer:

  acme | ultimately dwarf_attr->valp for strings point to what? DIE memory that is always there?
  acme | I'm working on pahole and need to keep a pointer to what it returns
  acme | I was strdup()ing what dwarf_formstring() returns, tried removing the strdup() and instead point to what dwarf_formstring() returns and it worked, but I want to know for sure
   mjw | ah, yeah
   mjw | the memory/string returned by dwarf_formstring() is owned by the Dwarf. So long as the Dwarf is active (dwarf_end() hasn't been called and the underlying Elf is valid of course) you can use that string.
  acme | cool!
  acme | I'll use your explanation in the commit log message
  acme | thanks!
  acme | I'm also working on multithreading DWARF loading
   mjw | in most cases it will point directly into the .debug_str section, but it can also be the .debug_line_str section or a string embedded in the .debug_info section, etc.
   mjw | in all cases the Dwarf is responsible for keeping the memory life.

Improved various missions with Script Vehicle Randomizer + added some SFX randomization + adjusted vehicle / weapon patterns + shuffled CutsceneModels groups + added no broken jaws config option + changes to extra pickups

LONG-WINDED RUN DOWN OF EVERY CHANGE FOLLOWS:

Script Vehicle Randomizer:
- Cut Throat Business now activates Cars On Water at the chase section to make it more intuitive / simple for casual players. Also added additional coordinates for planes you can take off with.
- New Model Army has been overhauled to allow fuller randomization of the player's RC Goblin. They can now receive both full-sized helicopters (which required the addition of a hook to nullify the aircraft height check) and cars - code has been added to account for this change by moving the magnet and its pickup range.
- Air Raid has been changed to be more challenging by giving the planes more speed. Previously you would pass no matter what, but now there is a balance of planes that crash and planes that actually pose a threat to give the player more agency.
- Reuniting The Families has had several fixes. A crash related to Train Randomizer was fixed, the player's height at the autoscroller was slightly increased so they can throw grenades / molotovs, and the cops that jump on are now moved on top of the vehicle so they can be shot properly by the player.
- Interdiction has been modified to remove some of the annoying / unfair aspects of the mission using two additional hooks. If the friendly heli becomes a car, it will be prevented from moving while the player is not driving it so the AI doesn't drive it off the cliff. Additionally, if the player has decided to drive the friendly heli in order to use it to destroy the enemy helis, they will be removed from the vehicle before it is destroyed to prevent them from dying.
- Modified the requirements for trailer attachment in Trucking / Tanker Commander / Highjack to make it more generous and easier for an unknowing player to achieve.
- Re-balanced the extra timings in Driving and Boat School.
- Removed vehicles from Mountain Cloud Boys that caused crashes.
- Added patterns to some scripted vehicles to prevent them from becoming boats (as they can explode from scraping on the ground).
- Added unique set of patterns for the Wheelie Weave test.
- Re-allowed RC vehicles for Up, Up, and Away, as the lighter mass of the Securicar now makes this possible.
- Removed helicopters from Destroy Targets test in Learning To Fly.
- Removed vehicles in Drive-By that your friends cannot enter.
- Added alternate coordinates for helis and large cars in Customs Fast Track.

Voice Line Randomizer:
- Added a minor new option called "RandomizeGenericSfx." This randomizes some simple frontend audio effects, primarily the bleeps and bloops of menus, picking up items, pop-ups, etc.

Cutscene Randomizer:
- Reshuffled various groups in the Cutscene_Models file. As well as increased chances for peds with facial animations, other props have been moved around to randomize with props that will move properly, plus allowing some props to randomize into more things after testing that they functioned properly.
- Added new option for preventing broken-jawed peds called "UseOnlyNormalCutsceneModels". This uses another data file, Cutscene_Models2.

Pickup Randomizer:
- Added extra chances for health and armour pickups in the additional pickups.
- Added a new cash bag pickup, similar to the briefcase except it can give thousands of dollars of money.
- Added sound effect that plays when briefcases or cash bags are picked up to indicate their reward.
- Briefcases will now only drop from dead peds due to an issue where they couldn't be picked up in many other scenarios.

Weapon Randomizer:
- Added "noflame" and "uselessproj" flags. The "uselessproj" flags in particular removes tear gas and satchel charges, which is particularly important for autoscrollers / turret sections where these are not usable.
- Adjusted Air Raid and Up, Up and Away patterns to give more useful weapons.
- Added pattern for cameras in Management Issues to prevent insta-fails.

Reduces the amount of merc dogs on dogbase POI
Reduced the amount of dogs from 17 to 12 because there are only 12 dog beds and even that is kinda silly excessive amount in my opinion.

Removed the insult on top of the injury. (As the creator of these dogs that were somewhat based on my real life dog, seeing them reduced to swarming manhack-tier gunfodder kinda stung, but at least the amount of dogs now matches the amount of dog beds lol)

Update books.md

There are so many books one can find on infosec, from Hacking Exposed to the Web Application Handbook. However, the books that I suggest in this pull request are of a different kind. They portray real life hacking scenarios where the reader shadows a hacker trying to break into a company. They get to experience the frustraiton, joy and excitment of a real hacking engagement.
Furthermore, the techniques and tips focus on common systems and network configurations: Windows, Mainframes, Active Directory, Linux, etc.
Cheers,

One More Time, One More Update

- Update to Rails 6.1
- disable unneeded components like ActiveStorage, ActionText,
  ActionCable, ...
- webpacker is not really used, remove all node packages
- sprockets javascript is not used neither, comment out (rails admin
  loads its own JS)
- update gems
- update Ruby to 2.7.3 (Rails 3 is not possible, smbhash depends on <3)
- disable spring and bootsnap, because why not
- remove SCSS, because causes segmentation faults....as usual...fuck you
  scss
- remove circular deps in tests - zeitwerk and test helper load stuff, I
  don't really remember why there were additional specific requires
- this is most likely the end of the road

Add files via upload

Resubmit for the project. First off I want to say that I had a separate imgs folder for my pictures. For some reason it didn't push the folder the first time so I'll upload the imgs individually and make the changes in the index file.

Next I would like to make it known that I do have some past experience with both HTML and CSS edits. I attribute this to my errors alongside a general sense of naivety and stupidity in what I submitted the first time. While working on this project last week I got swept away in making this as complete as humanly possible; googling anything and every concept and idea I thought was good without really trying to understand it and make it my own. When you're dabbling around for fun you don't think about any possible repercussions. Thank you Olivia and Bob for pointing out my errors and holding me accountable. 

I hope this will be a better representation of me and what I was able to learn last week. I keep some items that I googled because I believe they were natural extensions of what we learned. For example, regarding CSS animations. I wanted to know how to create an effect that I hadn't seen Bob display. I believe that's exactly what he would have encouraged us to do. 

I will also happily explain the thought process behind every line of this submission should it be asked of me or if the comments I have don't do it enough justice.
