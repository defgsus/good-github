Bug Fix Hints

I added some comments inline beginning on line 81 where your bug issue begins.
Overall, this is an amazing project 1.  I'd love to see you continue to improve it over time
by refactoring it so it's DRYer.  An excellent way to do that will be by using OOP.  Creating
some classes to help better organize your code will make it so there are fewer side effects
and will help in preventing bugs like the one you experienced.  Using React,
 which we're learning now, is another option to help put more structure behind your code.
Congratulations on a great project submission!

"10:10am. I am up. Let me read Ayakashi and AssPride and then I will start.

I keep plotting how to get that point of contact and the only thing my mind is producing are bigger and bigger lies. The right approach for this is to fake identity and gather a lot of negotiation experience that way. I mean, imagine you are an AI. You could just make up fake resumes and apply through them.

The fact that I am not looking for a job, but a sponsor for Spiral actually makes things a lot harder for me. Spiral is tied to my identity and I can't really use the full breadth of negotiation strategies. Plus this is wasting a lot of my time and mental energy.

I actually resent a company like Groq a little. In the job posting there was a lot of what the company itself wants, but not what they would provide to the candidate. This goes even for senior posts.

Do I really have to approach this as a conman? If I get ghosted by the end of the week, I'll burn my morals and approach this solely from the perspective of maximizing my odds. I'll apply to senior positions from here on out with a bunch of made up experience.

10:15am. But I am really tempted to just wash my hands of this.

Forget the outside world and change my goals.

Yesterday I said that making a ML library was a mistake. That might have been the truth.

I am going to change my desired specialty towards where I am going. In 2020 I've started changing my approach from ML to concurrency. It should have been my main path from the start.

10:25am. Yes, making a ML library was a mistake. But I don't think that creating Spiral was. It gave me unparalleled freedom.

Like, once I had v2 it allowed me to simply make a Cython backend. That shows just how strong Spiral's capabilities are. Now I can program Python in the true functional style.

10:30am. I should be getting better at concurrency. More and more. Everything else is trivial. Even ML itself is trivial. It is a bunch of compiler engineering problems surrounded by NP Hard, impossible tier problems.

How difficult it is entirely depends on my approach.

...

I can get better endlessly if I cultivate my concurrency skills. It is really the natural outgrowth of functional programming. The fact that I thought that ML skills were the most central in the path of transcendence was merely just my misconception.

I might have made a tactical error, but the strategic choice of striving to overcome my limitations through making a language was the right one.

Let me chill.

10:55am. Let me finally start.

I am not really a rank 5. The pinnacle of programming skill would not possess such shallow accumulation. The pinnacle of skill even for just humans would have significant effect upon the world. I need to chase after it.

11am. Programming is not about conning my way into some company or the other. It is not about recognition or sponsors. It is about my own personal power.

The ML library was a mistake, but was I wrong to push forth with my own style? Never!

11:05am. Now I need to focus. I need to make the UI for the Leduc game.

11:25am. At some point I am going to have to make a serious effort at learning Python concurrency. Right now I really have no idea how do independent training on a separate thread. Compared to my F# skills with the Hopac library, I am just too lost in the Python ecosystem.

I just don't have the same kind of power here.

11:30am. Python concurrency and fixing the Spiral's editor support for the top level are my biggest challenge for the month March.

I need to get better at concurrency. 4/5 is not enough. I am barely 3/5 right now in Python.

I want to exercise this. This is the only thing worth doing in life. How could I ever want anything else?

...

Damn, Spiral v2 is awesome. February was my first real programming month with it and I am enjoying it. If only I could make time to redesign the top level so that those crashes when moving and deleting files stop happening it would be perfect.

I should do what I want.

11:35am. But for today, let me outline my goals.

1) I need to CPS the Leduc game a step further. Instead of the regular `game` nominal, I am going to do a version that accepts the return as a continuation. When it is the player's turn to act, I'll send a message to the UI with the continuation.

...

Hmmm...I know what I want, but I am not sure how to make the design fit.

11:40am. Well, it will take some work. The real problem is fitting it in with the previous design.

I'll leave this first goal for later.

2) I need to make the UI itself. This won't be too hard. I just need to expand the bindings and get more familiar with the Kivy library.

11:45am. I am thinking about this right now. Let me just give it a try.

I need to play around with Kivy widgets. What do I use for diplaying text? What about separators?

11:45am. https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/widgets.html

There is actually a separator used here in the catalogue example.

12pm. I am trying to make some concrete goals. It is good that I have a plan at the top level, but what are the concrete steps that I should do now?

12:05pm. I feel like forgetting the game and the language server issues and just grinding Kivy.

Since I will be using Kivy, I should go through the examples and translate some of them to Spiral. I should also fill out the bindings for the primitives.

Right now I only have a single layout and don't even understand how to do something as simple as a separator. I should take it easy and play with the library for a while. Get to know it while at the same time writing bindings and replicating the examples in Spiral.

This would be different than the furious outburst that I had imagined, but I should build my foundation in Python slowly.

Since I really want to, I should start planning how to redesign the top level of editor support. I want to avoid this as it would be very time consuming, but having the language be 100% stable shouldn't be an auxiliary goal. I should not blame myself for taking a detour. Even if it took me a few weeks so what.

When I am fully satisfied with language I will be able to rest more easily. I do not want to move a few files and think: 'Shit, now I have to restart the plugin.'

12:20pm. Do I want to play with Kivy or work on editor support?

I cannot do both.

12:25pm. Sigh. The later. I have to do the later. Better to do it now and enjoy the benefits of it throughout my work, than leave it for some indefinite future. Right now, it feels like Spiral's front porch has a pileup of garbage instead of the welcome mat.

February was really fun. I had enjoyed programming in Spiral itself after working towards this goal through the entirety of 2020 and the January of 2021. I did some non-trivial things and fixed what were the likely the last remaining bugs in the compiler.

I want the top level to be better. I am afraid that this issue might consume the entirety of March for me. But I should just face my fear.

At this point in my development I am frequently moving files around in the editor. I am not making single module tests anymore. I want the editor support to be roboust. The reason it is not is because my design is hacky and poor.

12:35pm. Let me have breakfast here, then I will go through the language from the top and identify all the pain points."

Welcome!! 🤩👏 My name is Alejandro and I'm writing these words after years of teaching code and changing lives. Please I beg you to read until the end, I will try my best not to bore you!

## What you already know

You are here to develop your coding skills to a point where you can be useful to society in order to: 1️⃣ Get a job, 2️⃣ Create your own company or/and 3️⃣ Adapt better to the now world.

## What you did not know

You are also here because you need help, not only technical help but also spiritual help, and I say this in the most pragmatic way possible.

> The biggest wall to become a developer is not in the syllabus or content but in your mind.

We are about to change the way you learn, the way you approach life, the way you sell yourself (therefore see yourself), we are tearing down old misconceptions about yourself, others and your professional life.

### We are here to tear down the 💻 3 Walls Towards Code 

During the past years we have identified specific reasons that cause students stop trying to be a developer or fail to complete the course or get a job. 

#### Wall #1: Confidence 🥺 (Impostor syndrome)

![Impostor Syndrome](../../assets/images/6cf4655f-665f-4f68-b021-f34238cedd69.png)

At some point in our lives (some more than others) we all have thought we are the most stupid person in a room, if we keep thinking that for a long time and we don't get comfortable on any discipline we may even think that we are not that smart. BULLSHIT! You are a part of this school, we do not accept people that we don't think are smart enough to make a living as a developer, you need to believe that, especially on tough times!

> If a particular exercise or project is hard, instead of thinking you are not good at this, look for new ways of absorbing the content. Talk to a mentor and we'll give you exactly what you need.

Every average person can learn to code to a point of being useful, coding gets more complicated when you specialize further in your career (Like A.I., Robotics, etc.), but you can make good money without having to study Math, without being good at numbers or without learning as fast as others (we may be able to fix that, by the way).

##### 📝 Recipe to avoid losing confidence

1. **Avoid being stuck to long:** Coding is tricky because you may be very close to solving a problem but you are stuck and you don't realize it. Or maybe you don't know how to start a problem but a quick 5 min talk with a mentor will clear the way. You need to ask for help no longer than 15 mins after trying on your own.

2. **Talk to other students:** You may think you are the only one that does not understand, but if you talk to a couple of class-mates you'll see they are just like you, it will give you the confidence to ask questions.

3. **Talk to the mentors:** A voice of experience is always effective, you have alumni and teachers that struggled before and are also struggling right now! They can help you during dark times, we are not only talking about giving you coding solutions, but giving you strategies to succeed in your (coding?) life.

#### Wall #2: Trust ✝

During all your life you've learned the same way, the educational system has put you in a box and trained you to learn slowly, limiting your ability to adapt to the new world of skilled fast-learning and self-learning professionals.

We know how to train you: we have done it over and over again, but we'll train in such a different way that you may not like it at first, it's only normal that your mind will want to go back to learning "slow but safe", without having to be uncomfortable or constantly challenged by our system.

##### 📝 Recipe to avoid losing trust in our methods

1. **Follow the method!** How can you know if it works if you don't try it properly? Do the homework BEFORE coming to class (flipped classroom), follow the syllabus in the recommended order, do the small exercises before jumping to the projects, come to every class, don't read books that will slow you down, etc.

2. **Ask Why?** There is only so much we can say, we need you raise your concerns in a private way immediately the moment you start double guessing our methods, we do everything for a reason and I'm confident that we are going to be able to explain "the why".

3. **Humble yourself:** There are lots of smart students that have successfully completed the course following the method, some of them work at Google, Amazon and other big all around the world companies. Please be humble enough to try and follow the course as it is. And discuss any ways of improvement with us, we are also humble enough to be open to try things that may work.

#### Wall #3: Inactivity 😴 

This is a boot-camp, it does not matter if you do it on a full-time or part-time way, you need to set the boot-camp mindset and work every day like it's the last. The Human brain absorbs 80% more we it feels challenged and scared, if you idle for a day the brain relaxes and [it's proven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5PLO4XAXhs) that you usually forget 60% of recently acquired information in just 1 day unless you use it again and again for a sequence of 7 days (at least).  

These are not small numbers, 60% in a day and 90% if you don't practice for a week. You are waiting your time and money if you don't take the course serious! 

##### 📝 Recipe to avoid inactivity

1. **Talk to your spouse, partner and family:** You need a break from almost everything, we know life it's challenging enough already to be adding more responsibilities, but this is only for a short period of your time. Rewards are endless. Everyone needs to fall inline! Try opening up the most time you can, having a private desk to work without distraction, etc. Your home has to be in sync with this moment of your life.

2. **Talk to your boss:** You may need a few extra hours, weekend time, etc. Be smart about it or he/she could sabotage it because he is afraid of losing you.

3. **Don't miss class:** Missing classes is our biggest concern, we are very concerned about attendance because it has shown that is the #1 deterrent to your motivation, missing two classes in a row is the perfect storm. You will need to have 1-on-1 mentoring and double the hours thru that week to avoid staying behind.

4. **Get involved:** Just coming to class will not be enough, humans are emotional creatures, information attaches better to your brain when you are engaged, emotional, coming to events and study groups, publicly speaking about it, etc. 

## What next?

Please make sure you understand how the academy works:

1. **Platform:** BreatheCode, The Syllabus (learn how to follow it), GeekPal, GeekForce, the lessons, exercises, projects and assets.
2. **The people:** We are more than one thousand people now! Leaders, Mentors, the [Alumni and Students](http://sep.4geeksacademy.com/), we are here to help and we are here to stay. Network, make friends, take advantage!
3. **The community:** Communities are not one way, they just don't work like that to the events, support other students, give first and you will receive later. Slack, GeekTalks, Workshops, Group Studies.


## Best Practices while starting to learn code

| **Don't read (much):** Coding is like sport, the best what to get better is thru practice. Learn by doing |    ![Its practice](../../assets/images/01868f7d-4949-4e15-85da-8042ea24a11a.jpeg) |
| ---   | ----      |
| **Sleep:** Having a good sleep is as important as coming to class, coding is 100% intellectual, having a sharp mind is everything. | ![Sleep](../../assets/images/d29be460-cc2e-42e6-bf92-f9516fd7b21a.jpeg) |
| **Learn how to ask:** The biggest challenge you have to address at first is learning [how to ask a question](https://content.breatheco.de/how-to/ask), picking the right works, know exactly want you want to know is the best skill for any developer. | ![How to ask](../../assets/images/fdb86b48-fb0b-4841-8d4d-60d4dbf4d70c.jpeg) |
| **Ask questions:** Its a win-win, preparing the question will teach you, we get feedback from your understanding, it the biggest boost for your learning process. It's what you are paying for. | ![Ask questions](../../assets/images/5e975e91-1447-4117-b50b-b00df99a88a5.jpeg) |
