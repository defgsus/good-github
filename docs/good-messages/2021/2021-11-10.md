modpost: file2alias: go back to simple devtable lookup

[ Upstream commit ec91e78d378cc5d4b43805a1227d8e04e5dfa17d ]

Commit e49ce14150c6 ("modpost: use linker section to generate table.")
was not so cool as we had expected first; it ended up with ugly section
hacks when commit dd2a3acaecd7 ("mod/file2alias: make modpost compile
on darwin again") came in.

Given a certain degree of unknowledge about the link stage of host
programs, I really want to see simple, stupid table lookup so that
this works in the same way regardless of the underlying executable
format.

[Bleeding] Bunnyhop, bunnyfly, bug fixes.

Several/Major bunny adjustments (+ on the fly bug fixes)

1) Bunnyhop and slopes:
a) Let bunnyhop apply on yDistance
slopes (the jumping envelope is never hit: gravity hits harder here).
b) Grounded acceleration case (air-ground(landing), 0 hDist diff  ->
ground-ground,  0 hDist diff-> ground-ground, sudden mini burst of speed with no yDistance.
For this phase, we simply give players more momentum via bunnyhop ticks and increase speed slightly.
c) Continuous slope-jumping on ice will still fail  as speed  will keep increasing with each hop (Slime and normal ground seems fine)
d) Observed: edge case where bunnyfly speed decreases extremely little (in-air), thus, if the player has recently jumped up a slope and the hDist difference is small enough, the movement is allowed (should be confined more perhaps).

2) Get rid of that bloody sfOnIce legacy counter, at last.

3) Patch unintentional bypass with ice and headobstr.(bunnyhop -> drop speed below allowed to force set allowHop to true and to increase allowed friction speed -> bunnyhop again with higher speed (yOnGround case applies).

4) Cleanup, "simplify" (Where possible. Still too much spaghetti. Perhaps it's time for a rework :p).

5) Headbangbunny:
a) Don't wildcard; model should be decent enough now.
b) Observed: yet another case where clients can reach increasingly higher speed on ground: Touching ground in bunnyfriction with 0.3 speed -> ground-ground acceleration with 0.4 speed (bunnyhop) -> lifting off with increasing speed 0.5 (subsequent bunnyhop).

6) Hotfix for #171 : Allow bunny to consume the buffer.

7) Always clear hAcc on headbang.

8) On the fly:
a) sfVLTime -> sfVLMoveCount: we count moves, not time here.
b) Fix hopping right into a web (vertical).
c) Distinguish body in water VS body out of water when enforcing liquid->liquid speed limit: Magic has been warped for some time, how did we not get buried with reports about this !?
(Revert value to this commit: https://github.com/Updated-NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus/commit/c4331e1ffd4c7c17c43dba03f98f6feb875ada5b#diff-4adf02d4661b4aa4c5031880e2dd87200601581264a6d62eb56ce8c4b1606040 ).
d) Don't allow players to stand anywhere between minimum ground height and block height on ladders: fixes some fastladder bypasses (For @xaw3ep  is the Ground_Height flag still necessary? Seems like it's safe to remove)
Also slightly stricter climbable checking (step).

9) Move bunny stuff into its own workaround class (Coherence).

Missing:
1) Transitions stay problematic:
headobstructed -> head free / headobstructed on ice -> headobstructed on normal ground.

2) Bunnyhop while skimming over the edges of blocks. (video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/tdk1rdf9r3xwz5l/Edge_test.mov?dl=0 )
It does look like it's a problem with ice only (likely due to past moves being updated to not being on ice when touching the ground, the "lowjump problem" contributes as well).

3) Random setbacks when moving off from ice. Couldn't nail down the reason, let the buffer deal with this bullshit for now. Hopefully the higher modifier aids a little...

4) Hacc needs adjustments to take into account all illustrated cases.

5) Hop-after-velocity #171
Also applies when stopping to fly in air at high speed and falling. Looks like velocity isn't extended for long enough?

"10:30am. Let me chill a bit and then I will start.

Today I will get a handle on Blending modes.

11:05am. Frieren and then I start.

11:20am. Let me start.

https://youtu.be/Lmc0Ka7YIvw?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=384

Sigh, are these Blend modes any useful? I thought that the way to add shading is to just use opacity on the layer above.

https://youtu.be/Lmc0Ka7YIvw?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=676

Now that I am getting an explanation, I feel like I understand it even less what these modes are good for. Nevermind understanding them. I'll figure out their specific uses as I go along, but while painting I should focus on opacity for interactions between the layers.

11:55am. https://youtu.be/5Xd-41-exkg?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=281

I am not really sure where most of these settings are, but it does not matter too much.

https://youtu.be/2WcZe8Nkhrk?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl
17 The Brush Fallacy

So far those filter demos were hacky. They aren't that important in my view. Understanding them is not important to being a good artist, so I won't concern myself too much with them.

12:45pm. https://youtu.be/Ctv3CHMXV-E?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl

Hmmm, let me stop here. To be honest, it feels like I am just learning trivia here. None of this feels that important. Maybe I should watch this for a bit more and then just dive in.

Let me have breakfast here.

1:55pm. Done with breakfast and chores. Let me chill a bit and then I will resume. I want to put a dent into this course today so I can actually start doing painting work from here on out.

2:20pm. Let me finally start. Let me just get these tutorials out of the way. I've been through this plenty of times while programming. There are boring days like these, but soon enough I'll get back to the fun stuff.

https://youtu.be/wdOcV5Pjugk?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=180

This is fascinating. You really can see the depth based on the values.

3:10pm. https://youtu.be/RFIeez8vrgM?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=154

I don't know why. I really like his shading and coloring work, but dislike his line work for some reason. It feels out of place. Is it because it is too thick? Or is it something else?

https://youtu.be/WmgoOiwV7io?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=360

Sigh, I can't tell what he is doing at all. The video quality could be higher.

https://youtu.be/ZUw_l9d5sco?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=46

Couldn't he turn down the light somewhat? It is a bit painful to look at his face, it feels like a flashlight is shinning straight into my eyes.

4:10pm. https://youtu.be/9ZxRfPtUDCY?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=193
39 Painting Glowing Objects

This is interesting, though I am only paying sparse attention to this.

4:15pm. https://youtu.be/Gl9sI97asOo?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=929

I am skimming this. I am not going to watch him pain water for 22m. Though he is really good at it.

4:30pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oQrXNS92EM
â˜… The Scholar - full sketching, Inking and painting process // mixed media illustration

This caught my attention on the sidebar. I'll leave it for later though.

https://youtu.be/LrUbriA_tkw?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=840
> This line here

Which one? He really should have the stylus cursor shown. It is a weird ommission for the course. I have no idea what he is modifying here.

4:45pm. https://youtu.be/BPPmXvGVg7s?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=1250

I do not understand how, but his cell shading style mixes with realistic drawing style for some reason. My intuition is telling me that his lines are too rough even if they are precise.

To get beauty you need more curves.

There is an interplay between sharps and the smooths that his art ignores. Western art in general does not pay attention to this, and neither does his.

https://youtu.be/tKfMwZ1hGmA?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=79

If he is working on the yes like that, he really should zoom in. He'd get more precision and I would not have problems seeing what he is working on.

5:05pm. https://youtu.be/YP5zSAIjp7M?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl
56 Inked Art

I am doing my best to speed things up. Ultimately this course is just to up my familiarity.

5:20pm. https://youtu.be/wb3wS_bNowY?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl
64 Choosing and Preparing your Sketch

I am at my limit with this. Let me skim much faster. I want to read the Satanophany raws.

5:40pm. https://youtu.be/xHfIH8CQwts?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=203

This picture is really coming out well. Some weaknesses in lineart can really be surmounted with the proper use of color. He is pretty good.

6:30pm. Done with lunch. Let me resume.

I want to finish skimming the course.

https://youtu.be/ZFYS_5uW1hI?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl
87 Painterly Digital Paintings

Tomorrow I am going to do some fundamental exercises like painting basic 3d shapes. I thought of starting out with apples, but that would be too much. Well, something like a 3 value painting would be doable, but at this point before I do anything, I need to understand the brush itself better. There are some points that I am not clear on.

https://youtu.be/ggN9ZWJ0Crk?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=59
89 Rough Colors and Values

I'll want to watch this in full.

https://youtu.be/ggN9ZWJ0Crk?list=PLL7eX0No1f9nxLq_YIRD7QgugK95fn_wl&t=235

Let me stop here. I can't be bothered to watch anymore of this for one day. Tomorrow I'll finish this and then pick up the brush and give it a try myself. I had enough of tutorials. Somehow I feel like I learned more from those Sinix Design videos. The stuff here is more overly specific than I am interested in, though I guess if I was interested in these particular style vids I'd want to watch it more in depth. Just watching the lectures linearly is not that interesting.

I am thinking of how I would paint that apple and I am starting to think that the way I have in mind might be too complicated. I might be falling in the same I trap I had with drawing originally in that the way I have envisioned has no way of dealing with errors. Like, can I really do stoke direction to create edges? Probably not. it is better to use lighting differences to do that.

Maybe painting will turn out too hard for me simply because unlike for sculpting and drawing, I am more limited in my ability to correct myself.

7pm. Well, I am not obsessed about becoming a good painter in particular. But I will play with it for a while to get a feel for how doable it is.

7:15pm. Let me close here for the day. Tomorrow I will get something real done."
