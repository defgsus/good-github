Anguished over this bloody program for several hours and unshamefully phoned up a friend and used Stack Overflow to finally finish off a few bloody bugs after working on them for days, regardless of the fact that I could have dropped this assignment on account of the fact that this is an extension. God knows I don't have the self control to just put it down. I had to do it, even if it means Stack Overflow and asking homies for assistance. I'm just glad... that I finally got it done.

MORE INFO

My mother has been playing Mahjong for my entire life, and finally during the COVID-19 quarantine, she taught me and the rest of my family how to play. While bored over Summer 2020 in quarantine, I created a program that helps novice Mahjong players (like myself) with the game (using the 2020 card). In this program, I calculate the probability of each possible winning Mahjong hand taking into account the player's own hand and the tiles that have already been thrown by them and other players (this makes more sense if you know how to play the game). In a GUI that allows the player to enter their own tiles and the tiles being thrown by other players, the program recommends which tiles to discard and previews the player's most probable winning hands. Unfortunately, this program requires a number of seconds to run all of the probability computations, so I do not recommend using it if you are playing with experiences players (they may get annoyed at you, as I've found to be the case). However, if you're just learning to play the game, it may help you to see which hands are most attainable. I intend to continue working on this program in hopes of cutting down the program's run time between turns (i.e., tiles thrown).

proc: oom: drop bogus task_lock and mm check

Series "Handle oom bypass more gracefully", V5

The following 10 patches should put some order to very rare cases of mm
shared between processes and make the paths which bypass the oom killer
oom reapable and therefore much more reliable finally.  Even though mm
shared outside of thread group is rare (either vforked tasks for a short
period, use_mm by kernel threads or exotic thread model of
clone(CLONE_VM) without CLONE_SIGHAND) it is better to cover them.  Not
only it makes the current oom killer logic quite hard to follow and
reason about it can lead to weird corner cases.  E.g.  it is possible to
select an oom victim which shares the mm with unkillable process or
bypass the oom killer even when other processes sharing the mm are still
alive and other weird cases.

Patch 1 drops bogus task_lock and mm check from oom_{score_}adj_write.
This can be considered a bug fix with a low impact as nobody has noticed
for years.

Patch 2 drops sighand lock because it is not needed anymore as pointed
by Oleg.

Patch 3 is a clean up of oom_score_adj handling and a preparatory work
for later patches.

Patch 4 enforces oom_adj_score to be consistent between processes
sharing the mm to behave consistently with the regular thread groups.
This can be considered a user visible behavior change because one thread
group updating oom_score_adj will affect others which share the same mm
via clone(CLONE_VM).  I argue that this should be acceptable because we
already have the same behavior for threads in the same thread group and
sharing the mm without signal struct is just a different model of
threading.  This is probably the most controversial part of the series,
I would like to find some consensus here.  There were some suggestions
to hook some counter/oom_score_adj into the mm_struct but I feel that
this is not necessary right now and we can rely on proc handler +
oom_kill_process to DTRT.  I can be convinced otherwise but I strongly
think that whatever we do the userspace has to have a way to see the
current oom priority as consistently as possible.

Patch 5 makes sure that no vforked task is selected if it is sharing the
mm with oom unkillable task.

Patch 6 ensures that all user tasks sharing the mm are killed which in
turn makes sure that all oom victims are oom reapable.

Patch 7 guarantees that task_will_free_mem will always imply reapable
bypass of the oom killer.

Patch 8 is new in this version and it addresses an issue pointed out by
0-day OOM report where an oom victim was reaped several times.

Patch 9 puts an upper bound on how many times oom_reaper tries to reap a
task and hides it from the oom killer to move on when no progress can be
made.  This will give an upper bound to how long an oom_reapable task
can block the oom killer from selecting another victim if the oom_reaper
is not able to reap the victim.

Patch 10 tries to plug the (hopefully) last hole when we can still lock
up when the oom victim is shared with oom unkillable tasks (kthreads and
global init).  We just try to be best effort in that case and rather
fallback to kill something else than risk a lockup.

This patch (of 10):

Both oom_adj_write and oom_score_adj_write are using task_lock, check for
task->mm and fail if it is NULL.  This is not needed because the
oom_score_adj is per signal struct so we do not need mm at all.  The code
has been introduced by 3d5992d2ac7d ("oom: add per-mm oom disable count")
but we do not do per-mm oom disable since c9f01245b6a7 ("oom: remove
oom_disable_count").

The task->mm check is even not correct because the current thread might
have exited but the thread group might be still alive - e.g.  thread group
leader would lead that echo $VAL > /proc/pid/oom_score_adj would always
fail with EINVAL while /proc/pid/task/$other_tid/oom_score_adj would
succeed.  This is unexpected at best.

Remove the lock along with the check to fix the unexpected behavior and
also because there is not real need for the lock in the first place.

Improved Ritual descriptions (et al) (#1761)

* Updated book to match v3.0.4-9.

did a general quality pass, removed extranious $(item) tags where $(l:) tags were already being used, added a page for the explosive charges, added a description of blood transfer to and from the blood altar, added a 2x soulforge template, removed progress bar (for now)

* added changelog

also added links from the changelog to various relevant pages in the book, and added anchors accordingly.

* Update manual to 3.0.6-11

updated changelog, added page for Well of Suffering, rewrote entry on Explosive Charges, slightly tweaked the Anointments to better describe how they wear off, added a $(blood) tag to the manual (same colour as $(fire) so we can talk about Blood more dramatically. This is BLOOD magic after all! (Note, make sure this works - the word 'blood' in the Well of Suffering should be red.

* Improved Ritual Descriptions & Wills

Added links to a few things, formatted some bits to be prettier, elaborated on Fire Fuse, explained that benefits that improve with more Will in the aura don't care about other aspects,

* fixed overlapping URLs

might be a temporary fix until patchouli solves this bug on their end, but the 'NOT YET IMPLEMENTED' link was previously running-over into the clickable area for 'demon will'. Moving it to a new line should solve this.

* Anointments work on Explosives

... unless they don't, that is... Way, be sure to remove the bit for 'looting' working on charges if you can't crack that problem. (I've got faith in you, so i've left it in for now!)

* misc fixes

Cutting Fluid works with the Ritual of the Crusher, and the Self Sacrifice bonus is +150%, not 150%.
