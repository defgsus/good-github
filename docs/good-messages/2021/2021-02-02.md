LOLCOWS 

I can't even make this up. She ended up on the LOLCOWS website. I have no clue who put her up there, but the poor misguided soul tried. They failed terribly but they tried. And the trolls converged. All I can say is about 2am in the wee hours of Sunday morning I was trying to not laugh so hard to wake my darling husband up or my children.  I am ever so thankful my husband can sleep through anything and so can my children. Their comments were outrageous, I have a new love for Adam Driver, and I have never seen the Dibney Cru screen grab that many crazy comments that face in my time knowing them. Kudo's to the trolls at LOLCOWS, they kept a few of us awake past what can be called our bed times.

But Emily took them seriously. Thought they were her friends, even went as far as to make them a discord so they could keep trolling her, named it Anti-Troll HQ(Yes sir, Anti-Troll HQ filled with LOLCOWS Trolls) and even gave her speech like she was some important official. We all pretty well died laughing when she tried to get them to go after all of us. Though I will say getting the discord notice that the Trollorist forum had seen 41 hits at 4:30am Sunday Morning from Aislinn was hysterical to say the least. No one posted up on the forums, but they showed up, and did nothing. Not a single thing. Guess their "Queen" was just not that commanding.

Aevum Discord Server Pt 1

I am not even going to summarize this. I will quote a lovely woman that I know and adore "Ooof, that Discord RP is painful to read, my brain itches."
Another one who is truly a goddess to her generation put "My god this whole thing is a clusterfuck. Her "races" include jobs and things that don't have to do with races. Some are listed multiple times, the only ones that have any amount of explanation are her ridiculous custom races like "lava mermaid". Oh god, she did the sim lore in what she thinks is Shakespearean Rhyme." 
"Her RP is a mist of tons of different stories. She's all over the place." I quote another.
"Yeah, which is why I think its hilarious she compares every sim and says they were inspired by her and everyone wants to steal her ideas."

I heard that a few times from her mouth. Trying to claim COV's ideas as her own and a few others. Thankfully no one else has to listen to that business because again, she has been banned.

New data: 2021-02-01: DATA RECENTLY CHANGED. SEE NOTES.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

Revise historical data: cases (AB, BC, MB, ON, QC, SK).

SK did not provide testing data today. They also did not update their usual daily case CSV.

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “The data also report 32 new deaths, for a total of 9,826. Among these 32 deaths, 14 have occurred in the last 24 hours, 16 have occurred between January 25 and January 30 and 2 have occurred before January 25.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

gdb/dwarf: split dwarf2_cu::ranges_base in two

Consider the test case added in this patch.  It defines a compilation
unit with a DW_AT_rnglists_base attribute (used for attributes of form
DW_FORM_rnglistx), but also uses DW_AT_ranges of form
DW_FORM_sec_offset:

    0x00000027: DW_TAG_compile_unit
                  DW_AT_ranges [DW_FORM_sec_offset] (0x0000004c
                     [0x0000000000005000, 0x0000000000006000))
                  DW_AT_rnglists_base [DW_FORM_sec_offset]  (0x00000044)

The DW_AT_rnglists_base does not play a role in reading the DW_AT_ranges of
form DW_FORM_sec_offset, but it should also not do any harm.

This case is currently not handled correctly by GDB.  This is not
something that a compiler is likely to emit, but in my opinion there's
no reason why GDB should fail reading it.

The problem is that in partial_die_info::read and a few other places
where the same logic is replicated, the cu->ranges_base value,
containing the DW_AT_rnglists_base value, is wrongfully added to the
DW_AT_ranges value.

It is quite messy how to decide whether cu->ranges_base should be added
to the attribute's value or not.  But to summarize, the only time we
want to add it is when the attribute comes from a pre-DWARF 5 split unit
file (a .dwo) [1].  In this case, the DW_AT_ranges attribute from the
split unit file will have form DW_FORM_sec_offset, pointing somewhere in
the linked file's .debug_ranges section.  *But* it's not a "true"
DW_FORM_sec_offset, in that it's an offset relative to the beginning of
that CU's contribution in the section, not relative to the beginning of
the section.  So in that case, and only that case, do we want to add the
ranges base value, which we found from the DW_AT_GNU_ranges_base
attribute on the skeleton unit.

Almost all instances of the DW_AT_ranges attribute will be found in the
split unit (on DW_TAG_subprogram, for example), and therefore need to
have the ranges base added.  However, the DW_TAG_compile_unit DIE in the
skeleton may also have a DW_AT_ranges attribute.  For that one, the
ranges base must not be added.  Once the DIEs have been loaded in GDB,
however, the distinction between what's coming from the skeleton and
what's coming from the split unit is not clear.  It is all merged in one
big happy tree.  So how do we know if a given attribute comes from the
split unit or not?

We use the fact that in pre-DWARF 5 split DWARF, DW_AT_ranges is found
on the skeleton's DW_TAG_compile_unit (in the linked file) and never in
the split unit's DW_TAG_compile_unit.  This is why you have this in
partial_die_info::read:

      int need_ranges_base = (tag != DW_TAG_compile_unit
			      && attr.form != DW_FORM_rnglistx);

However, with the corner case described above (where we have a
DW_AT_rnglists_base attribute and a DW_AT_ranges attribute of form
DW_FORM_sec_offset) the condition gets it wrong when it encounters an
attribute like DW_TAG_subprogram with a DW_AT_ranges attribute of
DW_FORM_sec_offset form: it thinks that it is necessary to add the base,
when it reality it is not.

The problem boils down to failing to differentiate these cases:

  - a DW_AT_ranges attribute of form DW_FORM_sec_offset in a
    pre-DWARF 5 split unit (in which case we need to add the base)
  - a DW_AT_ranges attribute of form DW_FORM_sec_offset in a DWARF 5
    non-split unit (in which case we must not add the base)

What makes it unnecessarily complex is that the cu->ranges_base field is
overloaded, used to hold the pre-DWARF 5, non-standard
DW_AT_GNU_ranges_base and the DWARF 5 DW_AT_rnglists_base.  In reality,
these two are called "bases" but are not the same thing.  The result is
that we need twisted conditions to try to determine whether or not we
should add the base to the attribute's value.

To fix it, split the field in two distinct fields.  I renamed everything
related to the "old" ranges base to "gnu_ranges_base", to make it clear
that it's about the non-standard, pre-DWARF 5 thing.  And everything
related to the DWARF 5 thing gets renamed "rnglists".  I think it
becomes much easier to reason this way.

The issue described above gets fixed by the fact that the
DW_AT_rnglists_base value does not end up in cu->gnu_ranges_base, so
cu->gnu_ranges_base stays 0.  The condition to determine whether
gnu_ranges_base should be added can therefore be simplified back to:

  tag != DW_TAG_compile_unit

... as it was before rnglistx support was added.

Extend the gdb.dwarf2/rnglists-sec-offset.exp to cover this case.  I
also extended the test case for loclists similarly, just to see if there
would be some similar problem.  There wasn't, but I think it's not a bad
idea to test that case for loclists as well, so I left it in the patch.

Fixed image size but + added color, size options

I found a annoying bug in the image sizing stuff. Basically, the size
settings weren't doing anything because matplotlib is kinda stupid. If
you modify any of its settings before initializing a figure with a
specified size, then matplotlib ignores all sizing parameters when you
do eventually create an image (but, of course, it doesn't tell you that
it's doing that... because why the hell would you want to know that?
It's python, it decides for you because it knows best. So PyHoNiC).
Any way, I fixed that bug by rearranging a few lines.

I also added options to specify the color list and line size list.
These should have been parameters a long time ago... oh well, they are
now.

Fix Catalyst text rendering by disabling inappropriate subpixel-antialiasing (#29609)

Summary:
I noticed when porting my iOS app to macOS via Catalyst that the text rendering was somewhat different on the two platforms. Text looked blurry and over-weight on macOS, even when disabling the Catalyst scaling transform.

I hazily remembered that I'd seen this problem before in my old Cocoa development days: this kind of blurring occurs when rendering text with sub-pixel anti-aliasing into an offscreen buffer which will then be traditionally composited, because when the SPAA algorithm attempts to blend with the underlying content (i.e. in the offscreen buffer), there isn't any. SPAA is disabled on iOS, so the issue wouldn't appear there. On macOS, typical approachs to displaying text (e.g. `CATextLayer`) normally disable SPAA, since it's been incompatible with the platform's compositing strategy since the transition to layer-backed views some years ago. But React Native uses `NSLayoutManager` to rasterize text (rather than relying on the system render server via `CATextLayer`), and that class doesn't touch the context's font smoothing bit before drawing.

This change makes macOS/Catalyst text rendering consistent with iOS text rendering by disabling SPAA.

It appears that the code I've modified is in the process of being refactored (for Fabric?). It looks like [this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/8d6b41e9bcede07fb627d57cf6c11050ae590d57/ReactCommon/react/renderer/textlayoutmanager/platform/ios/RCTTextLayoutManager.mm#L111) is the corresponding place in the new code (sammy-SC, is that right?). I'm happy to include a change to the new renderer in this patch if someone can point me at how to test that change.

## Changelog

[iOS] [Fixed] - Improved text rendering on macOS Catalyst

Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/29609

Test Plan:
1. Prepare RNTester for running on macOS (or apply [this patch](https://gist.github.com/andymatuschak/d0f5b4fc1a28efc4f860801aa1deddcd) to handle parts 1 and 2, but you'll still need to do part 3):
   1. Open the workspace, navigate to the `RNTester` target's configuration, and check the "Mac" checkbox under "Deployment Info.
   2. Flipper doesn't yet compile for Catalyst (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/27845), so you must disable it by: a) commenting out `use_flipper!` and `flipper_post_install` in the Podfile, then running `pod install`; and b) removing the `FB_SONARKIT_ENABLED` preprocessor flags in the Xcode project.
   3. macOS has different signing rules from iOS; you must set a development team in the "Signing & Capabilities" tab of the `RNTester` target configuration pane. Unfortunately, you must also do this in the `Pods` project for the `React-Core-AccessibilityResources` target ([this is an issue which CocoaPods must fix](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/8891)).
2. Run RNTester with and without the patch. You'll see that the font hinting is overweight without the patch; see screenshots below (incorrect rendering above, correct rendering below; note that fonts still remain slightly blurred because of Catalyst's window scaling transform, but that's removed on Big Sur).

Tweak our Copy until it's _just_ right

Let's take an interesting idea, and do it in least surprising way that
we can.

Storing translations outside of `config/locales/en.yml`
---

Under the hood, Rails relies on the [`ruby-i18n/i18n`
gem][ruby-i18n/i18n] for determining translations' text. Without any
additional configuration, Rails employs an instance of
`I18n::Backends::SimpleBackend`. In this case, <q>simple</q> is
analogous for reading from the filesystem. The definitions we've
declared thus far have been made in our project's
`config/locales/en.yml`. During the application's boot process, the
`SimpleBackend` reads the contents of that file, parses the YAML into an
instance of a [`Hash`][Hash], and stores it in-memory.

Let's imagine that we'd like to change a key's translation.

> No problem! Let's write a new value to that key in the `Hash`.

This seems appealing at first, but there are some unfortunate quirks to
consider. Since the value is store in-memory, modifications to that
value would be lost on server restarts, and would be inaccessible from
_other_ server processes.

In the world of [horizontally scalable
infrastructure][horizontal-scalability] and [load balancing][], servers
are restarted constantly, and there are no guarantees that subsequent
requests are served by the same [application process][process].

> If the value is stored on the filesystem, let's change the
> contents of the file.

Unfortunately, the `I18n::Backends::SimpleBackend` eager-loads the
contents of the translation file once (and only once) during the
application's boot process, so subsequent changes to the file go
un-read.

Calling `I18n::Backend::SimpleBackend#reload!` re-parses the YAML file,
but any changes would be local to that server process, which runs afoul
of horizontal scalability and load balancing.

> This sounds like a problem for some sort of data persistence layer…

Fortunately, the [ruby-i18n/i18n][] project provides integrations for
alternate backends. [I18n::PostgresJson][] is an `I18n::Backend`
implementation that reads from and writes to [Postgres JSON and JSONB
columns][]:

> [PostgreSQL's][pg] support for storing objects as [JSON and JSONB
> columns][pg-json], integrated with `ActiveRecord` column-aware
> models makes it an ideal candidate to store dynamic, editable
> application translation text.

Within the [`config/initializers/i18n.rb`](#config/initializers/i18n.rb)

translation key.

Combine the two backends via a [`I18n::Backends::Chain`
instance][i18n-chain]. The `I18n::PostgresJson` backend serves as an
editable data source layered on top of the foundational
`I18::Backends::Simple` defaults:

Outside of configuring the `I18n.backend` and declaring a correctly
structured database table (included as a `I18n::PostgresJson`-generated
database migration), there are no additional requirements. We can
continue to transparently call `translate` in our views, oblivious to
the translations source of data.

The `Translation` model
---

The `I18n::Backend::Chain` adheres to the same interface as other
`I18n::Backend` classes. Its `store_translations(locale, data,
**options)` implementation adheres to the same order of precedence as
when writing values as its `#translate` method does when reading values.
In our case, a call to `I18n.backend.store_translation` will write to
the `I18n::PostgresJson::Backend` first.

Reading and writing values to and from a database (SQL or otherwise) is
something that Rails (`ActiveModel` and `ActiveRecord`, specifically)
excels at.

This commit introduces the `Translation` class. It's a model class that
_is not_ backed by `ActiveRecord::Base`. The `I18n.backend` instance
provides a means of writing to the correct data source with the exact
structure needed. With this access to this method, there's no value in
interfacing directly with PostgreSQL via `ActiveRecord`. However, there
is value in an `ActiveRecord`-like interface for reading, writing, and
validating attributes. To get the best of both worlds, the `Translation`
class mixes in the [`ActiveModel::Model`][am-model] and
[`ActiveModel::Attributes`][am-attributes] modules.

The data integrity of our translations is crucial. To preserve that
integrity, the `Translation` model declares several `ActiveModel`
validations.

For example, reject `nil` or empty values. Since the PostgresSQL-backed
translations are layer _on top of_ the translations declared in the YAML
file, reject any `Translation#key` value that _does not already exist_
in our set of resolvable keys.

Once deemed valid, calls to `Translation#save` will persist the changes
by invoking `I18n.backend.store_translations` &emdash; with one final
quirk. To keep the scope of our first foray into copyediting tight and
to limit exposure to various Cross-Site Scripting (<abrr
title="Cross-Site Scripting">XSS</abbr>) vulnerabilities, limit the
translations to _plain text only_ by wrapping calls to
`Translation#value` with calls to  `ActionText::Content#to_plain_text`
to **strip out any HTML**:

```ruby
def value
  content = ActionText::Content.new(super)

  content.to_plain_text
end
```

The `TranslationsController` class
---

Backed by our `I18n::Backends::Chain`, our `Translation` class serves as
a Model  (the <abbr title="Model>M</abbr> in Rails'
Model-View-Controller <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>)
paradigm. The remaining two-thirds of the work will be done in our
application's View (the <abbr title="View">V</abbr>) and Controller (the
<abbr title="Controller">C</abbr>) layers.

We'll be managing changes to our Model by responding to HTTP requests
that are routed to our Controllers.

The new `TranslationsController` class draws inspiration from an example
in the [i18n-postgres_json README file][i18n-edit-example] and
transforms `locale`, `key`, and `value` parameters into `Translation`
instances. Once the model instance is constructed, the controller
attempts to update the translation by calling `Translation#save`.

[i18n-edit-example]: https://github.com/seanpdoyle/i18n-postgres_json#writing-to-the-tables

The [`translations/form`](#app/views/translations/_form.html.erb) View partial
---

The final missing piece of the puzzle is our View layer (the <abbr
title="View">V</abbr> of <abbr
title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>). The `<form>` element that we
construct submits a `POST /translations` request with all the
constituent parts of a `Translation`: its `locale`, `key`, and `value`.

When passed a block, Rails' `translate` helper [yields the translation
_and_ the fully qualified translation key][translate] as [block
arguments][].

For example, when calling `translate(".hero.title")` with a block from
the `marketings#index` template, the value of the `key` block parameter
is `marketings.index.hero.title`. When we render our translations using
the "lazy" keys, we can access their fully-qualified counterparts
through block arguments.

For calls to `translate` that we want to be able to edit, invoke them as
a call to `editable.translate`. The `editable.translate` helper
delegates to an instance of the `Editable` class, which decorates calls
to `#translate` so that they accept a block.

Within the block, use the fully qualified translation key to construct a
`<form action="/translations" method="post">` element that contains the
`key` encoded as an [`<input type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden].

The submission's `locale` value can be inferred from the [current
request-local value of `I18n.locale`][i18n-locale], and is also encoded
as an [`<input type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden], invisible to
the user.

Ideally, the `<form>` elements for `value` would serve double duty:
presenting an field to edit the translation text when in focus, and
rendering the contents of the translation text otherwise.

Visual parity between those two modes is achievable, but due to the
subtle differences in how CSS rules are applied to certain [Flow Content
elements][flow-content] and [Form-associated Content
elements][form-associated-content], it could become tedious to do so.

Luckily, browser support for the [`[contenteditable]`
attribute][contenteditable] renders controls for editing content in the
same context and styles it's rendered within normally.

Trix-powered Rich Text
---

[Trix is <q cite="https://github.com/basecamp/trix#trix">a Rich Text
Editor for Everyday Writing</q>][trix]. It serves as a progressive
enhancement to `[contenteditable]`, and is a tool under the Ruby on
Rails umbrella [since the introduction of the ActionText portion of the
framework][action-text].

While Trix is a fully-featured, HTML-capable <dfn id="wysiwyg">What you
See is What you Get (<abbr title="What you See is What you
Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>) editor</dfn>, it's utility comes in the form its
ability to edit already styled content in-context.

Under the hood, [calls to `rich_text_area_tag`][rich_text_area_tag]
produce a `<trix-editor>` element along with a corresponding [`<input
type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden] that serves as its form-local
value storage.

On initialization, `<trix-editor>` elements construct their own
`<trix-toolbar>` elements to wrap a collection of `<button>` elements
that are wired-up to modify the `<trix-editor>` selected contents.

In our use case, we _don't_ want to support anything more sophisticated
than plain text, so we add `trix-toolbar`-specific CSS rules to style
those elements with `display: none;`.

It's important that we don't _entirely_ disable the `<trix-toolbar>`
element, since there are two custom actions we'd like to support:
canceling an edit and saving an edit. To implement these actions, we'll
declare the `<button>` elements in the [`translations/form` partial's
HTML](#app/views/translations/_form.html.erb) as descendants of the
`<trix-toolbar>` element, and ensure that the `<trix-editor
toolbar="...">` attribute references the `<trix-toolbar id="...">`
attribute. On the initial page load, ensure the toolbar is hidden by
declaring it with the [`[hidden]` attribute][hidden].

To handle interactions withing the `<trix-editor>` element and its
`<trix-toolbar>`, declare the [`trix-form` Stimulus
Controller](#app/javascript/controllers/trix_form_controller.js), and
ensure that our [`<form>` element declares it as part of its
`[data-controller="trix-form"]` attribute][data-controller].

When [the controller attaches behavior to the `<form>`
element][connect], ensure that the `<trix-toolbar>` is visually hidden
by ensuring it declares [`hidden = true`][hidden-property].

To declare the rest of its behavior, build the `<form>` element with
various [Stimulus-specific `data-action` values][data-action]:

```diff
--- /dev/null
+++ b/app/views/translations/_form.html.erb
@@ -0,0 +1,44 @@
+<%= form_with model: translation, class: "relative", data: {
+  controller: "trix-form",
+  action: "
+    trix-file-accept->trix-form#reject
+    trix-focus@document->trix-form#dismissDismissUnlessFocused
+    click@document->trix-form#dismissUnlessContained
+    focusout->trix-form#dismissUnlessContained
+    reset->trix-form#dismiss
+  "
+} do |form| %>
```

Each line routes a DOM event to an action declared in the `trix-form`
controller:

```diff
+    trix-focus@document->trix-form#dismissDismissUnlessFocused
```

The `@document` portion of the action routing declaration declares a
[`trix-focus` event listener][trix-focus] on the `document`, instead of
the `<form>` element. This means that whenever any of the
`<trix-editor>` elements receive focus, _all_ of the `trix-form`
controllers will respond to the event. This means that we can hide all
the `trix-toolbar` elements _except for the editor with focus_ within a
single action declaration.

```diff
+    trix-file-accept->trix-form#reject
```

This `trix-file-accept` event listener routes events to an action that
invokes [`event.preventDefault()`][preventDefault], effectively
cancelling any file attachment attempts.

The other routing declarations will dismiss the toolbar when the
`<form>` element is reset (via the `reset` event), focus
leaves the editor (via the `focusout` event), or a mouse `click` event
fires anywhere outside of the `<trix-editor>` or `<trix-toolbar>`
element.

Testing the interactions
---

For each concept introduced here (i.e. the `Translation` class, the
`TranslationsController` class, the `translations/form` view partial,
and the Trix editor integration) is tested in turn at its corresponding
layer of the [Testing Pyramid][]:

![The Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/testPyramid.png)

The `Translation` model is covered by a unit test, the
`TranslationsController` is covered by a [service-level integration
test][ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest], and the `translations/form` view
partial and the rest of the Trix behavior is covered by an [end-to-end
System Test][System Test].

In order to ensure that each test is run with test-specific data, the
`#with_translations` test helper accepts a set of translations and a
block, and ensures that those translations are only available _within
the block's scope of execution_.

I went with the simple option - just open the Terminal with the default profile in the selected directory. I'd love to add another entry for "Open Terminal here with Profile...", but that's going to be follow-up work, once we sort out pulling the Terminal Settings into their own dll.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

This adds a COM class that implements `IExplorerCommand`, which is what lets us populate the context menu entry. We expose that type through a new DLL that is simply responsible for the shell extension, so that explorer doesn't need to load the entire Terminal just to populate that entry.

The COM class is tied to the application through some new entries in the manifest. The Clsid values are IMPORTANT - they must match the UUID of the implementation type. However, the `Verb` in the manifest didn't seem important.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
Please note, I'm a non-practicing C++ developer, there are a number of things I wasn't sure how to handle in the appropriate fashion, mostly around error handling and what probably looks like an incredibly naive (and messy) way to implement the async co_await behavior. 

Error handling-wise, I found (don't ask me how!) that if you somehow mismatch the startup task's ID between the manifest and the call to `StartupTask::GetAsync(hstring taskId)`, you'll get a very opaque WinRT exception that boils down to a generic invalid argument message. This isn't likely to happen in the wild, but worth mentioning...

I had enough trouble getting myself familiarized with the project, environment, and C++/WinRT in general didn't want to try to tackle adding tests for this quite yet since (as I mentioned) I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm happy to give it a try with perhaps a bit of assistance in getting started 😃 

Further work in this area of the application outside of this immediate PR might need to include adding an additional setting to contain launch args that the startup task can pass to the app so that users can specify a non-default profile to launch on start, window position (e.g., #653).

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed

✔️ Default settings:
Given the user does not have the `startOnUserLogin` setting in their profile.json,
When the default settings are opened (via alt+click on Settings), 
Then the global settings should contain the `"startOnUserLogin": false` token

✔️ Applying setting on application launch
Given the `startOnUserLogin` is `true` and 
  the `Windows Terminal` startup task is `disabled` and 
  the application is not running
When the application is launched
Then the `Windows Terminal` entry in the user's Startup list should be `enabled`

✔️ Applying setting on settings change
Given the `startOnUserLogin` is `true` and
  the `Windows Terminal` startup task is `enabled` and
  the application is running
When the `startOnUserLogin` setting is changed to `false` and
  the settings file is saved to disk
Then the `Windows Terminal` startup task entry should be `disabled`

✔️ Setting is ignored when user has manually disabled startup
Given the `startOnUserLogin` is `true` and
  the application is not running and
  the `Windows Terminal` startup task has been set to `disabled` via user action
When the application is launched
Then the startup task should remain disabled and
  the application should not throw an exception

#### note: Task Manager does not seem to re-scan startup task states after launch; the Settings -> Apps -> Startup page also requires closing or moving away to refresh the status of entries

lib/xref: work around GCC bug 41091

gcc fucks up global variables with section attributes when they're used
in templated C++ code.  The template instantiation "magic" kinda breaks
down (it's implemented through COMDAT in the linker, which clashes with
the section attribute.)

The workaround provides full runtime functionality, but the xref
extraction tool (xrelfo.py) won't work on C++ code compiled by GCC.

FWIW, clang gets this right.
