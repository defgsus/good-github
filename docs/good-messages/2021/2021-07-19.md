ConquerUI: notch-city: Add 3 mode display cutout handler [2/3]
[@AgentFabulous - POSP]
- Introduces the HideCutout and StatusBarStock overlay used in the
  3 mode display cutout handler. The HideCutout overlay is necessary
  since we can't register a content observer in the display manager code.
  We only have access to resources during boot. Thus, leave this as an
  overlay and let the config and overlay change methods handle this.
  Though we can probably do statusbar stock height toggling in the
  SystemUI code without overlays, I kinda got lazy by the end, just
  live with it god damn it xD

Initialize static variable from static method instead of static block - rollback

@dbwiddis I'm so sorry. It's my mistake.
Before some day, I wrote some unit test for unsupported environment as blow for ensure unsupported platform.
At that time this class didn't have check logic.
```java
ReflectionUtil.setFinalFieldValue(
  SystemInfo::class.java,
  SystemInfo::class.java.getDeclaredField("currentPlatform"),
  PlatformEnum.UNKNOWN
)
OSCompatibleCentralProcessor.getProcessorIfPossible() shouldBe null
```
I should have been recovered currentPlatform forcibly before.
After remove above code, everything worked expectedly.
This MR just include rollback to before.

I appreciate you hear my opinion although my mistake.
And I want say again sorry for my mistake.

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/strong-password/problem

Louise joined a social networking site to stay in touch with her friends. The signup page required her to input a name and a password. However, the password must be strong. The website considers a password to be strong if it satisfies the following criteria:

Its length is at least .
It contains at least one digit.
It contains at least one lowercase English character.
It contains at least one uppercase English character.
It contains at least one special character. The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()-+
She typed a random string of length  in the password field but wasn't sure if it was strong. Given the string she typed, can you find the minimum number of characters she must add to make her password strong?

Note: Here's the set of types of characters in a form you can paste in your solution:

numbers = "0123456789"
lower_case = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
upper_case = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
special_characters = "!@#$%^&*()-+"
Example


This password is 5 characters long and is missing an uppercase and a special character. The minimum number of characters to add is .

Updates today :-)


Today we have 5164 streams in the ZZ_Playlist. :-)

We have one of the best repo with LEGAL and FREE streams. No pay-tv, no PAID-TV and we are on again.
That we are on again, a few very special guys were afraid of exactly that. Instead of working together, they then rather agitated 

against FREE-IPTV!

Some changes in (is our answer to the hate postings):

AU01_AUSTRALIA
CA01_CANADA
NZ01_NEWZEALAND
UK01_UNITED_KINGDOM

Only black humour! Haha... We¬¥re  not attacking anyone,we ONLY responding to the smear campaign still going on by these 

idiots! Here it goes on all the time: https://whrl.pl/RgipBk

Updates without humour:

UK02_UNITED_KINGDOM_Pluto
No all streams in again

YZ001_MUSIC
Update stream: XTV Music HD (CL), Thanks to Tom!

YZ002_WEBCAMS
Update stream: Amsterdam (NL) YT

If any stream doesn¬¥t work, please write an issue.

Have a good start in the new week! :-)

Compilation Try

C++ Compilation is a nightmare. It's incredible how impossible it is to do arrange your code freely. The Compiler is a real piece of garbage, and you need to think through all your damn files, to make sure he's able to speak the same damn language as you. This is completely fucking annoying.

Allow optional argument to be erased in Dhcp_server.make. (#111)

* Allow optional argument to be erased in Dhcp_server.make.

Changes public API, might will break users.

* maxleasetime -> max-lease-time like ISC dhcpd.conf.

* Fix handling of DHCPRELEASE, DHCPDECLINE probably still broken.

RELEASE doesn't have a request ip, the interesting address is in pkt.ciaddr.
Can't really test decline, but this improves the current situation at least.

* Rewrite server lease database and fix a bunch of bugs.

The double reference between old Id_map and Addr_map is too confusing and prone
to mistakes, this rewrites so that Addr_map now only gives a Client_id and
Lease_map gives a Lease.t.

Instead of trying to recycle old leases on the fly and introducing unecessary
complications, just remove it all over. Code gets considerably simpler and the
caller is responsible for calling Lease.garbage_collect once in a while.

Expired leases are kept even if expire, if a client does a discover later on, it
might re-active/renew the old lease, this is desirable since he gets to have his
same old ip back.

Fix a bug where the server *MUST NOT* ack a lease during INIT-REBOOT, it should
remain silent, it should ack only when SELECTING or RENEW/REBIDING. With this
every ack becomes a lease renew, so we don't need the extra logic of ack ~renew.

* Garbage collect in charruad.

Once every minute try to prune old leases. This should be configurable in the
future. No need for a timer, use packet input as a tick.

* Write pid file in charruad.

/run is what linux uses theses days, can and probably should be modified via -p.

* Implement -u/--user and -g/--group in charruad.

Forcing people to run as _charruad is bad.

* Shut opam-dune-lint up.

* opam: bump lower ocaml bound to 4.08 (module Int in stdlib)

* Remove sanity_check from Dhcp_server.replace.

Code is good, have some faith brother.

Fixed UI a bit and built game

As the leader from Davao collapses on the ground, his loyal aide rushes to his side. ‚ÄúDuterte-sama...‚Äù said Bong Go.
He held him in his arms, cradling him close to his beating heart. Thump-thump-thump it went. He looked at his face, almost as if he was trying to memorize each and every crack. ‚ÄúThe years have not been kind to Duterte-sama‚Äù he thought.
Duterte coughed up crimson
Tears fell from Bong‚Äôs eyes, ‚ÄúStay with me daddy, come on, remember our plans‚Äù tears running down his supple, rose colored cheeks, smegma running down his chin onto his barong. He held Dutertes face, blood move over his hand, the thick fluid no warmer or cooler than his own skin. Those moments he spent pleading with Duterte to look at him, to stay with him, feeling the very fluid of Dut‚Äôs life drain away over his cold hands.
Duterte looked at his hand. What had once flowed thick and scarlet in his veins was clasped in his callused fingers.
The clouds are churlish and kraken-cruel. They cough out great gouts of water and thunking balloons of sopping moisture. A tinkling sound came to Bong‚Äôs ears as the first pearls of rain dropped onto the leaves. The sound was like the glassy clinking of a champagne flute, lilting and clear. A sheet of rain passed over them and the sound intensified. It wasn‚Äôt the soft, sodden, swollen drops of spring he was hearing; it was like ball-bearings were hitting the canvas roof with force. The smell of the first rains after a dry spell, rises like a miasma. Water mixes with blood and smegma.
It was as if the heavens were crying
‚ÄúCome back to me, Duterte.... daddy, please I have a lot to say‚Äù
Duterte coughs, it was loose and wet, like thick phlemy mucus was sliding up and down his throat with each violent expulsion of air.
The veerus had taken a lot from Duterte. Never had a few moments deliberation seemed like an eternity as he felt his consciousness ebbing away, and his thoughts, as clear and concise as they were mere moments ago, were coming to an end.
‚ÄúBong...‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, no.... Please smile for me.... Don‚Äôt cry.‚Äú Duterte caresses Bong‚Äôs dimple and gave him a smile.
‚ÄúBong, i may have had many partners through out my career, but do you know who was my greatest partner?‚Äù
‚ÄúWho‚Äù
With his last breath he whispered into Bong‚Äôs ear
‚ÄúXi‚Äù
Duterte closes his eyes as he imagines the face of the glorious leader of the people‚Äôs republic.

Update most images that did not have known provenance

There are not that many images on the web site, but the provenance of
many of them was unknown.

The various images of antennas and cables on the HDTV Antennas page
have all been replaced with pictures that I have personally taken and
have released with the CC0 license.

The website's logo (the image in the oval at the top right of every
page) and the favicon have been replaced with a scan of watercolor
painted by Kim Miller that she has graciously allowed us to use:
  Please find attached a copy of my painting ‚ÄúHeceta morning by the Sea‚Äù.
  I hereby give you the right to use it for the Western Lane TV website
  and you may alter it in any way you have a need to.

The Siuslaw News previously given us permission to use the newspaper
images on the History page with the following credit:
  Courtesy of The Siuslaw News www.thesiuslawnews.com

The image on the HDTV Coverage map was generated by me via a website
and has the appropriate credits embedded in the image.

The only other image on the site is the picture of the tower on the
Leasing page.  I have to assume that whoever took it must be a member
and has allowed its presence on the website.
