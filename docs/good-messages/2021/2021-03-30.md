yeah boy more things

Added tag aliases, make their shitty and buffed divisions (hoping to add things like desicions to make more divisions later on) and more

Add files via upload

For starters, I love the layout of R Markdown, even though its just a document. I personally have experience with code using R Markdown, my intro to data mining class's assignments all used R Markdown format. The way its styled is clean and pleasing to the eye.

New data: 2021-03-29. See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (MB, ON, QC).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “5 new deaths, but the total of deaths amounts to 10,651, due to the withdrawal of 1 death not attributable to COVID-19: 2 deaths in the last 24 hours, 1 death between March 22 and March 27, 2 deaths before March 27.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

website: Fix style in 0.9.2 release notes

This commit fixes the style so the paragraph is not dedented and the
next item is not shown in the same line.

The first issue is "fixed" by just making it one paragraph, as no other
alternatives were found that worked correctly in hugo 0.57.0 (didn't
explored ugly hacks like manually indent, etc.).

The second issue (item in the wrong line) was reproduced locally with
hugo 0.57.0. It didn't happen with other newer hugo versions (tested
several >= 0.62.2 versions), however this patch is rendered correcly on
new and old hugo versions.

This patch was tested with hugo 0.57.0, as this was the only version I
found to render the site locally as similar as possible to the current
website. In particular, it renders the site with the horrible black
thing rendered when written like this[1], and properly includes the site
header logo (is not shown with newer hugo versions). However, some other
changes might be required if the production site is rendered using
another hugo version.

Fixes: #548

Implement ARMv7 support (untested)

ARM Thumb mode is the most evil thing ever conceived from a reverse
engineering point of view. Not only do you (and your disassembler) never
have a goddamn clue when the code is in Thumb mode or not (leading to
confusion and wrongly-disassembled instructions); but then if you want
to hack around with this code and actually interface with it, good luck
with that, because probably half the stuff will be in regular ARM ISA
and the other half will be in Thumb and it's just a giant inconsistent
mess.

You have no idea how happy I am that ARM made the highly intelligent
decision to NOT support the Thumb instruction set(s) in AArch64.
Dropping that shit was the best decision they ever made.

Update #13

Welp, as it turns out, I can't think or function when I'm this tired. I'm going to take a power nap and come back to it in the morning. There is just no feasible way for me at this point to get it done this night unfortunately. In this update, I added a little over half of the statuses of the countries. Things I have to do left is to add the rest of the statuses, the successful reports, and the end scene... Oooh boy. Probably should have asked for an extension for the project and the video rather than just the video... :(

[build] Add -Wformat-non-literal option

While this caused some trouble for pr_strings and configurable strftime
(evil hacks abound), it's the result of discovering an ancient (from
maybe as early as 2004, definitely before 2012) bug in qwaq's printing
that somehow got past months of trial-by-fire testing (origin understood
thanks to the warning finding it).

"1:55pm. Done with breakfast. Let me chill a little and then I will do the chores.

2:40pm. Let me resume.

```
terminal : game_state -> f64 -> r
```

I think I'll make this more explicit and put in the game state for each player.

```
terminal : game_state * game_state -> f64 -> r
```

```
    inl terminal ((p1 : player),(p2 : player),card) (i,r) =
        inl r = if i = 0 then r else -r
        inl p (x : player) = {x with pot#=(+) (if p1.id = 0 then r else -r)}
        inl p1, p2 = p p1, p p2
        terminal ((p1,p2,card),(p2,p1,card)) (f64 r)
```

This is the way things should be done.

3pm. Let me try it now.

...No wait. I need the pid.

```
    inl terminal ((p1 : player),(p2 : player),card) (i,r) =
        inl r = if i = 0 then r else -r
        inl p (x : player) = {x with pot#=(+) (if p1.id = 0 then r else -r)}
        inl p1, p2 = p p1, p p2
        inl p1, p2 = if i = 0 then p1,p2 else p2,p1
        terminal ((p1,p2,card),(p2,p1,card)) (f64 r)
```

Let me just add this. Now it should be proper.

Later I'll remove this fro the game itself as it would just do a bunch of meaningless processing.

But it does not matter either way. It is not going to turn into overhead. The main overhead will be NN training. 0.01% will be the actual game processing.

Let me try running this. Then I'll try setting the human player as p2.

Damn, it I get flipping in the terminal state again.

```
    inl terminal ~((p1 : player),(p2 : player),card) ~(i,r) =
        inl p1,p2 = join
            inl r = if i = 0 then r else -r
            inl p (x : player) = {x with pot#=(+) (if p1.id = 0 then r else -r)}
            inl p1, p2 = p p1, p p2
            if i = 0 then p1,p2 else p2,p1
        terminal ((p1,p2,card),(p2,p1,card)) (f64 r)
```

This is so annoying. How oculd I have possibly gone wrong here.

```
if p1.id = 0 then p1,p2 else p2,p1
```

Yeah, I got the condition wrong.

```
inl p (x : player) = {x with pot#=(+) (if x.id = 0 then r else -r)}
```

Here as well.

3:15pm. Wonderful job me. Let me try playing as p2.

```
    let human_dispatch (((p1,p2,card : leduc.game_state),(observations, r)),dist,next) =
        inl r =
            match r with
            | Some: r => Some: if p1.id = 0 then r else -r
            | None => None
        inl trace = agent.human.show_trace (observations,r)
```

I was wondering why I kept losing all the time. Turns out it was showing the wins and losses the other way around.

```
        inl r =
            match r with
            | Some: r => Some: if p1.id = 0 then r else -r
            | None => None
```

No wait, it is showing the wrong damn thing again.

```
    | Some: (r : f64) =>
        inl p = if i = 0 then "One" else "Two"
        if 0 < r then $"f\"Player {!p} wins {!r} chips.\\n\""
        elif 0 = r then $"f\"Player {!p} draws.\\n\""
        else inl r = -r in $"f\"Player {!p} loses {!r} chips.\\n\""
        |> r64.add ar
```

Let me do it like this. This should remove the confusion.

3:30pm. I am super confused.

```
    inl terminal ((p1 : player),(p2 : player),card) (i,r) =
        inl r = if i = 0 then r else -r
        inl p1,p2 =
            inl p (x : player) = {x with pot#=(+) (if x.id = 0 then r else -r)}
            inl p1, p2 = p p1, p p2
            if p1.id = 0 then p1,p2 else p2,p1
        terminal ((p1,p2,card),(p2,p1,card)) (f64 r)
```

Ah, I messed this up here.

3:35pm. Ok, now things are perfect. I can play as p2 with no problem.

Leduc poker - UI version is complete!

3:45pm. I am taking a short breather here. What should come next?

```
    player_funs {
        action = fun _ (p : _ stateless card action) opp_prob dist next => next (net (observations p) dist,state p)
        terminal = fun s p r => ()
        }
```

I am confused. Why are observations right here, but in the trace I had to reverse them?

```
    match listm.rev l with
    | Cons: (Observation: x), x' => action (x,Nil) x' |> listm.toArray
    | _ => failwith "Expected a card."
```

Ah, I am reversing them. Ok.

3:50pm. That is one mystery down.

3:55pm. Let me think a little what I want to do here. The code feels bloated at 3k lines compiled, but I am not going to bother debugging that now.

4pm. Let me take a nap for a bit. It took me so long to get to this stage that I can hardly believe it.

Should I take the time to do a monthly review here? I am thinking of stopping those. Since it has been decided, I might as well do the last few in the batch rarther than aborting all of a sudden.

Let me do it. A few more won't kill me. Better to do this than lie in bed."

"///

March highlights:

* During the first two weeks, I did a complete redesign of the editor support segment. Rather than use streams, I switched to immutable state updating functions. The streams version was too confusing and I could not figure out how to fix a lot of the bugs I've encountered. It is frequently the case that it is not possible to fix an error without changing the design from the ground up to guarantee it does not occur, and this was one of those cases. Right now, the editor support server should be extremely solid. If there are any more bugs remaining, I won't have trouble fixing them. It was a major redesign, and now I feel like I understand all major aspects of language development at a high level.

* It was an intense effort. After that I wanted to get back to working on RL agents, but ended up just playing around with UIs and Processing. While studying Kivy I was surprised how much overlap UI drawing and [Processing](https://processing.org/) had, so I played around with both. I was really supposed to be working on ML, but this somehow happened. I got some benefit out of this though. Check out the [Spiral logo](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language#the-spiral-language), I wrote the code to generate it in Processing. Though it took me way too much time, I learned quite a bit about computer graphics. It was a fun little diversion, the kind of programming I did there anybody could do, and even Java's mediocre type system was not a hindrance. The typical workflow in Processing is to make a small change and then run the sketch, then see the effect of the changes. This is not my usual workflow - when redesigning Spiral's editor support for the first half of the month, I spent two weeks writing code without running the compiler even once. This is not that rare for me. In contrast, what I did here which gave me instant feedback was refreshing.

* In the last month's entry, I gave a demo of how Spiral UIs will look, but I've abandoned that plan in favor of using [Kivy's native language](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/lang.html). Interfacing with Spiral and Python on a large scale is an interop nightmare and I do not want to bash my head against that wall anymore. But even more than that, I've had a shocking realization that observables are in fact the wrong abstraction for UIs. The right ones are properties. This is actually what Kivy and Svelte use, in different forms. I invested so much into learning Rx, so it is a shock that not only did I not use it for Spiral's editor support, but that I also have better alternatives when it comes to doing UIs. And even if I made a property-based UI library, I would not be able to do better than Kivy's language. The way properties are declared in classes seems like a hack, and the Kivy language seems restricted compared to what I could do with my own library or Svelte, but after thinking about it for a bit, I realized that unless the Python expressions were restricted to a subset of its language, the flow analyzer could not disambiguate the properties from regular variables. Without that pass to get property change notifications the system could not be reactive. So Kivy gets my approval. The language could be extended to allow dynamic widgets, but I do not particularly need that.

* This is convenient, as much like I do not need to write my own ML library thanks to having PyTorch, I do not need to write reactive UI library wrappers to get the necessary expressiveness out of it. It will be a huge time saver.

* Out of the last 4 months, it feels like I wasted 2. I did a little [Leduc poker game with an UI](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language/blob/495b6689e228f372b034c05699c0779201c96e20/Spiral%20Compilation%20Tests/cython_experiments/ui_leduc4/ui_leduc.py). This stuff here should not have taken me more than 2-3 days. Yet I am only at the point now where I should have been in early March. Hopefully now that I've worked out all the kinks in both Spiral and Python, the flow will come to me. Now that I can play against random players, the next goal is to implement agent training and have some fun playing against trained agents after that. After that I'll move to HU NL Holdem.

* A part of what drove me to create Spiral is to make backends and ML libraries for novel AI hardware, but I'll leave that vision for the NG+ playthrough. I pick a bunch of companies, send emails to them and get no reply whatsoever. If I got some feedback I could adjust my pitch and negotiate, but this game disgusts me and I am not interested in playing it anymore. The benefits of my main path vastly outstrip those from this crappy side quest and do not want my time to be taken up what could be better spent elsewhere. I'll hold these AI chip companies in the contempt they deserve and wait for them to finish killing each other. Then I'll go with the winner in the open market. If they like C++ that much, they can have it. I believe that Spiral could be a major asset in this field, the benefits were apparent to me back in 2018. But none of that really matters if I cannot clear the very first hurdle. And I can't. I can generate ideas and think of things to say, but I can't imagine the other side's reaction. So the effort feels like I am trying out random things in hopes of cracking a password. Forget this. I won't talk about this again.

* Now that I have UIs down, and the ML library down, I am in a unique position. At this point in time, I am probably the only person in the world doing actual functional programming in Python's ecosystem. In 2018 and 2019 I was obsessed about improving my understanding of ML, but since that did not get me far enough, I'll rely on sheer programming skill cultivated over the last six years to be my edge. I'll certainly need it. Doing RL is certainly [not a piece of cake](https://andyljones.com/posts/rl-debugging.html) at this point in time. I wanted to do this back in 2016, but my skills really were not good enough back then. My hunch that I needed more training, and bigger advantages than pure Python was offering me were probably right. If I am not good enough now, I’ll never be good enough.

///

Let me put this through Google Docs.

5:10pm. ...Done.

5:15pm. Let me take a breather. I do not feel like doing anything else for the day.

5:20pm. Hmmmmm...

The flow I had in the last few days was wonderful.

Start with the UI, then make the backend. That is justice.

5:25pm. I am visualizing the UI. The amount that can be done with a single page is small, but that serves to narrow down my purpose.

5:35pm. How do I do the replay buffer? I still haven't decided on it.

6:15pm. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ0xA3rAVjqaqA28XNDMD2g
Throw M. Away

This channel really has a lot of Alicesoft OSTs. Nice find.

7:10pm. Done with lunch. Let me stop here. Right now I am obsessing about the replay buffer. There are way of doing it, but the feedforward case is straightforward.

The trouble with recurrent cases is that it will be inefficient on the GPU. I could really use AI chips for that, but regardless I'll squeeze the RNNs in somehow.

For the time being, let me master feedforward nets on small games like Leduc. That won't take too long. Tomorrow, I'll start work on the UI. The main goal will be to generate the replay buffer. This is what I will use for training. And on every iteration I'll regenerate it.

7:15pm. I'll leave that for tomorrow. Let me have a different kind of fun now."
