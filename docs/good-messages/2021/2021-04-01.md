Implement ARMv7 support (untested)

ARM Thumb mode is the most evil thing ever conceived from a reverse
engineering point of view. Not only do you (and your disassembler) never
have a goddamn clue when the code is in Thumb mode or not (leading to
confusion and wrongly-disassembled instructions); but then if you want
to hack around with this code and actually interface with it, good luck
with that, because probably half the stuff will be in regular ARM ISA
and the other half will be in Thumb and it's just a giant inconsistent
mess.

You have no idea how happy I am that ARM made the highly intelligent
decision to NOT support the Thumb instruction set(s) in AArch64.
Dropping that shit was the best decision they ever made.

Create Menstrual Cycle Predictive Model.ipynb

Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Every month, a woman’s body prepares for pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, the uterus, or womb, sheds its lining. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from inside the uterus. Regular periods are a sign that a woman’s body is working normally. A woman should have regular periods unless she is pregnant, breastfeeding, postmenopausal, hormonal imbalance, or have a medical condition that causes her periods to stop. Irregular, painful, or heavy periods may be signs of a serious health problem. Irregular periods also can make it harder to get pregnant.

Below are four of the most common types of abnormal menstrual periods: -

Menorrhagia & Polymenorrhagia (Prolonged, Heavy Bleeding)
Dysmenorrhea (Excess Pain During Period)
Amenorrhea (Absent Periods)
Hypomenorrhea (Extra Light Periods)
Ovulation – Ovulation refers to the release of an egg during menstruation in females. Part of the ovary called the ovarian follicle discharges an egg. The egg is also known as an ovum, oocyte, or female gamete. It is only released on reaching maturity.

There's a 42% (max) chance of conception on the day before ovulation, the most fertile day of your cycle.
10% of women have PCOS, a condition that is associated with irregular and infrequent ovulation, making natural conception trickier.
Ovulation day can be find using the surge in Luteinizing Hormone (LH): - a. A LH surge means that you will probably ovulate within the next 12 to 24 hours. b. When taken correctly, ovulation tests are approximately 99% accurate in detecting the LH surge that precedes ovulation. However, these tests cannot confirm whether ovulation actually occurs a day or two later.
Problem Statement: Estimate the menstruation cycle at an early stage and be ready before the process begins.

Predict the chances of next menstrual cycle.
Predict the Estimated Ovulation Cycle.
ABSTRACT:

 This analysis details variation in menstrual cycle characteristics that are not widely known yet have significant implications for health and well-being. Clinically, women who wish to plan a pregnancy  need to have intercourse on their fertile days. In order to identify the fertile period, it is important to track different parameters such as cycle length and to keep watch on various hormones like Luteinizing hormones, Estrogen.
Conclusion:

Variability of the menstrual cycle is normal.

There are, however, norms that if exceeded might indicate health problems.

At a minimum, monitoring menstrual cycle length with a simple calendar is recommended.

The addition of a biological marker for estimating the day of ovulation and the beginning of the fertile phase is essential for those seeking to avoid and achieve pregnancy and for assessing menstrual cycle health.

First of chapter 2, legit a day after lmao. Idk what this chapter holds but it's just another chapter in our story. Don't know what to expect from this, I feel closer than ever to her mentally it's weird. I think I've come to peace that this is just another part in our great story. If it's meant to be everything will fall into place itself. Let's see how this goes and let it flow. Fuck love, Fuck feelings, we live in the moment and have fun.

update es.js

Modified from the formal "You" to the direct "you" for two reasons:

1) Its more friendly
2) It's more inclusive. The formal you makes you choose between female and male nouns,adjectives, etc., and with the informal you it's easier to avoid those.
I also modified words that are female/male with the @ at symbol. For example, bienvenid@ , and changed the gender on "coder" to be programador@ .

A couple other small corrections on language too.

[EDS-556] Return student search results when requester is authenticated (#47)

* Refactor backend to support student search results

# Change Summary

Essentially, this inserts a `population` layer into the results.

Before:

```
{
"num_results": 1,
"scenarios": [
    {
        "description": "foo",
        "people": [...]
    },  # . . .
]
}
```

New structure:

```
{
    "num_results": 2,
    "scenarios": [
        {
            "description": "foo",
            "num_results": 2,
            "populations": {
                "employees": {
                    "num_results": 1,
                    "people": [ . . . ]
                },
                "students": {
                     "num_results": 1,
                     "people": [ . . . ],
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This also includes the `num_results` field at each layer, so it's always known whether the underlying structure has values that need to be iterated over, or whether it's just a default, empty collection.

## Other changes:

- Updates JSON output test, since that is not reliant on front-end changes
- Fixes `validate_box_number` after writing a test for it and realizing it was broken.

* Updates the frontend to be compatible with the output structure change

Other changes:

- Consistently use `num_results` instead of a combination of `num_results` and `results|length`, now that `num_results` is available at all layers
- Breaks out the radio options for population and full/summary into a separate partial template , just because it was getting lengthy.
- Renames `search_options.py` to `search_attribute_selection.y` so that the stuff including the title "Search options" heading can be broken out into a file called `search_options.py`.
- Adds developer-friendly type-hints to the data types in the complex jinja rendering, where we have loops within loops, so that it's easier to understand which loop is iterating over which model.

* Updates tests to be compatible with the new front-end state, and back-end data structure.

* Fixes/Feedback from PR

- Refactors another small snippet from `test_saml_blueprint.py` to use the new HTMLValidator strategy for consistency.
- Breaks `summary_results_table.html` into several partials, so that we don't have to deal with the insane amount of indentation when editing.
- Renames `TestModel` to `_TestModel` to get rid of a pytest warning
- Fixes result count so that results are comma-delimited and properly singular/pluralized

* Simplify the browser<->backend communication (#48)

The original intent of the backend API design was because we originally intended this to be a javascript-powered experience. However, once we realized it wasn't, we never addressed the back-end API, which resulted in a lot of extra complexity.

This change makes the front-end request input model match the actual front-end use case, which removes several additional validations, translations, and an extra javascript function.

The request input is now preserved exactly as-is and returned exactly as-was.

Additionally I have added tests to ensure that this behavior stays in sync.

The input model is now simply:

```
{
    "method": "name",  // or phone, boxNumber, etc.
    "query": "ada lovelace",  // actual query term
    "population": "all",  // or "students", "employees"
    "length": "summary" // or "full"
}
```

This correlates 1:1 with the form, so we no longer have to coerce these two models.

Additionally:

- Removes unused check for "show_count"
- Fixes the "has_tag_with_text" to fix false positives (replacement is heavily documented)

* - Fix regression that omitted uwnetid from rendering context during '/search [POST]'
- Added test for /search POST (the previous search only tried '/ [GET]')

* Fix autofocus relying on form name in order to work.
