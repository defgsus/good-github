##### 2021-06-15 10:04:59 by Marko Grdiniƒá

"9am. Let me chill for a bit and I will start. I am starting to feel the urge to program. The real challenge is teaching AI systems social skills. It seems like a big deal and one imagines humans as the paragons of sociability, but plenty of lesser creatures such as insects have those kinds of desires.

The only way to take my revenge on the world is to do this. Death and destruction will happen anyway as the consequence of the Singularity, so my own rage on top of that is like drop in the bucket. Any kind of violence that I can envision would just be an addon. But having other people become connected to my drones who I have perfect control over is something I should be aiming for whole heartedly.

Unless I take on and internalize such a goal, it is just going to be one failure after another.

I'll make a superhuman agent and then get punished for not being normal enough. No.

Never again. I never again want to be punished for failing some kind of Turing test, whether it be because of my agents or because of myself.

9:30am. Let me start programming.

Social skills. Automating them is the ultimate goal. If I could do that, I could attain anything. All of the obstacles to using AI are some kind of Turing test.

Right now, I have no idea how I could do this. I was prepared to do the poker agent, but making the interface is something I've only paid lip service to. I do not have some great plan as to how I might achieve agents that can imitate my own activity patterns or be social.

9:35am. Just kind of game is the social game? What are the rewards and punishments? Maybe the fact that I cannot answer that is proof that I do not undertand it. I can only understand it at the level of - if I acted like 'this', then 'that' kind of result would happen. But it feels like I am just doing pattern matching.

I can see the flow of it, and how it depends on the context, but I can't find the true start and finish. It feels more like decentralized RL. If I get stung on the hand by a bee, is it the hand which influences the rest of the system, or is the brain which pretends it is like that. It should be the later, but the brain itself puts in great effort to convince me that it is the former.

I can't really cut through the layers of self deception to turn this into an algorithm.

9:40am. All I can be sure is that my life depends on figuring this out. Just like figuring out a stable and reward scale invariant RL algorithm was one of my great goals of the past six years, for the next six, figuring out the social aspects of AI is something that I must pursue.

I want money, but even with the RL algorithm I mentioned and the superhuman agent, actually attaining that feels hopeless.

It does not feel like I can win at all. And figuring out the social aspects and formalizing them into an algorithm feels beyond me. Even the hardware for this kind experimentation is not there. GPUs feel insuficient for anything significant.

9:50am. I'll accept it. Being at the bottom and on the losing end is what suits the human me the most. Glory, power, achievement are the furthest things from me. Not being able to get what I want is the standard. Letting opportunities pass me by is common occurence.

But I'll dream about grasping this. I'll make it my main goal. I'll aim to take revenge by completely formalizing and then trivializing the social aspects of interaction.

Did I think my journey was over just because I made the first step? The story of me cultivating my demonic heart continues.

9:55am. I need to start work on the Holdem game. Let me bring in `training.spi` and I will get started on it. I thought that the architecture would not be like last time, but it turns out that it will. The nodes are a bit different, but the old design turned out to be remarkably resilient to my attempts at changing them.

I guess that makes things simpler. For the past week, I've spent a remarkable amount of time in indecision and it is time to get some work done.

10am. I'll accept my own powerlessness and continue going forward. Maybe the future me will one day know what it is like to have power. But for the me of the present, I am still nobody different than when I have started. I've only made a few steps forward in the past six years.

Maybe something bad will happen and my quest will end prematurely without attaining victory. In that case, maybe I'd be better off spending my time on leisure. But the reason games and fiction are great is because of belief in it. When I was a kid, I thought that even though they aren't real, with some effort they could be.

The dreams of power that I had would have been empty without the actual pursuit of them.

10:05am. And that is why I will do programming today. To provide substance to my vision and life to my dreams. The eventual outcome is beyond my control, but it does not change that this way of living is the right one.

Who cares about right or wrong, and the lives and benefits of others? That only thing that matters is my own effort that I am putting in.

I need to remember that in order to overcome the tedium. When you feel tedium the perspective shifts and you can only see the enormous mountain of work that does need to be done ahead of you. When you are in the spirit of pursuit the mountain seems small and easily passable, just another hurdle in the passage of your journey.

Let me bring in the `train` module.

10:20am. In addition to `vs_self` and `vs_one` I'll have to do a function to let a human play against an agent, but I'll leave that for later. It is not important right now. I'll cross that hurdle when I get to it.

10:25am. Now...I think I am ready to start work on the Holdem game. Before I do that let me just put an eye Leduc for a moment.

10:30am. Mmmhhh...ok. There is nothing else but to start. For now, let me just aim to make a game where two players draw cards and then get a reward.

10:40am. This time I won't use union types for cards as it would be too much of a pain to get their ordering. And it could cause inefficiency due to using i32 tags.

Instead they should be i8s. How do I make an [0,51] array in Numpy?

https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html

Let me try this.

```
import numpy
x = numpy.linspace(0,51,52,dtype=numpy.int8)
numpy.random.shuffle(x)
```

Yeah, this is how I will make the starting deck.

```
inl Game =
    inl deck : a u64 i8 = $"numpy.linspace(0,51,52,dtype=numpy.int8)"
    $"numpy.random.shuffle(!deck)"
    ()
```

Nice and easy. The next step would be to draw two cards for each player.

11am.

```
open hand_scorer
inl game (stack : i32) =
    inl deck : a u64 card = $"numpy.linspace(0,51,52,dtype=numpy.int8)"
    $"numpy.random.shuffle(!deck)"

    inl pot = 1i32
    inl id = 0i8
    draw (Some: id) deck fun (c1, deck) =>
    draw (Some: id) deck fun (c2, deck) =>
    inl p1 = {stack pot id hand = c1,c2}

    inl pot = 2i32
    inl id = 1i8
    draw (Some: id) deck fun (c1, deck) =>
    draw (Some: id) deck fun (c2, deck) =>
    inl p2 = {stack pot id hand = c1,c2}

    terminal (p1,p2) (r2 1)
```

This is a good initial step.

11:10am. Focus me. Let me make an union type for the actions.

11:15am.

```
union action = Fold | Call | Raise: i32

open hand_scorer
inl game (stack : i32) =
    inl deck : a u64 card = $"numpy.linspace(0,51,52,dtype=numpy.int8)"
    $"numpy.random.shuffle(!deck)"
    inl actions : a _ _ = am.init (1 + u64 stack) fun i =>
        if i = 0 then Fold
        elif i = 1 then Call
        else Raise: i32 i - 2

    actions |> am.map function
        | Fold => "Fold"
        | Call => "Call"
        | Raise: x => $"f'Raise: {!x}'"
```

Let me see if this creates the kind of array I am envisioning.

11:20am. Nope it is completely wrong. It starts at zero and is in reverse order.

https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html

Ah, wait instead of linspace I could have used this as well.

```
union action = Fold | Call | RaiseTo: i32

open hand_scorer
inl game (stack : i32) = // Stack size should be at least 2.
    inl deck : a u64 card = $"numpy.linspace(0,51,52,dtype=numpy.int8)"
    $"numpy.random.shuffle(!deck)"
    inl actions : a _ _ = am.init (1 + u64 stack) fun i =>
        if i = 0 then Fold
        elif i = 1 then Call
        else RaiseTo: stack - i32 (i-2)

    actions |> am.map function
        | Fold => "Fold"
        | Call => "Call"
        | RaiseTo: x => $"f'RaiseTo: {!x}'"
```

This is right.

```
numpy.arange(0,52,dtype=numpy.int8)
```

Let me use this.

11:40am.

```
    inl actions : a _ _ = am.init (u64 stack) fun i =>
        if i = 0 then Fold
        elif i = 1 then Call
        else RaiseTo: stack - i32 (i-2)
```

Let me narrow the array down as much as possible. Than I will make the helpers for call only arrays and such.

```
    inl actions : a _ _ = am.init (u64 stack) fun i =>
        if i = 0 then Fold
        elif i = 1 then Call
        else RaiseTo: stack - i32 (i-2)
```

Hmmm, why does this break when I made the array an i32?

```
TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
```

What does this error mean?

```
    actions |> am.map function
        | Fold => "Fold"
        | Call => "Call"
        | RaiseTo: x => $"f'RaiseTo: {!x}'"
```

It happens due to the conversion.

```
inl map f ar = init (length ar) (fun i => f (index ar i))
```

This is how the map is implemented. So the problem has to be in init.

```
inl init nearTo f =
    inl ar = create nearTo
    for' (from: 0 nearTo:) (fun i => set ar i (f i))
    ar
```

What is the problem?

```
  File "c:/Users/Marko/Source/Repos/The Spiral Language/Spiral Compilation Tests/cython_experiments/ui_holdem1/hu_holdem_test.py", line 7, in <module>
    print(main())
  File "hu_holdem.pyx", line 23, in hu_holdem.main
    cpdef numpy.ndarray[str,ndim=1] main():
  File "hu_holdem.pyx", line 68, in hu_holdem.main
    v15 = v1
TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
```
```
cdef numpy.ndarray[object,ndim=1] v1
cdef signed long v15
```

Ok, this is an array...

Why is it trying to assign an array to a signed long?

```
    tmp0 = len(v1)
    if <signed long>tmp0 != tmp0: raise Exception("The conversion to signed long failed.")
    v15 = v1
    v16 = numpy.empty(v15,dtype=object)
```

Huh, I get the sense it is trying to pass the length and instead passes an array by accident. Let me take a look at the codegen.

```fs
        let length (a,b) =
            match a with
            | YPrim (Int64T | UInt64T) -> return' $"len({tup b})"
            | YPrim a ->
                let l = $"len({tup b})"
                let tmp_i = tmp()
                line defs $"cdef unsigned long long tmp{tmp_i}"
                line s $"tmp{tmp_i} = {l}"
                let a = prim a
                line s $"if <{a}>tmp{tmp_i} != tmp{tmp_i}: raise Exception(\"The conversion to {a} failed.\")"
                return' (tup b)
```

Yeah, the problem is here.

```
return' l
```

I probably meant to write this. What an eyesore.

```
inl game (stack : i32) = // Stack size should be at least 2.
    inl deck : a u64 card = $"numpy.arange(0,52,dtype=numpy.int8)"
    $"numpy.random.shuffle(!deck)"
    inl actions : a _ _ = am.init stack fun i =>
        if i = 0 then Fold
        elif i = 1 then Call
        else RaiseTo: stack - i + 2

    inl get_action is_fold (min_raise : i32) =
        inl min : i32 = if is_fold then 0 else 1
        $"!actions[!min:3+!stack-!min_raise]"

    actions |> am.map function
        | Fold => "Fold"
        | Call => "Call"
        | RaiseTo: x => $"f'RaiseTo: {!x}'"
```

Ok, now everything is fine. Let me publish a new Spiral version.

12pm. Did so.

```
    actions |> am.map function
        | Fold => "Fold"
        | Call => "Call"
        | RaiseTo: x => $"f'RaiseTo: {!x}'"
```

Let me take this out.

```
    inl actions : action_array = am.init stack fun i =>
        if i = 0 then Fold
        elif i = 1 then Call
        else RaiseTo: stack - i + 2

    inl get_action is_fold (min_raise : i32) : action_array =
        inl min : i32 = if is_fold then 0 else 1
        $"!actions[!min:3+!stack-!min_raise]"
```

This will suffice to generate the actions array and get the allowed actions. Good. Now I should start work on the preflop and flop.

Maybe I should just do flop poker to start things off. Let me take a break here."

bpf: do not change gso_size during bpf_skb_change_proto()

This is technically a backwards incompatible change in behaviour,
but I'm going to argue that it is very unlikely to break things,
and likely to fix *far* more then it breaks.

In no particular order, various reasons follow:

(a) I've long had a bug assigned to myself to debug a super rare kernel
crash on Android Pixel phones which can (per stacktrace) be traced back
to bpf clat ipv6 to ipv4 protocol conversion causing some sort of ugly
failure much later on during transmit deep in the GSO engine, AFAICT
precisely because of this change to gso_size, though I've never been able
to manually reproduce it.
I believe it may be related to the particular network offload support
of attached usb ethernet dongle being used for tethering off of an
IPv6-only cellular connection.  The reason might be we end up with more
segments than max permitted, or with a gso packet with only one segment...
(either way we break some assumption and hit a BUG_ON)

(b) There is no check that the gso_size is > 20 when reducing it by 20,
so we might end up with a negative (or underflowing) gso_size or
a gso_size of 0.  This can't possibly be good.
Indeed this is probably somehow exploitable (or at least can result
in a kernel crash) by delivering crafted packets and perhaps triggering
an infinite loop or a divide by zero...
As a reminder: gso_size (mss) is related to mtu, but not directly
derived from it: gso_size/mss may be significantly smaller then
one would get by deriving from local mtu.  And on some nics (which
do loose mtu checking on receive, it may even potentially be larger,
for example my work pc with 1500 mtu can receive 1520 byte frames
[and sometimes does due to bugs in a vendor plat46 implementation]).
Indeed even just going from 21 to 1 is potentially problematic because
it increases the number of segments by a factor of 21 (think DoS,
or some other crash due to too many segments).

(c) It's always safe to not increase the gso_size, because it doesn't
result in the max packet size increasing.  So the skb_increase_gso_size()
call was always unnecessary for correctness (and outright undesirable, see
later).  As such the only part which is potentially dangerous (ie. could
cause backwards compatibility issues) is the removal of the
skb_decrease_gso_size() call.

(d) If the packets are ultimately destined to the local device, then
there is absolutely no benefit to playing around with gso_size.
It only matters if the packets will egress the device.  ie. we're
either forwarding, or transmitting from the device.

(e) This logic only triggers for packets which are GSO.  It does not
trigger for skbs which are not GSO.  It will not convert a non-GSO mtu
sized packet into a GSO packet (and you don't even know what the mtu is,
so you can't even fix it).  As such your transmit path must *already* be
able to handle an mtu 20 bytes larger then your receive path (for ipv4
to ipv6 translation) - and indeed 28 bytes larger due to ipv4 fragments.
Thus removing the skb_decrease_gso_size() call doesn't actually increase
the size of the packets your transmit side must be able to handle.
ie. to handle non-GSO max-mtu packets, the ipv4/ipv6 device/route mtus
must already be set correctly.  Since for example with an ipv4 egress mtu
of 1500, ipv4 to ipv6 translation will already build 1520 byte ipv6 frames,
so you need a 1520 byte device mtu.  This means if your ipv6 device's
egress mtu is 1280, your ipv4 route must be 1260 (and actually 1252,
because of the need to handle fragments).  This is to handle normal non-GSO
packets.  Thus the reduction is simply not needed for GSO packets,
because when they're correctly built, they will already be the right size.

(f) TSO/GSO should be able to exactly undo GRO: the number of packets
(TCP segments) should not be modified, so that TCP's mss counting works
correctly (this matters for congestion control).
If protocol conversion changes the gso_size, then the number of TCP segments
may increase or decrease.  Packet loss after protocol conversion can result
in partial loss of mss segments that the sender sent.  How's the sending
TCP stack going to react to receiving ACKs/SACKs in the middle of the
segments it sent?

(g) skb_{decrease,increase}_gso_size() are already no-ops for GSO_BY_FRAGS
case (besides triggering WARN_ON_ONCE). This means you already cannot
guarantee that gso_size (and thus resulting packet mtu) is changed.
ie. you must assume it won't be changed.

(h) changing gso_size is outright buggy for UDP GSO packets, where framing
matters (I believe that's also the case for SCTP, but it's already excluded
by [g]).  So the only remaining case is TCP, which also doesn't want it
(see [f]).

(i) see also the reasoning on the previous attempt at fixing this
(commit fa7b83bf3b156c767f3e4a25bbf3817b08f3ff8e) which shows
that the current behaviour causes TCP packet loss:

  In the forwarding path GRO -> BPF 6 to 4 -> GSO for TCP traffic, the
  coalesced packet payload can be > MSS, but < MSS + 20.

  bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4() will upgrade the MSS and it can be > the payload
  length. After then tcp_gso_segment checks for the payload length if it
  is <= MSS. The condition is causing the packet to be dropped.

  tcp_gso_segment():
    [...]
    mss = skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size;
    if (unlikely(skb->len <= mss)) goto out;
    [...]

Thus changing the gso_size is simply a very bad idea.
Increasing is unnecessary and buggy, and decreasing can go negative.

Couple Massage Tacoma

Your body releases the "love hormone," oxytocin, to produce a feeling of affection and love when you have a terrific massage. This indicates that love is in the air when you have a couple's massage (and the bloodstream). Increased affection is one of the essential benefits of Couples Massage Tacoma. Maybe you are a champion for Marie Kondo or, like so many others, you prefer to choose material goods for the worth of your activities and experiences when the disadvantages outweigh the price. Getting a pair massage is a fantastic way of avoiding the effect of one more thing on the environment.

CodingGuidelines: recommend singular they

Technical writing seeks to convey information with minimal friction. One
way that a reader can experience friction is if they encounter a
description of "a user" that is later simplified using a gendered
pronoun. If the reader does not consider that pronoun to apply to them,
then they can experience cognitive dissonance that removes focus from
the information.

When choosing a gendered pronoun, that pronoun no longer applies to
nearly half of possible readers. Even if we alternated between "he/him"
and "she/her" perfectly evenly, we would still expect male and female
readers to experience an incorrect pronoun half the time. However, some
readers will not prescribe to either of these binary genders. Those
readers hence suffer an incorrect pronoun the entire time.

To make our documentation more inclusive, add recommendations to the
CodingGuidelines document. We can refer to this section when a
contributor submits a patch with a gendered pronoun and these
recommendations apply. The examples can assist in producing a new patch
with adjusted language.

As noted in the guidelines, removing an example person can make the
writing clearer and more concise. Other techniques such as singular
"you" and plural "they" are widely accepted ways to adjust the noun and
avoid gendered pronouns. Finally, an author can resort to singluar
"they" if absolutely necessary, but this can be difficult for readers
who learned English in a way that dictated "they" as always plural.

If we refer to a specific person, then using a gendered pronoun is
appropriate. There can also be other cases where it is inappropriate for
us to update the existing examples within the Git codebase, such as:

* References to real people (e.g. Linus Torvalds, "the Git maintainer").
  Do not misgender real people. If there is any doubt to the gender of a
  person, then avoid using pronouns.

* References to fictional people with clear genders (e.g. Alice and
  Bob).

* Sample text used in test cases (e.g t3702, t6432).

* The official text of the GPL license contains uses of "he or she", but
  modifying the license this way is not within the scope of the Git
  project.

* Literal email messages in Documentation/howto/ should not be edited
  for grammatical concerns such as this, unless we update the entire
  document to fit the standard documentation format. If such an effort is
  taken on, then the authorship would change and no longer refer to the
  exact mail message.

* External projects consumed in contrib/ should not deviate solely for
  style reasons. Recommended edits should be contributed to those
  projects directly.

Other cases within the Git project were cleaned up by the previous
changes.

January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India‚Äîdied August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan?), Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence movement against British rule of India. He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.</p><br>

    <h2>EARLY LIFE AND POLITICAL ACTIVITY</h2>
    <p>The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College, Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and the Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India. Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889‚Äì1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party) politician.
        <br>

        Bose joined the noncooperation movement started by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who had made the Indian National Congress a powerful nonviolent organization. Bose was advised by Gandhi to work under Chitta Ranjan Das, a politician in Bengal. There Bose became a youth educator, journalist, and commandant of the Bengal Congress volunteers. His activities led to his imprisonment in December 1921. In 1924 he was appointed chief executive officer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, with Das as mayor. Bose was soon after deported to Burma (Myanmar) because he was suspected of connections with secret revolutionary movements. Released in 1927, he returned to find Bengal Congress affairs in disarray after the death of Das, and Bose was elected president of the Bengal Congress. Shortly thereafter he and Jawaharlal Nehru became the two general secretaries of the Indian National Congress. Together they represented the more militant, left-wing faction of the party against the more compromising, right-wing Gandhian faction.

    <h2>HIS IMPACT ON PUBLIC </h2>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose (known also as Netaji) reflected a more militant and socialist approach to India‚Äôs independence movement as compared with Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi‚Äôs less confrontational stance and more conservative economics.

x11/plasma5-plasma: Update KDE Plasma Desktop to 5.22

Plasma 5.22 is here, and it is more reliable and stable than ever. By
cleaning up and refactoring code in the background, the Plasma desktop
gives you greater responsiveness and performance, helping you become
even more productive without hiccups or surprises. Enjoy a smoother
experience with KDE‚Äôs Plasma 5.22 desktop.

Plasma 5.22 has become more pleasurable to use through improvements to
the design and greater smoothness and consistency in transparencies,
blurs, icons, and animations. Moving things to accessible locations,
offering hints and visual cues, and creating new settings allows you to
customize your work environment to make it fit perfectly to your needs.
Following the true KDE spirit, the push for a more stable and attractive
desktop does not mean you have to renounce control over how you want it
to look or behave. Plasma 5.22, as always, packs all the flexibility and
tools for customization you have come to expect and love, and some more
to boot.

Meanwhile, the push to move Plasma in its entirety to Wayland (the
display protocol of the future) continues in full swing. So much so that
popular distros are starting to ship Plasma with Wayland by default. By
using Wayland behind the scenes, Plasma is able to include features and
bug fixes not possible to implement on X11, offering you a better
experience and more stability.

Update base for Update on "add a boxed CPU fallback kernel"

This PR replaces the existing code-generated CPU fallback kernels that XLA uses with a single boxed CPU fallback.

Current state: there are a couple different design ideas that I want to point out, but the logic for the actually kernel is mostly done and passing tests.

### Design

To preface, I'm not 100% tied to the current design and I'm putting the PR up now for opinions and totally open to alternatives, some of which I listed below. Actually after writing this description, I'm leaning toward the following changes:
* Confirm whether or not we can remove all C++ logging info directly in the yaml.


**Current Design**

All of the CPU fallback codegen is deleted. In its place, XLA (and other external backends, later) can choose to opt into a CPU fallback by adding the following code in a C++ file. I have an corresponding [xla-side PR with the xla changes](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/pull/2945/files#diff-1a005c10039f0cb11130a3b740f5de716d2f10acaea121017016025861886798R1).

There's no actual requirement to split up the code into a .h and .cpp file, but that's necessary in the XLA case because they sometimes need to call the fallback directly from their handcrafted kernels.

```
// xla_cpu_fallback.h
#include <ATen/native/CPUFallback.h>
...
void xla_cpu_fallback(const c10::OperatorHandle& op, torch::jit::Stack* stack);
...
```
```
// xla_cpu_fallback.cpp
#include "torch_xla/csrc/aten_cpu_fallback.h"
...
void xla_cpu_fallback(const c10::OperatorHandle& op, torch::jit::Stack* stack) {
  // Do custom logging here
  ...
  // Call the actual boxed CPU fallback.
  at::native::cpu_fallback(op, stack);
}

TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL(_, XLA, m) {
  m.fallback(torch::CppFunction::makeFromBoxedFunction<&xla_cpu_fallback>());
}
```

Now that the fallback is exposed in the backend, they can call it directly. Doing so requires converting from an unboxed to a boxed context, which we provide a utility function before. E.g.:
```
#include <ATen/native/CPUFallback.h>

at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::native::call_fallback_fn<&xla_cpu_fallback, decltype(at::addmm)>::call("aten::addmm", self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```

That `decltype(at::addmm)` logic isn't actually used everywhere in the xla-side PR yet, since you hit issues with overloads. I could use it everywhere once #58092 lands.

**Alternatives: The API for calling the CPU fallback directly is ugly, can we make it nicer?**
We could change the api to use `at::redispatch`, which would make it look something like this:
```
at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::redispatch::addmm(c10::DispatchKeySet(c10::DispatchKey::CPUFallback), self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```
Which definitely feels cleaner, but also requires adding a new DispatchKey just for this use case. Conditionally calling the CPU fallback doesn't sound like a hugely important use case, so I don't know if giving up one of our 64 dispatch key slots is worth the API improvement. Totally open to other opinions though!


Another more mild improvement that would avoid having to pass operator string names (including overloads) around would be to codegen (yet another) namespaced API. Something like this:
```
at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::fallback::addmm<&xla_cpu_fallback>(self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```

Writing that out actually I actually like it more (I think it'll let us get rid of `decltype(...)`). Maybe that is nice enough to warrant a new codegen API - I haven't tried adding that yet, but if people like it I'm happy to try it out.

**More alternatives**
The current design also involves the backend manually writing and registering the boxed fallback themselves, but an alternative would be for us to do it in codegen too: they would just need to pass in all of the C++ logging that they want done in the fallback, directly through the yaml. The main downsides:
* Backend code that wants to call the fallback needs to abide by whatever convention our codegen uses to name the generated boxed fallback.
* Passing custom C++ logging through yaml is just more fragile: right now xla uses an `iostream` to log each tensor arg in the operator, so we'd have to either force other backends into the same convention or figure something else out later.

To be fair, we actually already do that: XLA has custom per-tensor-arg logging for all of the generated `out` wrappers in the codegen, which we do by passing their C++ logging info through the yaml. This seems unnecessary though, since `out` wrappers just call into a functional kernel, which is hand written with its own custom logging. So my take is: try to remove custom C++ logging from the yaml, and if it turns out to be really necessary, then we may as well take advantage of that to codegen the fallback.

### Performance impact

While ops that fall back to CPU aren't exactly hot path, we probably don't want to use a boxed fallback if it turns out to be an absolute perf killer.

I ran my benchmarks using callgrind, benchmarking both `at::add` and `at::add_out` run on XLA. My callgrind benchmark for `at::add` can be found here (the add_out benchmark looks basically the same): https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415418587. I created the benchmark by hacking the existing xla C++ test build scripts and throwing in a reference to callgrind.

I also attached the full callgrind output for each benchmark; the full output is actually pretty noise and hard to parse, but I focused on everything underneath the `at::add()` call in the output, which was much more stable. My guess is that it's due to some heavyweight async startup processing that xla does.

`at::add`:
before: 88,505,130 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415421001
after: 102,185,654 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415421273
delta: ~15.5% increase

`at::add_out`:
before: 63,897,395 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/intern/everpaste/?handle=GBrrKwtAPlix9wUEAOZtrFXpdO5UbsIXAAAz
after: 73,170,346 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415423227
delta: ~14.5% increase

High level takeaway: A framework overhead increase of 10-20% doesn't seem too horrible for the CPU fallback use case.

For structured, functional ops that requires a CPU fallback, we're actually in an unfortunate situation: we're doing even more work than necessary. Our codegen automatically creates a `CompositeExplicitAutograd` kernel which calls into the `out` operator. So the extra work that we end up doing is:
* An extra dispatcher hop: (at::add -> CompositeExplicitAutograd -> CPUFallback -> at::native::add) instead of (at::add -> CPUFallback -> at::native::add)
* An unnecessary tensor allocation (the CompositeExplicitAutograd kernel uses at::empty() to create an output tensor, which is immediately overwritten by the CPU fallback)
* An unnecessary meta() call (the CompositeExplicitAutograd kernel calls it to create the output tensor, but we call it again in the CPU kernel).
* unboxing->boxing->unboxing logic (this is the only strictly required piece)

There are definitely ways to avoid the unnecessary work explained above: one would be to give the boxed fallback higher priority than composite keys (there's [an issue for it here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/55104)), and codegen fallthroughs for all composite ops. It'll require more infra to set up, so I see it as more of a perf knob that we can apply if we need it later.

Unfortunately I couldn't dig much deeper into the differences aside from the aggregate change in instructions, since it looks like callgrind fudged some of the instruction attribution (`at::to_cpu` takes up a ton of instructions, but I don't see any attribution for the `at::native::add` kernel anywhere).

add a boxed CPU fallback kernel

Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/58065

This PR replaces the existing code-generated CPU fallback kernels that XLA uses with a single boxed CPU fallback.

Current state: there are a couple different design ideas that I want to point out, but the logic for the actually kernel is mostly done and passing tests.

### Design

To preface, I'm not 100% tied to the current design and I'm putting the PR up now for opinions and totally open to alternatives, some of which I listed below. Actually after writing this description, I'm leaning toward the following changes:
* Confirm whether or not we can remove all C++ logging info directly in the yaml.


**Current Design**

All of the CPU fallback codegen is deleted. In its place, XLA (and other external backends, later) can choose to opt into a CPU fallback by adding the following code in a C++ file. I have an corresponding [xla-side PR with the xla changes](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/pull/2945/files#diff-1a005c10039f0cb11130a3b740f5de716d2f10acaea121017016025861886798R1).

There's no actual requirement to split up the code into a .h and .cpp file, but that's necessary in the XLA case because they sometimes need to call the fallback directly from their handcrafted kernels.

```
// xla_cpu_fallback.h
#include <ATen/native/CPUFallback.h>
...
void xla_cpu_fallback(const c10::OperatorHandle& op, torch::jit::Stack* stack);
...
```
```
// xla_cpu_fallback.cpp
#include "torch_xla/csrc/aten_cpu_fallback.h"
...
void xla_cpu_fallback(const c10::OperatorHandle& op, torch::jit::Stack* stack) {
  // Do custom logging here
  ...
  // Call the actual boxed CPU fallback.
  at::native::cpu_fallback(op, stack);
}

TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL(_, XLA, m) {
  m.fallback(torch::CppFunction::makeFromBoxedFunction<&xla_cpu_fallback>());
}
```

Now that the fallback is exposed in the backend, they can call it directly. Doing so requires converting from an unboxed to a boxed context, which we provide a utility function before. E.g.:
```
#include <ATen/native/CPUFallback.h>

at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::native::call_fallback_fn<&xla_cpu_fallback, decltype(at::addmm)>::call("aten::addmm", self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```

That `decltype(at::addmm)` logic isn't actually used everywhere in the xla-side PR yet, since you hit issues with overloads. I could use it everywhere once #58092 lands.

**Alternatives: The API for calling the CPU fallback directly is ugly, can we make it nicer?**
We could change the api to use `at::redispatch`, which would make it look something like this:
```
at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::redispatch::addmm(c10::DispatchKeySet(c10::DispatchKey::CPUFallback), self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```
Which definitely feels cleaner, but also requires adding a new DispatchKey just for this use case. Conditionally calling the CPU fallback doesn't sound like a hugely important use case, so I don't know if giving up one of our 64 dispatch key slots is worth the API improvement. Totally open to other opinions though!


Another more mild improvement that would avoid having to pass operator string names (including overloads) around would be to codegen (yet another) namespaced API. Something like this:
```
at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::fallback::addmm<&xla_cpu_fallback>(self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```

Writing that out actually I actually like it more (I think it'll let us get rid of `decltype(...)`). Maybe that is nice enough to warrant a new codegen API - I haven't tried adding that yet, but if people like it I'm happy to try it out.
