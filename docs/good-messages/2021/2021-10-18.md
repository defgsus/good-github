refs/files: remove "name exist?" check in lock_ref_oid_basic()

In lock_ref_oid_basic() we'll happily lock a reference that doesn't
exist yet. That's normal, and is how references are initially born,
but we don't need to retain checks here in lock_ref_oid_basic() about
the state of the ref, when what we're checking is either checked
already, or something we're about to discover by trying to lock the
ref with raceproof_create_file().

The one exception is the caller in files_reflog_expire(), who passes
us a "type" to find out if the reference is a symref or not. We can
move the that logic over to that caller, which can now defer its
discovery of whether or not the ref is a symref until it's needed. In
the preceding commit an exhaustive regression test was added for that
case in a new test in "t1417-reflog-updateref.sh".

The improved diagnostics here were added in
5b2d8d6f218 (lock_ref_sha1_basic(): improve diagnostics for ref D/F
conflicts, 2015-05-11), and then much of the surrounding code went
away recently in my 245fbba46d6 (refs/files: remove unused "errno ==
EISDIR" code, 2021-08-23).

The refs_resolve_ref_unsafe() code being removed here looks like it
should be tasked with doing that, but it's actually redundant to other
code.

The reason for that is as noted in 245fbba46d6 this once widely used
function now only has a handful of callers left, which all handle this
case themselves.

To the extent that we're racy between their check and ours removing
this check actually improves the situation, as we'll be doing fewer
things between the not-under-lock initial check and acquiring the
lock.

Why this is OK for all the remaining callers of lock_ref_oid_basic()
is noted below. There are only two of those callers:

* "git branch -[cm] <oldbranch> <newbranch>":

  In files_copy_or_rename_ref() we'll call this when we copy or rename
  refs via rename_ref() and copy_ref(). but only after we've checked
  if the refname exists already via its own call to
  refs_resolve_ref_unsafe() and refs_rename_ref_available().

  As the updated comment to the latter here notes neither of those are
  actually needed. If we delete not only this code but also
  refs_rename_ref_available() we'll do just fine, we'll just emit a
  less friendly error message if e.g. "git branch -m A B/C" would have
  a D/F conflict with a "B" file.

  Actually we'd probably die before that in case reflogs for the
  branch existed, i.e. when the try to rename() or copy_file() the
  relevant reflog, since if we've got a D/F conflict with a branch
  name we'll probably also have the same with its reflogs (but not
  necessarily, we might have reflogs, but it might not).

  As some #leftoverbits that code seems buggy to me, i.e. the reflog
  "protocol" should be to get a lock on the main ref, and then perform
  ref and/or reflog operations. That code dates back to
  c976d415e53 (git-branch: add options and tests for branch renaming,
  2006-11-28) and probably pre-dated the solidifying of that
  convention. But in any case, that edge case is not our bug or
  problem right now.

* "git reflog expire <ref>":

  In files_reflog_expire() we'll call this without previous ref
  existence checking in files-backend.c, but that code is in turn
  called by code that's just finished checking if the refname whose
  reflog we're expiring exists.

  See ae35e16cd43 (reflog expire: don't lock reflogs using previously
  seen OID, 2021-08-23) for the current state of that code, and
  5e6f003ca8a (reflog_expire(): ignore --updateref for symbolic
  references, 2015-03-03) for the code we'd break if we only did a
  "update = !!ref" here, which is covered by the aforementioned
  regression test in "t1417-reflog-updateref.sh".

Onboarding visual/flow updates; require permission prompting (#1878)

Fixes #380. Fixes #1794. Fixes #350. Fixes #722.

## Summary
- Pulls all of the onboarding steps out of segue-based storyboards and into code.
- Merges authentication with scanning/manual, reducing steps in auth.
- Removes the "checklist" final screen.
- Supports going 'back' through onboarding steps, e.g. an error after entering a URL.
- Moves permissions from an opt-in "which would you like?" to a required "you must accept/decline this permission" for each permission. See notes below for why.
- Removes the team migration warning from last year.
- Adds landscape & dynamic type support to onboarding. I didn't bother to make the DT do live-updating though.
- Fills in internal & external URL, sets active SSID if possible after location permission.
- Connects to internal URL from discovery instead of base (external) URL.
- Allows onboarding to a server which requests, but does not require, client certificates.
- Allows starting Onboarding skipping the Welcome screen, connects this to the 'add server' row in app configuration when in debug mode.
- Stops calling api/discovery_info for testing connectivity.
- Handles Bonjour updates and removals in the scanning screen.

## Any other notes
Apple is actively blocking 2021.10 (only on iOS) because of an unwritten part of [rule 5.1.1](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1), saying:

> **Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage**
> 
> We noticed your app encourages or directs users to allow the app to access the location. Specifically, your app directs the user to grant permission in the following way(s):
>
> - A message appears before the permission request, and the user can close the message and delay the permission request with the "Continue" button. The user should always proceed to the permission request after the message.
> 
> Permission requests give users control of their personal information. It is important to respect their decision about how their data is used.

This is of course referring to our screen which looks like this:

<img width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74188/136716566-349558d4-d343-4ede-acd6-83b4e66742bc.png">

I love that they're cherry-picking the location part of this when we allow users to do a number of things on this screen. I believe the part of 5.1.1 that they are alluding to here is:

> (iv) Access: Apps must respect the user’s permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access. For example, apps that include the ability to post photos to a social network must not also require microphone access before allowing the user to upload photos. Where possible, provide alternative solutions for users who don’t grant consent. For example, if a user declines to share Location, offer the ability to manually enter an address.

They do link to the Human Interface Guidelines' [Accessing User Data](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/accessing-user-data/) whose section "Displaying Custom Messaging Before the Alert" says:

> **Make it clear that opening the system alert is the only action people can take in your custom-messaging screen.** People can interpret a pre-alert message as a delaying tactic, so it’s critical to let them quickly dismiss the message and view the system alert. If you display a custom screen that precedes a privacy-related permission request, it must offer only one action, which must display the system alert. Use a word like "Continue" to title the action; don’t use "Allow" or other terms that might make people think they’re granting their permission or performing other actions within your custom screen.

I do not believe that we're showing a pre-alert message since we're showing numerous options and allowing the user to pick and choose. Oh well. This new onboarding has improvements in other ways, and maybe is _more_ clear about permissions and what they do, so lemons into lemonade I guess.

Kim Jung Gi - How to Become a Master

He drew this from memory? That is skill.

https://youtu.be/aoqu5SEFqRI?t=437

His skill is very high, 5/5 even at a glance, but his particular style is not the most appealing.

https://youtu.be/aoqu5SEFqRI?t=638

Here he is drawing a skeleten together with the outline.

I remember in his other vid he recommended using refs instead of drawing from memory.

Actually I had no idea that satelite images can be so detailed. I thought they would be more top down as well rather than curved. This could be pretty useful.

Bevel Better with the Bevel Modifier | Blender 2.93

Let me move on to this. Then I'll finish the mesh playlist.

3:10pm. https://youtu.be/ID09Y28kvTo?t=255

Vertex groups are a thing. Blender really has it all. It is quite a complex program, but I'll digest it eventually.

https://youtu.be/ID09Y28kvTo?t=350

Quite intricate. These 3d modeling programs are powerful.

https://youtu.be/ID09Y28kvTo?t=572

Ah, while working on that Man and Gorilla scene, I was wondering why there were lighting related creases. It seems that I needed to harden the normals somehow.

3:30pm. It might have been better to leave the Bevel modifier tutorial for later. I'll end up revisiting it if ever I need to.

> A lot of concept artists use 3d programs because they want to get proportions and perspective right.

Yeah, I picked correctly. I do need to learn 3d modeling for what I want to do.

3:45pm. Ok, done. Let me finally resume the playlist. I want to finish it today.

3:55pm. Nevermind these last 3 videos. They are just for those coming in from Blender 2.7.

I do not feel like watching them. Let me move on.

4pm. https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/qa6a4i/very_slow_compile_times_15s_with_llvmsys_as_a/

I am reading this PL sub thread instead of studying 3d modeling.

Right now I have a choice between texturing and character creation courses.

Character creation seems to be using sculpting. Right now I am sleepy from watching all these videos and do no feel like doing anything, but for that reason I think I should skip texturing and challenge myself to do something concrete. Work on a hand or work on a head or whatever. Texturing itself does not feel that challenigng, and probably the course is under two hours.

Sculpting is fun and difficult. I should start playing with it seriously.

https://pingcap.com/blog/rust-compilation-model-calamity

///

The Rust programming language was designed for slow compilation times.

I mean, that wasn't the goal. As is often cautioned in debates among their designers, programming language design is full of tradeoffs. One of those fundamental tradeoffs is run-time performance vs. compile-time performance, and the Rust team nearly always (if not always) chose run-time over compile-time.

So Rust compile times are bad. This is kinda infuriating, as almost everything that matters about Rust is pretty damn good. But Rust compile times are so, so bad.

///

Let me just read this for a bit and then I will start.

Setting up a base mesh | Blender 2.8 Character Creation Course | PART 1

Let me start with this. It is time to start building up my basics.

> It is a lot harder to sculpt with a mouse than with a tablet.

I'll skip it for now. If I can get some measure of skill with a mouse I'll move to a tablet.

Hmmm, where do I get his ref image?

Sigh, I'd have to pay 5$ per month to become his parton. Too expensive. I do not have any income to spend on anything.

I'll just take a screenshot and extract it from the video. Then I'll cut it out in Paint. Or maybe Illustrator.

4:25pm. Sigh, by now I've forgotten how Illustrator works.

4:30pm. Ok, I figured it out. There is a Crop Image option in there.

4:45pm. https://youtu.be/13u5Z3geizQ?list=PLdFBjtsWmM962XPHTt3mMr6NpM48uXIks&t=312

Damn it, I thought he would start out with sculpting, but he is starting out with some modifiers. I have no idea what skin and subdivision do.

How is he extruding the shape? I've merged everything into a single point, so I can't select any of them.

Looking at it more carefully I see he has vertices. When did that happen. Did he maybe apply a modifier? I need to backtrack.

Let me check out his modifier tuts.

No he only has the Bever and the Array ones. Let me backtrack the video and I'll pay more careful attention to what he is doing.

4:55pm. https://youtu.be/13u5Z3geizQ?list=PLdFBjtsWmM962XPHTt3mMr6NpM48uXIks&t=292

Yeah, I see his object has vertices already.

> Hey man. Thankyou so much for creating this tutorial.  Is there anything I should do different for a low poly character?

> You'll probably want to just manipulate the mesh using proportional editing and skip sculpting

Checking out the comments.

I am going to ask about where the vertices are coming from. I am going to have to find another tutorial, or try to get this to run without the modifiers.

5:10pm. Oh wow it is this late already.

Ok, let me go through the texturing course instead since things are like this.

You'll probably want to just manipulate the mesh using proportional editing and skip sculpting

I really should be following this along using an example instead of just watching, but this material should really come after I am done with everything else. It is not important right now.

6pm. Lunch time.

6:20pm. Let me resume. I want to watch the tutorials for a while longer. I started late today.

My effort has slackened. Long was the time when I was getting up at 7am.

6:30pm. Ok, enough. This is too unmotivated. I am not getting enough from these videos at the moment to warrant paying attention to them. What I need to do is have an model that I want to texture. That would make things stick.

What I should do here is get some practice in modeling actual characters. There should be a Blender 2.93 tutorial somewhere if I look. Sculpting directly is a bit too much, I'd like to be able to do low poly stuff in edit mode to get the shape down. After that I'll get practice putting in the fine details.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+2.9

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xAumJRKV6A
MODELLING For Absolute Beginners | Blender Human Tutorial

This really feels up my alley. I should be ready for this now. I'll leave it for tomorrow.

6:45pm. Honestly, the goblin head video was a bit too rough, since I did not have a complete reference from the start and was just playing around. I'll be able to move to 2/5 in my art skill once I am able to use the sculpting tools to achieve the effects that I want.

Right now when it comes to the grab and snake hook tools, I still feel very awkward with them. I do not know how to not make using them with the mouse take the exact path that I want. Instead the manipulation is done in a weird circular way around the viewport. This makes things strange.

Also I am not sure what the radius and strength should be for any particular action.

So the challenge is pretty similar to putting lines in the right place when 2d drawing. I am going to need focused practice to break through. 3d modeling will be easier to gain skill in. While 3d is harder than 2d, I am also getting a lot more help from the computer in the endeavor and the resources are better.

6:55pm. Tomorrow, I am going to get some serious modeling done. Today I meant to do a little, but got bit by that modifier difference. But the desire is there and I won't be perturbed. I know that basics of how to use the modeling and sculpting tools. Now I just need to apply them."
