  Change to LogRecord.__init__() to fix #1206. Note that archaic use of type(x) == types.DictType is because of keeping 1.5.2 compatibility. While this is much less relevant these days, there probably needs to be a separate commit for removing all archaic constructs at the same time.

  tuple.__repr__ did not consider a reference loop as it is not possible from
  Python code; but it is possible from C.  object.__str__ had the issue of not
  expecting a type to doing something within it's tp_str implementation that
  could trigger an infinite recursion, but it could in C code..  Both found
  thanks to BaseException and how it handles its repr.

  Closes issue #1686386.  Thanks to Thomas Herve for taking an initial stab at
  coming up with a solution.

  Made the various is_* operations return booleans.  This was discussed
  with Cawlishaw by mail, and he basically confirmed that to these is_*
  operations, there's no need to return Decimal(0) and Decimal(1) if
  the language supports the False and True booleans.

  Also added a few tests for the these functions in extra.decTest, since
  they are mostly untested (apart from the doctests).

  Thanks Mark Dickinson

  or if another process is already using one of the predefined ports.)

  Issue #1580738.  When HTTPConnection reads the whole stream with read(),
  it closes itself.  When the stream is read in several calls to read(n),
  it should behave in the same way if HTTPConnection knows where the end
  of the stream is (through self.length).  Added a test case for this
  behaviour.

Merge #64060

64060: kvserver: fix delaying of splits with uninitialized followers r=erikgrinaker a=tbg

Bursts of splits (i.e. a sequence of splits for which each split splits
the right-hand side of a prior split) can cause issues. This is because
splitting a range in which a replica needs a snapshot results in two
ranges in which a replica needs a snapshot where additionally there
needs to be a sequencing between the two snapshots (one cannot apply
a snapshot for the post-split replica until the pre-split replica has
moved out of the way). The result of a long burst of splits such as
occurring in RESTORE and IMPORT operations is then an overload of the
snapshot queue with lots of wasted work, unavailable followers with
operations hanging on them, and general mayhem in the logs. Since
bulk operations also write a lot of data to the raft logs, log
truncations then create an additional snapshot burden; in short,
everything will be unhappy for a few hours and the cluster may
effectively be unavailable.

This isn't news to us and in fact was a big problem "back in 2018".
When we first started to understand the issue, we introduced a mechanism
that would delay splits (#32594) with the desired effect of ensuring
that, all followers had caught up to ~all of the previous splits.
This helped, but didn't explain why we were seeing snapshots in the
first place.

Investigating more, we realized that snapshots were sometimes spuriously
requested by an uninitialized replica on the right-hand side which was
contacted by another member of the right-hand side that had already been
initialized by the split executing on the left-hand side; this snapshot
was almost always unnecessary since the local left-hand side would
usually initialize the right-hand side moments later.  To address this,
in #32594 we started unconditionally dropping the first ~seconds worth
of requests to an uninitialized range, and the mechanism was improved in
 #32782 and will now only do this if a local neighboring replica is
expected to perform the split soon.

With all this in place, you would've expected us to have all bases
covered but it turns out that we are still running into issues prior
to this PR.

Concretely, whenever the aforementioned mechanism drops a message from
the leader (a MsgApp), the leader will only contact the replica every
second until it responds. It responds when it has been initialized via
its left neighbor's splits and the leader reaches out again, i.e.  an
average of ~500ms after being initialized. However, by that time, it is
itself already at the bottom of a long chain of splits, and the 500ms
delay is delaying how long it takes for the rest of the chain to get
initialized.  Since the delay compounds on each link of the chain, the
depth of the chain effectively determines the total delay experienced at
the end. This would eventually exceed the patience of the mechanism that
would suppress the snapshots, and snapshots would be requested. We would
descend into madness similar to that experienced in the absence of the
mechanism in the first place.

The mechanism in #32594 could have helped here, but unfortunately it
did not, as it routinely missed the fact that followers were not
initialized yet. This is because during a split burst, the replica
orchestrating the split was typically only created an instant before,
and its raft group hadn't properly transitioned to leader status yet.
This meant that in effect it wasn't delaying the splits at all.

This commit adjusts the logic to delay splits to avoid this problem.
While clamoring for leadership, the delay is upheld. Once collapsed
into a definite state, the existing logic pretty much did the right
thing, as it waited for the right-hand side to be in initialized.

Closes #61396.

cc @cockroachdb/kv

Release note (bug fix): Fixed a scenario in which a rapid sequence
of splits could trigger a storm of Raft snapshots. This would be
accompanied by log messages of the form "would have dropped incoming
MsgApp, but allowing due to ..." and tended to occur as part of
RESTORE/IMPORT operations.

shortlog: remove unused(?) "repo-abbrev" feature

Remove support for the magical "repo-abbrev" comment in .mailmap
files. This was added to .mailmap parsing in [1], as a generalized
feature of the git-shortlog Perl script added earlier in [2].

There was no documentation or tests for this feature, and I don't
think it's used in practice anymore.

What it did was to allow you to specify a single string to be
search-replaced with "/.../" in the .mailmap file. E.g. for
linux.git's current .mailmap:

    git archive --remote=git@gitlab.com:linux-kernel/linux.git \
        HEAD -- .mailmap | grep -a repo-abbrev
    # repo-abbrev: /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/

Then when running e.g.:

    git shortlog --merges --author=Linus -1 v5.10-rc7..v5.10 | grep Merge

We'd emit (the [...] is mine):

      Merge tag [...]git://git.kernel.org/.../tip/tip

But will now emit:

      Merge tag [...]git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip

I think at this point this is just a historical artifact we can get
rid of. It was initially meant for Linus's own use when we integrated
the Perl script[2], but since then it seems he's stopped using it.

Digging through Linus's release announcements on the LKML[3] the last
release I can find that made use of this output is Linux 2.6.25-rc6
back in March 2008[4]. Later on Linus started using --no-merges[5],
and nowadays seems to prefer some custom not-quite-shortlog format of
merges from lieutenants[6].

You will still see it on linux.git if you run "git shortlog" manually
yourself with --merges, with this removed you can still get the same
output with:

    git log --pretty=fuller v5.10-rc7..v5.10 |
    sed 's!/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/!/.../!g' |
    git shortlog

Arguably we should do the same for the search-replacing of "[PATCH]"
at the beginning with "". That seems to be another relic of a bygone
era when linux.git patches would have their E-Mail subject lines
applied as-is by "git am" or whatever. But we documented that feature
in "git-shortlog(1)", and it seems more widely applicable than
something purely kernel-specific.

Refactor Python and Cython internals for groupby aggregation (#7818)

This PR makes some improvements to the groupby/aggregation code that I identified while working on #7731. The main purpose is to make the code logic easier to follow and reduce some unnecessary complexity; I see minor but measurable performance improvements (2-5% for small datasets) as well, but those are mostly just side effects here. Specifically, it makes the following changes:

1. Inlines the logic for dropping unsupported aggregations. The old function was repetitive and necessitated looping over the aggregations twice, whereas the new approach drops unwanted aggregations on the fly so it only loops once. The new code also makes it so that you only construct a C aggregation object once.
2. Merges the logic from `_AggregationFactory` into `Aggregation`, and removes the constructor for `Aggregation`. The one downside here is that the Cython `Aggregation` object's constructor no longer places it in a valid state; however, in practice the object is always constructed via either the `make_aggregation` function or its various factories, and the object's constructor was only every used in `_drop_unsupported_aggs` anyway. The benefit is we remove the fragmentation between these two classes, making the code much more readable, and the `Aggregation` class actually serves a purpose now beyond just providing a single property `kind` that is only used once: it is now the primary way that other Cython files interact with aggregations. This also means that in most places other Cython modules don't need to work with `unique_ptr[aggregation]` as much anymore (although they do still have to move `Aggregation.c_obj` for performance reasons). `make_aggregation` now returns the Cython class instead of the underlying C++ one.
3. Modified all the "allowed aggregations" sets to use the uppercase names of the aggregations. In addition to simplifying the code a tiny bit, this helps reduce confusion between the aggregation names used in Python for pandas compatibility and the libcudf names (for instance, `idxmin` vs `argmin`, now `ARGMIN`).
4. Explicitly defines all the aggregations on a groupby. I discussed this briefly with @shwina, the change has pros and cons. The benefit is that all of these methods are properly documented now, there's less magic (the binding of methods to a class after its definition can be confusing for less experienced Python developers and has a lot of potential gotchas), and we can use the simpler string-based agg definition wherever possible. The downside is that we now have to define all of these methods. I think the change is definitely an improvement, but I'm happy to change it back if anyone can suggest a better alternative. In the long run we probably need to find a way to share both code and docstrings more effectively between all aggregations (DataFrame, Series, and GroupBy).

[script] [tendme] Add background monitoring mode; use DRCH


### Background
* `tendme` is duplicating logic for parsing bleeders from your health; should use DRCH instead.
* `tendme` will exit the script after tending a wound (likely a bug in the script), it won't stay perpetually in passive mode monitoring for new bleeders.

### Changes
* Use DRCH common methods for parsing health and identifying wounds
* Add optional argument 'monitor' to put script into passive loop to retend as needed
* Add optional argument 'train' to unwrap and tend wounds to maximize experience
* Encapsulate logic in a class and use `events` module instead of the low-level `scripts.get` 

### Usage
* `;tendme [train] [monitor]`
  - `train` will unwrap and rewrap bandages to maximize experience
  - `monitor` will enter passive loop and retend bleeders when bandages fall off
  - if not in monitor mode (default) then will check health and tend bleeders once then exit

## Tests

### should rewrap wound when bandages fall off
```
> ,tendme monitor

...

The bandages binding your chest become useless and fall apart.

> 
[tendme]>tend my chest

You work carefully at tending your wound.
Doing your best, you only manage to reduce the bleeding a little.
Roundtime: 10 sec.
```

### should train by unwrapping wounds when bandages are ready to be changed
```
> ,tendme train

--- Lich: tendme active.

...

You feel like now might be a good time to change the bandages on your neck.
> 
[tendme]>unwrap my neck

The bandages binding your neck become useless and fall apart.

You unwrap your bandages.
[Roundtime: 20 seconds]

[tendme]>tend my neck

You work carefully at tending your wound.
Doing your best, you are able to stop the bleeding.
Roundtime: 1 sec.
> 
[tendme]>health

```

### should not try to tend clotted, tended, or internal bleeders
```

"4:10pm. I spent the whole day in bed pitting the local updates against moving averages in my head. And the moving averages are winning. Shit.

I came to some new insights. I realized that I can't propagate targets after all. They are too distinct from signals. A signal is a gradient vector, but a target is a fixed point. If I do local optimization using targets, what would happen on the second pass in places where the signal would otherwise be 0?

They would be fixed to the old values. There is a large difference between propagating signals and propagating targets. A gradient of zero does not mean stay where you are. Gradients can be summed up. What would I do with targets?

The reason GANs work (as opposed to autoencoders) is probably because the decoder can instruct the generator to attend to the image in pieces. If the targets were fixed and I took multiple iterations through the dataset that would get wrecked.

So targets are out. What about optimizing gradient signals directly?

They are ironic - in RNNs for example, with the usual updates, small weights would cause the gradients to vanish and large weights would cause them to blow up. But if I do my local kind of reversal training what would happen is that small weights would result in large signals and give me the opposite problem!

Gah!

In contrast, a simple moving average to correct the propagated gradients would give me what I want.

4:25pm. I am dying here. On my tombstone it will say that I was overrun by a moving average.

Let me watch that unsupervised learning Deepmind.

I just can't grasp that orgasmic: 'YES IT ALL MAKES SENSE' when it comes to deep learning. Everything feels like shit.

https://youtu.be/f0s-uvvXvWg?t=1496

This is great, if only I knew how it could be done! It does not even matter if I could understand it personally, it would be enough if one of my agents understood it.

https://youtu.be/f0s-uvvXvWg?t=1526

She is starting to talk about physics. Ok, maybe this lecture will be worth watching after all. I am going to make an effort to study physics for inspiration at some point.

https://youtu.be/f0s-uvvXvWg?t=2307

Ok, I apologize. This is not bad. These lectures are definitely worth watching.

5pm. https://youtu.be/f0s-uvvXvWg?t=2913

If I could do all this, my faith in neural networks would be way higher. I would not have trouble getting on with it then.

Sigh...

Yeah, moving averages are the right answer. So is replay buffer shaping. Replacing KFAC with moving averages will only increase its roboustness. Regular KFAC requires a big identity matrix in order to be inverted and work properly. In constrast, a single scalar L1 norm of the inputs and the gradients will not require an epsilon to be added to it.

I am put my faith in these two techniques. Local training does not have any advantages over global one. At most, it will rescale the gradients, but a moving average would be a far better solution for this.

Hmmmm...

I'll be looking forward to this. Let me finish the lecture I am watching.

7:05pm. Does it make sense to use the weights for the reverse paths? Would it be possible to train something like a GAN with feedback alignment?

7:10pm. No, I do not think it would be possbile. That serves as a proof that backprop does make sense.

In the morning I spent the entirety of it thinking how I would make a probabilistic version of backprop. I thought of making a backward pass, but turning the gradients into probabilities. Normalize the weights into probabilities, make sure that the input gradients are also normalized, and progate them backward like that.

This would be something sensible on the face of it. But the immediate problem that I've realized is that this would run into the vanishing gradient problem. The deeper the net and the more numerous the parameters, the more the gradient probabilities would get spread out.

The solution, if I assume that particular credit assignment scheme is right is to then modulate the activity. Monitor the activity level and amplify it when the credit assignment is not sufficient.

But that would really be the same thing as starting with regular backprop rules and just using a moving average to modulate the activity later. There is no point in trying to normalize the weights for the reverse pass.

7:25pm. I've been trying to think up some rules, but between the nonlinearities blocking credit assignment and probabilities watering down the signal, the gradients would be very shallow.

7:30pm. If I can convince myself that training something like an GAN would be impossible with anything other than backprop like rules, then I can be certain that the rule are right and that proper modulation is the true secret of credit assignment.

I think that an autoencoder might be possible with feedback alignment, though not an symmetric one.

7:35pm. Ok, I think I can see a few ways that feedback alignment, meaning something other than the weights used for the forward pass when used on the reverse pass could lead to optimization not working.

7:40pm. Yeah, it is right. I can't imagine anything being more right than the backprop rules. The original weights have all the path information.

Deep Learning - The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

Let me read this thing.

> Even translation invariance, the property that motivated the original architectural design behind CNNs (Fukushima 1980, LeCun et al. 1998, Riesenhuber & Poggio 1999), has been shown to be surprisingly limited, in contrast to common belief (Azulay & Weiss 2018). In fact, the deeper is the network, the less invariance to translation it exhibits, with a shift by only a few pixels greatly affecting the network output.

I hadn't known about this.

DeepMind x UCL | Deep Learning Lectures | 8/12 | Attention and Memory in Deep Learning

Let me have dinner here. I'll take a look at this after that.

8:45pm. If backprop really was a bad method, would something like GAN training even be remotely possible? I keep thinking it is bad and trying to convince myself to find something better, but after I adjust for the scaling issues using modulation, is what I have left over that problematic?

8:50pm. I keep thinking, what if some kind of physical system is the answer. Some kind of physical system that has a notion of credit assignment and its of capacity.

But even if that is so, what about ANNs? Would such a system be any simpler than ANNs?

ANNs are pared down to the very bones. I can't imagine something simpler than its rules. Anything more, would invariably have to be more complex.

8:55pm. In some ways, this is the biggest hurdle I can face. In 2018 I spent the entire year not trusting deep learning and trying to exceed it by arcane optimizers.

I have done any concrete work, but before I do that, it only makes sense that I begin with this struggle. It only makes sense to put all of my experience together and decide whether I want to put my faith in the current methods.

I do not want to go into the future thinking that what I will be using here is wrong at its root.

If I am going to use backprop, I want to believe in it. Let me watch the other Deepmind lecture.

I am not doing any work, but this is the opposite of a vacation. My mind is very much active.

I think I am going to converge at this rate on backprop being right after all. It is amazing how much it would take to convince me.

9pm. Damn it, I really actually quite tired at this point. As much as the situation with my mom is raising the tension for me, putting in work at this time in the day is not going to get me anywhere. Thinking, and reading and watching these lectures is not nothing even though it is not my stated goal.

If I can convince myself that backprop rules + modulation is the way, then I will have no hesitation towards resuming programming. I am going to go all out and put every fiber of my being into making the poker CFR agent a success.

9:05pm. Let me try to wind off a bit here. Let me close for the day here."

iipass_flags handling refactor + rewrites a part of projectiles for the n-th time (#54924)

Yeah uhh this'll probably need testmerging even after it's done because yeah it's a bit big.
If y'all want me to atomize this into two PRs (pass flags vs projectiles) tell me please. Pass flags would have to go in first though, in that case, as new projectile hit handling will rely on pass_flags_self.
Pass flags:

Pass flags handling now uses an atom variable named pass_flags_self.
If any of these match a pass_flag on a thing trying to pass through, it's allowed through by default.
This makes overriding CanAllowThrough unnecessary for the majority of things. I've however not removed overrides for very.. weird cases, like plastic flaps which uses a prob(60) for letting PASSGLASS things through for god knows why.
LETPASSTHROW is now on pass_flags_self
Projectiles:

Not finalized yet, need to do something to make the system I have in mind have less unneeded overhead + snowflake

Basically, for piercing/phasing/otherwise projectiles that go through things instead of hitting the first dense object, I have them use pass_flags flags for two new variables, projectile_phasing and projectile_piercing. Anything with pass_flags_self in the former gets phased through entirely. Anything in the latter gets hit, and the projectile then goes through. on_hit will also register a piercing hit vs a normal hit (so things like missiles can only explode on a normal hit or otherwise, instead of exploding multiple times. Not needed as missiles qdel(src) right now but it's nice to have for the future).

I still need to decide what to do for hit handling proper, as Bump() is still preferred due to it not being as high-overhead as something like scanning on Moved(). I'm thinking I'll make Moved() only scan for cases where it needs to hit a non-dense object - a prone human the user clicked on, anything special like that. Don't know the exact specifics yet, which is why this is still WIP.

Projectiles now use check_pierce() to determine if it goes through something and hits it, doesn't hit it, or doesn't go through something at all (should delete self after hitting). Will likely make an on_pierce proc to be called post-piercing something so you can have !fun! things like projectiles that go down in damage after piercing something. This will likely deprecate the process_hit proc, or at least make it less awful.

scan_for_hit() is now used to attempt to hit something and will return whether the projectile got deleted or not. It will delete the projectile if the projectile does hit something and fails to pierce through it.

scan_moved_turf() (WIP) will be used for handling moving onto a turf.

permutated has been renamed to impacted. Ricocheting projectiles get it reset, allowing projectiles to pierce and potentially hit something again if it goes back around.

A new unit test has been added checking for projectiles with movement type of PHASING. This is because PHASING completely causes projectiles to break down as projectiles mainly sense collisions through Bump. The small boost in performance from using PHASING instead of having all pass flags active/overriding check_pierce is in my opinion not worth the extra snowflake in scan_moved_turf() I'd have to do to deal with having to check for hits manually rather than Bump()ing things.
Movement types

UNSTOPPABLE renamed to PHASING to better describe what it is, going through and crossing everything but not actually bumping.
Why It's Good For The Game

Better pass flags handling allows for less proc overrides, bitflag checks are far less expensive in general.

Fixes penetrating projectiles like sniper penetrators

This system also allows for better handling of piercing projectiles (see above) without too much snowflake code, as you'd only need to modify on_pierce() if you needed to do special handling like dampening damage per target pierced, and otherwise you could just use the standardized system and just set pass flags to what's needed. If you really need a projectile that pierces almost everything, override check_pierce(), which is still going to be easier than what was done before (even with snowflake handling of UNSTOPPABLE flag process_hit() was extremely ugly, now we don't rely on movement types at all.)
