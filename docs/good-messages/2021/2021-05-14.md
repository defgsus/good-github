CURE SPRAY!

"It turns out that the Bio-Virus is far less intimidating if you can just magic-wand it away. If you find infection too annoying, you can still disable it for players and/or NPCs." --Sninctbur

so uhhh yeah about that one homie

Much of the code here is borrowed/adapted from BA1, with the model being the same also (minus the recompile I had to do).

Context
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Content

Attribute Information:

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.

Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

See if you can find any other trends in heart data to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart health.

#### Friday 2021-05-14 10:54:36 by Marko Grdinić

"9:20am. I keep going to bed late, last night was 1am again, but I am waking up refreshed. Today I even had time to laze in bed for a while after waking up. Yesterday I speculated that sparsity and attention must be the secret behind long term credit assignment, but this is wrong. No matter what kind of method it is, sparsity and attention will be merely a band aid. You can squeeze out some fixed point amount of efficiency out of them, but usually that is at the expense of network capacity.

I've thought this through, including predicting the gradients, but no matter how I roll this issue, my conclusion remains the same - it is impossible to do exact long term credit assignment. Not just with backprop, but with zero order methods or anything else.

I might be going down the wrong track. The brain can do it, so I assumed that there should be a way for ANNs to do it as well, but that not necessarily be the case. Not via supervised or reinforcement learning that is.

If that is the case, that only leaves composing unsupervised learners at different timescales.

9:25am. I'll start with the synthetic gradients paper, but even though the idea seemed good to me at first I can now see that filtering out the information in the activations - the main reason why one would want to use a NN in the first place means that inevitably there will be bias unless a trace is kept. Predicting the gradients is not the answer.

If sparsity, attention and prediction is not the answer then nothing is.

I need a completely new paradigm to make sense of long term credit assignment. It might be a misnomer.

Let me read those papers.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343
Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients

> We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass -- amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.

Oh, they tried an RNN at different timescales. Nice.

> When applied to RNNs we show that using synthetic gradients allows RNNs to model much greater time horizons than the limit imposed by truncating backpropagation through time (BPTT).  We also show that using synthetic gradients to decouple a system of two RNNs running at different timescales can greatly increase training speed of the faster RNN.

> In this case, since the target error gradient δi is produced by backpropagating ˆδi+1 through layer i + 1, δi is not the true error gradient, but an estimate bootstrapped from synthetic gradient models later in the network. Surprisingly, this does not cause errors to compound and learning remains stable even with many layers,
as shown in Sect. 3.3.

9:50am. I saw this paper years ago when it came out, but did not care even a little about it. I am very interested in it now.

So maybe, predicting the gradient is the way to go. In the abstract they even talk about predicting the inputs.

They directly compare their synthetic algorithm as being analogous to TD learning.

>  The cosine similarity is on average very slightly positive, indicating that the direction of synthetic gradient is somewhat aligned with that of the target gradient, allowing the model to train. However, it is clear that the synthetic gradient is not tracking the true gradient very accurately, but this does not seem to impact the ability to train the classifiers.

It does seem to work well on toy problems. I'd like to see how this works on larger datasets. If it works on something like Imagenet I'd be sold.

...Actually, no. If I look carefully, it just extends the backprop horizon by 10x. That is not enough to get me to where I want to go.

The training error is horrible too. Actually this paper is a good example why synthetic gradients are not a good idea.

> The synthetic gradient is scaled by a factor of 0.1 when consumed by the model (we found that this reliably leads to stable training).

And there are instabilities.

Let me read the papers that refer to it.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03419
Training Deep Architectures Without End-to-End Backpropagation: A Brief Survey

Let me go for this next.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9395703
Advancing Neuromorphic Computing With Loihi - A Survey of Results and Outlook

https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14331
A Theoretical Framework for Target Propagation

> Furthermore, our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of difference target propagation (DTP), a well-known variant of TP, in the realistic scenario of non-invertible neural networks. We provide a first solution to this problem through a novel reconstruction loss that improves feedback weight training, while simultaneously introducing architectural flexibility by allowing for direct feedback connections from the output to each hidden layer. Our theory is corroborated by experimental results that show significant improvements in performance and in the alignment of forward weight updates with loss gradients, compared to DTP.

10:30pm. Let me read the Target Prop paper. After that I'll go for the talk by Bengio. I skipped it yesterday.

>  However, by introducing a new reconstruction loss used for training the feedback functions gi , we can ensure that the DTP method propagates approximate GN targets

This is an interesting paper. It outright talks about invertibility.

10:55am. > From a machine learning perspective, the TP framework has inspired new training methods for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Manchev and Spratling, 2020; Ororbia et al., 2020; DePasquale et al., 2018; Abbott et al., 2016)

It might be worth checking this out. Target prop definitely has connections to ZORB.

Ah, yes, I said I would watch Bengio's talk on Beyond Backprop. Let me get to it.

> However, for upstream layers, future studies are required for further improvement, e.g. by investigating better feedback parameterizations or by using dynamical inversion (Podlaski and Machens, 2020).

Oh, what is this dynamic inversion thing?

https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05112
Biological credit assignment through dynamic inversion of feedforward networks

I should definitely read this paper. First come the talk by Bengio.

11:15am. At 14m he talks about point predictions not making sense here.

11:30am. Let me take a break and then I'll go for the paper I've linked to.

11:50am. Let me do a bit more and then I will have breakfast. Let me read the dynamic inversion paper.

> As mentioned above, learning can sometimes be achieved with a fixed random feedback matrix, a strategy termed feedback alignment (FA), in part due to the observed alignment between the forward weights and the pseudoinverse of the feedback weights during training (Lillicrap et al., 2016). The authors of this study also describe a biologically-implausible idealization of this algorithm, pseudobackprop (PBP), which propagates errors through the pseudoinverse of the current feedforward weights.

I had no idea that feedback alignment already considered inversion.

12:10pm. https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15139
Deriving Differential Target Propagation from Iterating Approximate Inverses

Bengio is the sole author on this paper.

12:30pm. It feels like I've read this paper before, but that is impossible given its date of release. This target prop stuff feels quite similar to stuff I've researched while writing the reversible learning draft.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01342
LoCo: Local Contrastive Representation Learning

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9395703

I'll leave these two for later.

12:40pm.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09108
Fully Decoupled Neural Network Learning Using Delayed Gradients

This paper caught my attention. I am looking up citations for synthetic gradients. I want to digest all that there is on this subject. If I can conclude that synthetic gradients are a dead end, I can open up my mind to some other approaches I am thinking of.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15045
Reservoir Transformer

I'll add this paper to the mix as well. I am just interested how they would work.

12:55pm. Let me have that breakfast."

[native] Don't update deviceToken in Redux unless setDeviceToken API request succeeds

Summary:
Adrian experienced an issue on Android where he wasn't getting notifs delivered for some reason. He was able to solve it by logging out and in, but it was a pretty negative experience.

I read through the code in an effort to guess at what might have happened. The fact that logging out and in again solved the issue strongly indicates that the server had the wrong device token. But the native side is supposed to keep track of the device token in Redux, and inform the server whenever it changes.

I have a guess at what happened. I noticed that currently we update the `deviceToken` on `setDeviceTokenActionTypes.started`. But what if that request fails? In that case, the client will think the server has the correct device token, but the server will still have the old one.

In this diff I update it to use `setDeviceTokenActionTypes.success`, so we only update it on the client's Redux store if it can confirm the server received the request. Until the device token is updated in Redux, on every foreground the app will try to register the new device token. So it should eventually get updated once a connection with the server can successfully be established.

Test Plan: I honestly am just relying on Flow here. I really don't have much time to test this today, and it's a pretty complicated thing to test since notifs are hard to get working in the local dev environment

Remove old apache tests (#8843)

Apache test farm tests started failing last night due to a change in pyenv. See https://dev.azure.com/certbot/certbot/_build/results?buildId=3948&view=logs&j=f67c2a39-2c4f-5190-915f-6f32a7a4306f&t=96f0f394-f513-5158-f5e7-a26e55aeadbf&l=26943.

I managed to fix that in https://github.com/certbot/certbot/commit/d94f20f8b709e088b0c3036683bbda88b354f254, however, the OSes the tests were failing on were Debian 9 and Ubuntu 16.04. [Debian 9 reached its end-of-life in July 2020](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases) and [Ubuntu 16.04 reached its end of standard support in April 2021](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases). As shown at the same links, Debian 9 still has support from the LTS team and Ubuntu 16.04 has ESM support. Do we still want to support either of these OSes?

If so, we can use the commit I linked in the first sentence of the last paragraph, but I think supporting the OSes through their standard support is good enough. The Certbot team has enough on their plate and especially when the OSes are so old that we can't even use their packaged version of Python anymore which complicates our tests, I think we can just drop support and move on.

I don't have a strong opinion here though so if someone else does, let me know what you'd like to see or make the PR yourself based on the changes in my linked commit and I'll merge it.

You can see the tests passing with this change at https://dev.azure.com/certbot/certbot/_build/results?buildId=3955&view=results.

* Remove apache tests on old OSes

* remove unused pyenv code

"2:55pm. Done with chores. I need some time to cool down. Let me watch the Ancient Gods Ultra Nightmare playthrough by DraQu for a bit longer.

3:20pm. That was fun. Let me read the papers.

3:40pm. The delayed gradient one is nothing big. Forget it. You know what I feel like now, that Photonic chip talk. I know I have contempt for these companies, but I should keep up with the news. I wonder what they have to say.

3:50pm. I do not think that a chip that seriously bets on feedback alignment will pass muster. Partly because of that, but partly because if can't do more than that, it won't be flexible enough to be worth adopting.

3:55pm. Enough, I won't waste my time listening to this stupid sales pitch for LightOn. Just what was I thinking?

Let me skim the Reservoir Transformers paper.

> Beyond desirable efficiency gains, random layers are interesting for several additional reasons. Fixed randomly initialized networks (Gallicchio & Scardapane, 2020) converge to Gaussian processes in the limit of infinite width (Daniely et al., 2016), have intriguing interpretations in metric learning (Rosenfeld & Tsotsos, 2019; Giryes et al., 2016), and have been shown to provide excellent “priors” either for subsequent learning (Ulyanov et al., 2018) or pruning (Frankle & Carbin, 2018).

I wonder what is meant by random nets convering to GPs?

4:05pm. Nevermind, let me move on to the Loihi paper. I'll leave the best for last.

4:50pm. > While data-parallel architectures are able to efficiently compute batched dot products using their plentiful multiply-accumulator resources operating in parallel, they are extremely inefficient at executing the sequential top-k sorting operation. A high-speed implementation of the top-k computation on a GPU requires considerable effort and extra latency and is the focus of GPU k -NN search implementations. In contrast, the operation comes nearly for free for the Loihi SNN implementation since waiting for the earliest spikes to arrive consumes no incremental energy or time.

I actually implemented a Cuda kernel that zeroed out all but the top-k back in 2015. An interesting insight from that era is that it is possible to replace top-k with the relu activation (while keeping the nets the same) and the net would still work.

5:20pm. > The tight integration of memory and computation in neuromorphic architectures is both its blessing and its curse. The elimination of the von Neumann bottleneck frees the hardware implementation to splinter into an arbitrarily granular collection of tiny processing elements without any need for a monolithic memory. This is optimal for energy efficiency and sparsity but is potentially devastating for overall system cost.

> The overall economics of today’s semiconductor industry are highly optimized for the von Neumann architecture. The per-bit cost of monolithic dynamic random access memory (DRAM) is on the order of 100× cheaper than the per-bit cost of the densest memory available in a logic process. For large-scale memory-bound workloads, conventional architectures achieve a cost optimum by partitioning their physical implementation between cheap DRAM and expensive logic. A neuromorphic implementation must choose one or the other, and architecture as complex as Loihi’s, with over half of its silicon area devoted to logic circuits, can only be implemented in a logic process today. Hence, scaling up Loihi’s architecture comes at the cost of expensive logic state bits.

> For large-scale applications, this inevitably puts neuromorphic technology into a high-end niche. To broaden this niche, neuromorphic technology needs to add value for small-scale problems, which suggests that its first commercially viable applications will emerge at the edge and in tightly integrated sensors and robotic systems.

> Long-term, fundamental manufacturing technology innovations will be needed to reduce the cost of neuromorphic architectures. This could come from dense and cheaply integrated emerging memories, such as crossbars of resistive, magnetic, or phase change devices. Further cost gains could come from storing multiple bits per device, although a truly analog memory needs to maintain its density and cost advantages without forcing too much of the surrounding architectural elements into the analog domain, which would introduce its own cost challenges.

> Without breakthroughs in the density of low energy, high-speed CMOS-integrated memory, the cost will limit the proliferation of all but small-scale neuromorphic technology into mainstream devices—even once the architecture, algorithms, and software challenges are resolved.

Just when will memristors get here? I remember when 2015 was a long way away and they would be surely out by then.

5:25pm. > Feedforward networks and especially rate-coded feedforward networks are the least compelling match for Loihi, especially larger networks that perform significantly worse on Loihi. Great gains are possible when spike timing becomes computationally significant, whether through supervised optimization using backpropagation or through analytical design. All of the best performing workloads on Loihi make use of highly recurrent networks.

Now let me go for the Loco paper.

5:50pm. Ok, done. Let me gather my thoughts.

I had this idea earlier today, let me write it down now.

Remember the ensemble variance trick for deep exploration? In RL it should be possible to use value uncertainty by calculating the variance between the value nets in the ensemble and use it to multiply the policy weights.

Now imagine a GAN. Suppose in addition to the encoder and the critic, it is extended by having a ensemble of critics. What use would the critic uncertainty estimate have here?

It could be used to add the data point being sampled to the replay buffer. The critic ensemble variance could be the score that decides whether or not to filter the data point.

Once you have this sort of filtering you could have true hierarchies at multiple temporal scales.

And the trick in the Loco paper is significant. Optimizing overlaping regions instead of isolated ones is pure brilliance. Using this kind of architecture it would be possible to have true multi-temporal GANs.

6pm. Looking for ways of hacking hackprop to take advantage of sparsity or predicting the gradients ahead of time is not the way to go here.

In deep temporal hierarchies over very long time periods, even you assume having infinite memory for storing traces, the reward signals would be so sparse in the lower layers that it would be completely drowned out by the unsupervised learning the layer should be doing anyway.

Optimizing overlapping regions meshes better with the sponge model of learning.

A sponge absorbs water via the principle of least resistance, it absorbs water gradually and spreads out the wetness throughout its structure as it gets saturated.

In constrast, backprop will distrubute the credit signal fully throughout all the layers.

I am certain that the Loco model is right, and end to end kind of credit assignment that backprop does is wrong. But seen as a local training rule, I have nothing against it.

6:10pm. As for recurrent nets, there is nothing wrong with assuming them being able to have traces locally. In specialized hardware that kind of weight sharing across time is just free extra efficiency. But it is a local thing, I should not assume that a scheme exists for doing credit assignment beyond the fixed number of steps afforded by the trace length. There certainly won't be one for distributing information across arbitrary timescales.

There will be hacks to extend the horizon, but all of those will come with costs in complexity and capacity restrictions. They are not worth considering.

6:20pm. It would really be good if the duality gap algorithm for optimizing GANs pans out. That means that instead of those hacky contrastive learning losses, proper unsupervised learning could be done throughout the network.

6:25pm. I wouldn't use it though even if it worked. The reason? Training GANs is damn expensive. And those 10 extra interations that the duality gap requires to get stability won't come for cheap.

I wouldn't use unsupervised learning in general.

I have no choice, but to train a net directly. But for a lifelong learner, the things I am suggesting here would be necessary.

Hah...I want a chip like Loihi. I want something that is 1,000x more powerful than the current GPUs without increasing the wattage.

GPUs are going the wrong way, the latest 30x GPU series by Nvidia increased the flops by 2x while increasing the power consumption by 1.5.

I want to train systems that have deep layers and billions parameters in parallel without turning my room into a sauna.

6:30pm. GPUs are useless as far as getting to the next stage is concerned. If I got the latest 30x, I'd get 3x more memory and better performance, but that is it.

I need a real neuromorphic system.

6:45pm. Done with lunch. No news on memristors. They are as far away as ever.

7pm. I should close here. I've gone through all the motions that I wanted to.

The Loco paper is proof enough that it is worth putting faith into local learning. I've also worked out how to do long term credit assignment via unsupervised learning and critic ensembles.

Ah yeah, one last thing.

What we think as unsupervised learning is not necessarily that.

Whether it is images or something else, the kind of data we push into the network is heavily curated and distilled either way. More than just novelty, it might be possible to train a net to produce novel transformations of the data before putting it into the replay buffer to be trained.

Different hierarchies could be trained on different aspects of the original input.

There might be something on top down input influencing those decisions.

It is wrong to think that unsupervised learning is free form.

7:30pm. I see something right now that I couldn't before. The feedback connections might not be necessarily for propagating gradient signals. It might be for weight sharing. Because the only way to do global optimization via local ones is through weight sharing, suppose I had those temporal gans with critic ensembles and a feedforward filter for the inputs. Those filters are necessary if for nothing else, but to differentiate different modules from one another.

The GAN itself cannot train those filters, instead what could be done is to have the upper layer combine the original input with the GANs distilation of it and optimize that, along with inputs from different GAN modules. That would allow the filter nets to be trained.

7:35pm. I am not sure, something like that.

It does not matter too much, I think that figuring out the layer interleaving trick to implement the sponge concept of learning and then combining that with critic ensemble variance estimates to get replay buffer scores which would allow true long term temporal credit assignment is accomplishment enough.

This insight I had today is actually a fairly huge thing. I internalized a new principle.

7:45pm. The duality gap algorithm for optimizing GANs should stabilize their training, so this method is viable in the real world. I won't use it, but I really want to use it.

This is the right thing to do.

It would allow me to move to use real world data in the training of my RL agents rather than just pitting them against each other. It would allow me to succinctly add arbitrary new data sources into the system in a modular fashion.

7:55pm. The Loco paper and the one by Schmidhuber really awakened me to the possibilities of weight sharing.

Oh yes, regarding hindsight. Using hindsight information for the policy critic will be much easier with unsupervised learning throughout the hierarchy (if it does not work well already.) Just having the net do most of its learning in an unsupervised fashion will get rid of the need for the hacks in the counterfactual credit assignment paper.

8:10pm. Maybe the last two weeks have been worth it. These insights when collated together have the same worth as inventing the training regime I described in the PL update.

With this, I have a sensible route of advancement to the next level in my ML work.

After I make the first agent, I will know how to make a 100x better agent. I'll know where more compute would be worth throwing at. I'll know how to make good use of real world data and will be able to move beyond just self play.

8:20pm. The level after this will be AI chips like Loihi. It will be time to bring everything together, the insights from deep learning and from neuroscience to create an agent capable of autonomous self improvement.

I need to hold out until that point.

The last three weeks have really been a dream, but I think I should be done with the second round of insight generation. I'll try to focus on programming tomorrow. I just need to run forward and the agent will be done before too long. At this time, there aren't any papers I am interested in reading.

It does not matter if the Singularity happens in 5, 10 or 20 years. I should do things at my own pace. The most important thing is that the pace gets maintained. The dream must be kept alive."

vendor: notch-city: Add 3 mode display cutout handler [2/3]

[@AgentFabulous - POSP]
- Introduces the HideCutout and StatusBarStock overlay used in the
  3 mode display cutout handler. The HideCutout overlay is necessary
  since we can't register a content observer in the display manager code.
  We only have access to resources during boot. Thus, leave this as an
  overlay and let the config and overlay change methods handle this.
  Though we can probably do statusbar stock height toggling in the
  SystemUI code without overlays, I kinda got lazy by the end, just
  live with it god damn it xD
