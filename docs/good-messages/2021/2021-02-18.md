A little experiment with macros instead of build scripts.

This commit is basically me messing around with procedural macros,
to try them out as a potential future iteration of the UniFFI
developer experience.

As a crate author, I think it would be amazing not to have to
worry about .udl files and build scripts and what-not, but
instead be able to declare my API with a macro and have Rust
just take care of the details. This commit is a tiny experiment
in that direction, based on existing features of UniFFI.

The idea is that I can wrap my Rust code in a little macro
like this:

```
[uniffi_macros::declare_interface]
pub mod my_component {
  ...my rust code goes here...
}
```

And I can provide a corresponding `my_component.udl` file that
declares the interface, and all the Rust scaffolding code just
gets taken care of automagically.

I still have to provide a `.udl` file, but I hope you can imagine
one day the possibility of generating the interface definition
directly from the Rust code that is decorated by the macro.
Not any time soon! But one day...

Add files via upload

Section 1
Summary
Today we will write some programs involving text file input and output. We will be importing some new libraries that contain methods necessary for making file I/O work.

Part 1
In a class called Stats (template is provided), given a text file of doubles (see this lab’s Canvas page for a sample file), write a program that determines the average, the maximum, the minimum and how many numbers are in the following buckets: less than 0, between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive), and greater than or equal to 100.

Your program should print the following message to another file called “fileOut.txt”:


    Statistics for the numbers in fileIn.txt:
    average: <average>
    max: <max>
    min: <min>

    There are <negNum> negative numbers, <btw0and100> numbers between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive), and <geq100> numbers that are greater than or equal to 100.
  
(Optional Challenge - work on it after completing the rest of the lab!)

Write a program that generates a text file that can be used as input for the problem described above. Use your knowledge of file output, loops and the random method from the Math library. How random and in what range the numbers should be it totally up to you!

Part 2
In a class called Diary (template is provided), write a program that prompts users to enter the date as three integers separated by spaces (i.e mm dd yyyy) then it prompts them enter as many lines of prose they wish (for their to-do’s list or diary entry). Your program should store their entries at the end of a file called “diaryLog.txt” and old data should NOT be erased. Each entry should be formatted as follows (example for a diary entry entered on 7/14/2017):


    ...old stuff.
    Date: 07/14/2017
    Dear diary, today we had a midterm. I think it went ok, ..
  
Part 3
Write a program Advice.java that gives and takes advice on program writing. The program starts by writing a piece of advice to the screen and asking the user to type in a different piece of advice. The program then ends.

The next person to run the program receives the advice given by the person who last ran the program.

The advice is kept in a text file advice.txt and the content of the file changes after each run of the program. Furthermore, you should have another text file called adviceLog.txt, which starts off blank but with each run of the program it logs the advice that was given (without deleting the previous advices). You should allow theuser to type in advice of any length so that it can be any number of lines long. The user is told to end his orher advice by pressing the Return key two times. Your program can then test to see that it has reached the end of the input by checking to see when it reads an empty string "".

Input file: advice.txt

Section 2
Template: Lab6.javaPreview the document

Summary
Today we will write some programs involving String objects. Strings are widely used not only in Java, but in many other programming languages, as well. You can think of a string as a sequence of characters; strings and are treated as objects in Java and Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.

Part 1
Write a method that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence, named capitalizeFirstLetters. This method prints a capitalized version of a String to the screen -that is, it changes the first letter of each word in the string to upper case (if it is not already upper case). So "I really enjoy attending lab!" becomes "I Really Enjoy Attending Lab!". The string to be printed should be a parameter to the method, and the method should have a void return. You should test your method in main by getting a line of input from the user and applying the method to it.


        public static void capitalizeFirstLetters(String input) {
          //TODO: parse input for words and capitalize each one.
        }
      
Hint: You may want to browse the Java String docs for useful methods on strings, such as split().

Hint: You can usea new Scanner to get next() words out of a String.

Hint: StringTokenizer is a class that can do the same thing.

Write a method called nameInitials that takes one String as argument, pertaining to somebody's full name and returns a String of the name's initials. Usage example,


        String initials = nameInitials("Bertrand Arthur William Russell");
        System.out.println(initials);         //should print B.A.W.R.
      
Optional

Write a method called letterCount that takes two String arguments, one containing some text and the other containing a single letter. This method should then compute and return the count of all of the occurrences of that letter in the given text. Usage example,


        int countMs;
        countMs = letterCount("I am the very model of a modern major general", "m");
        System.out.println(countMs);       //should print 4
      
 

Part 2
Write a method called lexLargest that takes a string object argument containing some text. Your method should return the lexicographical largest word in the String object (that is, the one that would appear latest in the dictionary).


        String large = lexLargest ("I am the very model of a modern major general");
        System.out.println(large);   // should print : very
      
Write a method called largestBy that takes a string object argument containing some text. Your method should return the largest-by-length word in the String object. In case of ties, return the first occurrence of the largest word. Note the return type is String. Example,


        String large ;
        large = largestBy("I am the very model of a modern major general");
        System.out.println(large);                   // should print general
      
Optional

Now, using above two methods, see if you can combine them in one single method and still produce the same outputs? NOTE: use an integer to determine which algorithm your code will execute, e.g., String largestByAction(String inputText, int action) If integer action is 1, then run first algorithm and if integer action is 2, then run the 2nd algorithm. Also, if the integer action is anything other than 1 or 2, return the empty string "".

Part 3
Write a Java program named CharsIndex to get the index of all the characters of the alphabet. Ask user to input a string.The sample output was produced by this string: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

Sample Output:


    a  b  c  d e  f  g h i  j
    =========================
    36 10 7 40 2 16 42 1 6 20

    k  l  m  n  o  p q  r  s  t
    ===========================
    8 35 22 14 12 23 4 11 24 31

    u  v  w  x  y  z
    ================
    5 27 13 18 38 37

chore(rds): add PG12.5 and deprecate PG9.5 and PG9.6 (#12998)

Added PostgreSQL 12.5 version.

Also, I got a friendly email from AWS that some versions of PG will be forcefully updated, and I've decided to mark PG9.5 and 9.6 as deprecated. (Feb 2021 and Nov 2021 EOLs respectfully).

> Amazon RDS is starting the end of life process for PostgreSQL major version 9.5. We are doing this because the PostgreSQL community is planning to discontinue support for PostgreSQL 9.5 on February 11, 2021 [1].
> 
> Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 will reach end of life on February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.6 will reach end of life in late 2021. Hence, we strongly encourage you to upgrade your databases running PostgreSQL major version 9.5 to 12 or greater at your convenience before February 16, 2021. PostgreSQL 12 contains major innovations including JSON path queries per SQL/JSON specifications and pluggable table storage interface [2]. PostgreSQL 13 introduced parallel processing of indexes with the VACUUM command and improved duplicate data handling by B-tree indexes [3]. Both versions contain numerous fixes to various software defects in earlier versions of the database.
> 
> If you do not upgrade your databases before February 16, 2021, RDS will upgrade your PostgreSQL 9.5 databases to PostgreSQL 12 during a scheduled maintenance window between Feb 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC and March 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC. On March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC, any PostgreSQL 9.5 databases that remain will be upgraded to version 12 regardless of whether the instances are in a maintenance window or not.
> 
> You can initiate an upgrade of your database instance — either immediately or during your next maintenance window — to a newer major version of PostgreSQL using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface. The upgrade process will shut down the database instance, perform the upgrade, and restart the database instance. The database instance may be restarted multiple times during the upgrade process. While major version upgrades typically complete within the standard maintenance window, the duration of the upgrade depends on the number of objects within the database. To avoid any unplanned unavailability outside your maintenance window, we recommend that you first take a snapshot of your database and test the upgrade to get an estimate of the duration. To learn more about upgrading PostgreSQL major versions in RDS, review the Upgrading Database Versions page [4].
> 
> We want to make you aware of the following additional milestones associated with upgrading these databases that are reaching end of life.
> 
> Now through March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - You can initiate upgrades of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to PostgreSQL 12 or higher at any time.
> February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - After this date and time, you cannot create new RDS instances with PostgreSQL major version 9.5 from either the AWS Console or the CLI. RDS will also automatically upgrade PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 within the earliest scheduled maintenance window that follows. Restoration of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 database snapshots will result in an automatic upgrade of the restored database to a still supported version at the time.
> March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - RDS will automatically upgrade any remaining PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 whether or not they are in a maintenance window.
> Should you have any questions or concerns, the AWS Support Team is available on the community forums and via Premium Support [5].

large-scale refactor

-Now includes all perks (by adding cost scaling info for all perks). Observation and Frenzy are not yet optimized (TODO) but can be manually adjusted. Packrat is now optimized since it's just a resource perk.
-Removed heirloom optimization. Omsi's calc is better, and this would have been hard to maintain through the refactor. This is a perks calc!
-Added Scruffy level which is required to value Prismal correctly.
-Replaced health/attack weights with clearspeed/survival weights for better clarity on the distinction between atk/hp and equality, and to make it impossible to set attack weight higher than health weight (which is just wrong). Final attack weight is clearspeed weight. Final health weight is clearspeed + survival. New equality weight (simply used to weight the effect of max equality) is the survival weight. Radon weight remains.
-There is a big global "perks" object where all the bookkeeping happens. Yeah it's still global but it is much easier to maintain in the future. In general a lot of old stuff was cleansed and replaced with routines that I find cleaner. YMMV.
-Now includes prestige-based equipment scaling for low equip levels. Prior calc assumed 1.2 cost for linear effect, but prestige scaling is much better than this.
-Probably other shit I'm forgetting.
-IANA web dev. No bully. Please feel free to volunteer to clean up the HTML-generation code or reorganize this into multiple files or whatever. All the HTML and JS hooks into the HTML are copypasta from the original.

TODO: Add checkbox(es) for locking of inputs to get rid of the annoyance of fucking with the equip levels and tributes every time you load a save.
TODO: Optimize Frenzy and Observation.
PROBABLY NOT TODO: Optimize Pheromones. There could be an optional breed speed weight, probably no other way to do it.
