Disable Naming/RescuedExceptionsVariableName (#42)

In my opinion, the variable name for an exception is not important in
many cases. Some love to name it as `e`, some like `error`, some insist
on naming it as `exception`... I believe it absolutely a matter of
preference and does not undermine productivity in software development.
Besides, even if someone writes code with so an inappropriate variable,
this would be pointed out by other code reviewers.

So, I want to disable `Naming/RescuedExceptionsVariableName`.

when the impostor is F I X E D
yeah i fixed that stupid default wav file issue lmao
(and a ton of stuff too)
- promises are no longer sussy
- made overworld associations map private because nobody aint got time for dat shit
- added "absolute" method on overworld and undertaleGame because we need to be able to get the in-game position of the bottom left corner of the rendered area for overlays and stuff
- made render code less sussy by moving zero calculation to outside for loop
- 'draw' event now fired on all rendered objects just before canvas application, could be used to inject stuff before draw
- a HUGE issue with XSheet fixed (it was alwayhs blanking the texture before)
- another HUGE issue with XRoom entity delete fixed, it was LITERALLY RECURSIVE ERROR 100% of the time!!! (so sus)
- metadata is defined sorta now? idk seems kinda garbo1234 if you ask me
- attributes instead of style for rectangle variable name becuase W H Y N O T lmao
- removed dumbo overworld layer in UndertaleGame it was rather sus
- dialogue push function in undertaleGame now works with no content (epic saucy?)
- oh yeah i guess i added a battler thing too idk its kinda cool i guess

Update Bear and Big Brother.cpp

Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?
Input

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.
Output

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.
Examples

Output

Note

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.

Remove GUI

This project isn't dead. Not that anybody had asked in the first place,
but it should still be said. Gyre is CoubDownloader's successor, but
sometimes having a CLI tool is just more convenient than a GUI. Plus
packaging a Python GTK program, that uses all kinds of GNOME-related
technologies, on Windows is still a pain.

Anyway, CoubDownloader has its place in the world, but not in its
current state. It will turn back into the simple CLI script it once was.
That means trimming a lot of the fat that accumulated over the years,
starting with the Tkinter GUI. One GUI already gives me enough headache,
so I don't need a second one on top of that. Maybe - but just maybe -
Gooey will be used in the future for another quick makeshift GUI, but
nothing more.

#### Tuesday 2021-06-29 18:22:38 by bingis-khan

I'm kinda bored.

A lot of things - big and small. I didn't make commits, because I was
experimenting with a lot of stuff.
1. I finished the "user" part of the application - it's possible to
actually run it now like a normal human being. Wow.
2. I understand Gradle better (like 1% overall, compared to 0.01%
before) - got the build file cleaned up a bit.
3. Oh, right. New task 'executable' to compile the whole thing to a
sorta independent executable. The task adds a custom, jlinked JRE,
launch4j's .exe and sample automata to a single folder.* Kinda cool.
4. Added sample automatas.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

On that note, I'm kinda bored of this project.

What's left:
1. More flexible / less repetetive functions might never be implemented
(for example, right now, the 'is' is part of the 'sum' function and
every function returns boolean. Functions also can't overlap - something
like 'north is [state]' and 'north west is [state]' is not possible - a
task perfect for some kind of a FSM).
2. Speed up the simulation. This project might actually be interesting
to try and implement 'hashlife' in.
For evaluating expressions, maybe something like a bytecode VM? That
last one is probably overkill, it would be better after porting to C/C++
or even Rust (as a learning exercise)?
3. Improve the language. When trying to write a simple fluid simulation,
I had to repeat a lot of cases (ex. 5 lines with 'FULL:' for example).
So, a general 'switch-case' structure? A lot of writing, basically. It's
interesting, because the language might be the greatest barrier in
creating some interesting cellular automata.

(3) is similar to (1) in a way, that we can increase the expressiveness
of this language by better implementing function definitions.
Instead of 4 times 'north is GOES_DOWN and random 1 in n chance ->
[state]'
Adding better functions can change it to: 'north is GOES_DOWN -> choose
GOES_UP, GOES_DOWN, GOES_LEFT, GOES_RIGHT', where 'choose' is of type
State.


What's left, but might actually be implemented, because I'm not as tired
of this project as I thought:
1. Toroidal-ness.
2. Setting (maximum) simulation speed. It ain't that fast and I don't
know no 'hashlife'. Git outta here!
3. Remove requirement for specyfing neighborhood type (like, it's not
needed if the CA is not using it - random walk for example).
4. Change the order of color definitions - originally there, because of
code reuse (laziness) and that it kinda makes sense that states are
differentiated by color first (what you see), then the state it belongs
to (what it actually is). It breaks down on something like Langton's
Ant, where multiple states are red. So, yeah, one-to-many: [state] is
[color].
5. Custom color, represented by a leading '#', then 6 hex digits. Should
be added after implementing (4), because it'll look bad otherwise (ex.
'#00FF00 is ON' vs 'ON is #00FF00').
6. Parameters (and a system to handle them) to configure all these.
7. Images instead of colors. The framework is there (State uses
BufferedImage by default), but we might have to decouple creating states
from parsing? (Suppose we specify the default image folder in 'Defualts'
and reference images only by filename. We can do it while parsing, but
it'll lead to some 'half-parameters' which are only valid inside the
Parser object and would need to be removed after.)
8. And, as always, finish pretty printing for error reporting. (^^^^^ to
underline errors).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*I experimented with two ways to bundle an executable.
1. Official - Making an installer. Why I didn't go for it? I don't feel
like this manlet of an application should require a whole installation
process.

2. Hacky - Something called 'sfx' (self-extracting archive). I actually
ended up making it work (manually), but, because it seems to be an
untrustoworthy format
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-extracting_archive#Disadvantages ),
Windows always shows its password prompt, which is really annoying. So,
I scrapped it, but the idea for both a JRE and a program bundled into a
single executable (without it being obvious it uses a virtual machine)
is interesting.
Also, the fact that the jlink Gradle plugin also supports jpackage and
creating the whole "image" structure, which I used for sfx, is a welcome
surprise. (I'm not sure if this 'image structure' is the jpackage's or
the plugin's doing.)

Tentative Finaal Commit (6.29)

Additions/Alterations include:

1. Adding new themes/sprites to game to make the theme more uniform and
appearance cleaner for better UX. Went from ambiguous theme to a
Spongebob-driven game.

2. Added boosts as planned in the last commit. Player will gain a boost
(double their speed) until they lose a life. This entity's
spawn/movement component is rather simple as we're just spawning the
object randomly (x-wise) somewhere at the top of the screen and it will
fall to the bottom (movement component) - inactive once reaches bottom
of screen.

3. Added an additional obstacle (Danger bubble) that is essentially the
same object as the boost, however has different affects on the player
upon collision. If the player cannot evade the falling bubble, the
player will lose a life.

4. Added different UI feedback in different instances of pausing, and
starting new games. Ex: different screen is shown after a life is lost,
after a pause, after all lives are lost, and upon initial start up of the game.
- Changes were made to GameState class to facilitate the above
additions.

5. Fixed some miscellaneous bugs pertaining to player/NPC movement, and game
start-up (UI conditions interfering with one another). Some of the bugs
were caused by the boost addition. Overall these changes make the game
movement look smoother.

6. Removed some redundancies/code that was not needed from importing
some of framework from scrolling shooter game (cannot remember all
changes off top of my head).

Note: May make some more additions/alterations if I have time later this
afternoon. Game looks/runs a lot better than it did in past commit.

Apologize for typos throughout this commit/possibly past commits. If something
does not make sense, please reach out and I would be happy to provide
some context.

allows editing expired and removed bans (tgstation/tgstation#59431)

This is needed for the rare case that the situation described in the ban turns out to be inaccurate, so future searches for the user in the ban db don't lead admins to the wrong opinion.

Creating a situation where the admin has to remember to edit the ban reason before unbanning them is kinda lame

I'd love to make it so only the reason is editable, but that is far too much work for too little benefit.
