ML3M Rebalancing

Originally, the ML3M was intended to be a little bit stronger. The healing values for the Brute, Burn, Omni, Toxin, and Antirad cells, have been adjusted according to what was initially planned. 
Base Tier's now heal 10 per shot, for a total of 40 damage healed, up from 20.
Second Tier's now heal 20, instead of 10.
Third Tier's heal 40, instead of 20. 

Omni 1 heals 5's for brute, burn, and toxin, and 30 for oxy, up from half those values. Omni 2, is 10's and 60, and Omni 3 is 20's and 120. 

Antirad Cell had its toxin heal bumped up from 2.5 to 5, and its radiation-heal from 150, to 350. I wasn't originally going to touch this one, but the text said "It's 150 because that's equal to five units of arithrazine", and... it wasn't. So, I bumped it up to actually be equal to 5u of Arithrazine's worth of radiation healing.

Stabilizer Cell, CorpseMend, Resistance, Haste, and the size-changing cells, were not touched.
The reasons for this are as follows:

- The healing laser was simply not strong enough to ever tend to more than one patient. Healing 20-40 damage per cell just isn't enough, even if you had several clips full of cells, it just wasn't viable.
- As a result of this, it was seldom if ever used. Field Medics rarely if ever took it with them. In nearly every round I've played, it was left exactly where it was spawned, collecting dust. 
- I'd like to make it a more proper treatment option. It wouldn't be equal to reagents used in your usual Medbay setting, or surgical repair, but if it's modified to actually fulfill its niche as a rapid, contact-free treatment option, it could be relied on more by Field Medics. There is so much potential for this device as an "in the field" healing tool, and I'd like to see it done well. We have no shortage of people who would like to see non-chemical-based treatment options. We might as well make it useful enough to actually use.

Here are a few issues people brought up in Discord when I floated this idea.
"But, Tempest, you're doubling everything? That's a huge change! Won't this result in the ML3M overshadowing other treatment options?"
Certainly not. Currently, with tier-2 cells that only heal up to 40 damage, this is actually worse than basic first-aid in terms of raw healing ability, as the cutoff for first aid healing is 50 damage on a limb. First aid and reagents will still be the most convenient, most readily available, and overall most-used manner of treatment for injuries that can be treated using those methods. All this change would do is allow the ML3M to also have its uses, and stop being overshadowed by everything else. 

"Okay, but what if it DOES actually become The New Meta and becomes the favored tool for healing?"
I wouldn't see it as an issue if Chemistry gets dethroned, in all honesty. They'd both take quite a bit of prep-work to use. You have to make multiples of every chem if you want a solid stock, and you'd need multiples of every cell if you want proper coverage and healing-ability, since even with these changes you're expending 1-3 cells per patient. And, unless you get multiple ML3M's made, only folks who are gonna have one are the CMO, and whoever nabs the spawned one first. 

"But wouldn't this result in less departmental cooperation between Medical and Science now that Medical will require fewer cells?"
Most likely, no. If anything, I'd think there would be an increase, round-to-round, if this becomes a more viable and wanted tool, more people will ask for cells. Personally, my list of requested cells would stay the same, but I'd be sending that request in more often since I know it'll actually be useful rather than having it just to have it. Tier 2 cells are still going to be desirable, and I'm still probably not going to order Tier 3's because of the cost, but that's just me. It's still going to be incredibly weak at roundstart, and better cells will be that much nicer to obtain.

"But Tempest! If you get the highest tiers of cells, and a lot of them, you could fix anything that doesn't require surgery!"
Well, if Science had the time and mats, then sure, you could gather up a large enough collection of cells, and you probably could indeed do this for one or two badly injured patients... ... ...and I could accomplish the same goal if I'm given 20 seconds in a chem-lab. The ML3M is more costly to use, the cells cost resources, have to be recharged after 4 shots, and you only start with a base tier Burn, Brute, and Stabilizer cell. Each shot from a base level burn/brute cell is the equivalent of 1.25u of bicaridine or kelotane. This change would make it 2.5. Base level cells are still going to be next to useless for anything other than the most minor of injuries. Chemistry will still be the dominating powerhouse it always has been, but at least you can use this tool, provided the PR goes through, instead, more often.

"Tempest, this thing just wasn't intended to be used to fully heal people..."
A couple people have said this, and to be honest, it's silly. In our medical system, there's very little distinction between what can "heal a little bit" and what can "heal fully", because it all comes down to the fact that everything works off of damage values. If Option A heals 5 damage, and Option B heals 50... Both are capable of "healing fully" if you have enough Option A, it's just a question as to whether or not that's practical. Currently, the ML3M's healing values can't really even be used to even partially heal injuries, unless you have a large number of cells. You'd expend all of your charges on one patient and then you've got a paperweight taking up storage space until you can get to a recharger. 

Now, as for issues that I personally see? Biggest one is probably the Toxin cell. If I remlember correctly, the base Toxin cell is the same tech requirement as the Second Tier Brute/Burn cells. This PR doesn't fix that, and I don't really see it as a huge priority since I don't think anyone uses the toxin cells as it is, but yeah. Might need to be fixed at some point if this PR goes through.

And, absolute worst case scenario, let's say that this PR screws everything up, turns the Tether upside down, and now Medbay is dominated by a bunch of blue laser beams flying everywhere like it's the new Star Wars Trilogy (but actually better because those movies kinda set a low bar)... this PR was really easy to do. The only long part about it was typing all of this up. We can just bump the numbers down if this ends up sucking really bad, ezpz.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

* emag examine oh yeah slammy wammy wakowstic cheezy breezy easy peezy. yoyobatty aint got no mans arms on this slimy. I fucken did it. I have figured out how large Thano’s flaccid penis is. I know what you’re thinking: How could I have done this? Well, allow me to explain. I started out with an image. The picture was of Thanos and Iron Man standing next to each other. This image was exactly what I needed. It came directly from Marvel, so we know for certain that the proportions are correct. Now that we have the two characters, how does one go about actually determining Thano’s length? That’s easy. We only need the length of Robert Downey Jr.’s penis. Luckily, we have a vague idea of just how large that is. Back in 2014, Robert Downey Jr. was quoted saying something along the lines of: “I have a massive dick, and feminism is a joke”. From this statement, we can determine one major thing: Robert Downey Jr. slays women with his massive peen.

Update README.md

Creating mandala pattern using p5.js.
This is challenging for me to create a pattern using this kind of application. I created a pattern design that reflects our way of life. It'll starts with a small circle that represents a new beginnings in life. Next is the lines connected to the circle is the    obstacles we need to face in order to go on the next journey. The small circles that surrounds is inspirations that no matter what challenges and obstacles that happened, they are always there to motivates you. The thorns allign with big circles and small circles inside means the positive and negative thoughts that comes to our mind especially when we have problems that need to accomplish. Lastly the big circles, each of them group with five to form flowers. So, I choose this design because flowers symbolizes adoration, dedication, spiritual attainment, flexibility, and opportunity. Also symbolic of good luck, wealth, happiness, strength, and ambition.
 That no matter what happens in life there is hope on us. So I will never give up in order to achieve my goals, learn from my mistakes and be positive in life.

I've learned on how to code and made an artwork using p5.js. It was fun but very challenging in my part. Because it was my first time using this kind application.

Update to bsnes v034r03 release.

New WIP, with _major_ changes to internal header detection.

This should get everything working, if we're lucky. It does get
Batman: RotJ working for the first time, as well as all the fan
translations.

I'm releasing it publicly, as I need all the help I can get with this
one. Windows binary with ZIP+JMA support included along with source
for the penguins.

    byuu.org/temp/bsnes_v034_wip03.zip


Do note that I left the console enabled in the binary. It's not a
release-grade version, anyway. But the main reason was to print the
scoring information. If any games fail, I'd like that information
posted. Might be good to note really close passes, as well, so we can
keep an eye on them for future changes. Right now, I'm only aware of
SFA2 that gets really really close.

Basically, it prints the address it tests for a header at, the score
it ended up getting, and the reset vector's first opcode. If the
values are equal, it defaults to LoROM, then HiROM, then ExHiROM. If
the reset vector is invalid, or the ROM is too small to contain a
header at a certain offset, you won't see any output for that line!
That means a lot of times, you'll only see one line output, and
sometimes you'll see two or three. No worries, just assume missing
means total fail. It only prints output for "possible" header
locations.

If you do test, you don't have to play in-game or anything. The second
you see any visible output whatsoever, that's good enough.

Many thanks to everyone who tests in advance :D

----------

Hunter and tukuyomi, thank you for the kind words and localizations :)

I really hate that table on the download page, and I need to go
through and get names out of all of the locales, but I'd like to get
an "Author:" field in that table on the download page. Sorry it's not
there just yet.

----------

Fes, thanks for the feedback.

> Apparently it has a limit of 65535 bytes for string literals.


I don't have a workaround for that. For whatever reason, ISO didn't
add an "incbin"-style command, and I need a platform-agnostic way of
encoding binary data.

Not for v035, but maybe a while after that, I'll use a more advanced
compressor to get the controller below 64kb of string data. Maybe I
can rig my order-0 arithmetic coder onto the end of LZSS for a quick
and dirty size cut. The reason I don't use 0xnn, 0xnn, is because that
takes 5 bytes of source to encode one byte of input, whereas base-64
strings only take ~1.25 bytes. I didn't want those files to slow down
compilation much.

Oops, sorry. Didn't get a warning on GCC, so I overlooked it. This is
now fixed.

First should return the filename, it's just a convenience thing to
allow chaining commands. The second should return result of patching.
I've fixed both now, thanks.

Microsoft really pisses me off by intentionally ignoring stdint.h.
nall/stdint.hpp was meant as a workaround, so that I didn't have to
special case Visual C++. The idea was to not require you to get one of
those third-party add-ons.

So yes, two of those were a mistake on my part, I used stdint.h on
them before I created my own stdint wrapper. I've corrected both.

As for spc_dsp.h, that shouldn't be compiled. That is for blargg's
reference, unmodified S-DSP emulator. The ones modified to work in
bsnes do not require it. And in fact, only src/dsp/sdsp will compile
at the moment due to memory map changes.

> # pEditbox::get_text seems to declare a dynamically sized stack
> array, which CL balked at.


Hahah, yeah, that would be C99 syntax. Very nice, that.

Looks like I was allocating length*2 wchars, too. I don't know why I
was doing that ... I don't think Microsoft's system even supports the
extended Unicode symbols that need more than 16-bits, and even if so,
they aren't likely to appear in the emulator.

Dropped that back to length+1, and made it use new[]/delete[],
instead. That's one horribly inefficient routine by the way, but
whatever, it works for now.

The rest I can't do much about, sorry. Hopefully it'll make it easier
for you to compile in the future. Sorry for letting the port slip, I
just don't have the patience to load VS2k5 again. Software takes like
three hours to install >_< and creates slower code than GCC4 anyway.
If they'd fix their damn PGO support, I'd be all over it again,
though.

##### 2021-01-28 23:18:29 by byuu

Update to bsnes v047 release.

The most notable feature for this release is the addition of SuperFX support. This enables an additional eight commercial games, and two unreleased betas, to run with full support. Most notably of these would be Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and Starfox. Though timing is not quite perfect just yet, there should be no known issues with any titles at the time of this release. That means there should only be two official, commercially-released titles that are not compatible with bsnes at this time: Quick-move Shogi Match with Nidan Rank-holder Morita 1 and 2 (using the ST011 and ST018 co-processors, respectively.)
SuperFX support was the work of many people. GIGO was a great help by providing the source code to his SuperFX emulator (for reference; the implementation in bsnes is my own design), _Demo_ was very helpful in getting Starfox to work properly, and Jonas Quinn provided roughly a half-dozen very important bug fixes that affected nearly every SuperFX game. Without them, this release would not be possible. So please do thank them if you appreciate SuperFX support in bsnes.
Please note that SuperFX emulation is very demanding. I hate to have to repeat this, but once again: bsnes is a reference emulator. It exists to better understand the SNES hardware. It is written in such a manner as to be friendly to other developers (both emulator authors and game programmers), and the findings are meant to help improve other emulators. As far as I know, bsnes is the first emulator to fully support all SuperFX caching mechanisms (instruction cache, both pixel caches, ROM and RAM buffering caches, ...); as well as many other obscure features, such as full support for ROM / RAM access toggling between the SNES and SuperFX CPUs, and multiplier overhead timing. By emulating these, I was able to discover what additional components are needed to emulate Dirt Racer and Power Slide, two titles that no emulator has yet been able to run (they aren't very good games, you weren't missing much.) It should be possible to backport these fixes to faster emulators now.
That said, with a Core 2 Duo E8400 @ 3GHz, on average I get ~100fps in Super Mario World 2, ~95fps in Starfox and ~85fps in Doom. Compare this to ~165fps in Zelda 3, a game that does not use the SuperFX chip. My binary releases also target 32-bit x86 architecture. For those capable of building 64-bit binaries, especially Linux users, that should provide an additional ~10% speedup. Be sure to profile the application if you build it yourself.
Lastly on the SuperFX front, note that Starfox 2 is fully playable, but that most images floating around have corrupted headers. I do not attempt to repair bad headers, so these images will not work. Please either use NSRT on the Japanese version, or use Gideon Zhi's English fan translation patch, if you are having trouble running this title.
With that out the way, a few other improvements have been made to this release: xinput1_3.dll is no longer required for the Windows port (though you will need it if you want to use an Xbox 360 controller), the video drivers in ruby now allocate the smallest texture size possible for blitting video, and the code has been updated with preliminary compilation support for Mac OS X. Note that I will not be releasing binaries for this: it is primarily meant for developers and for porting my other libraries to the platform. Richard Bannister maintains a much better OS X port with full EE support and a native Apple GUI that follows their interface guidelines much better than a Qt port ever could. He has also synced the Mac port with this release. You can find a link to that in the bsnes download section.
