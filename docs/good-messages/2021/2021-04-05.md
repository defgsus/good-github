Create README.md

this is a repository for adding bible verses to a magic mirror module. you can paste these lines including the quotation marks and coma into the compliments module on the default "compliments.js" found in the /modules/compliments/compliments folder in your magic mirror folder. just past the verses you like or all of them into the sections labeled "anytime" "morning" "afternoon" or "evening"... bible verses at certain points throughout the day on your mirror are a sure way to bring inspiration while you check your hair, or even the weather.. all thanks to your magic mirror!
here is the source of the books i am putting into the module: http://www.catholic-bible.org/ feel free to do any book of the bible you like but personally will be completing the wisdom books specifically except the book of job. 
to add to the project copy each chapter of bible to a text file from http://www.catholic-bible.org/ . then my preferred method of adding quotations is by using notepad++ found here for windows> Notepad++ v7.9.5 bug-fixes:
 make sure you go through and delete any empty lines (every other line). you can add quotations to each line by opening the file in notepad++ and click "search>replace" once the replace window comes up to add a quotation mark to the begining of each line do the following: in the find what bar type ^ then in the replace with bar type " make sure "regular expression" is selected in the bottom left of the box and then hit enter.
next to add ", to the end of each line- find what type $ replace with type ", make sure regular expression in the bottom corner is selected you may have to delete the last comma on the final line of the chapter or book you are contributing for the module to work correctly.
feel free to add an entire book. please only use the bible given in the read me for this project so that everything canonically accurate.

feat(npm-scripts): add `configureTypeScript()` to manage tsconfig.json

High-level overview:

- This function takes an existing `tsconfig.json` file and brings it
  up-to-date based on three inputs: (1) A base config that is bundled
  inside `npm-scripts` and is common across all projects; (2) An
  `@overrides` field that contains any, er, overrides, that a project
  might need to apply; and (3) Information about the TS dependency graph
  that is needed to set up project references between projects.

- The function returns `true` if everything is up-to-date and `false`
  otherwise, which means that we will be able to plug it in to the rest
  of the system to perform two operations: (1) Freshen the config (can
  also be used to generated a brand new one if you just do `touch
  tsconfig.json` first to identify the project as a TS one); or (2)
  Check that the config is up to date. So the plan is to plug (1) into
  the "build" subcommand and (2) into the "check" subcommand (in CI).

- In order to detect changes and prevent unintended manual edits,
  every config file has a `@generated` hash and clear `@readonly`
  warning to keep edits inside the `@overrides` section alone. There is
  also a `@see` file with a short-link to the following URL (which I
  haven't written yet, but will, and which will explain all of this):

      https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/blob/master/projects/npm-tools/packages/npm-scripts/src/typescript/README.md

- Note that the hash only cares about the values in the file, not the
  whitespace or formatting. This means that if you modify the file with
  Java SourceFormatter or Prettier the hash will remain the same. We
  already have a mess where those two tools fight with one another of
  what JSON should look like, so we do our best here to at least not
  make thing worse there. When we write JSON, we do so in a format which
  (I hope) matches what SourceFormatter wants, and we only write it when
  absolutely necessary (ie. because the values have changed).

There is one TODO noted inline, as well as the missing docs I mentioned
above. Finally, I need to test this in liferay-portal and actually
integrate it with the "build" and "check" subcommands, but I'll do that
in another commit.

Details:

- `configureTypeScript()` is a simple function that takes the dependency
  graph information (from `getTypeScriptDependencyGraph()`) and no other
  parameters; it configures the "tsconfig.json" file in current working
  directory. I did it this way in order to make it simple for callers,
  even though it makes writing the tests harder. Whatevs. The tests were
  going to be hard no matter what because you need a bunch of fixtures.

- Given those fixtures, we can copy them on every test (slow), or do
  some naughty writing in-place (ie. to the "tsconfig.json" files in the
  "__fixtures__" directories). I did the naughty thing because I don't
  want headaches with temporary files on Windows in CI. (Speaking of
  which, there are a few `path.join` type things that may require a good
  review/test on Windows.)

- Doing the naughty thing requires us to modify the `.gitignore`,
  because we don't want changes to these `tsconfig.json` files appearing
  in the `git diff` output. Note that while I was in there I stripped
  out the useless "node_modules" entry (already covered by the
  `.gitignore` in the repo root).

- We tell Jest to ignore the `__fixtures__` directory because otherwise
  a `yarn test --watch` run will infinite loop because every time you
  run the tests, you touch the file-system, which causes Jest to run
  again, which causes you to touch the file-system...

- Our base `tsconfig.json` that we use as a template is actually called
  `tsconfig-base.json` because I don't want `tsc` or any editor LSP
  picking it up and thinking that the containing `config/` folder is the
  root of a TS project.

- The tests have a few `sort-keys` lint suppressions in them for
  readability reasons (to make the precendence of the spread/merge
  operations clear).

Test plan: For now, just unit tests.

Switch assets mounting to dedicated directory

This fixes an issue where you would be able to mount things other than
custom assets in per-level custom asset directories and zips.

To be fair, the effects of this issue were fairly limited - about the
only thing I could do with it was to override a user-made quicksave of a
custom level with one of my own. However, since the quicksave check
happens before assets are mounted, if the user didn't have an existing
quicksave then they wouldn't be able load my quicksave. Furthermore,
mounting things like settings.vvv simply doesn't work because assets
only get mounted when the level gets loaded, but the game only reads
from settings.vvv on startup.

Still, this is an issue, and just because it only has one effect doesn't
mean we should single-case patch that one effect only. So what can we
do?

I was thinking that we should (1) mount custom assets in a dedicated
directory, and then from there (2) mount each specific asset directly -
namely, mount the graphics/ and sounds/ folders, and mount the
vvvvvvmusic.vvv and mmmmmm.vvv files. For (1), assets are now mounted at
a (non-existent) location named .vvv-mnt/assets/. However, (2) doesn't
fully work due to how PhysFS works.

What DOES work is being able to mount the graphics/ and sounds/ folders,
but only if the custom assets directory is a directory. And, you
actually have to use the real directory where those graphics/ and
sounds/ folders are located, and not the mounted directory, because
PHYSFS_mount() only accepts real directories. (In which case why bother
mounting the directory in the first place if we have to use real
directories anyway?) So already this seems like having different
directory and zip mounting paths, which I don't want...

I tried to unify the directory and zip paths and get around the real
directory limitation. So for mounting each individual asset (i.e.
graphics/, sounds/, but especially vvvvvvmusic.vvv and mmmmmm.vvv), I
tried doing PHYSFS_openRead() followed by PHYSFS_mountHandle() with that
PHYSFS_File, but this simply doesn't work, because PHYSFS_mountHandle()
will always create a PHYSFS_Io object, and pass it to a PhysFS internal
helper function named openDirectory() which will only attempt to treat
it as a directory if the PHYSFS_Io* passed is NULL. Since
PHYSFS_mountHandle() always passes a non-NULL PHYSFS_Io*,
openDirectory() will always treat it like a zip file and never as a
directory - in contrast, PHYSFS_mount() will always pass a NULL
PHYSFS_Io* to openDirectory(), so PHYSFS_mount() is the only function
that works for mounting directories.

(And even if this did work, having to keep the file open (because of the
PHYSFS_openRead()) results in the user being unable to touch the file on
Windows until it gets closed, which I also don't want.)

As for zip files, PHYSFS_mount() works just fine on them, but then we
run into the issue of accessing the individual assets inside it. As
covered above, PHYSFS_mount() only accepts real directories, so we can't
use it to access the assets inside, but then if we do the
PHYSFS_openRead() and PHYSFS_mountHandle() approach,
PHYSFS_mountHandle() will treat the assets inside as zip files instead
of just mounting them normally!

So in short, PhysFS only seems to be able to mount directories and zip
files, and not any loose individual files (like vvvvvvmusic.vvv and
mmmmmm.vvv). Furthermore, directories inside directories works, but
directories inside zip files doesn't (only zip files inside zip files
work).

It seems like our asset paths don't really work well with PhysFS's
design. Currently, graphics/, sounds/, vvvvvvmusic.vvv, and mmmmmm.vvv
all live at the root directory of the VVVVVV folder. But what would work
better is if all of those items were organized into a subfolder, for
example, a folder named assets/. So the previous assets mounting system
before this patch would just have mounted assets/ and be done with it,
and there would be no risk of mounting extraneous files that could do
bad things. However, due to our unorganized asset paths, the previous
system has to mount assets at the root of the VVVVVV folder, which
invites the possibility of those extraneous bad files being mounted.

Well, we can't change the asset paths now, that would be a pretty big
API break (maybe it should be a 2.4 thing). So what can we do?

What I've done is, after mounting the assets at .vvv-mnt/assets/, when
the game loads an asset, it checks if there's an override available
inside .vvv-mnt/assets/, and if so, the game will load that asset
instead of the regular one. This is basically reimplementing what PhysFS
SHOULD be able to do for us, but can't. This fixes the issue of being
able to mount a quicksave for a custom level inside its asset directory.

I should also note, the unorganized asset paths issue also means that
for .zip files (which contain the level file), the level file itself is
also technically mounted at .vvv-mnt/assets/. This is harmless (because
when we load a level file, we never load it as an asset) but it's still
a bit ugly. Changing the asset paths now seems more and more like a good
thing to do...
