Merge #64329

64329: cli,ts: allow (hacky) visualization of timeseries dumps r=knz a=tbg

One of our observability achilles heels has always been that time series
are not included in `debug.zip`. But let's aim lower, they're also not
included in roachtest artifacts. This PR tries to address at least the
latter, and opens up a potential interim solution for the former.

We actually have had the ability to export time series from a cluster
for quite some time, and have recently improved it in #57481. However,
the real problem is visualizing the data. We have something that allows
you to [explore] a dump, but it's unusable until we also do #54178,
which isn't going to happen anytime soon.

For better or worse, in the short term, the most attractive way to get
the data visualized is to dump raw KV pairs into a local cockroachdb
instance and open the DB console.

That's what this commit achieves. Here's a "demo":

```
./cockroach debug tsdump --format raw --insecure \
    --host $(roachprod ip --external tobias-ui: 1) > ts.gob
```

```
COCKROACH_DEBUG_TS_IMPORT_FILE=ts.gob ./cockroach start-single-node --insecure
```

Open the UI and browse:

We anticipate trying this out in `roachtest`. It's unclear if it will
ever be included in `debug.zip`, but it seems worthwhile given that
our real solution - the observability server - is a ways out.

There are gotchas.

- the code behind COCKROACH_DEBUG_TS_IMPORT_FILE has to make all kinds of
assumptions about which node each store belongs to and in practice this
means that unless each node has exactly one store, and the IDs match,
the operation will either fail or produce an incorrect mapping,
silently.  What's worse, if this conflicts with the actual running node,
the running node's opinion will win (so things might look at at first,
then flip around, not sure).
- some metrics are missing, see #64373. I think everything except the latency
metrics are there, such as `sql.txn.latency-*`.
- to get the console to even realize these metrics are there, we have to
write fake NodeStatuses. Definitely don't use this on any cluster you
care about.

Given those, the only situation in which I will personally use this is
that of a vanilla roachtest, where NodeIDs and StoreIDs line up nicely.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Text messages are used for personal, family, business and social
purposes. Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text
messaging for communication between colleagues. In the 2010s,
the sending of short informal messages became an accepted part of
many cultures, as happened earlier with emailing.[1] This makes
texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family and
colleagues, including in contexts where a call would be impolite or
inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night or when one knows the
other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and
voicemail and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly
with the recipient), texting does not require the caller and recipient
to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even
between busy individuals.

nixos/testing: Switch from black to pyflakes

So far, we have used "black" for formatting the test code, which is
rather strict and opinionated and when used inline in Nix expressions it
creates all sorts of trouble.

One of the main annoyances is that when using strings coming from Nix
expressions (eg. store paths or option definitions from NixOS modules),
completely unrelated changes could cause tests to fail, since eg. black
wants lines to be broken.

Another downside of enforcing a certain kind of formatting is that it
makes the Nix expression code inconsistent because we're mixing two
spaces of indentation (common in nixpkgs) with four spaces of
indentation as defined in PEP-8. While this is perfectly fine for
standalone Python files, it really looks ugly and inconsistent IMO when
used within Nix strings.

What we actually want though is a linter that catches problems early on
before actually running the test, because this is *actually* helping in
development because running the actual VM test takes much longer.

This is the reason why I switched from black to pyflakes, because the
latter actually has useful checks, eg. usage of undefined variables,
invalid format arguments, duplicate arguments, shadowed loop vars and
more.
