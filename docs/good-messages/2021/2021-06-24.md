Update Readme.md

MISUSING DISPENSATION - NO MORE!

"Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof" (from Ecc. 7:8).  I want to encourage you and share why I believe this verse applies to the Church - it shall soon be better than it was in the book of Acts as it continues from "faith to faith" as God intends! (from Rom. 1:17)  This world is now entering into far more profound change as God's kingdom culture comes than has ever happened since the Flood, in the same class of profound as when satan was cast from heaven, and in the same class of profound as when Christ spoiled satan's minions in hell before His blood under the Cross dried.  Yet for all its long-prophesied newness, redemptive culture transformations, eternally pivotal prominence, and worthy of royal celebration and welcome, the coming new age still can't ever be called a new "dispensation"!  Likewise, the term "dispensation" is misused of any previous time period, and I'll explain why it is now, more than ever before, important to stop misusing that term.  I trust it will be your faith, more than your knowledge, more than your principles of doctrine (Heb. 6:1), that will grow in the few minutes of reading this.  One way that faith would manifest itself is as a more instant, thorough, and strong believing of scripture as you read it, and realize that God credits to you righteousness for that level of belief! (Rom. 4)  One thing that has severely limited widespread knowledge of the times is the misunderstanding of the word "dispensation".

Like other Christians are, you were taught the Bible is true.  Certainly it is true, and true on innumerable levels, and true on every level.  It is supernaturally true, and I encourage you to have it handy for searching as you read this.  Yet curiously enough, you were also taught that several verses sealed therein (by their transformation from verbal or thoughts to written) are NOT true today based on something about "dispensation".  Sure, the verses were true when written, but supposedly many aren't any more because "we're no longer in that dispensation" rather than for one of the legitimate reasons a later chapter and verse might explicitely declare.  So the Bible is true, but just not all of it.  And with each passing "dispensation", the Bible becomes less true and less relevant to those of us upon whom the ends of the world are come  (1 Cor. 10:11)...even to the extent that a God-given practice or teaching can become so anathema to God that it later supposedly becomes a satanic teaching.  We're all comfortable with this, right?

I am an uncommon believer - a new wineskin.  As such, I am decidedly NOT comfortable that the most truthful and most sure Book to ever exist in ANY dimension - physical or otherwise - would only be partially and not fully true, and which verses are obsolete are the ones chosen at our whims without a scripture basis.  I am not comfortable with the notion that this Book having been settled in a dimension without time and where nothing EVER becomes obsolete (Ps. 119:89), sealed by writing in this dimension, could EVER contain prankster GOTCHAs of obsolete teachings (Matt. 24:35, Mk. 13:31, Lk. 21:33) that it doesn't identify anywhere within itself as obsolete.  I am VERY comfortable being UNashamed of any of Jesus' words (Mk. 8:38)...at least one of Jesus' commandments that is commonly categorized as obsolete based on a misunderstanding of "dispensation" is emphasized to be one of "...the commandments of the Lord" (1 Cor. 14:37, just after a "dispensation"-discarded commandment in v. 34).  Emphasized as very few other commandments are!  And what do we do with it if we misunderstand "dispensation" as is being done rampantly in the Church?  We say no to it: we are ashamed of it, and we refuse to be washed by it! (In case you haven't realized yet, 1 Cor. 14:34-35 relates to the ministry roles being different between genders.  Maybe God emphasized it as a least commandment to see which of us would show the full extent of our worthiness to "...be called great in the kingdom of heaven". [Matt. 5:19])

How do we treat fellow Christians like me who refuse to mix belief with unbelief and so hold that  "...those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever..."?  Consider that God receives these types of believers and tells the rest to receive them, too. (Rom. 14-15:7)  Would you show me in the original Bible languages how/where I'm not allowed to believe because of your misunderstanding of dispensation with what God wrote?  But I've found that ALL of Scripture can be believed, and that fact allows me more freedom to believe the Scriptures as I am reading.  I don't have to be careful and selective to believe as I read my Bible.  When a later verse says an earlier teaching is obsolete, that's fine.  I have no problem with additional WRITTEN revelation like that to override WRITTEN truth.  I have no problem with a scripture becoming obsolete due to its being completely fulfilled.  But anyone who subscribes to something called "dispensation" causing words, verses, and entire teachings to be now obsolete is restricted from wholeheartedly believing scriptures they read, just in case the end of some "dispensation" somehow claimed the teaching as a kill.  Let me state that another way: misunderstanding "dispensation" by necessity weakens our faith in Bible teachings.  Some even think that the ENTIRE Old Testament is obsolete unless re-confirmed in the New Testament.  That is most certainly NOT how Apostle Paul reasoned as he gratuitously used the Old Testament as basis for his teachings.

"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment" (1 Cor 1:10).  This will be impossible if we continue misusing and misunderstanding dispensation, unless the Church has a worldwide council culminating in a unanimous decision of which scripture teachings we'll stand united against [our being washed by].  But then what will you do with believers like me who, for our very lives sake, refuse to be against ANY word that proceeds from the mouth of God?  Invoking "dispensation" to justify the elimination of any sealed word, verse, or teaching is admittedly commonplace, but it is also whimsical - no scriptural guidance can be found anywhere that helps us bless one denomination's targets over the other's or to bless both equally.  The teachings that each faction of Christianity chooses to target are based on cultural and peer pressures, walking by sight, and/or taking offense, not based on scriptural guidance.  Thus, divisions in the Bride are as certain to continue to exist as long as our misunderstanding the term "dispensation" does because our cultures differ, our experiences in or reception of the miraculous differ, and our resistance level to being offended by God's words differs.  Can church leaders DEMAND their congregations to believe differently from what their Bibles tell them?  Of course not, so to have no divisions in the Bride there is only one option how to believe the Bible - believe it can ONLY be obsoleted or superceded by itself.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

The word "dispensation" is really used in the Bible, but NEVER as a synonym for time or age.  More on that later...
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Many of us were also taught that some Bible verses, though perhaps true when written, became NOT true even by so soon as 397 AD when the New Testament was canonized.  I was actually taught that the Bible was canonized while it contained verses that had already become false by the time because of some dispensation change when the twelfth original apostle died.  That rationale is called "hyper-dispensationalism" by many.  I trusted the teachers in my life enough not to question them nor be alarmed at how hidden this rationale is (or is not even) in the Bible, though in my own casual reading, I never noticed any guidelines in the Bible itself for "once true" verses becoming not true.  However, the possibility of any specific verse I might read being no longer true certainly made me read my Bible less intently than otherwise - I must only believe the verses that my trusted leaders FIRST taught from their pulpits.  After all, the secret key to knowing which verses are still true today and which verses LURKING THEIR VERY SAME CONTEXT aren't true any more, was never clearly taught for me to use it in my own Bible studying.  Until I could be sure from my teachers any particular verse was still for today, I needed to be suspicious of it.  This is SO not a good way to be reading your Bible, is it?  I learned there exist several variants of dispensation rationale differing from each other in how much of Scripture they believe is no longer true.  Surprisingly, some of these persuasions actually believe that certain Bible teachings which were totally of God at one time (only "in that dispensation" when they were written) are now of satan!!!  So some of God's written Word is now satan's deviant teaching!  Mind blown!  Someone PLEASE explain to me how, in the entire universe, that type of dispensational devilution (exactly what I mean) of the written Scripture is becoming of something that is "more sure" (2 Pe. 1:19)?!

Then, (when I was of age, thankfully, and free to choose for myself) some perplexing assertions from coworkers that, through their mere legitimate extrapolation of the same [mis]understanding of dispensation, even more Bible verses are no longer true than I had ever thought ("hyper-hyper-dispensationalism" is arguably a fair description of their persuasion).  Finally, a little concerned but greatly curious, I started reading the Bible deeper than casually.  I actually read the Bible for all it's worth, over and over again, and found verses like these that have something to say related to the way dispensation is commonly misunderstood:

    Deut. 29:29 - "The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."  "FOR EVER" bears repeating.  Note from this verse an many others that what does exist is before and after, but not time periods where teachings and truths are temporary for such a period of time.   Dispensation misunderstanding disagrees with this, so where in the Bible can we find some verse that overrules this one in support of dispensation time constructs for the temporary existence of truth?  There is none that I've found.

    2 Cor. 1:13 - "For we write none other things unto you, that what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end".  "EVEN TO THE END" bears repeating.  Dispensation misunderstanding disagrees with this, so where can we find the verse that overrules this one in support of dispensation time constructs?  There is none that I've found.

    2 Cor. 11:3,4 - "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.  For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him."  Note that the Jesus Paul preached to them takes ownership in 1 Cor. 14:37 of commands to this same Corinthian church that we 21st century _enlightened_ Christians now discard in the name of "dispensation": the verses IMMEDIATELY preceding "...the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord" are counter to 21st century secular culture and dispensation misunderstanding demands that we (most Christian factions, anyway) discard them.  Read them for yourself.

    2 Pe. 1:19 (in context!) where the written scriptures are declared to be more sure than the audible voice of God.  Dispensation misunderstanding disagrees with the notion that written scriptures are "sure" enough to survive supposed dispensation boundaries.

    Apostle Paul totally missed the memo about supposed dispensation boundaries in ALL of his reasonings where he used scriptures dozens of times to support his teaching points...old "dispensation" teaching points from Jewish scriptures mostly to GENTILES who were entering a supposed new dispensation.

    MANY other places in Scripture, ad infinitim....

Thank you for reading this far.  I promise I'll eventually share the real definition and Biblical use of "dispensation" with you, but first I need to address any reader who has not accepted Jesus as Savior: Godkind loves mankind so much that the Father gave His dearly loved Son for our benefit, knowing we would mistreat, torture and kill Him, He allowed that but so that the wounds He received from us could be lovingly offered right back to us for our healing and as an example of how to love our enemies, including Him.  Don't for one moment think that your sins are bigger than everyone else's so Jesus' blood can't cleanse you from them.  His blood will eventually reconcile EVERYTHING in all of heaven plus earth, so it can certainly handle every last sin of yours, as tiny as you are (see also Heb. 9:13-14).  Jesus is always listening for the heart-felt words from you, telepathically or spoken, that you receive His Life and that you abandon your waywardness so you can be made whole (saved).  Or start by asking Him just "please save me" and "I receive you, Jesus".  He knows well enough that you're not promising to be better, but merely that you surrender and are truthfully sincere.  You are now restored to your place in royalty.  After you've come to the Father by receiving Son Jesus, the Spirit (who is distinct from the Father and from the Son) of Godkind now awaits your [verbal or otherwise] invite for Him to fill you with Himself.

Jesus Christ is Lord of all, and He has come in the flesh, given the blood of His sinless life for the redemption of mankind, for cleansing from all sin, and to reconcile all things unto Himself. (Acts 3:21, 1 Cor 12:3, Col 1:20, 1 Jn 1:7; 2:2; 4:2,3)  He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and no man comes to the Father but by Jesus. (Jn 14:6).  He is one of three members (Eloah or Eloha) of Godkind (Elohim).  He, along with the Spirit of God, advocates for His human fellow heirs, and they offer us guidance how to live an abundant life even while we are yet in this physical dimension.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Thessalonians "...received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God..." (1 Th. 2:13), yet the Bereans "...were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so" (Acts 17:11).  It bears noting the contrast between readily accepting the VERBAL word versus searching the WRITTEN scriptures to validate the verbal.  There is a very good reason God lays this contrast out for us, as I hope you're seeing.

A couple of paragraphs back I used the term "hidden" describing dispensation time constructs.  Synonym to "hidden" is "occult".  The apostle Paul's use of the term "simplicity" I believe is very legitimately contrasted with hidden or occult.  To put it bluntly, a fully engaged Bible reader does not conclude at the end of reading the entire Bible that a hidden complication called "dispensation" exists which negates the afore-mentioned and following "milk" verses I lay out here in simplicity.  I've tried that fully engaged Bible reading, so I speak from experience.  No one ever overtly planted the thought in my mind that dispensation was being mistaught - it simply was conspicuous by its deference to the clearer passages describing how time affects God's truths (it doesn't).  I would be hard pressed to think of a better application for Rom. 3:4 "Let God be true and every man a liar" than the rampant deceptive use of the term "dispensation" we see today.

We've all heard them - statements from pulpits we trust and from Bible study materials we trust that imply there is some guideline in scripture teaching us which verses become obsolete due to dispensation "advancements".  If you as a 21st century _enlightened_ Christian could and were to time-travel back to the church at Corinth AFTER they might have accepted Paul's admonitions and had started obeying them perfectly, would you think our 21st century Christian enlightenment on, for example, womens' ministry potential in mixed-gender church services could improve their Christian standing?  Without a doubt, they would recognize you as "another spirit" for sure.

Do you see how "Now these things...are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come" (from 1 Cor. 10:11)  teaches that scriptures become _more_and_more_ relevant throughout the ages?  Yet a misunderstanding of dispensation would imply they become _more_and_more_ obsolete as each supposed dispensation ends and a new one begins.  Attached to that paradox, strangely enough, always seems to be the thinking that the Church of today and tomorrow is not destined to be any greater than the Church as found in Acts.  But a proper understanding from God's perspective instead of a dispensational perspective looks for the Church to become GREATER than the Church we read about in Acts.

Do you see the common thought among:

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and _greater_works_than_these_ shall he do; because I go unto my Father" (John 14:12)

    and

"Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof...Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this" (from Ecc. 7:8-10)

   and

"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious" (1 Cor. 3:11) ?

The common thought in those passages is in stark contrast to the the very opposite thought so inexplicably intertwined with the misconception of dispensation, wrongly telling us that the Acts Church achieved the status of "role model for all ages" and owns the greatest stories of miracles the world can ever see.  To say it another way, the Acts Church did not fulfill the full extent of greater works [than His own] that Jesus attributed to the Church that would follow His time or we wouldn't need to still pray for God's Kingdom to come and His will to be done on earth as it is in heaven.  The Acts Church is "...the beginning thereof..." while the Church later (and I mean NOW) will be better and more glorious.  Notice, too, that Apostle Paul could not yet point to any material example of the ideal for a church that all in it prophesy (1 Cor. 14:24), but he leaves the concept of it for later generations to attain to.  It is not the Acts church, but it is Scriptures like these listed and others that PROPHETICALLY declare the Church role model for all ages.  Even more amazing, many denominations' misconception of "dispensation" leads them to teach that the Acts Church exhibited signs and wonders that would be satanic if manifested in their denomination today!

Come on people, let's be more intelligent than that!  God is expecting humans on earth to prepare the way for Kingdom Culture.  We do that by continuing in His ways as He reveals them to us "... precept upon precept; line upon line...here a little, and there a little..." down through the ages "...until the time appointed of the father".  (See Isa 28:9-11 and Gal. 4:1-2)  Don't be offended that I would combine two contexts there - both of those contexts infer concerning the same concept I'm drawing from: Heaven intends to teach earth (remember the watchers mentioned in Dan. 4:17) so a glorious Romans 8 redemptive manifestation and maturation ensues.  The word "Likewise" in Rom. 8:26 hinges about this concept, if you read Romans 8:14-32 engaged enough.  You'll need to let go of the misunderstanding of "dispensation" to see this, but when you do you'll realize there is a crescendo in earth TOWARD the ultimate rather than the diminuendo AWAY from it.  You'll realize the Bible becomes MORE truthful and relevant, not less.  Psalm 37 is one of many examples of this.  Please take time away from reading this to read Psalm 37 to see what I mean, then ask yourself why you think we have a right enjoy the destiny Ps. 37 declares while canceling scripture teachings at our dispensational whims.

We're taught that God gave us a Bible having partially obsolete revelations in it before it was even canonized and has become even more obsolete by dispensation advancements since then
    ...even though the Bible itself says "The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children FOR EVER, that we may do all the words of this law" (Deut. 29:29).

In Christianity we have a bewildering number of denominational divisions and schisms disagreeing with each other over which scriptures are obsolete
    ...even though we are commanded "...that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment" (1 Cor. 1:10), "I hear that there be divisions among you..." so "...there must be also heresies among you..." (1 Cor 11:18), and "....there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another" (1 Cor. 12:25).

We're taught that Jesus is coming imminently for His bride while we're still in this condition
    ...even though the Bible says Jesus will "...sanctify and cleanse it [us] with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it [us] to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it [we] should be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:26-27).  Riddle me this: how will the Bride be cleansed by the Scriptures when they are falling into obsolesence  by passings of "dispensations"?  ...when their meaning can be so varied depending on which version of unscriptural interpretation dispensation key you prefer to be washed by?  ...when they contain satanic verses?  How can He present His Bride to Himself without blemish when we are all inconsistent about which scriptures we allow to wash us?

In what we've been mistaught by misunderstanding dispensation, where is the hope of us ever seeing the abundant life that Jesus wanted for us and so wanted with abandon that He CAME, LIVED and DIED for us to experience? (Jn. 10:10)  Is there no more abundant life possible on this planet than what we read about in the book of Acts?  We all KNOW there is, counter to the unbelief associated with misunderstanding dipensation, and I haven't the least doubt that God is only waiting for us to prepare the way.  See how this whole physical dimension knows this: "For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God" (Rom. 8:19, see also Heb. 5:11-14 on how to get from here to there)  God's heart about this is expressed a few verses later (v32) in a verse that really needs to be read with our own emotions disarmingly receptive to God's emotions expressed here: "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"  See also Rom. 11, especially v15 "For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?" and v26: "And so all Israel shall be saved...".  Israel will be saved which ushers in life from the dead (even literally for those who'll receive it) for the rest of the world!  Coming soon to a theater (of operations) near you...    We know there remains a uniqueness of Israel by this.  Notice what draws Israel to Christ: being jealous of what Gentiles have (Rom. 10:19 & 11:11), rather than being drawn by Jesus' Second Coming or the Tribulation or anything like that.  Rather than the Rapture being imminent, the salvation of all Israel is really the next prophetic event that is imminent.  After that is the abundant life (the "life from the dead" of Rom. 11:15) Jesus referred to where the FULL scriptures will be seen to be relevant, true, and observed in light of Acts 15:1-32 and elsewhere.  There is no "dispensation" of Old Testament law that became obsolete by New Testament grace, but there IS simply differentiation between Israel and other nations concerning the Law of Moses which was promised to maintain that uniqueness of Israel (Ex. 19:5-6, Lev 26:12, Deut. 4:6, 7:6, etc.) until at least the saving of all Israel.  Do you see the difference between that and a supposed other means of salvation that produces or results from a misunderstanding of "dispensation"?

The specific verses that we're taught are obsolete are IMMEDIATELY adjacent to other verses we know not to be obsolete and lack ANY scripture guideline ANYWHERE to divide between them - verse x is still relevant but verse y immediately adjacent to it is obsolete.  In several of these very same examples, the rationale for the instruction is clearly given and spans several supposed dispensations going back to creation....  CHURCH LEADERS, DO YOU WANT YOUR CONGREGANTS TO READ THE BIBLE BUT JUST NOT BELIEVE IT?  OR WILL YOU REBUKE THOSE LIKE ME WHO READ WITH A BELIEVING HEART AND SEE THESE THINGS FROM THEIR BIBLES?   Isn't it astonishing that church leaders get so upset at someone who chooses to believe God, who gives them and me righteousness for doing so (Rom. 4:5), above the pulpit's contrary words?  In all seriousness, do they really think the Bride has made herself ready as she brazenly says some of God's words have now become satanic since leaving "that dispensation" rather than cooperate with their Author who says ("threatened", is that what you think?) He would wash us by them?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's not go any farther without a quick specific example we find in 1 Cor 14:33-35, which could be rendered "Keep your women from needing to be responsible in the long term for leading chuch services where there are men in that service who ought to be stepping up to that burdensome responsibility: for the order should reflect the pattern of the Bride's relationship to the Bridegroom.  Consider the contrast naturally and in upbringing between feminity and masculinity.  Consider natural and God-given principles of chivalry.  It is the male who ought to be thought of as more appropriately designed, conditioned, and with more margin of endurance to mature into handling corporate governance of an assortment of people that includes adult males, as the Christ has been placed over His Church. It is the male that is designed to more elegantly and without getting over-worked, use the confrontational and assertion techniques often required of a teacher or leader...."Let all things be done decently and in order" (v.40)  The basis for this teaching is natural ORDER - how a mother (yes, I do know I've jumped a gap from woman to mother) is designed naturally and appropriately to strongly prioritize minding her children above a message she might deliver to the Body while a father will defer (within reason) to those his wife's strong natural inclinations while he might similarly be delivering a message?  It is so common of pople who misunderstand dispensation to miss the significance of the older women being ordained to teach the younger women (Titus 2:4)!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As long as the term "dispensation" is misunderstood and misused, these unbecoming and wrongful contrasts cannot be reconciled.  They are unavoidable consequences of that blemish in the Bride - a blemish that, except it be washed by the water of the word, renders the Bride unpresentable as per Eph. 5:27.  All capital letters would be appropriate for me to say this: I appeal, not to any perceived authority in my words or lack thereof, but to these words' fidelity to God's heart and befitting this season of His calendar - His soon-arriving Kingdom.  There are times for Him to wink at blemishes and when old wineskins can be cavalier to reckon them to low priority, but not right now for new wineskins standing at the threshhold of this next season.  A less cavalier approach should be in the hearts of those of us who want to be most fit to enter this coming Kingdom age.  I'm not suggesting that only those most fit will enter, but I do point out that Jesus made clear there will be greater and lesser among those who do enter based on how we handle His least commandments (Matt. 5:19).

We're taught that while "dispensation" technically means "administration", it is still perfectly fine to use it as a synonym of "age" or "time"
    ...even though none, zero, not a single instance of the nine times dispensation is used by Jesus and the Apostle Paul does it ever remotely refer to a time nor time period.  It bears repeating, not even remotely!  The nine locations of the term are these: (Bible version abbreviations are courtesy http://biblegateway.com/versions/)

1) Luke 16:2,3,4 (Greek texts);
2) 3 times of Paul's COMMISSION to preach the Gospel (i.e., his JOB) 1 Corinthians 9:17
     (Greek texts, BRG, DRA, GNV, KJV, AKJV, WYC), Ephesians 3:2 (Greek texts, KJ21, ASV,
     BRG, DRA, GNV, JUB, KJV, NKJV, WYC), Colossians 1:25  (Greek texts, KJ21, ASV, BRG,
     DARBY, DRA, GNV, JUB, KJV, AKJV, RGT, WYC);
3) 2 times in referring to a WORK of God - Ephesians 3:9 (some but not all Greek texts,
     ASV, DRA, WYC), 1 Timothy 1:4 (some but not all Greek texts, ASV, DARBY);
4) 1 time in Ephesians 1:10 (Greek texts, KJK21, ASV, BRG, DRA, GNV, JUB, KJV, AKJV, NKJV, RGT, WYC) referring to
     "the dispensation of the end of times", a TASK that happens to be stated more clearly in the parallel chapter
     to this, Colossians 1, where verse 20 specifically states that TASK, also found in Acts 3:21 where it also
     is clearly a TASK for a future "time".  These references are consistently "time of a "task", not "time of a
     time" as would be the case in Eph 1:10 if time and dispensation were synonyms.

The summation of all that follows herein is this: Deut 29:29 stands in opposition - and as an alternative - to the current widespread misunderstanding of the term "dispensation":

"The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."

...pointing out that "for ever" means NOT "until the end of this dispensation", like the unbelief accompanying a misunderstanding of "dispensation" demands.

Unless you're all in already, you really should STOP here until you understand those words.  Continuing further without understanding those words is just a waste of your time.  Also STOP anytime throughout this if your Bible knowledge is too weak to be absolutely certain of the Bible context of any of these scriptures I use.  Know your Bible, and have enough confidence your Bible knowledge to base your beliefs in scripture rather than my words. I am not your personal Matthew Henry.

Now you might legitimately ask for specifics; like, a discussion about "dispensation" is boring - is it REALLY worth my time?  And - what things are so important to believe that we don't believe because of this misunderstanding?  And - why will a correct understanding of "dispensation" result in belief where I might now have unbelief?  And - what is the correct definition of "dispensation", anyway?  As I continue, I am keeping all those concerns of yours in mind.  Most of all though, I want your life to be more conformed to Kingdom of Heaven living as a result of simply believing ALL that God tells us.  I want your life, my life, to be FIT to live in the Kingdom about to be manifest on earth, just like we've been praying for for 2 millenia.  There are a few things about our beliefs we need to change to be more FIT to  enter the Kingdom that God is right now in the process of putting on earth.

Now in the next couple paragraphs or so, receive my sincere belaboring on the importance of choosing to hold to God's written word where it needs to displace wayward teachings we all have received from pulpits, commentaries and Bible study aids of man's authorship instead of God's.  (Anything copyrighted makes the claim to be of human authorship, and God's Word is by necessity in the public domain.)

Ps. 138:2 teaches us that God has magnified His word above all His Name, meaning that even though He has authority to act and decree contrary to His Word, He has determined not to.  Ps. 138:2 invites us to hold God to His Word being the highest standard, and according to 2 Pe. 1:18-19, the written Word is more sure than hearing God's voice from heaven. It should be abundantly obvious from these two verses, not to mention many others, that we are to let the authority of the written scripture rule in all matters it addresses, including how the term "dispensation" is used.

The prevalent connotation of the term "dispensation" is one of the segments of time as the Bible implicitely segments time into.  The actual denotation of the term is "administration".

I cannot emphasize enough that NEITHER of those definitions is anything even close to the true meaning as used in the Bible!  And this is NOT a harmless misunderstanding!

An argument could be made that "administration" and "dispensation" are synonyms, but  NOT ANY MORE.  Maybe in olde Englishe that argument could be made, but today's  synonyms for dispensation are words like "commission", "job", "assignment", or [a good] "work".  EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE NINE OCCURANCES OF THE GREEK WORD FOR DISPENSATION CONFORMS TO THIS.  NEVER, EVER CAN ANY OF THEM BE STRETCHED INTO BEING A SYNONYM FOR ANYTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TIME.

The proof of that assertion is in the reading and is an easy slam-dunk, but an even more urgent point is this - the end result of this discussion will NOT be to promote worship on Saturday or to observe Judaism's other teachings.  Paul's epistles to the Galatians and Romans, and Acts 15 are among the scriptures against Gentiles doing so in hopes they obey God by observing His commands to Israel.  Nonetheless, you WILL be challenged to receive a few scriptures that you've been taught NOT to believe, but you've never really had a clear reason why we shouldn't believe them.  You've never had a clear reason to not believe because there is no such reason in the Bible nor consistent with the Bible.

If you'd rather maintain the status quo connotation of "dispensation", think about why.  Safe, at least temporally; company to agreement; you're comfortable with that complexity; but most of all, you don't think you capable of comprehending the flawed rationale of scholars.  The scholars, whoever they are, that write the reference book and dictionary entries for the term "dispensation" stand a better chance of being right about it than I do, right?   It's that last point that we'll meet head-on right now.

We start by seeing the indisputable fact (I emphasize this!) that the term "dispensation" as used by Jesus and the Apostle Paul ALWAYS refers to someone's JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION or ENDEAVOR.  Then, EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, we'll show how the prevalent connotation is incompatible with a number of scripture verses besides just Deut 29:29 shown above.  Then we'll examine why historically the current connotation became accepted by scholars.  Without addressing each of these points with unbiased intellectual honesty and with a rationale you can unreservedly hold to, I will expect you to remain steadfast to the status quo.  (As an aside, David Robert Palmer publishes some very good insight as a Bible translator, but none on the term "dispensation".  I'd like his someday...)

The Strong's number for the Greek term of dispensation is 3622, and the transliteration from the Greek is "oikonomia".  It is used 9 times in the entire Bible, two of those occurrences being arguably debateable, but even so, those two questionable ones still conform to the useage and context of the other 7 occurrences.

On the other hand, the transliteration of the Greek term for "age" is "aión", and the Strong's Greek number is 165...totally etymologically unrelated to 3622 "oikonomia".  "Aión" in its various forms is used some 125 times in the New Testament.  ALWAYS clearly referring to a time period or time eternal, never to a JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION or ENDEAVOR.  Some sources will use the term "age" as in "the New Testament age".  The problem with simply switching from saying "dispensation" to saying "age" or "covenant" is _likely_ the Deut 29:29 useage of "for ever" is still again disregarded and still no Scripture context explicitly teaches those unbeliefs.

In case you would lightly forgive wrong useage of "dispensation" and so decide "age" is a better term  with which to carry forward the unbelief, so that you'd think all we have to do is change out "dispensation" for "age" and all is well, STOP!  There has been deceit or incompetence in the manner that "dispensation" has been taught to us...let's take that as serious as it warrants - very, as I've already hinted to!  If the Bible teachers, scholars and preachers have deceitully OR INCOMPETENTLY misappropriated the term "dispensation" like I'm showing you they have, you need to question their standing optherwise to simply rename the corral that contains the same dispensation-connected unbeliefs.  In a large or small way, I and they - yes, my previous self included - have made fools of us with the unbelief they've taught us.  I beg you to think about that sincerely.  The whole point of this presentation is to expose the unbeliefs that insist Bible-day works of God are now obsolete...specifically how those unbeliefs are propagated in the name of name of "dispensation", but if they are propagated in the name of "age", that is just as unbiblical and problematic and incompetence can then be ruled out in favor of intentional deceit!  Receive God's words, not man's, and expect righteousness for doing so. (Rom. 4:3)  Can mere men, authors of Bible dictionaries and commentaries, offer you righteousness for believing them?  Yet God does do that for believing Him.  According to Ps 119:99-100 you can have more understanding than all those teachers when you hold God's Word higher than theirs; you can understand more than the ancients, because you hold to God's precepts when they differ from the commentary and dictionary authors.  Open up your grasp to what you've heretofore been taught from the pulpit of Bible study materials, not so much in entirety, but do so where God's written word clearly disagrees with it.

Remember the contrast between the Thessalonians and the more noble Bereans: the Apostle Paul commended the Thessalonians in 1 Thess. 2:13 "For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe."  Yet even with such high praise, the Bereans are called "more noble" in Acts 17:11 "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."  The difference here between commendable and more noble is the extent to which the written Word is magnified, and my hope right here is to encourage you to aspire to noble.  See in what follows that I am offering you scriptures, not regurgitated sermon talk points.  Know that the scriptures (knowledge of, obedience to, declaring of, application of, etc.) are where great power is, and multi-faceted power, at that (a huge number of of scriptures tell of this).  Judge whether these scriptures are in context and worthy of all acceptance, or out of context and unrightly divided.  I've determined to use them in context and rightly divided.

Here, now, is the evidence...what God says and offers us righteousness to believe.

For the very first 3 Bible occurrences of "dispensation" Jesus uses it in Luke 16:2,3,4.  Jesus tells how the unjust steward was told that he was about to lose his "DISPENSATION"...his JOB, not his TIME SPAN.  His master was telling that unjust steward that he was about to get FIRED, not KILLED.  The other 6 occurrences of the term are used by the Apostle Paul, and they refer to

1) 3 times of Paul's commission to preach the Gospel (i.e., his JOB - 1 Corinthians 9:17, Ephesians 3:2, Colossians 1:25), or
2) 2 times in referring to a WORK of God (Ephesians 3:9, 1 Timothy 1:4 but presumably not included in some manuscripts), or
3) one time in Ephesians 1:10 referring to "the dispensation of the end of times", which happens to be stated more clearly in the parallel chapter to Ephesians 1 - that chapter being Colossians 1, where verse 20 specifically states that TASK.  When you look, you'll see in a couple of these passages that, once he mentions it, he dwells just a little more on the term "dispensation", so great was his passion about his own.  But NEVER is the term "dispensation" used in the Bible to refer to ANY time or period of time.  Never.  It's ALWAYS a JOB...a TASK...a WORK.  After reading the occurrences using the correct synonyms, we'll see if the currently popular connotation makes any sense at all, and if it fits the understanding of simplicity, as in "...the simplicity that is in Christ..." (2 Cor 11:3)

Expansion of #1 above...these are self-evident that they mean JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION:

1 Corinthians 9:16-17 - "For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!  For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation _of_the_gospel_(italicized) is committed unto me." The three italicized words are not in the untranslated epistle so that "necessity is laid upon" = "dispensation is committed".

Ephesians 3:2 - "if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you,"

Colossians 1:25 - "Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;"

Important: Paul never says "...my dispensation...", but rather "...a dispensation...unto me..." or "...the dispensation...to me...".  Yet it is nonetheless self-evidently synonymous with his personal portion of the Great Commission.  Read the verses again if you question that.

Expansion of #2 above:

Ephesians 3:9 (ASV) - "...and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;"  (ASV is one of a minority of translations that remain true from Greek to English to retaining the term dispensation for clarification here)
The required context for v.9 is set in the prior verse "Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;" (KJV)  Bear in mind that Paul's mere mention 7 verses earlier of the term dispensation started him into this prolonged statement of "his" commission, if you will - the dispensation and grace to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles as in v.6.  (Paul uses the word grace in vs.2,7 & 8 to refer to God's provision for Paul to carry out the dispensation to him - his work of preaching the gospel as delineated in v.6.)  Consistent with v.2, 1 Corinthians 9:17, and Colossians 1:25 Paul does not say "...my dispensation...", but rather "...the dispensation...".  So regardless of whether the article is definite or indefinite, the point still stands that the term means JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION as it does above.  Try synonym swapping - "...to make all men see [learn] what is [God's new endeavor/work-in-progress] heretofore a mystery..." makes much more sense than "...to make all men see what is [the age] heretofore a mystery...".  Observe also in v.5 the term "ages" is correctly used in the way "dispensation" is often misused: "...Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit...".  IF "AGE" AND "DISPENSATION" WERE SYNONYMS LIKE MOST PEOPLE THINK OF THEM, V.5 WOULD BE THE RIGHT PLACE FOR "DISPENSATION" TO BE USED.  That bears repeating ad infinitum!  If you doubt that whatsoever, read the entire chapter in context until it sinks in!



Expansion of #3 above:


I hope now you're better able to know why you were so uncomfortable explaining away many scripture verses that church life obviously doesn't line up with.

1 Cor 1:10
"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."  This will be impossible if we continue misusing dispensation, unless the Church has a worldwide council culminating in a unanimous decision of which scripture teachings we'll stand united against [our being washed by].  Then what will you do with believers like me?  Because you're certainly not able to offer me more righteousness for believing you than God offers me for believing Him.

I'll admit, God has verbally told at least one person I know of that there is a different reason for His commands in 1 Cor. 14:33-35 than the reason He has written there.  Nonetheless, I will stand alone on the Word of God, the B I B L E, to challenge God herewith: "If Your reason found in v. 34 and 35, and Your reason found in 1 Tim. 2:13,14 have become WRONG because of the passing of time or new revelation, then You need to change Your more sure written Word so those of us who live by EVERY word You speak know so!  And You should call me 'more noble' for insisting to You on this!  You know that when I pray, I declare back to You what You have SPOKEN by WRITING and promised in Your Word, and I will continue to do so unashamedly."

Incidentally, the reason God gave to this person I write of is that women [are we to believe all and only?] were located in the rear of the church taking care of their or someone else's children, which made their gender-equal participation disruptive because of mere distal location rather than gender.  Contrast that verbal rationale with the written one, "it is a shame for women to speak in the church".  Did God really have to lie in written and sealed Scripture to give this instruction?  Of course not!  Don't get me wrong - by no means AT ALL do I imply that God didn't tell this to that person.  I fully believe this person recounts truthfully that they heard this from God, but I also fully believe God wants us to quote His written Word right back to Him about it if we [rightly, IMO] struggle with the seeming or actual dissonance there.  Can God speak contradictory statements?  Yes, in which case all those statements must be TRUE (Rom. 4:17 - they become true when He speaks them if they weren't before then) - none can be false! (Titus 1:2)  In all this, I am determined to accept every word that proceeds from His mouth, for my very life's sake, even apparent contradictions to His written word.  I'll take the seaming contradictions along with the rational, but I would just want Him to expound unto me, please, as Apollos was expounded to by Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:26) or add more revelation to be subsequently included, i.e. SEALED, with the written Bible.  Incidentally, it was also a shame that Deborah led men into battle (Judges 4:9) when the man refused, yet God was mighty to use her that way when the man was unwilling to take receive that grace.  I can accept allowing some shame in cases like that of male unwillingness or unfitness, but not so easily when males who are both willing and fit to teach arrive but are judged less desirable in general to teach men than the woman is - special revelation excepted and with men's attendence explicitely optional, obviously. (1 Tim 2:11-14, which contains a "dispensation"-resistant rationale because it goes back to Creation)

From Ecc. 7:8-10 - "Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof...Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this."  If this is said as scriptures become less relevant because of misunderstanding dispensation, it would be the same level of satanic as saying "The less that Scripture is relevant, the better".

Now faith is the product of your envisioned desires; better yet, of your efforts toward those desires; better yet, of your "failure is not an option" determination and "never give up" persistent effort until their fruition (from Heb. 11:1, understood in context of the remainder of the chapter).  Let's envision the kingdom of heaven and make it happen.  The generation that does so - and there will be one - will doubtless be regarded as members of the Hebrews chapter 11 club.

If you're determined to be an inflexible old wineskin because you're too proud to change your public stance you've preached for so long, I'm sorry for you, but I do wish peace upon you until your replacement.

DISCLAIMER:  A few observations I've stated were first taught by others, including Kat Kerr and Howard Storm that I know of, though I do know these are fallible people like we all are.

Update Readme.md

MISUSING DISPENSATION - NO MORE!

"Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof" (from Ecc. 7:8).  I want to encourage you and share why I believe this verse applies to the Church - it shall soon be better than it was in the book of Acts as it continues from "faith to faith" as God intends! (from Rom. 1:17)  This world is now entering into far more profound change as God's kingdom culture comes than has ever happened since the Flood, in the same class of profound as when satan was cast from heaven, and in the same class of profound as when Christ spoiled satan's minions in hell before His blood under the Cross dried.  Yet for all its long-prophesied newness, redemptive culture transformations, eternally pivotal prominence, and worthiness of royal celebration and welcome, the coming new age still can't ever be called a new "dispensation"!  Likewise, the term "dispensation" is misused of any previous time period, and I'll explain why it is now, more than ever before, important to stop misusing that term.  I trust it will be your faith, more than your knowledge, more than your principles of doctrine (Heb. 6:1), that will grow in the few minutes of reading this.  One way that faith would manifest itself is as a more instant, thorough, and strong believing of scripture as you read it, and realize that God credits to you righteousness for that level of belief! (Rom. 4)  One thing that has severely limited widespread knowledge of the times is the misunderstanding of the word "dispensation".

Like other Christians are, you were taught the Bible is true.  Certainly it is true, and true on innumerable levels, and true on every level.  It is supernaturally true, and I encourage you to have it handy for searching as you read this.  Yet curiously enough, you were also taught that several verses sealed therein (by their transformation from verbal or thoughts to written) are NOT true today based on something about "dispensation".  Sure, the verses were true when written, but supposedly many aren't any more because "we're no longer in that dispensation" rather than for one of the legitimate reasons a later chapter and verse might explicitely declare.  So the Bible is true, but just not all of it.  And with each passing "dispensation", the Bible becomes less true and less relevant to those of us upon whom the ends of the world are come  (1 Cor. 10:11)...even to the extent that a God-given practice or teaching can become so anathema to God that it later supposedly becomes a satanic teaching.  We're all comfortable with this, right?

I am an uncommon believer - a new wineskin.  As such, I am decidedly NOT comfortable that the most truthful and most sure Book to ever exist in ANY dimension - physical or otherwise - would only be partially and not fully true, and which verses are obsolete are the ones chosen at our whims without a scripture basis.  I am not comfortable with the notion that this Book having been settled in a dimension without time and where nothing EVER becomes obsolete (Ps. 119:89), sealed by writing in this dimension, could EVER contain prankster GOTCHAs of obsolete teachings (Matt. 24:35, Mk. 13:31, Lk. 21:33) that it doesn't identify anywhere within itself as obsolete.  I am VERY comfortable being UNashamed of any of Jesus' words (Mk. 8:38)...at least one of Jesus' commandments that is commonly categorized as obsolete based on a misunderstanding of "dispensation" is emphasized to be one of "...the commandments of the Lord" (1 Cor. 14:37, just after a "dispensation"-discarded commandment in v. 34).  Emphasized as very few other commandments are!  And what do we do with it if we misunderstand "dispensation" as is being done rampantly in the Church?  We say no to it: we are ashamed of it, and we refuse to be washed by it! (In case you haven't realized yet, 1 Cor. 14:34-35 relates to the ministry roles being different between genders.  Maybe God emphasized it as a least commandment to see which of us would show the full extent of our worthiness to "...be called great in the kingdom of heaven". [Matt. 5:19])

How do we treat fellow Christians like me who refuse to mix belief with unbelief and so hold that  "...those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever..."?  Consider that God receives these types of believers and tells the rest to receive them, too. (Rom. 14-15:7)  Would you show me in the original Bible languages how/where I'm not allowed to believe because of your misunderstanding of dispensation with what God wrote?  But I've found that ALL of Scripture can be believed, and that fact allows me more freedom to believe the Scriptures as I am reading.  I don't have to be careful and selective to believe as I read my Bible.  When a later verse says an earlier teaching is obsolete, that's fine.  I have no problem with additional WRITTEN revelation like that to override WRITTEN truth.  I have no problem with a scripture becoming obsolete due to its being completely fulfilled.  But anyone who subscribes to something called "dispensation" causing words, verses, and entire teachings to be now obsolete is restricted from wholeheartedly believing scriptures they read, just in case the end of some "dispensation" somehow claimed the teaching as a kill.  Let me state that another way: misunderstanding "dispensation" by necessity weakens our faith in Bible teachings.  Some even think that the ENTIRE Old Testament is obsolete unless re-confirmed in the New Testament.  That is most certainly NOT how Apostle Paul reasoned as he gratuitously used the Old Testament as basis for his teachings.

"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment" (1 Cor 1:10).  This will be impossible if we continue misusing and misunderstanding dispensation, unless the Church has a worldwide council culminating in a unanimous decision of which scripture teachings we'll stand united against [our being washed by].  But then what will you do with believers like me who, for our very lives sake, refuse to be against ANY word that proceeds from the mouth of God?  Invoking "dispensation" to justify the elimination of any sealed word, verse, or teaching is admittedly commonplace, but it is also whimsical - no scriptural guidance can be found anywhere that helps us bless one denomination's targets over the other's or to bless both equally.  The teachings that each faction of Christianity chooses to target are based on cultural and peer pressures, walking by sight, and/or taking offense, not based on scriptural guidance.  Thus, divisions in the Bride are as certain to continue to exist as long as our misunderstanding the term "dispensation" does because our cultures differ, our experiences in or reception of the miraculous differ, and our resistance level to being offended by God's words differs.  Can church leaders DEMAND their congregations to believe differently from what their Bibles tell them?  Of course not, so to have no divisions in the Bride there is only one option how to believe the Bible - believe it can ONLY be obsoleted or superceded by itself.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

The word "dispensation" is really used in the Bible, but NEVER as a synonym for time or age.  More on that later...
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Many of us were also taught that some Bible verses, though perhaps true when written, became NOT true even by so soon as 397 AD when the New Testament was canonized.  I was actually taught that the Bible was canonized while it contained verses that had already become false by the time because of some dispensation change when the twelfth original apostle died.  That rationale is called "hyper-dispensationalism" by many.  I trusted the teachers in my life enough not to question them nor be alarmed at how hidden this rationale is (or is not even) in the Bible, though in my own casual reading, I never noticed any guidelines in the Bible itself for "once true" verses becoming not true.  However, the possibility of any specific verse I might read being no longer true certainly made me read my Bible less intently than otherwise - I must only believe the verses that my trusted leaders FIRST taught from their pulpits.  After all, the secret key to knowing which verses are still true today and which verses LURKING THEIR VERY SAME CONTEXT aren't true any more, was never clearly taught for me to use it in my own Bible studying.  Until I could be sure from my teachers any particular verse was still for today, I needed to be suspicious of it.  This is SO not a good way to be reading your Bible, is it?  I learned there exist several variants of dispensation rationale differing from each other in how much of Scripture they believe is no longer true.  Surprisingly, some of these persuasions actually believe that certain Bible teachings which were totally of God at one time (only "in that dispensation" when they were written) are now of satan!!!  So some of God's written Word is now satan's deviant teaching!  Mind blown!  Someone PLEASE explain to me how, in the entire universe, that type of dispensational devilution (exactly what I mean) of the written Scripture is becoming of something that is "more sure" (2 Pe. 1:19)?!

Then, (when I was of age, thankfully, and free to choose for myself) some perplexing assertions from coworkers that, through their mere legitimate extrapolation of the same [mis]understanding of dispensation, even more Bible verses are no longer true than I had ever thought ("hyper-hyper-dispensationalism" is arguably a fair description of their persuasion).  Finally, a little concerned but greatly curious, I started reading the Bible deeper than casually.  I actually read the Bible for all it's worth, over and over again, and found verses like these that have something to say related to the way dispensation is commonly misunderstood:

    Deut. 29:29 - "The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."  "FOR EVER" bears repeating.  Note from this verse an many others that what does exist is before and after, but not time periods where teachings and truths are temporary for such a period of time.   Dispensation misunderstanding disagrees with this, so where in the Bible can we find some verse that overrules this one in support of dispensation time constructs for the temporary existence of truth?  There is none that I've found.

    2 Cor. 1:13 - "For we write none other things unto you, that what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end".  "EVEN TO THE END" bears repeating.  Dispensation misunderstanding disagrees with this, so where can we find the verse that overrules this one in support of dispensation time constructs?  There is none that I've found.

    2 Cor. 11:3,4 - "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.  For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him."  Note that the Jesus Paul preached to them takes ownership in 1 Cor. 14:37 of commands to this same Corinthian church that we 21st century _enlightened_ Christians now discard in the name of "dispensation": the verses IMMEDIATELY preceding "...the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord" are counter to 21st century secular culture and dispensation misunderstanding demands that we (most Christian factions, anyway) discard them.  Read them for yourself.

    2 Pe. 1:19 (in context!) where the written scriptures are declared to be more sure than the audible voice of God.  Dispensation misunderstanding disagrees with the notion that written scriptures are "sure" enough to survive supposed dispensation boundaries.

    Apostle Paul totally missed the memo about supposed dispensation boundaries in ALL of his reasonings where he used scriptures dozens of times to support his teaching points...old "dispensation" teaching points from Jewish scriptures mostly to GENTILES who were entering a supposed new dispensation.

    MANY other places in Scripture, ad infinitim....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for reading this far.  I promise I'll eventually share the real definition and Biblical use of "dispensation" with you, but first I need to address any reader who has not accepted Jesus as Savior: Godkind loves mankind so much that the Father gave His dearly loved Son for our benefit, knowing we would mistreat, torture and kill Him, He allowed that but so that the wounds He received from us could be lovingly offered right back to us for our healing and as an example of how to love our enemies, including Him.  Don't for one moment think that your sins are bigger than everyone else's so Jesus' blood can't cleanse you from them.  His blood will eventually reconcile EVERYTHING in all of heaven plus earth, so it can certainly handle every last sin of yours, as tiny as you are (see also Heb. 9:13-14).  Jesus is always listening for the heart-felt words from you, telepathically or spoken, that you receive His Life and that you abandon your waywardness so you can be made whole (saved).  Or start by asking Him just "please save me" and "I receive you, Jesus".  He knows well enough that you're not promising to be better, but merely that you surrender and are truthfully sincere.  You are now restored to your place in royalty.  After you've come to the Father by receiving Son Jesus, the Spirit (who is distinct from the Father and from the Son) of Godkind now awaits your [verbal or otherwise] invite for Him to fill you with Himself.

Jesus Christ is Lord of all, and He has come in the flesh, given the blood of His sinless life for the redemption of mankind, for cleansing from all sin, and to reconcile all things unto Himself. (Acts 3:21, 1 Cor 12:3, Col 1:20, 1 Jn 1:7; 2:2; 4:2,3)  He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and no man comes to the Father but by Jesus. (Jn 14:6).  He is one of three members (Eloah or Eloha) of Godkind (Elohim).  He, along with the Spirit of God, advocates for His human fellow heirs, and they offer us guidance how to live an abundant life even while we are yet in this physical dimension.

The Thessalonians "...received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God..." (1 Th. 2:13), yet the Bereans "...were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so" (Acts 17:11).  It bears noting the contrast between readily accepting the VERBAL word versus searching the WRITTEN scriptures to validate the verbal.  There is a very good reason God lays this contrast out for us, as I hope you're seeing.

A couple of paragraphs back I used the term "hidden" describing dispensation time constructs.  Synonym to "hidden" is "occult".  The apostle Paul's use of the term "simplicity" I believe is very legitimately contrasted with hidden or occult.  To put it bluntly, a fully engaged Bible reader does not conclude at the end of reading the entire Bible that a hidden complication called "dispensation" exists which negates the afore-mentioned and following "milk" verses I lay out here in simplicity.  I've tried that fully engaged Bible reading, so I speak from experience.  No one ever overtly planted the thought in my mind that dispensation was being mistaught - it simply was conspicuous by its deference to the clearer passages describing how time affects God's truths (it doesn't).  I would be hard pressed to think of a better application for Rom. 3:4 "Let God be true and every man a liar" than the rampant deceptive use of the term "dispensation" we see today.

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We've all heard them - statements from pulpits we trust and from Bible study materials we trust that imply there is some guideline in scripture teaching us which verses become obsolete due to dispensation "advancements".  If you as a 21st century _enlightened_ Christian could and were to time-travel back to the church at Corinth AFTER they might have accepted Paul's admonitions and had started obeying them perfectly, would you think our 21st century Christian enlightenment on, for example, womens' ministry potential in mixed-gender church services could improve their Christian standing?  Without a doubt, they would recognize you as "another spirit" for sure.

Do you see how "Now these things...are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come" (from 1 Cor. 10:11)  teaches that scriptures become _more_and_more_ relevant throughout the ages?  Yet a misunderstanding of dispensation would imply they become _more_and_more_ obsolete as each supposed dispensation ends and a new one begins.  Attached to that paradox, strangely enough, always seems to be the thinking that the Church of today and tomorrow is not destined to be any greater than the Church as found in Acts.  But a proper understanding from God's perspective instead of a dispensational perspective looks for the Church to become GREATER than the Church we read about in Acts.

Do you see the common thought among:

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and _greater_works_than_these_ shall he do; because I go unto my Father" (John 14:12)

    and

"Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof...Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this" (from Ecc. 7:8-10)

   and

"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious" (1 Cor. 3:11) ?

The common thought in those passages is in stark contrast to the the very opposite thought so inexplicably intertwined with the misconception of dispensation, wrongly telling us that the Acts Church achieved the status of "role model for all ages" and owns the greatest stories of miracles the world can ever see.  To say it another way, the Acts Church did not fulfill the full extent of greater works [than His own] that Jesus attributed to the Church that would follow His time or we wouldn't need to still pray for God's Kingdom to come and His will to be done on earth as it is in heaven.  The newly-birthed Acts Church, lacking the fully compiled Bible and the years of growth that we have, is "...the beginning thereof..." while the Church later (and I mean NOW), having a more complete Bible and many more years to mature, will be better and more glorious.  Shouldn't that be obvious?  Notice, too, that Apostle Paul could not yet point to any material example of the ideal for a church that all in it prophesy (1 Cor. 14:24), but he leaves the concept of it for later generations to attain to.  It is not the Acts church, but it is Scriptures like these listed and others that PROPHETICALLY declare the Church role model for all ages.  Even more amazing, many denominations' misconception of "dispensation" leads them to teach that the Acts Church exhibited signs and wonders that would be satanic if manifested in their denomination today!

Come on people, let's be more intelligent than that!  God is expecting humans on earth to prepare the way for Kingdom Culture.  We do that by continuing in His ways as He reveals them to us "... precept upon precept; line upon line...here a little, and there a little..." down through the ages "...until the time appointed of the father".  (See Isa 28:9-11 and Gal. 4:1-2)  Don't be offended that I would combine two contexts there - both of those contexts infer concerning the same concept I'm drawing from: Heaven intends to teach earth (remember the watchers mentioned in Dan. 4:17) so a glorious Romans 8 redemptive manifestation and maturation ensues.  The word "Likewise" in Rom. 8:26 hinges about this concept, if you read Romans 8:14-32 engaged enough.  You'll need to let go of the misunderstanding of "dispensation" to see this, but when you do you'll realize there is a crescendo in earth TOWARD the ultimate rather than the diminuendo AWAY from it.  You'll realize the Bible becomes MORE truthful and relevant, not less.  Psalm 37 is one of many examples of this.  Please take time away from reading this to read Psalm 37 to see what I mean, then ask yourself why you think we have a right enjoy the destiny Ps. 37 declares while canceling scripture teachings at our dispensational whims.

We're taught that God gave us a Bible having partially obsolete revelations in it before it was even canonized and has become even more obsolete by dispensation advancements since then
    ...even though the Bible itself says "The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children FOR EVER, that we may do all the words of this law" (Deut. 29:29).

In Christianity we have a bewildering number of denominational divisions and schisms disagreeing with each other over which scriptures are obsolete
    ...even though we are commanded "...that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment" (1 Cor. 1:10), "I hear that there be divisions among you..." so "...there must be also heresies among you..." (1 Cor 11:18), and "....there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another" (1 Cor. 12:25).

We're taught that Jesus is coming imminently for His bride while we're still in this condition
    ...even though the Bible says Jesus will "...sanctify and cleanse it [us] with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it [us] to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it [we] should be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:26-27).  Riddle me this: how will the Bride be cleansed by the Scriptures when they are falling into obsolesence  by passings of "dispensations"?  ...when their meaning can be so varied depending on which version of unscriptural interpretation dispensation key you prefer to be washed by?  ...when they contain satanic verses?  How can He present His Bride to Himself without blemish when we are all inconsistent about which scriptures we allow to wash us?

In what we've been mistaught by misunderstanding dispensation, where is the hope of us ever seeing the abundant life that Jesus wanted for us and so wanted with abandon that He CAME, LIVED and DIED for us to experience? (Jn. 10:10)  Is there no more abundant life possible on this planet than what we read about in the book of Acts?  We all KNOW there is, counter to the unbelief associated with misunderstanding dipensation, and I haven't the least doubt that God is only waiting for us to prepare the way.  See how this whole physical dimension knows this: "For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God" (Rom. 8:19, see also Heb. 5:11-14 on how to get from here to there)  God's heart about this is expressed a few verses later (v32) in a verse that really needs to be read with our own emotions disarmingly receptive to God's emotions expressed here: "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"  See also Rom. 11, especially v15 "For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?" and v26: "And so all Israel shall be saved...".  Israel will be saved which ushers in life from the dead (even literally for those who'll receive it) for the rest of the world!  Coming soon to a theater (of operations) near you...    We know there remains a uniqueness of Israel by this.  Notice what draws Israel to Christ: being jealous of what Gentiles have (Rom. 10:19 & 11:11), rather than being drawn by Jesus' Second Coming or the Tribulation or anything like that.  Rather than the Rapture being imminent, the salvation of all Israel is really the next prophetic event that is imminent.  After that is the abundant life (the "life from the dead" of Rom. 11:15) Jesus referred to where the FULL scriptures will be seen to be relevant, true, and observed in light of Acts 15:1-32 and elsewhere.  There is no "dispensation" of Old Testament law that became obsolete by New Testament grace, but there IS simply differentiation between Israel and other nations concerning the Law of Moses which was promised to maintain that uniqueness of Israel (Ex. 19:5-6, Lev 26:12, Deut. 4:6, 7:6, etc.) until at least the saving of all Israel.  Do you see the difference between that and a supposed other means of salvation that produces or results from a misunderstanding of "dispensation"?

The specific verses that we're taught are obsolete are IMMEDIATELY adjacent to other verses we know not to be obsolete and lack ANY scripture guideline ANYWHERE to divide between them - verse x is still relevant but verse y immediately adjacent to it is obsolete.  In several of these very same examples, the rationale for the instruction is clearly given and spans several supposed dispensations going back to creation....  CHURCH LEADERS, DO YOU WANT YOUR CONGREGANTS TO READ THE BIBLE BUT JUST NOT BELIEVE IT?  OR WILL YOU REBUKE THOSE LIKE ME WHO READ WITH A BELIEVING HEART AND SEE THESE THINGS FROM THEIR BIBLES?   Isn't it astonishing that church leaders get so upset at someone who chooses to believe God, who gives them and me righteousness for doing so (Rom. 4:5), above the pulpit's contrary words?  In all seriousness, do they really think the Bride has made herself ready as she brazenly says some of God's words have now become satanic since leaving "that dispensation" rather than cooperate with their Author who says ("threatened", is that what you think?) He would wash us by them?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's not go any farther without a quick specific example we find in 1 Cor 14:33-35, which could be rendered "Keep your women from needing to be responsible in the long term for leading chuch services where there are men in that service who ought to be stepping up to that burdensome responsibility: for the order should reflect the pattern of the Bride's relationship to the Bridegroom.  Consider the contrast naturally and in upbringing between feminity and masculinity.  Consider natural and God-given principles of chivalry.  It is the male who ought to be thought of as more appropriately designed, conditioned, and with more margin of endurance to mature into handling corporate governance of an assortment of people that includes adult males, as the Christ has been placed over His Church. It is the male that is designed to more elegantly and without getting over-worked, use the confrontational and assertion techniques often required of a teacher or leader...."Let all things be done decently and in order" (v.40)  The basis for this teaching is natural ORDER - how a mother (yes, I do know I've jumped a gap from woman to mother) is designed naturally and appropriately to strongly prioritize minding her children above a message she might deliver to the Body while a father will defer (within reason) to those his wife's strong natural inclinations while he might similarly be delivering a message?  It is so common of pople who misunderstand dispensation to miss the significance of the older women being ordained to teach the younger women (Titus 2:4)!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As long as the term "dispensation" is misunderstood and misused, these unbecoming and wrongful contrasts cannot be reconciled.  They are unavoidable consequences of that blemish in the Bride - a blemish that, except it be washed by the water of the word, renders the Bride unpresentable as per Eph. 5:27.  All capital letters would be appropriate for me to say this: I appeal, not to any perceived authority in my words or lack thereof, but to these words' fidelity to God's heart and befitting this season of His calendar - His soon-arriving Kingdom.  There are times for Him to wink at blemishes and when old wineskins can be cavalier to reckon them to low priority, but not right now for new wineskins standing at the threshhold of this next season.  A less cavalier approach should be in the hearts of those of us who want to be most fit to enter this coming Kingdom age.  I'm not suggesting that only those most fit will enter, but I do point out that Jesus made clear there will be greater and lesser among those who do enter based on how we handle His least commandments (Matt. 5:19).

We're taught that while "dispensation" technically means "administration", it is still perfectly fine to use it as a synonym of "age" or "time"
    ...even though none, zero, not a single instance of the nine times dispensation is used by Jesus and the Apostle Paul does it ever remotely refer to a time nor time period.  It bears repeating, not even remotely!  The nine locations of the term are these: (Bible version abbreviations are courtesy http://biblegateway.com/versions/)

1) Luke 16:2,3,4 (Greek texts);
2) 3 times of Paul's COMMISSION to preach the Gospel (i.e., his JOB) 1 Corinthians 9:17
     (Greek texts, BRG, DRA, GNV, KJV, AKJV, WYC), Ephesians 3:2 (Greek texts, KJ21, ASV,
     BRG, DRA, GNV, JUB, KJV, NKJV, WYC), Colossians 1:25  (Greek texts, KJ21, ASV, BRG,
     DARBY, DRA, GNV, JUB, KJV, AKJV, RGT, WYC);
3) 2 times in referring to a WORK of God - Ephesians 3:9 (some but not all Greek texts,
     ASV, DRA, WYC), 1 Timothy 1:4 (some but not all Greek texts, ASV, DARBY);
4) 1 time in Ephesians 1:10 (Greek texts, KJK21, ASV, BRG, DRA, GNV, JUB, KJV, AKJV, NKJV, RGT, WYC) referring to
     "the dispensation of the end of times", a TASK that happens to be stated more clearly in the parallel chapter
     to this, Colossians 1, where verse 20 specifically states that TASK, also found in Acts 3:21 where it also
     is clearly a TASK for a future "time".  These references are consistently "time of a "task", not "time of a
     time" as would be the case in Eph 1:10 if time and dispensation were synonyms.

The summation of all that follows herein is this: Deut 29:29 stands in opposition - and as an alternative - to the current widespread misunderstanding of the term "dispensation":

"The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."

...pointing out that "for ever" means NOT "until the end of this dispensation", like the unbelief accompanying a misunderstanding of "dispensation" demands.

Unless you're all in already, you really should STOP here until you understand those words.  Continuing further without understanding those words is just a waste of your time.  Also STOP anytime throughout this if your Bible knowledge is too weak to be absolutely certain of the Bible context of any of these scriptures I use.  Know your Bible, and have enough confidence your Bible knowledge to base your beliefs in scripture rather than my words. I am not your personal Matthew Henry.

Now you might legitimately ask for specifics; like, a discussion about "dispensation" is boring - is it REALLY worth my time?  And - what things are so important to believe that we don't believe because of this misunderstanding?  And - why will a correct understanding of "dispensation" result in belief where I might now have unbelief?  And - what is the correct definition of "dispensation", anyway?  As I continue, I am keeping all those concerns of yours in mind.  Most of all though, I want your life to be more conformed to Kingdom of Heaven living as a result of simply believing ALL that God tells us.  I want your life, my life, to be FIT to live in the Kingdom about to be manifest on earth, just like we've been praying for for 2 millenia.  There are a few things about our beliefs we need to change to be more FIT to  enter the Kingdom that God is right now in the process of putting on earth.

Now in the next couple paragraphs or so, receive my sincere belaboring on the importance of choosing to hold to God's written word where it needs to displace wayward teachings we all have received from pulpits, commentaries and Bible study aids of man's authorship instead of God's.  (Anything copyrighted makes the claim to be of human authorship, and God's Word is by necessity in the public domain.)

Ps. 138:2 teaches us that God has magnified His word above all His Name, meaning that even though He has authority to act and decree contrary to His Word, He has determined not to.  Ps. 138:2 invites us to hold God to His Word being the highest standard, and according to 2 Pe. 1:18-19, the written Word is more sure than hearing God's voice from heaven. It should be abundantly obvious from these two verses, not to mention many others, that we are to let the authority of the written scripture rule in all matters it addresses, including how the term "dispensation" is used.

The prevalent connotation of the term "dispensation" is one of the segments of time as the Bible implicitely segments time into.  The actual denotation of the term is "administration".

I cannot emphasize enough that NEITHER of those definitions is anything even close to the true meaning as used in the Bible!  And this is NOT a harmless misunderstanding!

An argument could be made that "administration" and "dispensation" are synonyms, but  NOT ANY MORE.  Maybe in olde Englishe that argument could be made, but today's  synonyms for dispensation are words like "commission", "job", "assignment", or [a good] "work".  EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE NINE OCCURANCES OF THE GREEK WORD FOR DISPENSATION CONFORMS TO THIS.  NEVER, EVER CAN ANY OF THEM BE STRETCHED INTO BEING A SYNONYM FOR ANYTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TIME.

The proof of that assertion is in the reading and is an easy slam-dunk, but an even more urgent point is this - the end result of this discussion will NOT be to promote worship on Saturday or to observe Judaism's other teachings.  Paul's epistles to the Galatians and Romans, and Acts 15 are among the scriptures against Gentiles doing so in hopes they obey God by observing His commands to Israel.  Nonetheless, you WILL be challenged to receive a few scriptures that you've been taught NOT to believe, but you've never really had a clear reason why we shouldn't believe them.  You've never had a clear reason to not believe because there is no such reason in the Bible nor consistent with the Bible.

If you'd rather maintain the status quo connotation of "dispensation", think about why.  Safe, at least temporally; company to agreement; you're comfortable with that complexity; but most of all, you don't think you capable of comprehending the flawed rationale of scholars.  The scholars, whoever they are, that write the reference book and dictionary entries for the term "dispensation" stand a better chance of being right about it than I do, right?   It's that last point that we'll meet head-on right now.

We start by seeing the indisputable fact (I emphasize this!) that the term "dispensation" as used by Jesus and the Apostle Paul ALWAYS refers to someone's JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION or ENDEAVOR.  Then, EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, we'll show how the prevalent connotation is incompatible with a number of scripture verses besides just Deut 29:29 shown above.  Then we'll examine why historically the current connotation became accepted by scholars.  Without addressing each of these points with unbiased intellectual honesty and with a rationale you can unreservedly hold to, I will expect you to remain steadfast to the status quo.  (As an aside, David Robert Palmer publishes some very good insight as a Bible translator, but none on the term "dispensation".  I'd like his someday...)

The Strong's number for the Greek term of dispensation is 3622, and the transliteration from the Greek is "oikonomia".  It is used 9 times in the entire Bible, two of those occurrences being arguably debateable, but even so, those two questionable ones still conform to the useage and context of the other 7 occurrences.

On the other hand, the transliteration of the Greek term for "age" is "aión", and the Strong's Greek number is 165...totally etymologically unrelated to 3622 "oikonomia".  "Aión" in its various forms is used some 125 times in the New Testament.  ALWAYS clearly referring to a time period or time eternal, never to a JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION or ENDEAVOR.  Some sources will use the term "age" as in "the New Testament age".  The problem with simply switching from saying "dispensation" to saying "age" or "covenant" is _likely_ the Deut 29:29 useage of "for ever" is still again disregarded and still no Scripture context explicitly teaches those unbeliefs.

In case you would lightly forgive wrong useage of "dispensation" and so decide "age" is a better term  with which to carry forward the unbelief, so that you'd think all we have to do is change out "dispensation" for "age" and all is well, STOP!  There has been deceit or incompetence in the manner that "dispensation" has been taught to us...let's take that as serious as it warrants - very, as I've already hinted to!  If the Bible teachers, scholars and preachers have deceitully OR INCOMPETENTLY misappropriated the term "dispensation" like I'm showing you they have, you need to question their standing optherwise to simply rename the corral that contains the same dispensation-connected unbeliefs.  In a large or small way, I and they - yes, my previous self included - have made fools of us with the unbelief they've taught us.  I beg you to think about that sincerely.  The whole point of this presentation is to expose the unbeliefs that insist Bible-day works of God are now obsolete...specifically how those unbeliefs are propagated in the name of name of "dispensation", but if they are propagated in the name of "age", that is just as unbiblical and problematic and incompetence can then be ruled out in favor of intentional deceit!  Receive God's words, not man's, and expect righteousness for doing so. (Rom. 4:3)  Can mere men, authors of Bible dictionaries and commentaries, offer you righteousness for believing them?  Yet God does do that for believing Him.  According to Ps 119:99-100 you can have more understanding than all those teachers when you hold God's Word higher than theirs; you can understand more than the ancients, because you hold to God's precepts when they differ from the commentary and dictionary authors.  Open up your grasp to what you've heretofore been taught from the pulpit of Bible study materials, not so much in entirety, but do so where God's written word clearly disagrees with it.

Remember the contrast between the Thessalonians and the more noble Bereans: the Apostle Paul commended the Thessalonians in 1 Thess. 2:13 "For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe."  Yet even with such high praise, the Bereans are called "more noble" in Acts 17:11 "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."  The difference here between commendable and more noble is the extent to which the written Word is magnified, and my hope right here is to encourage you to aspire to noble.  See in what follows that I am offering you scriptures, not regurgitated sermon talk points.  Know that the scriptures (knowledge of, obedience to, declaring of, application of, etc.) are where great power is, and multi-faceted power, at that (a huge number of of scriptures tell of this).  Judge whether these scriptures are in context and worthy of all acceptance, or out of context and unrightly divided.  I've determined to use them in context and rightly divided.

Here, now, is the evidence...what God says and offers us righteousness to believe.

For the very first 3 Bible occurrences of "dispensation" Jesus uses it in Luke 16:2,3,4.  Jesus tells how the unjust steward was told that he was about to lose his "DISPENSATION"...his JOB, not his TIME SPAN.  His master was telling that unjust steward that he was about to get FIRED, not KILLED.  The other 6 occurrences of the term are used by the Apostle Paul, and they refer to

1) 3 times of Paul's commission to preach the Gospel (i.e., his JOB - 1 Corinthians 9:17, Ephesians 3:2, Colossians 1:25), or
2) 2 times in referring to a WORK of God (Ephesians 3:9, 1 Timothy 1:4 but presumably not included in some manuscripts), or
3) one time in Ephesians 1:10 referring to "the dispensation of the end of times", which happens to be stated more clearly in the parallel chapter to Ephesians 1 - that chapter being Colossians 1, where verse 20 specifically states that TASK.  When you look, you'll see in a couple of these passages that, once he mentions it, he dwells just a little more on the term "dispensation", so great was his passion about his own.  But NEVER is the term "dispensation" used in the Bible to refer to ANY time or period of time.  Never.  It's ALWAYS a JOB...a TASK...a WORK.  After reading the occurrences using the correct synonyms, we'll see if the currently popular connotation makes any sense at all, and if it fits the understanding of simplicity, as in "...the simplicity that is in Christ..." (2 Cor 11:3)

Expansion of #1 above...these are self-evident that they mean JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION:

1 Corinthians 9:16-17 - "For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!  For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation _of_the_gospel_(italicized) is committed unto me." The three italicized words are not in the untranslated epistle so that "necessity is laid upon" = "dispensation is committed".

Ephesians 3:2 - "if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you,"

Colossians 1:25 - "Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;"

Important: Paul never says "...my dispensation...", but rather "...a dispensation...unto me..." or "...the dispensation...to me...".  Yet it is nonetheless self-evidently synonymous with his personal portion of the Great Commission.  Read the verses again if you question that.

Expansion of #2 above:

Ephesians 3:9 (ASV) - "...and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;"  (ASV is one of a minority of translations that remain true from Greek to English to retaining the term dispensation for clarification here)
The required context for v.9 is set in the prior verse "Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;" (KJV)  Bear in mind that Paul's mere mention 7 verses earlier of the term dispensation started him into this prolonged statement of "his" commission, if you will - the dispensation and grace to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles as in v.6.  (Paul uses the word grace in vs.2,7 & 8 to refer to God's provision for Paul to carry out the dispensation to him - his work of preaching the gospel as delineated in v.6.)  Consistent with v.2, 1 Corinthians 9:17, and Colossians 1:25 Paul does not say "...my dispensation...", but rather "...the dispensation...".  So regardless of whether the article is definite or indefinite, the point still stands that the term means JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION as it does above.  Try synonym swapping - "...to make all men see [learn] what is [God's new endeavor/work-in-progress] heretofore a mystery..." makes much more sense than "...to make all men see what is [the age] heretofore a mystery...".  Observe also in v.5 the term "ages" is correctly used in the way "dispensation" is often misused: "...Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit...".  IF "AGE" AND "DISPENSATION" WERE SYNONYMS LIKE MOST PEOPLE THINK OF THEM, V.5 WOULD BE THE RIGHT PLACE FOR "DISPENSATION" TO BE USED.  That bears repeating ad infinitum!  If you doubt that whatsoever, read the entire chapter in context until it sinks in!



Expansion of #3 above:


I hope now you're better able to know why you were so uncomfortable explaining away many scripture verses that church life obviously doesn't line up with.

1 Cor 1:10
"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."  This will be impossible if we continue misusing dispensation, unless the Church has a worldwide council culminating in a unanimous decision of which scripture teachings we'll stand united against [our being washed by].  Then what will you do with believers like me?  Because you're certainly not able to offer me more righteousness for believing you than God offers me for believing Him.

I'll admit, God has verbally told at least one person I know of that there is a different reason for His commands in 1 Cor. 14:33-35 than the reason He has written there.  Nonetheless, I will stand alone on the Word of God, the B I B L E, to challenge God herewith: "If Your reason found in v. 34 and 35, and Your reason found in 1 Tim. 2:13,14 have become WRONG because of the passing of time or new revelation, then You need to change Your more sure written Word so those of us who live by EVERY word You speak know so!  And You should call me 'more noble' for insisting to You on this!  You know that when I pray, I declare back to You what You have SPOKEN by WRITING and promised in Your Word, and I will continue to do so unashamedly."

Incidentally, the reason God gave to this person I write of is that women [are we to believe all and only?] were located in the rear of the church taking care of their or someone else's children, which made their gender-equal participation disruptive because of mere distal location rather than gender.  Contrast that verbal rationale with the written one, "it is a shame for women to speak in the church".  Did God really have to lie in written and sealed Scripture to give this instruction?  Of course not!  Don't get me wrong - by no means AT ALL do I imply that God didn't tell this to that person.  I fully believe this person recounts truthfully that they heard this from God, but I also fully believe God wants us to quote His written Word right back to Him about it if we [rightly, IMO] struggle with the seeming or actual dissonance there.  Can God speak contradictory statements?  Yes, in which case all those statements must be TRUE (Rom. 4:17 - they become true when He speaks them if they weren't before then) - none can be false! (Titus 1:2)  In all this, I am determined to accept every word that proceeds from His mouth, for my very life's sake, even apparent contradictions to His written word.  I'll take the seaming contradictions along with the rational, but I would just want Him to expound unto me, please, as Apollos was expounded to by Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:26) or add more revelation to be subsequently included, i.e. SEALED, with the written Bible.  Incidentally, it was also a shame that Deborah led men into battle (Judges 4:9) when the man refused, yet God was mighty to use her that way when the man was unwilling to take receive that grace.  I can accept allowing some shame in cases like that of male unwillingness or unfitness, but not so easily when males who are both willing and fit to teach arrive but are judged less desirable in general to teach men than the woman is - special revelation excepted and with men's attendence explicitely optional, obviously. (1 Tim 2:11-14, which contains a "dispensation"-resistant rationale because it goes back to Creation)

From Ecc. 7:8-10 - "Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof...Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this."  If this is said as scriptures become less relevant because of misunderstanding dispensation, it would be the same level of satanic as saying "The less that Scripture is relevant, the better".

Now faith is the product of your envisioned desires; better yet, of your efforts toward those desires; better yet, of your "failure is not an option" determination and "never give up" persistent effort until their fruition (from Heb. 11:1, understood in context of the remainder of the chapter).  Let's envision the kingdom of heaven and make it happen.  The generation that does so - and there will be one - will doubtless be regarded as members of the Hebrews chapter 11 club.

If you're determined to be an inflexible old wineskin because you're too proud to change your public stance you've preached for so long, I'm sorry for you, but I do wish peace upon you until your replacement.

DISCLAIMER:  A few observations I've stated were first taught by others, including Kat Kerr and Howard Storm that I know of, though I do know these are fallible people like we all are.

CHECKING ALPHABETS  

Checking alphabets
Lucy Pevensie and her brothers Peter and Edmund found themselves in Narnia,the land of magic during the World War III. Narnia was completely filled with gentle people and also it is where the trees sing, fauns dance and animals talk. Being from England, Lucy wanted to teach the kids , English language. She started teaching them alphabets but then she remembered that she might go back to London and felt sad. Edmund and Peter discussed with each other and suggested an idea to Lucy to come up with a program so that the kids can learn on their own when she was not there. Can you help Lucy to write a C++program to check whether the given character is a vowel or Consonant.

The input consists of a character.

The output should be any one of the below-given strings.

“Vowel” or “Consonant” or “Not an alphabet”.

remove RxJS code from the transports code

After doing a proof-of-concept looking at how some parts of the code
looks like without RxJS (#916), this is a first functional proposal
which looks good enough to me to be merged.

It removes all RxJS code from the `transports` code in `src/transports`.

As a reminder, the reasons for doing this are:

  1. Observables are complicated and full of implicit behaviors
     (lazily running, sync or async, unsubscribing automatically after
     the last unsubscription etc.) which is difficult to reason about,
     especially for a newcomer.

     Things like exploiting schedulers through the `deferSubscriptions`
     util to work-around some subtle potential race-conditions, or
     merging Observables in a specific order for similar reasons, are
     ugly hacks that are difficult to explain to someone not familiar
     with that code.

     Even for us with multiple years of experience with it, we sometimes
     struggle with it.

  2. Promises, event listeners - and direct callbacks in general - are
     generally much more explicit and most developpers (at least JS/TS
     devs) are familiar with them.

  3. Call stacks are close to inexploitable when using RxJS.

  4. Promises provide async/await syntax which can improve drastically
     the readability of our async-heavy code, which for the moment
     suffer from callback hells almost everywhere.

However, I'm still not sure if this wish (getting rid of RxJS) is shared
by other maintainers and/or contributors, so it is still only a proposal.

Thoughts?

add JNI lib for interacting with macOS security framework

Description
===========

The `security` commandline tool on macOS is a horrible tool.
It has a very ugly interface and most commands have weird ways of
returnning values. Sometimes stuff gets pushed to `stdout` and
sometimes to `stderr`. Not all features are supported, like getting
the actual status of a keychain. To have more control over the
execution and the output I decided to move some of the core keychain
handling logic into a JNI lib.
At the moment this means most APIs that provide basic keychain
logic (`create`, `lock`, `unlock`, etc) are now implemented with
a JNI lib. The rest of the functionality is still provided with
the `security` cli wrapper commands.

JNI
---

JNI on its own is a tough bit of software. I decided to use the
[nokee] gradle plugin suite to build package a JNI jar with a native
libraty written in pure `c`. This is all contained in a seperate
gradle subproject.

```

 ┌────────────────┐
 │                │
 │ macos-security │
 │                │
 └───────┬────────┘
         │
         │        ┌────────────────────┐
         │        │                    │
         └───────►│ macos-security-jni │
                  │                    │
                  └────────────────────┘
```

This new project contains two major wrappers.

* MacOsSecurity
* KeychainRef

The `MacOsSecurity` class is the main native interface and provides
the raw JNI methods. I decided to wrap the functions provided by
the apple [Security Framework] as close as possible without to much
JNI back and forth. Means when possible only use scalar parameters
and simple types JNI supports out of the box.

`KeychainRef` on the other hand contains methods that allow to pass
more jave natural objects like `File`, `List<>` etc. These will
be translated back and forth. My main intention is that
`MacOsSecurity` should not be used directly from consuming libraries.

The `KeychainRef` object is also interesting because of a second fact.
This object is mainly an interface. It's the main object returned
and or passed to `MacOsSecurity`. The kechain references in the
[Security Framework] are memory managed with a reference counting
model. The moment we pass a keychain ref to JAVA land we are responsible
of `releasing` it again. To make this as easy as possible I decided
to create this interface. The `c` code will instanciate an object
which implements this interface which is not constructable from Java.
This object has a `finalizer` which calls into JNI again to release
the reference. This makes it easy to use these references without
thinking to much about the underlying memory management model.

Breaking Chagnes
----------------

This patch will introduce breaking API changes. I thought about this
long and think to leverage this new JNI interface best we should use
the `KeychainRef` as the main handle to pass keychain references.
The old API used `File` objects since keychains are just files on the
harddisc. But I like the fact to use a strict datatype to describe
a keychain rather that a generic `File` object. I updated everything
to use the new object. From the outside it is quite easy to move from
the `File` based API to the new one. The `KeychainRef` interface has
static methods to either create or open (get) keychain references from
files. The underlying files don't have to exists to fetch a valid
`KeychainRef`.

Publish Changes
---------------

I updated also the publish flow slightly since we need to publish
two jars at the same time. I didn't want to open a new repo for
the JNI part as this belongs together in a single repo anyways.
I moved the main publish configuration for gradle into a file
`publish-helper.gradle` which is sourced by the two gradle projects.
The rest is taken care of by the maven-publish/nexus publish plugins.

This patch is rather big for my taste. I don't think breaking it up
makes a lot of sense here.

Changes
=======

* ![ADD] ![GRADLE] subproject `macos-security-jni`
* ![ADD] `JNI` library to expose [Security Framework] functions to Java
* ![BREAK] Use `KeychainRef` as the base keychain objects rather than `File`
* ![IMPROVE] publish to publish multiple projects (jars) at the same time

"8:50am. Let me chill a bit.

This seems interesting.

https://nvlabs.github.io/alias-free-gan/

The image quality is really impressive.

9:05am. Right now I am reading the paper. I had time to think about what I want to try tackling the Holdem training next.

What I am going to do is implement fast averaging on top of the slow one I am already doing and have the network train against the fast average. For all I know this might work even for GANs. If not, I always have the duality gap method to fall back on.

9:35am. Ok, focus me. Let me read that GAN paper, a few chapter of Hagure Idol and then I will implement my idea and let it run for a while.

10:05am. Done with the above. I do not get a thing of that paper. But it is quite impressive.

For the time being let me just do my own thing. GANs are something I will tackle when the hardware costs go down.

```py
    favg_iter = 100
    ...
    def make_avg(max_t):
        def avg_fn(avg_p, p, t): return avg_p + (p - avg_p) / min(max_t, t + 1)
        return AveragedModel(value,avg_fn=avg_fn), AveragedModel(policy,avg_fn=avg_fn), AveragedModel(head,avg_fn=avg_fn)

    valuea, policya, heada = make_avg(iter_chk)
    valuefa, policyfa, headfa = make_avg(favg_iter)
```

Let me do this.

10:20am.

```py
def create_nn_agent(iter_train,iter_avg,iter_chk,vs_self,vs_one,neural,uniform_player): # self play NN
    assert ((iter_train + iter_avg) % iter_chk == 0)

    opt = SignSGD([
        {'params': value.parameters(), 'lr': 2 ** -6},
        {'params': policy.parameters()}
        ],{'lr': 2 ** -8})

    def make_avg(max_t):

        # logging.info(f"The reward vs the uniform is {r.mean()}")
        opt.step()
        valuefa.update_parameters(value); policyfa.update_parameters(policy); headfa.update_parameters(head)

        if is_avg: valuea.update_parameters(value); policya.update_parameters(policy); heada.update_parameters(head)

    logging.info("** TRAINING START **")
    t1 = time.perf_counter()

    for i in range(1,iter_train+iter_avg+1):
        is_avg = iter_train < i

        if i % iter_chk == 0:
            with open(f"dump/nn_agent_{i}.nnreg",'wb') as f: torch.save((value,policy,head),f)
            if is_avg:

```

The idea I had yesterday was to make a copy of the net at the present step and train the agent against that, but during the night it occurred to me that I could just have it train against its average. This should be an interesting experiment. Let me run it for a quarter of the iterations that I have yesterday.

```
AttributeError: 'AveragedModel' object has no attribute 'head'
```

Ah whops. I should extract the module.

10:25am.

```py
    valuea, policya, heada = make_avg(iter_chk) # The slow average
    valuefa, policyfa, headfa = make_avg(favg_iter) # The fast average
    valuefa.requires_grad_
```

Damn, I should really be turning off the requires_grad_ for this. I'll have to check out the state of that.

```py
import torch
import torch.nn
from torch.optim.swa_utils import AveragedModel

a = torch.nn.Linear(2,2,False)
b = AveragedModel(a)
b.requires_grad_(False)
a.weight.requires_grad
b.module.weight.requires_grad
```

There is no conflict. Turning off the grad on `b`, does not do it on `a`. And the avg model does have it on by default.

10:30am.

```py
valuefa.requires_grad_(False), policyfa.requires_grad_(False), headfa.requires_grad_(False)
```

No, it is not important forget this.

Ok, it already played 1k hands. Let me try it out.

...No, it just keeps raising like a moron again.

Let me try the 1.5k.

Oh it raise do 15 instead of half stack! This seems promising.

10:40am. It is still quite awful, but at least it is developing some sort of diversity in its actions. It still does not know how to fold though. Let me try the 2k player.

10:45am. 2k is trash. It has not moved at all from its policy. How about 2.5k?

Oh it raise to 5. That is different.

It still did not learn to fold.

10:50am. Let me try the 3.5k.

It has gone back to making huge raises. It seems the primary challenge today will be figuring out how to get it to fold.

Enough. I can't bear this anymore. I'll abort the training. If it cannot learn to fold I think the most likely culprit is the value function.

```
head_decay = 1.0 - 2 ** -2
```

Maybe this decay is way too high.

```py
head_decay = 1.0 - 2 ** -10
```

Let me try this. With Leduc finding the right value was no problem, but with what I have now, it might be forgetting too quickly.

I at least want to see it learning to fold trash hands.

Maybe I should go back to Leduc and see how it does when there is no decay.

Actually, let me try that out here. I'll turn off head decay just to see how it does.

I'd bet it would do just fine without decay. But too much decay could very well hurt it.

11am. This is not so bad. Training the agent and playing against it is something I should have been doing from the start.

This is the kind of work, I've dreamed about.

Let me try the 500 agent.

11:20am. I've aborted it again.

So far my theories have all turned out to be wrong. I thought it is an aggrodonk because of optimization vagaries, but now I am not sure.

Instead of doing what I have been doing so far, let me ditch playing against the average and increase the batch size by a factor of 2 ** 7. Combined with signSGD maybe the variance of the gradients is just too high.

11:25am.

```py
def create_nn_agent(iter_train,iter_avg,iter_chk,vs_self,vs_one,neural,uniform_player): # self play NN
    assert ((iter_train + iter_avg) % iter_chk == 0)

    favg_iter = 100
    head_decay = 1.0 - 2 ** -2

    value, policy, head = neural_create_model(neural.size)

        # vs_one(batch_size // 2,plfa,pl)
        opt.step()
        # valuefa.update_parameters(value); policyfa.update_parameters(policy); headfa.update_parameters(head)

        if is_avg: valuea.update_parameters(value); policya.update_parameters(policy); heada.update_parameters(head)

    logging.info("** TRAINING START **")
    t1 = time.perf_counter()

    for i in range(1,iter_train+iter_avg+1):
        is_avg = iter_train < i
        run(is_avg)
        if i % iter_chk == 0:
            with open(f"dump/nn_agent_{i}.nnreg",'wb') as f: torch.save((value,policy,head),f)
            if is_avg:

    logging.info("** TRAINING DONE **")
    t2 = time.perf_counter()
    logging.info(f"TIME ELAPSED: {t2-t1:0.4f}")
```

Let me try doing this.

```
    sample_probs += action_mask_inv / (action_mask_inv.sum(-1,keepdim=True) * (1 / epsilon))
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 82.00 MiB (GPU 0; 4.00 GiB total capacity; 2.80 GiB already allocated; 6.73 MiB free; 2.82 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch)
```

No helping it. Let me lower the batch size.

```py
for _ in range(2 ** 3): vs_self(batch_size,pl)
```

I've lowered the batch size to 2 ** 14. Let me try doing it like this.

11:40am. No forget this. Such a large batch size for a single step is just way too high.

12:25pm. I am thinking. Let me stop here for the morning."

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

This adds a COM class that implements `IExplorerCommand`, which is what lets us populate the context menu entry. We expose that type through a new DLL that is simply responsible for the shell extension, so that explorer doesn't need to load the entire Terminal just to populate that entry.

The COM class is tied to the application through some new entries in the manifest. The Clsid values are IMPORTANT - they must match the UUID of the implementation type. However, the `Verb` in the manifest didn't seem important.

bpf: do not change gso_size during bpf_skb_change_proto()

This is technically a backwards incompatible change in behaviour,
but I'm going to argue that it is very unlikely to break things,
and likely to fix *far* more then it breaks.

In no particular order, various reasons follow:

(a) I've long had a bug assigned to myself to debug a super rare kernel
crash on Android Pixel phones which can (per stacktrace) be traced back
to bpf clat ipv6 to ipv4 protocol conversion causing some sort of ugly
failure much later on during transmit deep in the GSO engine, AFAICT
precisely because of this change to gso_size, though I've never been able
to manually reproduce it.
I believe it may be related to the particular network offload support
of attached usb ethernet dongle being used for tethering off of an
IPv6-only cellular connection.  The reason might be we end up with more
segments than max permitted, or with a gso packet with only one segment...
(either way we break some assumption and hit a BUG_ON)

(b) There is no check that the gso_size is > 20 when reducing it by 20,
so we might end up with a negative (or underflowing) gso_size or
a gso_size of 0.  This can't possibly be good.
Indeed this is probably somehow exploitable (or at least can result
in a kernel crash) by delivering crafted packets and perhaps triggering
an infinite loop or a divide by zero...
As a reminder: gso_size (mss) is related to mtu, but not directly
derived from it: gso_size/mss may be significantly smaller then
one would get by deriving from local mtu.  And on some nics (which
do loose mtu checking on receive, it may even potentially be larger,
for example my work pc with 1500 mtu can receive 1520 byte frames
[and sometimes does due to bugs in a vendor plat46 implementation]).
Indeed even just going from 21 to 1 is potentially problematic because
it increases the number of segments by a factor of 21 (think DoS,
or some other crash due to too many segments).

(c) It's always safe to not increase the gso_size, because it doesn't
result in the max packet size increasing.  So the skb_increase_gso_size()
call was always unnecessary for correctness (and outright undesirable, see
later).  As such the only part which is potentially dangerous (ie. could
cause backwards compatibility issues) is the removal of the
skb_decrease_gso_size() call.

(d) If the packets are ultimately destined to the local device, then
there is absolutely no benefit to playing around with gso_size.
It only matters if the packets will egress the device.  ie. we're
either forwarding, or transmitting from the device.

(e) This logic only triggers for packets which are GSO.  It does not
trigger for skbs which are not GSO.  It will not convert a non-GSO mtu
sized packet into a GSO packet (and you don't even know what the mtu is,
so you can't even fix it).  As such your transmit path must *already* be
able to handle an mtu 20 bytes larger then your receive path (for ipv4
to ipv6 translation) - and indeed 28 bytes larger due to ipv4 fragments.
Thus removing the skb_decrease_gso_size() call doesn't actually increase
the size of the packets your transmit side must be able to handle.
ie. to handle non-GSO max-mtu packets, the ipv4/ipv6 device/route mtus
must already be set correctly.  Since for example with an ipv4 egress mtu
of 1500, ipv4 to ipv6 translation will already build 1520 byte ipv6 frames,
so you need a 1520 byte device mtu.  This means if your ipv6 device's
egress mtu is 1280, your ipv4 route must be 1260 (and actually 1252,
because of the need to handle fragments).  This is to handle normal non-GSO
packets.  Thus the reduction is simply not needed for GSO packets,
because when they're correctly built, they will already be the right size.

(f) TSO/GSO should be able to exactly undo GRO: the number of packets
(TCP segments) should not be modified, so that TCP's mss counting works
correctly (this matters for congestion control).
If protocol conversion changes the gso_size, then the number of TCP segments
may increase or decrease.  Packet loss after protocol conversion can result
in partial loss of mss segments that the sender sent.  How's the sending
TCP stack going to react to receiving ACKs/SACKs in the middle of the
segments it sent?

(g) skb_{decrease,increase}_gso_size() are already no-ops for GSO_BY_FRAGS
case (besides triggering WARN_ON_ONCE). This means you already cannot
guarantee that gso_size (and thus resulting packet mtu) is changed.
ie. you must assume it won't be changed.

(h) changing gso_size is outright buggy for UDP GSO packets, where framing
matters (I believe that's also the case for SCTP, but it's already excluded
by [g]).  So the only remaining case is TCP, which also doesn't want it
(see [f]).

(i) see also the reasoning on the previous attempt at fixing this
(commit fa7b83bf3b156c767f3e4a25bbf3817b08f3ff8e) which shows
that the current behaviour causes TCP packet loss:

  In the forwarding path GRO -> BPF 6 to 4 -> GSO for TCP traffic, the
  coalesced packet payload can be > MSS, but < MSS + 20.

  bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4() will upgrade the MSS and it can be > the payload
  length. After then tcp_gso_segment checks for the payload length if it
  is <= MSS. The condition is causing the packet to be dropped.

  tcp_gso_segment():
    [...]
    mss = skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size;
    if (unlikely(skb->len <= mss)) goto out;
    [...]

Thus changing the gso_size is simply a very bad idea.
Increasing is unnecessary and buggy, and decreasing can go negative.

dma-buf: Document dma-buf implicit fencing/resv fencing rules

Docs for struct dma_resv are fairly clear:

"A reservation object can have attached one exclusive fence (normally
associated with write operations) or N shared fences (read
operations)."

https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/driver-api/dma-buf.html#reservation-objects

Furthermore a review across all of upstream.

First of render drivers and how they set implicit fences:

- nouveau follows this contract, see in validate_fini_no_ticket()

			nouveau_bo_fence(nvbo, fence, !!b->write_domains);

  and that last boolean controls whether the exclusive or shared fence
  slot is used.

- radeon follows this contract by setting

		p->relocs[i].tv.num_shared = !r->write_domain;

  in radeon_cs_parser_relocs(), which ensures that the call to
  ttm_eu_fence_buffer_objects() in radeon_cs_parser_fini() will do the
  right thing.

- vmwgfx seems to follow this contract with the shotgun approach of
  always setting ttm_val_buf->num_shared = 0, which means
  ttm_eu_fence_buffer_objects() will only use the exclusive slot.

- etnaviv follows this contract, as can be trivially seen by looking
  at submit_attach_object_fences()

- i915 is a bit a convoluted maze with multiple paths leading to
  i915_vma_move_to_active(). Which sets the exclusive flag if
  EXEC_OBJECT_WRITE is set. This can either come as a buffer flag for
  softpin mode, or through the write_domain when using relocations. It
  follows this contract.

- lima follows this contract, see lima_gem_submit() which sets the
  exclusive fence when the LIMA_SUBMIT_BO_WRITE flag is set for that
  bo

- msm follows this contract, see msm_gpu_submit() which sets the
  exclusive flag when the MSM_SUBMIT_BO_WRITE is set for that buffer

- panfrost follows this contract with the shotgun approach of just
  always setting the exclusive fence, see
  panfrost_attach_object_fences(). Benefits of a single engine I guess

- v3d follows this contract with the same shotgun approach in
  v3d_attach_fences_and_unlock_reservation(), but it has at least an
  XXX comment that maybe this should be improved

- v4c uses the same shotgun approach of always setting an exclusive
  fence, see vc4_update_bo_seqnos()

- vgem also follows this contract, see vgem_fence_attach_ioctl() and
  the VGEM_FENCE_WRITE. This is used in some igts to validate prime
  sharing with i915.ko without the need of a 2nd gpu

- vritio follows this contract again with the shotgun approach of
  always setting an exclusive fence, see virtio_gpu_array_add_fence()

This covers the setting of the exclusive fences when writing.

Synchronizing against the exclusive fence is a lot more tricky, and I
only spot checked a few:

- i915 does it, with the optional EXEC_OBJECT_ASYNC to skip all
  implicit dependencies (which is used by vulkan)

- etnaviv does this. Implicit dependencies are collected in
  submit_fence_sync(), again with an opt-out flag
  ETNA_SUBMIT_NO_IMPLICIT. These are then picked up in
  etnaviv_sched_dependency which is the
  drm_sched_backend_ops->dependency callback.

- v4c seems to not do much here, maybe gets away with it by not having
  a scheduler and only a single engine. Since all newer broadcom chips than
  the OG vc4 use v3d for rendering, which follows this contract, the
  impact of this issue is fairly small.

- v3d does this using the drm_gem_fence_array_add_implicit() helper,
  which then it's drm_sched_backend_ops->dependency callback
  v3d_job_dependency() picks up.

- panfrost is nice here and tracks the implicit fences in
  panfrost_job->implicit_fences, which again the
  drm_sched_backend_ops->dependency callback panfrost_job_dependency()
  picks up. It is mildly questionable though since it only picks up
  exclusive fences in panfrost_acquire_object_fences(), but not buggy
  in practice because it also always sets the exclusive fence. It
  should pick up both sets of fences, just in case there's ever going
  to be a 2nd gpu in a SoC with a mali gpu. Or maybe a mali SoC with a
  pcie port and a real gpu, which might actually happen eventually. A
  bug, but easy to fix. Should probably use the
  drm_gem_fence_array_add_implicit() helper.

- lima is nice an easy, uses drm_gem_fence_array_add_implicit() and
  the same schema as v3d.

- msm is mildly entertaining. It also supports MSM_SUBMIT_NO_IMPLICIT,
  but because it doesn't use the drm/scheduler it handles fences from
  the wrong context with a synchronous dma_fence_wait. See
  submit_fence_sync() leading to msm_gem_sync_object(). Investing into
  a scheduler might be a good idea.

- all the remaining drivers are ttm based, where I hope they do
  appropriately obey implicit fences already. I didn't do the full
  audit there because a) not follow the contract would confuse ttm
  quite well and b) reading non-standard scheduler and submit code
  which isn't based on drm/scheduler is a pain.

Onwards to the display side.

- Any driver using the drm_gem_plane_helper_prepare_fb() helper will
  correctly. Overwhelmingly most drivers get this right, except a few
  totally dont. I'll follow up with a patch to make this the default
  and avoid a bunch of bugs.

- I didn't audit the ttm drivers, but given that dma_resv started
  there I hope they get this right.

In conclusion this IS the contract, both as documented and
overwhelmingly implemented, specically as implemented by all render
drivers except amdgpu.

Amdgpu tried to fix this already in

commit 049aca4363d8af87cab8d53de5401602db3b9999

Date:   Wed Sep 19 16:54:35 2018 +0200

    drm/amdgpu: fix using shared fence for exported BOs v2

but this fix falls short on a number of areas:

- It's racy, by the time the buffer is shared it might be too late. To
  make sure there's definitely never a problem we need to set the
  fences correctly for any buffer that's potentially exportable.

- It's breaking uapi, dma-buf fds support poll() and differentitiate
  between, which was introduced in

	commit 9b495a5887994a6d74d5c261d012083a92b94738
	Author: Maarten Lankhorst <maarten.lankhorst@canonical.com>
	Date:   Tue Jul 1 12:57:43 2014 +0200

	    dma-buf: add poll support, v3

- Christian König wants to nack new uapi building further on this
  dma_resv contract because it breaks amdgpu, quoting

  "Yeah, and that is exactly the reason why I will NAK this uAPI change.

  "This doesn't works for amdgpu at all for the reasons outlined above."

  https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/f2eb6751-2f82-9b23-f57e-548de5b729de@gmail.com/

  Rejecting new development because your own driver is broken and
  violates established cross driver contracts and uapi is really not
  how upstream works.

Now this patch will have a severe performance impact on anything that
runs on multiple engines. So we can't just merge it outright, but need
a bit a plan:

- amdgpu needs a proper uapi for handling implicit fencing. The funny
  thing is that to do it correctly, implicit fencing must be treated
  as a very strange IPC mechanism for transporting fences, where both
  setting the fence and dependency intercepts must be handled
  explicitly. Current best practices is a per-bo flag to indicate
  writes, and a per-bo flag to to skip implicit fencing in the CS
  ioctl as a new chunk.

- Since amdgpu has been shipping with broken behaviour we need an
  opt-out flag from the butchered implicit fencing model to enable the
  proper explicit implicit fencing model.

- for kernel memory fences due to bo moves at least the i915 idea is
  to use ttm_bo->moving. amdgpu probably needs the same.

- since the current p2p dma-buf interface assumes the kernel memory
  fence is in the exclusive dma_resv fence slot we need to add a new
  fence slot for kernel fences, which must never be ignored. Since
  currently only amdgpu supports this there's no real problem here
  yet, until amdgpu gains a NO_IMPLICIT CS flag.

- New userspace needs to ship in enough desktop distros so that users
  wont notice the perf impact. I think we can ignore LTS distros who
  upgrade their kernels but not their mesa3d snapshot.

- Then when this is all in place we can merge this patch here.

What is not a solution to this problem here is trying to make the
dma_resv rules in the kernel more clever. The fundamental issue here
is that the amdgpu CS uapi is the least expressive one across all
drivers (only equalled by panfrost, which has an actual excuse) by not
allowing any userspace control over how implicit sync is conducted.

Until this is fixed it's completely pointless to make the kernel more
clever to improve amdgpu, because all we're doing is papering over
this uapi design issue. amdgpu needs to attain the status quo
established by other drivers first, once that's achieved we can tackle
the remaining issues in a consistent way across drivers.

v2: Bas pointed me at AMDGPU_GEM_CREATE_EXPLICIT_SYNC, which I
entirely missed.

This is great because it means the amdgpu specific piece for proper
implicit fence handling exists already, and that since a while. The
only thing that's now missing is
- fishing the implicit fences out of a shared object at the right time
- setting the exclusive implicit fence slot at the right time.

Jason has a patch series to fill that gap with a bunch of generic
ioctl on the dma-buf fd:

https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/20210520190007.534046-1-jason@jlekstrand.net/

v3: Since Christian has fixed amdgpu now in

commit 8c505bdc9c8b955223b054e34a0be9c3d841cd20 (drm-misc/drm-misc-next)
Author: Christian König <christian.koenig@amd.com>
Date:   Wed Jun 9 13:51:36 2021 +0200

    drm/amdgpu: rework dma_resv handling v3

Use the audit covered in this commit message as the excuse to update
the dma-buf docs around dma_buf.resv usage across drivers.

Since dynamic importers have different rules also hammer these in
again while we're at it.

v4:
- Add the missing "through the device" in the dynamic section that I
  overlooked.
- Fix a kerneldoc markup mistake, the link didn't connect

v5:
- A few s/should/must/ to make clear what must be done (if the driver
  does implicit sync) and what's more a maybe (Daniel Stone)
- drop all the example api discussion, that needs to be expanded,
  clarified and put into a new chapter in drm-uapi.rst (Daniel Stone)

I want to encourage you and share why I believe this verse applies to the Church - it shall soon be better than it was in the book of Acts as it continues from "faith to faith" as God intends! (from Rom. 1:17)  This world is now entering into far more profound change as God's kingdom culture comes than has ever happened since the Flood, in the same class of profound as when satan was cast from heaven, and in the same class of profound as when Christ spoiled satan's minions in hell before His blood under the Cross dried.  Yet for all its long-prophesied newness, redemptive culture transformations, eternally pivotal prominence, and worthiness of royal celebration and welcome, the coming new age still can't ever be called a new "dispensation"!  Likewise, the term "dispensation" is misused of any previous time period, and I'll explain why it is now, more than ever before, important to stop misusing that term.  I trust it will be your faith, more than your knowledge, more than your principles of doctrine (Heb. 6:1), that will grow in the few minutes of reading this.  One way that faith would manifest itself is as a more instant, thorough, and strong believing of scripture as you read it, and realize that God credits to you righteousness for that level of belief! (Rom. 4)  One thing that has severely limited widespread knowledge of the times is the misunderstanding of the word "dispensation".

Like other Christians are, you were taught the Bible is true.  Certainly it is true, and true on innumerable levels, and true on every level.  It is supernaturally true, and I encourage you to have it handy for searching as you read this.  Yet curiously enough, you were also taught that several verses sealed therein (by their transformation from verbal or thoughts to written) are NOT true today based on something about "dispensation".  Sure, the verses were true when written, but supposedly many aren't any more because "we're no longer in that dispensation" rather than for one of the legitimate reasons a later chapter and verse might explicitely declare.  So the Bible is true, but just not all of it.  And with each passing "dispensation", the Bible becomes less true and less relevant to those of us upon whom the ends of the world are come  (1 Cor. 10:11)...even to the extent that a God-given practice or teaching can become so anathema to God that it later supposedly becomes a satanic teaching.  We're all comfortable with this, right?

I am an uncommon believer - a new wineskin.  As such, I am decidedly NOT comfortable that the most truthful and most sure Book to ever exist in ANY dimension - physical or otherwise - would only be partially and not fully true, and which verses are obsolete are the ones chosen at our whims without a scripture basis.  I am not comfortable with the notion that this Book having been settled in a dimension without time and where nothing EVER becomes obsolete (Ps. 119:89), sealed by writing in this dimension, could EVER contain prankster GOTCHAs of obsolete teachings (Matt. 24:35, Mk. 13:31, Lk. 21:33) that it doesn't identify anywhere within itself as obsolete.  I am VERY comfortable being UNashamed of any of Jesus' words (Mk. 8:38)...at least one of Jesus' commandments that is commonly categorized as obsolete based on a misunderstanding of "dispensation" is emphasized to be one of "...the commandments of the Lord" (1 Cor. 14:37, just after a "dispensation"-discarded commandment in v. 34).  Emphasized as very few other commandments are!  And what do we do with it if we misunderstand "dispensation" as is being done rampantly in the Church?  We say no to it: we are ashamed of it, and we refuse to be washed by it! (In case you haven't realized yet, 1 Cor. 14:34-35 relates to the ministry roles being different between genders.  Maybe God emphasized it as a least commandment to see which of us would show the full extent of our worthiness to "...be called great in the kingdom of heaven". [Matt. 5:19])

How do we treat fellow Christians like me who refuse to mix belief with unbelief and so hold that  "...those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever..."?  Consider that God receives these types of believers and tells the rest to receive them, too. (Rom. 14-15:7)  Would you show me in the original Bible languages how/where I'm not allowed to believe because of your misunderstanding of dispensation with what God wrote?  But I've found that ALL of Scripture can be believed, and that fact allows me more freedom to believe the Scriptures as I am reading.  I don't have to be careful and selective to believe as I read my Bible.  When a later verse says an earlier teaching is obsolete, that's fine.  I have no problem with additional WRITTEN revelation like that to override WRITTEN truth.  I have no problem with a scripture becoming obsolete due to its being completely fulfilled.  But anyone who subscribes to something called "dispensation" causing words, verses, and entire teachings to be now obsolete is restricted from wholeheartedly believing scriptures they read, just in case the end of some "dispensation" somehow claimed the teaching as a kill.  Let me state that another way: misunderstanding "dispensation" by necessity weakens our faith in Bible teachings.  Some even think that the ENTIRE Old Testament is obsolete unless re-confirmed in the New Testament.  That is most certainly NOT how Apostle Paul reasoned as he gratuitously used the Old Testament as basis for his teachings.

"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment" (1 Cor 1:10).  This will be impossible if we continue misusing and misunderstanding dispensation, unless the Church has a worldwide council culminating in a unanimous decision of which scripture teachings we'll stand united against [our being washed by].  But then what will you do with believers like me who, for our very lives sake, refuse to be against ANY word that proceeds from the mouth of God?  Invoking "dispensation" to justify the elimination of any sealed word, verse, or teaching is admittedly commonplace, but it is also whimsical - no scriptural guidance can be found anywhere that helps us bless one denomination's targets over the other's or to bless both equally.  The teachings that each faction of Christianity chooses to target are based on cultural and peer pressures, walking by sight, and/or taking offense, not based on scriptural guidance.  Thus, divisions in the Bride are as certain to continue to exist as long as our misunderstanding the term "dispensation" does because our cultures differ, our experiences in or reception of the miraculous differ, and our resistance level to being offended by God's words differs.  Can church leaders DEMAND their congregations to believe differently from what their Bibles tell them?  Of course not, so to have no divisions in the Bride there is only one option how to believe the Bible - believe it can ONLY be obsoleted or superceded by itself.

The word "dispensation" is really used in the Bible, but NEVER as a synonym for time or age.  More on that later...

Many of us were also taught that some Bible verses, though perhaps true when written, became NOT true even by so soon as 397 AD when the New Testament was canonized.  I was actually taught that the Bible was canonized while it contained verses that had already become false by the time because of some dispensation change when the twelfth original apostle died.  That rationale is called "hyper-dispensationalism" by many.  I trusted the teachers in my life enough not to question them nor be alarmed at how hidden this rationale is (or is not even) in the Bible, though in my own casual reading, I never noticed any guidelines in the Bible itself for "once true" verses becoming not true.  However, the possibility of any specific verse I might read being no longer true certainly made me read my Bible less intently than otherwise - I must only believe the verses that my trusted leaders FIRST taught from their pulpits.  After all, the secret key to knowing which verses are still true today and which verses LURKING THEIR VERY SAME CONTEXT aren't true any more, was never clearly taught for me to use it in my own Bible studying.  Until I could be sure from my teachers any particular verse was still for today, I needed to be suspicious of it.  This is SO not a good way to be reading your Bible, is it?  I learned there exist several variants of dispensation rationale differing from each other in how much of Scripture they believe is no longer true.  Surprisingly, some of these persuasions actually believe that certain Bible teachings which were totally of God at one time (only "in that dispensation" when they were written) are now of satan!!!  So some of God's written Word is now satan's deviant teaching!  Mind blown!  Someone PLEASE explain to me how, in the entire universe, that type of dispensational devilution (exactly what I mean) of the written Scripture is becoming of something that is "more sure" (2 Pe. 1:19)?!

Then, (when I was of age, thankfully, and free to choose for myself) some perplexing assertions from coworkers that, through their mere legitimate extrapolation of the same [mis]understanding of dispensation, even more Bible verses are no longer true than I had ever thought ("hyper-hyper-dispensationalism" is arguably a fair description of their persuasion).  Finally, a little concerned but greatly curious, I started reading the Bible deeper than casually.  I actually read the Bible for all it's worth, over and over again, and found verses like these that have something to say related to the way dispensation is commonly misunderstood:

    Deut. 29:29 - "The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."  "FOR EVER" bears repeating.  Note from this verse an many others that what does exist is before and after, but not time periods where teachings and truths are temporary for such a period of time.   Dispensation misunderstanding disagrees with this, so where in the Bible can we find some verse that overrules this one in support of dispensation time constructs for the temporary existence of truth?  There is none that I've found.

    2 Cor. 1:13 - "For we write none other things unto you, that what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end".  "EVEN TO THE END" bears repeating.  Dispensation misunderstanding disagrees with this, so where can we find the verse that overrules this one in support of dispensation time constructs?  There is none that I've found.

    2 Cor. 11:3,4 - "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.  For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him."  Note that the Jesus Paul preached to them takes ownership in 1 Cor. 14:37 of commands to this same Corinthian church that we 21st century _enlightened_ Christians now discard in the name of "dispensation": the verses IMMEDIATELY preceding "...the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord" are counter to 21st century secular culture and dispensation misunderstanding demands that we (most Christian factions, anyway) discard them.  Read them for yourself.

    2 Pe. 1:19 (in context!) where the written scriptures are declared to be more sure than the audible voice of God.  Dispensation misunderstanding disagrees with the notion that written scriptures are "sure" enough to survive supposed dispensation boundaries.

    Apostle Paul totally missed the memo about supposed dispensation boundaries in ALL of his reasonings where he used scriptures dozens of times to support his teaching points...old "dispensation" teaching points from Jewish scriptures mostly to GENTILES who were entering a supposed new dispensation.

    MANY other places in Scripture, ad infinitim....

Thank you for reading this far.  I promise I'll eventually share the real definition and Biblical use of "dispensation" with you, but first I need to address any reader who has not accepted Jesus as Savior: Godkind loves mankind so much that the Father gave His dearly loved Son for our benefit, knowing we would mistreat, torture and kill Him, He allowed that but so that the wounds He received from us could be lovingly offered right back to us for our healing and as an example of how to love our enemies, including Him.  Don't for one moment think that your sins are bigger than everyone else's so Jesus' blood can't cleanse you from them.  His blood will eventually reconcile EVERYTHING in all of heaven plus earth, so it can certainly handle every last sin of yours, as tiny as you are (see also Heb. 9:13-14).  Jesus is always listening for the heart-felt words from you, telepathically or spoken, that you receive His Life and that you abandon your waywardness so you can be made whole (saved).  Or start by asking Him just "please save me" and "I receive you, Jesus".  He knows well enough that you're not promising to be better, but merely that you surrender and are truthfully sincere.  You are now restored to your place in royalty.  After you've come to the Father by receiving Son Jesus, the Spirit (who is distinct from the Father and from the Son) of Godkind now awaits your [verbal or otherwise] invite for Him to fill you with Himself.

Jesus Christ is Lord of all, and He has come in the flesh, given the blood of His sinless life for the redemption of mankind, for cleansing from all sin, and to reconcile all things unto Himself. (Acts 3:21, 1 Cor 12:3, Col 1:20, 1 Jn 1:7; 2:2; 4:2,3)  He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and no man comes to the Father but by Jesus. (Jn 14:6).  He is one of three members (Eloah or Eloha) of Godkind (Elohim).  He, along with the Spirit of God, advocates for His human fellow heirs, and they offer us guidance how to live an abundant life even while we are yet in this physical dimension.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Thessalonians "...received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God..." (1 Th. 2:13), yet the Bereans "...were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so" (Acts 17:11).  It bears noting the contrast between readily accepting the VERBAL word versus searching the WRITTEN scriptures to validate the verbal.  There is a very good reason God lays this contrast out for us, as I hope you're seeing.

A couple of paragraphs back I used the term "hidden" describing dispensation time constructs.  Synonym to "hidden" is "occult".  The apostle Paul's use of the term "simplicity" I believe is very legitimately contrasted with hidden or occult.  To put it bluntly, a fully engaged Bible reader does not conclude at the end of reading the entire Bible that a hidden complication called "dispensation" exists which negates the afore-mentioned and following "milk" verses I lay out here in simplicity.  I've tried that fully engaged Bible reading, so I speak from experience.  No one ever overtly planted the thought in my mind that dispensation was being mistaught - it simply was conspicuous by its deference to the clearer passages describing how time affects God's truths (it doesn't).  I would be hard pressed to think of a better application for Rom. 3:4 "Let God be true and every man a liar" than the rampant deceptive use of the term "dispensation" we see today.

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We've all heard them - statements from pulpits we trust and from Bible study materials we trust that imply there is some guideline in scripture teaching us which verses become obsolete due to dispensation "advancements".  If you as a 21st century _enlightened_ Christian could and were to time-travel back to the church at Corinth AFTER they might have accepted Paul's admonitions and had started obeying them perfectly, would you think our 21st century Christian enlightenment on, for example, womens' ministry potential in mixed-gender church services could improve their Christian standing?  Without a doubt, they would recognize you as "another spirit" for sure.

Do you see how "Now these things...are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come" (from 1 Cor. 10:11)  teaches that scriptures become _more_and_more_ relevant throughout the ages?  Yet a misunderstanding of dispensation would imply they become _more_and_more_ obsolete as each supposed dispensation ends and a new one begins.  Attached to that paradox, strangely enough, always seems to be the thinking that the Church of today and tomorrow is not destined to be any greater than the Church as found in Acts.  But a proper understanding from God's perspective instead of a dispensational perspective looks for the Church to become GREATER than the Church we read about in Acts.

Do you see the common thought among:

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and _greater_works_than_these_ shall he do; because I go unto my Father" (John 14:12)

    and

"Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof...Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this" (from Ecc. 7:8-10)

   and

"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious" (1 Cor. 3:11) ?

The common thought in those passages is in stark contrast to the the very opposite thought so inexplicably intertwined with the misconception of dispensation, wrongly telling us that the Acts Church achieved the status of "role model for all ages" and owns the greatest stories of miracles the world can ever see.  To say it another way, the Acts Church did not fulfill the full extent of greater works [than His own] that Jesus attributed to the Church that would follow His time or we wouldn't need to still pray for God's Kingdom to come and His will to be done on earth as it is in heaven.  The newly-birthed Acts Church, lacking the fully compiled Bible and the years of growth that we have, is "...the beginning thereof..." while the Church later (and I mean NOW), having a more complete Bible and many more years to mature, will be better and more glorious.  Shouldn't that be obvious?  Notice, too, that Apostle Paul could not yet point to any material example of the ideal for a church that all in it prophesy (1 Cor. 14:24), but he leaves the concept of it for later generations to attain to.  It is not the Acts church, but it is Scriptures like these listed and others that PROPHETICALLY declare the Church role model for all ages.  Even more amazing, many denominations' misconception of "dispensation" leads them to teach that the Acts Church exhibited signs and wonders that would be satanic if manifested in their denomination today!

Come on people, let's be more intelligent than that!  God is expecting humans on earth to prepare the way for Kingdom Culture.  We do that by continuing in His ways as He reveals them to us "... precept upon precept; line upon line...here a little, and there a little..." down through the ages "...until the time appointed of the father".  (See Isa 28:9-11 and Gal. 4:1-2)  Don't be offended that I would combine two contexts there - both of those contexts infer concerning the same concept I'm drawing from: Heaven intends to teach earth (remember the watchers mentioned in Dan. 4:17) so a glorious Romans 8 redemptive manifestation and maturation ensues.  The word "Likewise" in Rom. 8:26 hinges about this concept, if you read Romans 8:14-32 engaged enough.  You'll need to let go of the misunderstanding of "dispensation" to see this, but when you do you'll realize there is a crescendo in earth TOWARD the ultimate rather than the diminuendo AWAY from it.  You'll realize the Bible becomes MORE truthful and relevant, not less.  Psalm 37 is one of many examples of this.  Please take time away from reading this to read Psalm 37 to see what I mean, then ask yourself why you think we have a right enjoy the destiny Ps. 37 declares while canceling scripture teachings at our "dispensation" whims.

We're taught that God gave us a Bible having partially obsolete revelations in it before it was even canonized and has become even more obsolete by dispensation advancements since then
    ...even though the Bible itself says "The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children FOR EVER, that we may do all the words of this law" (Deut. 29:29).

In Christianity we have a bewildering number of denominational divisions and schisms disagreeing with each other over which scriptures are obsolete
    ...even though we are commanded "...that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment" (1 Cor. 1:10), "I hear that there be divisions among you..." so "...there must be also heresies among you..." (1 Cor 11:18), and "....there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another" (1 Cor. 12:25).

We're taught that Jesus is coming imminently for His bride while we're still in this condition
    ...even though the Bible says Jesus will "...sanctify and cleanse it [us] with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it [us] to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it [we] should be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:26-27).  Riddle me this: how will the Bride be cleansed by the Scriptures when they are falling into obsolesence  by passings of "dispensations"?  ...when their meaning can be so varied depending on which version of unscriptural interpretation dispensation key you prefer to be washed by?  ...when they contain satanic verses?  How can He present His Bride to Himself without blemish when we are all inconsistent about which scriptures we allow to wash us?

In what we've been mistaught by misunderstanding dispensation, where is the hope of us ever seeing the abundant life that Jesus wanted for us and so wanted with abandon that He CAME, LIVED and DIED for us to experience? (Jn. 10:10)  Is there no more abundant life possible on this planet than what we read about in the book of Acts?  We all KNOW there is, counter to the unbelief associated with misunderstanding dipensation, and I haven't the least doubt that God is only waiting for us to prepare the way.  See how this whole physical dimension knows this: "For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God" (Rom. 8:19, see also Heb. 5:11-14 on how to get from here to there)  God's heart about this is expressed a few verses later (v32) in a verse that really needs to be read with our own emotions disarmingly receptive to God's emotions expressed here: "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"  See also Rom. 11, especially v15 "For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?" and v26: "And so all Israel shall be saved...".  Israel will be saved which ushers in life from the dead (even literally for those who'll receive it) for the rest of the world!  Coming soon to a theater (of operations) near you...    We know there remains a uniqueness of Israel by this.  Notice what draws Israel to Christ: being jealous of what Gentiles have (Rom. 10:19 & 11:11), rather than being drawn by Jesus' Second Coming or the Tribulation or anything like that.  Rather than the Rapture being imminent, the salvation of all Israel is really the next prophetic event that is imminent.  After that is the abundant life (the "life from the dead" of Rom. 11:15) Jesus referred to where the FULL scriptures will be seen to be relevant, true, and observed in light of Acts 15:1-32 and elsewhere.  There is no "dispensation" of Old Testament law that became obsolete by New Testament grace, but there IS simply differentiation between Israel and other nations concerning the Law of Moses which was promised to maintain that uniqueness of Israel (Ex. 19:5-6, Lev 26:12, Deut. 4:6, 7:6, etc.) until at least the saving of all Israel.  Do you see the difference between that and a supposed other means of salvation that produces or results from a misunderstanding of "dispensation"?

The specific verses that we're taught are obsolete are IMMEDIATELY adjacent to other verses we know not to be obsolete and lack ANY scripture guideline ANYWHERE to divide between them - verse x is still relevant but verse y immediately adjacent to it is obsolete.  In several of these very same examples, the rationale for the instruction is clearly given and spans several supposed dispensations going back to creation....  CHURCH LEADERS, DO YOU WANT YOUR CONGREGANTS TO READ THE BIBLE BUT JUST NOT BELIEVE IT?  OR WILL YOU REBUKE THOSE LIKE ME WHO READ WITH A BELIEVING HEART AND SEE THESE THINGS FROM THEIR BIBLES?   Isn't it astonishing that church leaders get so upset at someone who chooses to believe God, who gives them and me righteousness for doing so (Rom. 4:5), above the pulpit's contrary words?  In all seriousness, do they really think the Bride has made herself ready as she brazenly says some of God's words have now become satanic since leaving "that dispensation" rather than cooperate with their Author who says ("threatened", is that what you think?) He would wash us by them?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's not go any farther without a quick specific example we find in 1 Cor 14:33-35, which could be rendered "Keep your women from needing to be responsible in the long term for leading chuch services where there are men in that service who ought to be stepping up to that burdensome responsibility: for the order should reflect the pattern of the Bride's relationship to the Bridegroom.  Consider the contrast naturally and in upbringing between feminity and masculinity.  Consider natural and God-given principles of chivalry.  It is the male who ought to be thought of as more appropriately designed, conditioned, and with more margin of endurance to mature into handling corporate governance of an assortment of people that includes adult males, as the Christ has been placed over His Church. It is the male that is designed to more elegantly and without getting over-worked, use the confrontational and assertion techniques often required of a teacher or leader...."Let all things be done decently and in order" (v.40)  The basis for this teaching is natural ORDER - how a mother (yes, I do know I've jumped a gap from woman to mother) is designed naturally and appropriately to strongly prioritize minding her children above a message she might deliver to the Body while a father will defer (within reason) to those his wife's strong natural inclinations while he might similarly be delivering a message?  It is so common of pople who misunderstand dispensation to miss the significance of the older women being ordained to teach the younger women (Titus 2:4)!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As long as the term "dispensation" is misunderstood and misused, these unbecoming and wrongful contrasts cannot be reconciled.  They are unavoidable consequences of that blemish in the Bride - a blemish that, except it be washed by the water of the word, renders the Bride unpresentable as per Eph. 5:27.  All capital letters would be appropriate for me to say this: I appeal, not to any perceived authority in my words or lack thereof, but to these words' fidelity to God's heart and befitting this season of His calendar - His soon-arriving Kingdom.  There are times for Him to wink at blemishes and when old wineskins can be cavalier to reckon them to low priority, but not right now for new wineskins standing at the threshhold of this next season.  A less cavalier approach should be in the hearts of those of us who want to be most fit to enter this coming Kingdom age.  I'm not suggesting that only those most fit will enter, but I do point out that Jesus made clear there will be greater and lesser among those who do enter based on how we handle His least commandments (Matt. 5:19).

We're taught that while "dispensation" technically means "administration", it is still perfectly fine to use it as a synonym of "age" or "time"
    ...even though none, zero, not a single instance of the nine times dispensation is used by Jesus and the Apostle Paul does it ever remotely refer to a time nor time period.  It bears repeating, not even remotely!  The nine locations of the term are these: (Bible version abbreviations are courtesy http://biblegateway.com/versions/)

1) Luke 16:2,3,4 (Greek texts);
2) 3 times of Paul's COMMISSION to preach the Gospel (i.e., his JOB) 1 Corinthians 9:17
     (Greek texts, BRG, DRA, GNV, KJV, AKJV, WYC), Ephesians 3:2 (Greek texts, KJ21, ASV,
     BRG, DRA, GNV, JUB, KJV, NKJV, WYC), Colossians 1:25  (Greek texts, KJ21, ASV, BRG,
     DARBY, DRA, GNV, JUB, KJV, AKJV, RGT, WYC);
3) 2 times in referring to a WORK of God - Ephesians 3:9 (some but not all Greek texts,
     ASV, DRA, WYC), 1 Timothy 1:4 (some but not all Greek texts, ASV, DARBY);
4) 1 time in Ephesians 1:10 (Greek texts, KJK21, ASV, BRG, DRA, GNV, JUB, KJV, AKJV, NKJV, RGT, WYC) referring to
     "the dispensation of the end of times", a TASK that happens to be stated more clearly in the parallel chapter
     to this, Colossians 1, where verse 20 specifically states that TASK, also found in Acts 3:21 where it also
     is clearly a TASK for a future "time".  These references are consistently "time of a "task", not "time of a
     time" as would be the case in Eph 1:10 if time and dispensation were synonyms.

The summation of all that follows herein is this: Deut 29:29 stands in opposition - and as an alternative - to the current widespread misunderstanding of the term "dispensation":

"The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."

...pointing out that "for ever" means NOT "until the end of this dispensation", like the unbelief accompanying a misunderstanding of "dispensation" demands.

Unless you're all in already, you really should STOP here until you understand those words.  Continuing further without understanding those words is just a waste of your time.  Also STOP anytime throughout this if your Bible knowledge is too weak to be absolutely certain of the Bible context of any of these scriptures I use.  Know your Bible, and have enough confidence your Bible knowledge to base your beliefs in scripture rather than my words. I am not your personal Matthew Henry.

Now you might legitimately ask for specifics; like, a discussion about "dispensation" is boring - is it REALLY worth my time?  And - what things are so important to believe that we don't believe because of this misunderstanding?  And - why will a correct understanding of "dispensation" result in belief where I might now have unbelief?  And - what is the correct definition of "dispensation", anyway?  As I continue, I am keeping all those concerns of yours in mind.  Most of all though, I want your life to be more conformed to Kingdom of Heaven living as a result of simply believing ALL that God tells us.  I want your life, my life, to be FIT to live in the Kingdom about to be manifest on earth, just like we've been praying for for 2 millenia.  There are a few things about our beliefs we need to change to be more FIT to  enter the Kingdom that God is right now in the process of putting on earth.

Now in the next couple paragraphs or so, receive my sincere belaboring on the importance of choosing to hold to God's written word where it needs to displace wayward teachings we all have received from pulpits, commentaries and Bible study aids of man's authorship instead of God's.

Ps. 138:2 teaches us that God has magnified His word above all His Name, meaning that even though He has authority to act and decree contrary to His Word, He has determined not to.  Ps. 138:2 invites us to hold God to His Word being the highest standard, and according to 2 Pe. 1:18-19, the written Word is more sure than hearing God's voice from heaven. It should be abundantly obvious from these two verses, not to mention many others, that we are to let the authority of the written scripture rule in all matters it addresses, including how the term "dispensation" is used.

The prevalent connotation of the term "dispensation" is one of the segments of time as the Bible implicitely segments time into.  The actual denotation of the term is "administration".

I cannot emphasize enough that NEITHER of those definitions is anything even close to the true meaning as used in the Bible!  And this is NOT a harmless misunderstanding!

An argument could be made that "administration" and "dispensation" are synonyms, but  NOT ANY MORE.  Maybe in olde Englishe that argument could be made, but today's  synonyms for dispensation are words like "commission", "job", "assignment", or [a good] "work".  EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE NINE OCCURANCES OF THE GREEK WORD FOR DISPENSATION CONFORMS TO THIS.  NEVER, EVER CAN ANY OF THEM BE STRETCHED INTO BEING A SYNONYM FOR ANYTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TIME.

The proof of that assertion is in the reading and is an easy slam-dunk, but an even more urgent point is this - the end result of this discussion will NOT be to promote worship on Saturday or to observe Judaism's other teachings.  Paul's epistles to the Galatians and Romans, and Acts 15 are among the scriptures against Gentiles doing so in hopes they obey God by observing His commands to Israel.  Nonetheless, you WILL be challenged to receive a few scriptures that you've been taught NOT to believe, but you've never really had a clear reason why we shouldn't believe them.  You've never had a clear reason to not believe because there is no such reason in the Bible nor consistent with the Bible.

If you'd rather maintain the status quo connotation of "dispensation", think about why.  Safe, at least temporally; company to agreement; you're comfortable with that complexity; but most of all, you don't think you capable of comprehending the flawed rationale of scholars.  The scholars, whoever they are, that write the reference book and dictionary entries for the term "dispensation" stand a better chance of being right about it than I do, right?   It's that last point that we'll meet head-on right now.

We start by seeing the indisputable fact (I emphasize this!) that the term "dispensation" as used by Jesus and the Apostle Paul ALWAYS refers to someone's JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION or ENDEAVOR.  Then, EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, we'll show how the prevalent connotation is incompatible with a number of scripture verses besides just Deut 29:29 shown above.  Then we'll examine why historically the current connotation became accepted by scholars.  Without addressing each of these points with unbiased intellectual honesty and with a rationale you can unreservedly hold to, I will expect you to remain steadfast to the status quo.  (As an aside, David Robert Palmer publishes some very good insight as a Bible translator, but none on the term "dispensation".  I'd like his someday...)

The Strong's number for the Greek term of dispensation is 3622, and the transliteration from the Greek is "oikonomia".  It is used 9 times in the entire Bible, two of those occurrences being arguably debateable, but even so, those two questionable ones still conform to the useage and context of the other 7 occurrences.

On the other hand, the transliteration of the Greek term for "age" is "aión", and the Strong's Greek number is 165...totally etymologically unrelated to 3622 "oikonomia".  "Aión" in its various forms is used some 125 times in the New Testament.  ALWAYS clearly referring to a time period or time eternal, never to a JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION or ENDEAVOR.  Some sources will use the term "age" as in "the New Testament age".  The problem with simply switching from saying "dispensation" to saying "age" or "covenant" is _likely_ the Deut 29:29 useage of "for ever" is still again disregarded and still no Scripture context explicitly teaches those unbeliefs.

In case you would lightly forgive wrong useage of "dispensation" and so decide "age" is a better term  with which to carry forward the unbelief, so that you'd think all we have to do is change out "dispensation" for "age" and all is well, STOP!  There has been deceit or incompetence in the manner that "dispensation" has been taught to us...let's take that as serious as it warrants - very, as I've already hinted to!  If the Bible teachers, scholars and preachers have deceitully OR INCOMPETENTLY misappropriated the term "dispensation" like I'm showing you they have, you need to question their standing optherwise to simply rename the corral that contains the same dispensation-connected unbeliefs.  In a large or small way, I and they - yes, my previous self included - have made fools of us with the unbelief they've taught us.  I beg you to think about that sincerely.  The whole point of this presentation is to expose the unbeliefs that insist Bible-day works of God are now obsolete...specifically how those unbeliefs are propagated in the name of name of "dispensation", but if they are propagated in the name of "age", that is just as unbiblical and problematic and incompetence can then be ruled out in favor of intentional deceit!  Receive God's words, not man's, and expect righteousness for doing so. (Rom. 4:3)  Can mere men, authors of Bible dictionaries and commentaries, offer you righteousness for believing them?  Yet God does do that for believing Him.  According to Ps 119:99-100 you can have more understanding than all those teachers when you hold God's Word higher than theirs; you can understand more than the ancients, because you hold to God's precepts when they differ from the commentary and dictionary authors.  Open up your grasp to what you've heretofore been taught from the pulpit of Bible study materials, not so much in entirety, but do so where God's written word clearly disagrees with it.

Remember the contrast between the Thessalonians and the more noble Bereans: the Apostle Paul commended the Thessalonians in 1 Thess. 2:13 "For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe."  Yet even with such high praise, the Bereans are called "more noble" in Acts 17:11 "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."  The difference here between commendable and more noble is the extent to which the written Word is magnified, and my hope right here is to encourage you to aspire to noble.  See in what follows that I am offering you scriptures, not regurgitated sermon talk points.  Know that the scriptures (knowledge of, obedience to, declaring of, application of, etc.) are where great power is, and multi-faceted power, at that (a huge number of of scriptures tell of this).  Judge whether these scriptures are in context and worthy of all acceptance, or out of context and unrightly divided.  I've determined to use them in context and rightly divided.

Here, now, is the evidence...what God says and offers us righteousness to believe.

For the very first 3 Bible occurrences of "dispensation" Jesus uses it in Luke 16:2,3,4.  Jesus tells how the unjust steward was told that he was about to lose his "DISPENSATION"...his JOB, not his TIME SPAN.  His master was telling that unjust steward that he was about to get FIRED, not KILLED.  The other 6 occurrences of the term are used by the Apostle Paul, and they refer to

1) 3 times of Paul's commission to preach the Gospel (i.e., his JOB - 1 Corinthians 9:17, Ephesians 3:2, Colossians 1:25), or
2) 2 times in referring to a WORK of God (Ephesians 3:9, 1 Timothy 1:4 but presumably not included in some manuscripts), or
3) one time in Ephesians 1:10 referring to "the dispensation of the end of times", which happens to be stated more clearly in the parallel chapter to Ephesians 1 - that chapter being Colossians 1, where verse 20 specifically states that TASK.  When you look, you'll see in a couple of these passages that, once he mentions it, he dwells just a little more on the term "dispensation", so great was his passion about his own.  But NEVER is the term "dispensation" used in the Bible to refer to ANY time or period of time.  Never.  It's ALWAYS a JOB...a TASK...a WORK.  After reading the occurrences using the correct synonyms, we'll see if the currently popular connotation makes any sense at all, and if it fits the understanding of simplicity, as in "...the simplicity that is in Christ..." (2 Cor 11:3)

Expansion of #1 above...these are self-evident that they mean JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION:

1 Corinthians 9:16-17 - "For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!  For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation _of_the_gospel_(italicized) is committed unto me." The three italicized words are not in the untranslated epistle so that "necessity is laid upon" = "dispensation is committed".

Ephesians 3:2 - "if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you,"

Colossians 1:25 - "Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;"

Important: Paul never says "...my dispensation...", but rather "...a dispensation...unto me..." or "...the dispensation...to me...".  Yet it is nonetheless self-evidently synonymous with his personal portion of the Great Commission.  Read the verses again if you question that.

Expansion of #2 above:

Ephesians 3:9 (ASV) - "...and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;"  (ASV is one of a minority of translations that remain true from Greek to English to retaining the term dispensation for clarification here)
The required context for v.9 is set in the prior verse "Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;" (KJV)  Bear in mind that Paul's mere mention 7 verses earlier of the term dispensation started him into this prolonged statement of "his" commission, if you will - the dispensation and grace to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles as in v.6.  (Paul uses the word grace in vs.2,7 & 8 to refer to God's provision for Paul to carry out the dispensation to him - his work of preaching the gospel as delineated in v.6.)  Consistent with v.2, 1 Corinthians 9:17, and Colossians 1:25 Paul does not say "...my dispensation...", but rather "...the dispensation...".  So regardless of whether the article is definite or indefinite, the point still stands that the term means JOB or COMMISSION or DUTY, OBLIGATION as it does above.  Try synonym swapping - "...to make all men see [learn] what is [God's new endeavor/work-in-progress] heretofore a mystery..." makes much more sense than "...to make all men see what is [the age] heretofore a mystery...".  Observe also in v.5 the term "ages" is correctly used in the way "dispensation" is often misused: "...Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit...".  IF "AGE" AND "DISPENSATION" WERE SYNONYMS LIKE MOST PEOPLE THINK OF THEM, V.5 WOULD BE THE RIGHT PLACE FOR "DISPENSATION" TO BE USED.  That bears repeating ad infinitum!  If you doubt that whatsoever, read the entire chapter in context until it sinks in!



Expansion of #3 above:


I hope now you're better able to know why you were so uncomfortable explaining away many scripture verses that church life obviously doesn't line up with.

1 Cor 1:10
"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."  This will be impossible if we continue misusing dispensation, unless the Church has a worldwide council culminating in a unanimous decision of which scripture teachings we'll stand united against [our being washed by].  Then what will you do with believers like me?  Because you're certainly not able to offer me more righteousness for believing you than God offers me for believing Him.

I'll admit, God has verbally told at least one person I know of that there is a different reason for His commands in 1 Cor. 14:33-35 than the reason He has written there.  Nonetheless, I will stand alone on the Word of God, the B I B L E, to challenge God herewith: "If Your reason found in v. 34 and 35, and Your reason found in 1 Tim. 2:13,14 have become WRONG because of the passing of time or new revelation, then You need to change Your more sure written Word so those of us who live by EVERY word You speak know so!  And You should call me 'more noble' for insisting to You on this!  You know that when I pray, I declare back to You what You have SPOKEN by WRITING and promised in Your Word, and I will continue to do so unashamedly."

Incidentally, the reason God gave to this person I write of is that women [are we to believe all and only?] were located in the rear of the church taking care of their or someone else's children, which made their gender-equal participation disruptive because of mere distal location rather than gender.  Contrast that verbal rationale with the written one, "it is a shame for women to speak in the church".  Did God really have to lie in written and sealed Scripture to give this instruction?  Of course not!  Don't get me wrong - by no means AT ALL do I imply that God didn't tell this to that person.  I fully believe this person recounts truthfully that they heard this from God, but I also fully believe God wants us to quote His written Word right back to Him about it if we [rightly, IMO] struggle with the seeming or actual dissonance there.  Can God speak contradictory statements?  Yes, in which case all those statements must be TRUE (Rom. 4:17 - they become true when He speaks them if they weren't before then) - none can be false! (Titus 1:2)  In all this, I am determined to accept every word that proceeds from His mouth, for my very life's sake, even apparent contradictions to His written word.  I'll take the seaming contradictions along with the rational, but I would just want Him to expound unto me, please, as Apollos was expounded to by Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:26) or add more revelation to be subsequently included, i.e. SEALED, with the written Bible.  Incidentally, it was also a shame that Deborah led men into battle (Judges 4:9) when the man refused, yet God was mighty to use her that way when the man was unwilling to take receive that grace.  I can accept allowing some shame in cases like that of male unwillingness or unfitness, but not so easily when males who are both willing and fit to teach arrive but are judged less desirable in general to teach men than the woman is - special revelation excepted and with men's attendence explicitely optional, obviously. (1 Tim 2:11-14, which contains a "dispensation"-resistant rationale because it goes back to Creation)

From Ecc. 7:8-10 - "Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof...Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this."  If this is said as scriptures become less relevant because of misunderstanding dispensation, it would be the same level of satanic as saying "The less that Scripture is relevant, the better".

Now faith is the product of your envisioned desires; better yet, of your efforts toward those desires; better yet, of your "failure is not an option" determination and "never give up" persistent effort until their fruition (from Heb. 11:1, understood in context of the remainder of the chapter).  Let's envision the kingdom of heaven and make it happen.  The generation that does so - and there will be one - will doubtless be regarded as members of the Hebrews chapter 11 club.

If you're determined to be an inflexible old wineskin because you're too proud to change your public stance you've preached for so long, I'm sorry for you, but I do wish peace upon you until your replacement.

DISCLAIMER:  A few observations I've stated were first taught by others, including Kat Kerr and Howard Storm that I know of, though I do know these are fallible people like we all are.

##### 2021-06-24 19:09:53 by Kirk McKusick

Fix handling of embedded symbolic links (and history lesson).

The original filesystem release (4.2BSD) had no embedded sysmlinks.
Historically symbolic links were just a different type of file, so
the content of the symbolic link was contained in a single disk block
fragment. We observed that most symbolic links were short enough that
they could fit in the area of the inode that normally holds the block
pointers. So we created embedded symlinks where the content of the
link was held in the inode's pointer area thus avoiding the need to
seek and read a data fragment and reducing the pressure on the block
cache. At the time we had only UFS1 with 32-bit block pointers,
so the test for a fastlink was:

	di_size < (NDADDR + NIADDR) * sizeof(daddr_t)

(where daddr_t would be ufs1_daddr_t today).

When embedded symlinks were added, a spare field in the superblock
with a known zero value became fs_maxsymlinklen. New filesystems
set this field to (NDADDR + NIADDR) * sizeof(daddr_t). Embedded
symlinks were assumed when di_size < fs->fs_maxsymlinklen. Thus
filesystems that preceeded this change always read from blocks
(since fs->fs_maxsymlinklen == 0) and newer ones used embedded
symlinks if they fit. Similarly symlinks created on pre-embedded
symlink filesystems always spill into blocks while newer ones will
embed if they fit.

At the same time that the embedded symbolic links were added, the
on-disk directory structure was changed splitting the former
u_int16_t d_namlen into u_int8_t d_type and u_int8_t d_namlen.
Thus fs_maxsymlinklen <= 0 (as used by the OFSFMT() macro) can
be used to distinguish old directory formats. In retrospect that
should have just been an added flag, but we did not realize we
needed to know about that change until it was already in production.

Code was split into ufs/ffs so that the log structured filesystem could
use ufs functionality while doing its own disk layout. This meant
that no ffs superblock fields could be used in the ufs code. Thus
ffs superblock fields that were needed in ufs code had to be copied
to fields in the mount structure. Since ufs_readlink needed to know
if a link was embedded, fs_maxlinklen gets copied to mnt_maxsymlinklen.

The kernel panic that arose to making this fix was triggered when a
disk error created an inode of type symlink with no allocated data
blocks but a large size. When readlink was called the uiomove was
attempted which segment faulted.

static int
ufs_readlink(ap)
	struct vop_readlink_args /* {
		struct vnode *a_vp;
		struct uio *a_uio;
		struct ucred *a_cred;
	} */ *ap;
{
	struct vnode *vp = ap->a_vp;
	struct inode *ip = VTOI(vp);
	doff_t isize;

	isize = ip->i_size;
	if ((isize < vp->v_mount->mnt_maxsymlinklen) ||
	    DIP(ip, i_blocks) == 0) { /* XXX - for old fastlink support */
		return (uiomove(SHORTLINK(ip), isize, ap->a_uio));
	}
	return (VOP_READ(vp, ap->a_uio, 0, ap->a_cred));
}

The second part of the "if" statement that adds

	DIP(ip, i_blocks) == 0) { /* XXX - for old fastlink support */

is problematic. It never appeared in BSD released by Berkeley because
as noted above mnt_maxsymlinklen is 0 for old format filesystems, so
will always fall through to the VOP_READ as it should. I had to dig
back through `git blame' to find that Rodney Grimes added it as
part of ``The big 4.4BSD Lite to FreeBSD 2.0.0 (Development) patch.''
He must have brought it across from an earlier FreeBSD. Unfortunately
the source-control logs for FreeBSD up to the merger with the
AT&T-blessed 4.4BSD-Lite conversion were destroyed as part of the
agreement to let FreeBSD remain unencumbered, so I cannot pin-point
where that line got added on the FreeBSD side.

The one change needed here is that mnt_maxsymlinklen is declared as
an `int' and should be changed to be `u_int64_t'.

This discovery led us to check out the code that deletes symbolic
links. Specifically

	if (vp->v_type == VLNK &&
	    (ip->i_size < vp->v_mount->mnt_maxsymlinklen ||
	     datablocks == 0)) {
		if (length != 0)
			panic("ffs_truncate: partial truncate of symlink");
		bzero(SHORTLINK(ip), (u_int)ip->i_size);
		ip->i_size = 0;
		DIP_SET(ip, i_size, 0);
		UFS_INODE_SET_FLAG(ip, IN_SIZEMOD | IN_CHANGE | IN_UPDATE);
		if (needextclean)
			goto extclean;
		return (ffs_update(vp, waitforupdate));
	}

Here too our broken symlink inode with no data blocks allocated
and a large size will segment fault as we are incorrectly using the
test that we have no data blocks to decide that it is an embdedded
symbolic link and attempting to bzero past the end of the inode.
The test for datablocks == 0 is unnecessary as the test for
ip->i_size < vp->v_mount->mnt_maxsymlinklen will do the right
thing in all cases.

The test for datablocks == 0 was added by David Greenman in this commit:

Author: David Greenman <dg@FreeBSD.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 2 13:51:05 1994 +0000

    Completed (hopefully) the kernel support for old style "fastlinks".

    Notes:
	svn path=/head/; revision=1821

I am guessing that he likely earlier added the incorrect test in the
ufs_readlink code.

I asked David if he had any recollection of why he made this change.
Amazingly, he still had a recollection of why he had made a one-line
change more than twenty years ago. And unsurpisingly it was because
he had been stuck between a rock and a hard place.

FreeBSD was up to 1.1.5 before the switch to the 4.4BSD-Lite code
base. Prior to that, there were three years of development in all
areas of the kernel, including the filesystem code, from the combined
set of people including Bill Jolitz, Patchkit contributors, and
FreeBSD Project members. The compatibility issue at hand was caused
by the FASTLINKS patches from Curt Mayer. In merging in the 4.4BSD-Lite
changes David had to find a way to provide compatibility with both
the changes that had been made in FreeBSD 1.1.5 and with 4.4BSD-Lite.
He felt that these changes would provide compatibility with both systems.

In his words:
``My recollection is that the 'FASTLINKS' symlinks support in
FreeBSD-1.x, as implemented by Curt Mayer, worked differently than
4.4BSD. He used a spare field in the inode to duplicately store the
length. When the 4.4BSD-Lite merge was done, the optimized symlinks
support for existing filesystems (those that were initialized in
FreeBSD-1.x) were broken due to the FFS on-disk structure of
4.4BSD-Lite differing from FreeBSD-1.x. My commit was needed to
restore the backward compatibility with FreeBSD-1.x filesystems.
I think it was the best that could be done in the somewhat urgent
circumstances of the post Berkeley-USL settlement. Also, regarding
Rod's massive commit with little explanation, some context: John
Dyson and I did the initial re-port of the 4.4BSD-Lite kernel to
the 386 platform in just 10 days. It was by far the most intense
hacking effort of my life. In addition to the porting of tons of
FreeBSD-1 code, I think we wrote more than 30,000 lines of new code
in that time to deal with the missing pieces and architectural
changes of 4.4BSD-Lite. We didn't make many notes along the way.
There was a lot of pressure to get something out to the rest of the
developer community as fast as possible, so detailed discrete commits
didn't happen - it all came as a giant wad, which is why Rod's
commit message was worded the way it was.''
