Update README.md

“BLOOM” is to help people to relieve their mental stress in a much congenial manner by making them engaged in several mind relaxing activities. Mental stress is a social phenomenon which all social groups and all age categories may experience. Hence the beneficiaries and the intended audience of this system will be people of any age category.
BLOOM is developed as a web application and it is supported in mobile platforms as well. This is for the use of the general public and 100% free for anyone to use. Also the users are privileged with sharing their own intentions about the application as feedbacks. All these information is maintained in a database which is located on a web server. Administration is granted permission to access this information for further analysis purposes.
The process is based upon the techniques of machine learning, deep learning and CNN. Initially the user’s emotions will be detected and the system offers the three main features listed below for the user to engage with.
 A virtual text based chat-bot to communicate with
 An emotion based music player which consists of calming music tracks
 Mind relaxing games
System initially recommends a feature for the user depending on the mood and user is free either to continue on the path initiated by the system or choose any feature of preference.

Virtual Chatbot
The chatbot will guide the user suggesting methods to relieve his/her stress by making them engage in several leisure activities. So, the user won’t have to spend time deciding what activity he/she should do.
The friendly text-based conversations with the chatbot can also help to relieve the stress of the user to a great extent.
This can be also seen as a virtual therapy session which will help the user to improve his/her interpersonal skills and eventually learn to open up more about the struggles he/she facing to his/her family members or to closest friends.

Emotion-Based Music Player
The music player will mainly contain of soothing music and ASMR tracks. Following benefits can be gained from listening to relaxing music:
 Stress and Anxiety Relief
 Reduces a person’s perception of pain
 Improves brain functioning
 Helps to sleep better at night
 Lower blood pressure
 Replenish body muscles and limbs
 
System will also assist the user to select a suitable game according to the preference.
The following benefits can be gained from playing anti-stress games:
 Reduce cognitive fatigue
 Reduce stress and anxiety
 Reduce frustration
 Release dopamine, the “happiness hormone”

WIP: Completely re-imagine the project

Okay, this is a doozie.

I kept thinking about the DEFINE-TREE macro and how much I hated it.
Its MASSIVE, the code is ugly, and its awkward to use.  I kept
thinking about how I wanted generic functions with static dispatch.
It would make DEFINE-TREE so much nicer!

Yeah, there are inline generic functions, but they suck.  They're
skin-deep!  Its so easy to find yourself in a situation where the
compiler doesn't have enough information to eliminate the type
dispatch.  E.g. introducing a helper function can easily break the
type information unless you're very careful.  Also, it inverts the
compile order.  The functions provided by DEFINE-TREE would need to be
compiled AFTER all tree types were defined.  Gross.

I really wished I had C++ templates, honestly.  That's not a thought I
ever thought I'd have!  I went down a rabbit hole of learning about
how exactly they work so I could model them in this project, but
ultimately I decided it was WAY overkill for my needs.

At the same time, I was thinking about how annoyed I was that uses of
generic functions were slipping in here and there just because it was
so awkward to do anything else.  For example, the ITERATOR-TOOLS
module had several calls to generic functions.  I wanted my
implementations of the data structures to be GF-free, but keeping it
that way was proving difficult.

I saw a way for these two problems to be solved at the same time.  If
DEFINE-TREE's functions took in something akin to a C++ vtable, then
they wouldn't need to call any GFs but would still be able to find the
right functions for traversing and manipulating the tree.  Neat!

Ah shoot, but that would lose the neat property of DEFINE-TREE where
all the function calls are completely static.  Vtable dispatch is
probably faster than a GF, but its not as nice as the static dispatch.

Okay, but that's where the idea of C++ templates come in.  What if I
could, on demand, create a "specialized" version of the DEFINE-TREE
functions that consulted a *specific* vtable instead of an arbitrary
one.  Then, a little compiler macro magic would be all it takes to
make the calls to vtable functions into static calls.  Neato!

At that point, why would I use GFs anywhere?  I could just pass
interface objects around and specialize the functions consuming them
as I see fit.

So that's what I did.

Expose kotlinc's -Xfriend-paths to all jvm/android kt rules under the attribute 'assocates=' (#465)

Associates lets a library associate it self to other libraries, making them part of the same module. This is constrained such that while multiple libraries may be associated, they must all shard the same module, and so cannot associate to anything that is part of a different module. These module relationships are in the bazel build graph, not the contents of the jars as such.

This module membership is transitive (within the above-mentioned constraint), though strict-deps would stop that. Also, only kotlin targets can be associated.

Per discussions across several media, the name "associates" was chosen over "friends" (despite the kotlinc flag being -Xfriend-paths) as that is the terminology used in the gradle kotlin plugin, which is kotlin's primary delivery vehicle, and to avoid confusion with the C++ friends concepts. The pre-existing "friends" attribute is preserved for backward compatibility with a warning. Future PR will add a flag to turn off that support, and then we'll delete it.

kt_jvm_import does not include this facility, but these can just set their module_name in common to participate.

Android should work, but because kt_android_* is a macro not a rule, the implicit target //my/android/library:mytarget_kt should be friended, since it has a KtJvmInfo. The //my/android/library will macro-resolve into an android_library. Until the android rules get the right kind of love, such that we can make a rule that has KtJvmInfo AND android-whatever providers, this simply is a known limitation we'll have to live with.

Also, the prior implementation shoved the full transitive closure (all jars, kotlin or no) of the friend= into the -Xfriends-paths flag, which is awful. This PR does break that, in case people were relying on that by some oddity. The fix is to just add the targets directly.

Fixes #211

Reference implementation of Soter container (#35)

* Reference implementation of Soter container

Okay, here's my stupid idea. In addition to specs with prose, provide
users with a reference implementation of whatever is described. Some
people are better at understanding concepts through code. Plus, this
provides an "executable specification" and tests. I have found this
invaluable when writing Secure Cell spec: that caught quite a few
mistakes and misconceptions that I had about its implementation.

(History-savvy people here could have found parallels between this and
the concept of "literate programming". Indeed, if only Knuth's ideas
caught up, this would have been a perfect opportunity for that approach.
Unfortunately, it's not really popular to have good tooling.)

The reference implementation is written in Go. Aside from an obvious
reasons having to do with Cossack Labs being a Go shop, this choice has
a number of other benefits:

  - very good standard library, with a lot of cryptographic primitives
    available which will come very handy later

  - readable to most programmers who are familiar with C syntax

  - almost immediately executable if you copy-paste the sample code,
    thanks to "push to GitHub to publish a package" approach

  - reference implementation can actually reuse its own code for
    different cryptosystems

Unfortunately, you can't run this on Go Playground without much hassle,
but that would have been amazing.

Now, note that "reference implementation" is different from the
"official GoThemis source code". The overriding objective here is to
illustrate key points in Themis algorithms. Readability and correctness
are the main focus of the reference implementation. Performance,
usability, good error reporting, feature completeness -- all of this can
be sacrificed for the sake of brevity and clarity of the code.

Themis Core's C code is anything but easy to understand cryptography.
Since even its maintainers make mistakes when deciphering code paths
leading to arcane OpenSSL invocations, any cryptography audit would be
pretty expensive for it. Hopefully, this reference implementation can
serve as a better way to understand the cryptography behind Themis.

Now... Here's an implementation of Soter container for starters.

* Use reference implementation instead of example

Now that we have a reference implementation in our repository, let's
link to it for the implementation details and replace the snippet with
something shorter (which still invokes the same code). The reader should
be able to copy the snippet, run it with "go run", and see the output
which corresponds to whatever is there in the spec prose.

Pipeguns: Elitism Edition (#56322)

About The Pull Request

The core of the PR:

The improvised shotgun that was is dead and removed.

Now we have Pipeguns. Pipeguns are bolt action rifles that have a damage multiplier that reduces their damage to 75%, and can be modified to fit the rare 7.62mm bullets. If you want to that is.

The pipegun also slowly increases in misfire probability for every shot at a rate of 5% per shot.

Pipeguns can also be upgraded to Regal Pipeguns. These contain more bullets, don't misfire and don't have a damage multiplier. To acquire one is a maint secret, only available to lucky assistants who come across the diary of a dead assistant. The probability of finding the book is quite, quite low.

Bandoliers now fit individual 7.62mm. Because why not. Currently they're available in stripper clips that fit into most combat belts so this is mostly a style preference at the moment

Other shit

Ammo modification and misfire behaviour is now generalized to all ballistics. You can now make any gun misfire and any internal magazine gun swap ammunition.

Misfires are not a flat chance. Instead, they increment as the gun fires over time.

Ports over this PR Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13#12274 which I felt was pretty neat conceptually for making some weapons weaker.

Makes the icemoon hermit's mosin into a regal pipegun, just to get mosins out of easy access.
Why It's Good For The Game

Improvised shotguns were one of my favourite weapons to horribly abuse while they were utterly broken a nice alternative, but I fully support moving towards curbing gun power curve. Part of that should include looking at improvised weapons like this which are seeing considerable usage with the removal of buckshot and slugs.

Initially I wanted to pair this with a PR of my own to bop Mosins on the skull along with it, but #56319 is already doing that, and while it's a very lenient approach to my own (I was going to remove them entirely from cargo), I respect it.

Changelog

cl
add: Replaces improvised shotguns with Pipeguns (with a special variant for those willing to go through arbitrary bullshit to acquire it and sheer good luck).
add: Now all guns can be set to misfire and swap ammunition.
add: Misfire chance is incremental as you fire the weapon, and not a flat static chance. This can be reset by using a piece of cloth on the gun and 10 seconds of cleaning.
balance: This has been applied to the detective revolver, but it only increments while using .357 bullets.
add: Guns can have damage multipliers attached for the bullets they fire. The pipegun (but not the regal version) is the first example with a 75% damage output.
balance: The Ice Hermit now has a regal pipegun instead of a Mosin Nagant.
balance: The bandolier fits 7.62mm.
balance: You can construct receivers and rifle stocks in the crafting menu.
balance: Detaches the magical rifles from the boltaction subtype, since they are just basically not using any variables attached to that subtype and made from a series of early returns.
