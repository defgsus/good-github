This Repo is so :joy:

My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your code gave me cancer anyway.

Add multiple types of poison from SpliceHack.

This feature is almost exactly as silly and insane as it was before, and I still love it.

Update the history section of the manual

I've rewritten the history section to hopefully better capture the
origins of Linley's Dungeon Crawl and its progression to DCSS. Mention
Moria instead of Angband, as the former is what Linley actually gave as
his inspiration:

"Crawl started out in about 1995 when, having played PCHack and Moria, I
managed to get hold of NetHack 3.1.3. Although I liked the randomness
and the humour of it, there were some things I really wanted to fix -
the targetting system, for example - and I thought parts of it, like
spellcasting, could be made much more interesting (NetHack still has
very few spells which weren't wand/potion/scroll effects in Rogue). So I
dusted off my old Turbo C++ box and set about teaching myself C, with
only a rudimentary knowledge of Commodore 64 BASIC to get me started (I
wasn't connected to the internet in those days)."

(From https://web.archive.org/web/20060424060820/http://tvilsom.org/roguelike/50.html)

Mention Hack instead of PCHack as the latter is a direct port of Hack,
and curious readers will have an easier time finding info on the
original game; I certainly did!

The mention of traditional RPGs, specifically Ultima IV, is hopefully
interesting to people who didn't realize that PC RPGs were also an
direct inspiration, particularly the limited LOS/play area of a large
map seen in games like Ultima IV. Moria does already have a similar
play area compared to Crawl, but Linley highlighted the influence of PC
RPGs aesthetics like of Ultima in a couple of interviews. Sadly I'm only
able to find one online reference where he directly mentions them:

httpe://quote-un-quote.tumblr.com/post/2178789666/interview-with-shmup-legend-linley-henzell

Hopefully this addition to the narrative won't be seen as unreliable
original research! Internet archaeologists reading this who find
additional sources, please send them my way. I've also moved the bit
about Wizard's Castle and the Orb of Zot into this first paragraph.

For describing the transition from Linley as lead developer to Brent
Ross, to the founding of DCSS, I've cleaned up the timeline and
mentioned the two project founders, Darshan Shaligram (aka greensnark)
and Erik Piper, by name. I feel it's important to highlight their very
important efforts in getting DCSS started and include some basic details
about that from greensnark's excellent writeup, which I've also linked.

Hopefully this new history section gives a clearer picture of how the
project progressed. It's possible that we could describe the subsequent
"eras" of DCSS development in this section, but that's arguably even
more difficult to sort out. We could highlight the addition of major
features like Tiles and WebTiles, perhaps some content milestones and
notable fundamental changes. I'll leave that for a future writer, after
further discussion.

Cleanup and fix small immediate handling

I tried to make the small imm handling a bit more transparent and general,
and ran into a major clusterfuck of issues.

Honestly, how could this ever work? The stupid bugs were the worst.

Interim save, NOT COMPILING (sorry). Will need to redact big time.

But chances are that what comes out will be much much better. Here's hoping.

Swift implementation of BezierCurve works now.

We already had an ObjC implementation for an animation curve, that is a cubic BezierCurve (cubic <=> 4 control Points <=> degree 3) with the first and last control points fixed to (0,0) and (1,1) (Find it in AnimationCurve.m). We copied that from some Apple source code. I think WebKit, but I can't find it anymore.

The new Swift implementation features these improvements over the Apple implementation:
- It supports an arbitrary number of control points. Not just 4.
- The position of these control points is arbitrary, as well. The start and endpoints arent fixed.

This should make it a little easier to deal with for creating acceleration curves, which is why we wrote this.

However it was probably not worth the hassle, as it would've been sufficient for our needs and much easier would we have just written a wrapper around the ObjC class which would allow us to easily scale and translate the curve along the x and y axis → That would make it possible to set the start and end control points to arbitrary locations using the ObjcC implementation under the hood.
Having more that 4 control points is probably unnecessary to begin with. All the online editors have cubic beziers with first and last points (0,0) and (1,1). And path tools in graphic design programs usually just stick together lots of cubic bezier curves.
Also my Swift implementation is slower than the AnimationCurve.m implementation, because they somehow solve the Bezier Curve and turn it into a polynomial while I use De Casteljau's algorithm. But it should still be way fast.

So yeah that was a waste of time. But at least it was kinda fun!

man realised that his node package was not working

ok why though? I realised that my constructor is still rejecting a supposed 'promise?' So me in my blindness opened this... I went like: 'yeah promises in a constructor, mate you're brain is broken.' In a jiffy I removed 'new Promise((resolve, reject) => {}) but in my ignorance I literally forgot to delete reject from the face of the Earth.

To whoever it may concern...
I'm sorry. The AMOGUS package wasn't working for a few days. Call me ignorant and useless... throw to the rescue.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk

    #It's annoying you can't change the commit discussion after it's pushed. Tried to replace the apostrophes and spaces in my array via numeous methods.
    #Even when I did turn them into integers, it assumed they were decimal places.
    #The closest I got is commented out above, but that has the unfortunate effect of placing each IP on a new line, they need no spaces, line breaks, or apostrophes.
    #I'm sure there is a way to print continuously on the next line but I was meant to be asleep hours ago. Damn you EMIL! *raises fist*.
    #Word find and replace did the trick with my list :)
