Toggle open our results when search is active

Now that we're overlaying our results on top of the rest of the page,
we'll only want to do so when the end-user is actively searching. We'll
also want to avoid needless requests to the server with empty query
text.

Lucky for us, browsers provide a built-in mechanism to prevent bad
`<form>` submissions and to surface a field's correctness: [Constraint
Validations][]!

In our case, there are two ways that a search can be invalid:

1. The query `<input>` element is completely blank.
2. The query `<input>` element has a value, but that value is comprised
   of entirely empty text characters.

To consider those states invalid, render the `<input>` with [required][]
and [pattern][] attributes:

```diff
--- a/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
           <label for="search_query">Query</label>
-          <input id="search_query" name="query" type="search">
+          <input id="search_query" name="query" type="search" pattern=".*\w+.*" required>
```

By default, browsers will communicating a field's invalidity by
rendering a field-local, end-user facing message. While it's important
to minimize the number of invalid HTTP requests sent to our server, a
type-ahead search box works best when users can incrementally make changes to the query
string. In our case, a validation message could disruptive or
distract a user mid-search.

To have more control over the validation experience, we'll need to write
some JavaScript. Let's create
`app/assets/javascripts/controllers/form_controller.js` to serve as a
[Stimulus Controller][]:

```javascript
import { Controller } from "stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
}
```

Next, we'll need to listen for browsers' built-in [invalid][] events to
fire. When they do, we'll route them to the `form` controller as a
[Stimulus Action][] named `hideValidationMessage`:

```diff
--- a/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
     <header class="relative left-0 right-0 flex justify-center">
       <div class="absolute flex flex-col items-center">
-        <form action="<%= searches_path %>" data-turbo-frame="search_results">
+        <form action="<%= searches_path %>" data-turbo-frame="search_results" data-controller="form" data-action="invalid->form#hideValidationMessage:capture">
           <label for="search_query">Query</label>
```

One quirk of [invalid][] events is that they _do not_ [bubble up][]
through the [DOM][]. To account for that, our `form` controller will
need to act on them during the capture phase. Stimulus support the
[`:capture` suffix][capture] as a directive to hint to the Actions
routing that the controller's action should be invoked during the
capture phase of the corresponding event listener.

Once we're able to act upon the [invalid][] event, we'll want the
`form#hideValidationMessage` action to [prevent the default behavior][]
to stop the browser from rendering the validation message.

```diff
 import { Controller } from "stimulus"

 export default class extends Controller {
+  hideValidationMessage(event) {
+    event.stopPropagation()
+    event.preventDefault()
+  }
 }
```

When the ancestor `<form>` element contains fields that are invalid, it
will match the [:invalid][] pseudo-selector. By rendering the search
results `<turbo-frame>` element as a [direct sibling][] to the `<form>`
element, we can incorporate the `:invalid` state into the sibling
element's style, and hide it.

```diff
--- a/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
+++ b/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
  *= require_tree .
  *= require_self
  */
+
+.empty\:hidden:empty          { display: none; }
+:invalid ~ .\~invalid\:hidden { display: none; }

--- a/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
-        <turbo-frame id="search_results" class="bg-white border border-current px-4 py-2 max-h-96 overflow-y-scroll"></turbo-frame>
+        <turbo-frame id="search_results" class="bg-white border border-current px-4 py-2 max-h-96 overflow-y-scroll empty:hidden ~invalid:hidden"></turbo-frame>
       </div>
     </header>
```

The "syntax" for these two classes draws inspiration from [Tailwind
CSS][], but the classes are not provided by Tailwind. The `empty:hidden`
class strictly adheres to the syntax of a Tailwind [variant][], while
the `~invalid:hidden` class takes some creative liberties to prefix the
class with `~`, the [direct sibling][] selector operator.

Fix issue with webring (details in description)

Since the launch of webrings in JULY 2020, there's been this absolutely awful issue that I couldn't figure out, where sometimes Scrappy would post somebody's post but the message on Slack would get an infinite beachball and scrappy would never reply. I couldn't figure it out because it never happened to me, it only seemed to happen to some people, and it seemed to happen totally randomly to the people it did happen to. The issue ended up being that scrappy doesn't check if a user in someone's webring has any posts, so when it tried to get their latest post, it failed and stopped . such a stupid error caused simply by bad code, i can't believe i couldn't figure out for like 9 months. ridiculous. anyway it's fixed now (hopefully)

revsets: change operators around a bit to prepare for infix DAG range operator

I really liked the idea of having the operators for parents and
ancestors (etc.) look similar, but that turned out to be problematic
when we want to add an infix operator for a DAG range (hg's `::`
revset operator and git's `--ancestry-path` flag). Let's say we chose
`:*:` as the operator. Part of the problem is how to parse `foo:*:bar`
without eagerly parsing the `foo:`. It would also be nicer to use
exactly the same operator as prefix, postfix, and infix. Since the
"parents" operator can be repeated, we can't have it be just `:` and
the "ancestors" operator be `::`. We could make the "ancestors"
operator be something like `*:*` (or anything symmetric with the `:`
symbol on the inside). However, at that point, the operator is getting
ugly and hard to type. Another option would be to use `:` for
ancestors and `::` for parents, but that is counterintuitive and get
annoying if you want to repeat it. So it seems that the best option is
to simply pick different symbols for parents/children and
ancestors/descendants/range.

This patch changes the ancestors/descendants operators to both be
`,,`. I'm not at all attached to that particular symbol. I suspect
we'll change it later.

Added ability to select player's class from the same menu where you
setup map size. Its ugly, but for now it will do.
Also added placeholder for new class'es config, that (for now) is no

"9:15am. What a hard night. I envy my father's ability to sleep soundly. I am still filled with anxiety over my mother's cancer report.

9:20am. At any rate, I did put in a bit extra yesterday and managed to figure out belief propagation. I got is as soon as he mentioned dynamic programming.

But now that I get it, I just feel even more suppressed by backprop. In order to make things efficient, the first thing I would do is make things smooth locally and use heuristics to take advantage of that.

I can't do it after all. I thought I would be able to grasp something with graph reasoning that would allow me to increase my level of understanding, but it is a mirage. I can't go beyond my replay buffer tricks.

Not to mention, using priors on the weights makes no sense. Within the replay buffer, they'll all have the same penalty. To make prior penalties in any way meaningful, I'd have to optimize multiple nets at the same time. And that does not make sense since I do not know how to share gradients between them.

Where The Really Hard Problems Really Are?

Let me watch this for a bit.

https://youtu.be/Xs2QIUAzB4I?t=169

Training a 3 node neural network is actually NP Complete.

9:35am. Ok, forget it. Let me just let off some steam and then I will start programming. I'll shake off my doubts and simply start cultivating. I know that what I have now is not good enough for real AI. But I do not have any better ideas.

I am not sure if it will be even good enough for real poker. But I need to take the risk.

If I run into a roadblock that I cannot overturn, I am going to have to accept my fate. But until then, I should keep fighting with what I have on hand.

Oh, right. I want to watch this a bit as well.

9:50am. Let me watch it for just 10m.

9:55am. No forget the talk. I've only been pussyfotting for the past 2 days. Let me finally resume programming. Copy the project and start hacking on it.

```

Let me start wtih this.

Let me get rid of this.

    draw = choice draw
    sample = choice sample
    }
```

The CPS stuff goes out.

```

        else s *! prob
    loop 0 (r2 0)

inl nodes_2p forall game_state o a. is_choice (player_funs fp1, player_funs fp2)
        : game2p game_state o a (pl2 o a -> r2) = game2p {

        fp1.terminal {chance_prob game_state=s1; id=0; player=p1; reward=r} . fp2.terminal {chance_prob game_state=s2; id=1; player=p2; reward=r}
        r
    action = fun s pid ar f (chance_prob,p1,p2) =>
        let f (a : a) (b : pl2 o a) : r2 = real real_core.unbox a (fun _ => f a b)
        if pid = 0 then fp1.action {chance_prob game_state=s; id=0; player=p1; player'=prob p2; actions=ar; next=fun (_,a as cs) => f a (chance_prob,apply_changes p1 cs,apply_action p2 a)}
        else fp2.action {chance_prob game_state=s; player=p2; id=1; player'=prob p1; actions=ar; next=fun (_,a as cs) => f a (chance_prob,apply_action p1 a,apply_changes p2 cs)}
    draw = (if is_choice then choice else iter) draw
    sample = (if is_choice then choice else iter) sample
    }
```

The same goes for main.

```
// Having finished with the tabular players, here I prepare the game for consumption by NNs.
// In particular, GPUs work much more efficiently when inputs are batched, so I need to be able
// to run multiple games in parallel. The best way to get that is to compile the game to discrete

packages: |core2-
modules:
    utils-
    log_probm-
    sampling
    game-
    wval-
    nodes/
        utils-
        main-
```

Now this is everything that I have in the package file.

```
nominal game2p game_state obs act r = {
    terminal : game_state * game_state -> r2 -> r
    draw : option u8 -> a u64 obs -> (obs * a u64 obs -> r) -> r
    action : game_state -> u8 -> a u64 act -> (act -> r) -> r
    sample : option u8 -> a u64 obs -> (obs -> r) -> r
    }
```

Do I need to change this...yeah, I think I should change this to the relevant union types.

```
union rec game2p game_state obs act =
    | Terminal: game_state * game_state * r2
    | Draw: option u8 * a u64 obs * (obs * a u64 obs -> game2p game_state obs act)
    | Action: game_state * u8 * a u64 act * (act -> game2p game_state obs act)
    | Sample: option u8 * a u64 obs * (obs -> game2p game_state obs act)
```

I really wish I didn't have the game state dumped right there.

```
union rec game2p obs act =
    | Terminal: r2
    | Draw: option u8 * a u64 obs * (obs * a u64 obs -> game2p obs act)
    | Action: u8 * a u64 act * (act -> game2p obs act)
    | Sample: option u8 * a u64 obs * (obs -> game2p obs act)
```

I ma going to have the game state be returned separately from the game nodes. So what I have to modify the game. What I have right now is already a hack...

Ah, no wait. Then this kind of signature will prevent me from doing the right thing.

```
union rec game2p game_state obs act =
    | Terminal: game_state * r2
    | Draw: game_state * option u8 * a u64 obs * (obs * a u64 obs -> game2p game_state obs act)
    | Action: game_state * u8 * a u64 act * (act -> game2p game_state obs act)
    | Sample: game_state * option u8 * a u64 obs * (obs -> game2p game_state obs act)
```

So maybe something like this then?

I can't avoid having a plug after all. I want to play against human players at some point and the overhead from having extra states due to this does not matter. In fact it might be possible to eliminate it entirely in some cases thanks to Spiral's inlining.

10:30am. Damn it, let me just go with this. I have to push through the feeling of tedium.

10:35am. Right now it occurs to me - do I even have to change game2p? I could have the node itself change the compilation scheme...

10:40am. In various senses, all of these are equivalent.

11am. I've started reading the Baki thread. Not only am I anxious, but I also can't program properly. This is the worst. But I am going to focus on the task at hand until I get the spark again.

11:05am. I am lonely. But loneliness is not fundamentally caused by absence of company. Rather it is caused by the suppression of the environment. This suppression can either come from other people or nature itself.

11:10am. I want better ML skills, but I just find it hard to compare myself to the real smart people doing research. I have my niche in the simpler kind of reasoning that programming generally requires, but I can't cross the enormous gulf imposed on me by higher dimensional geometry that ML requires. When floats come in, my ass gets kicked.

So I yearn for others to help me. I feel loneliness.

Loneliness is really helplessness.

The only way to overcome it and build resistance is to win. Victory builds confidence and confidence builds an independent spirit.

11:35am. Had to leave for a bit.

I am thinking and trying to restore my spirit.

When it comes to float using algorithms I am blnd.

There is no way around it. With regular programming I am a genius, I think dozens of steps ahead, I am psychic when it comes to finding bugs.

But put me in a regime where I have to anticipate the effects of simple multiplicative rules and my reasoning completely breaks down and I turn into a drolling retard.

I tackle the wall again and again, and leave blodied and battered every time.

11:40am. What are my actual beliefs. Do I really think that backprop is wrong?

Suppose that CFR is right and actor-critic agents are wrong. Is the difference between AC and CFR that large?

No, not really. Algorithmically they are quite close. If nature was trying to evolve these algorithms, it would have an easy time starting from the regular actor critic.

11:40am. The same goes for backprop. I know that backprop is wrong. I know the ways in which it is wrong.

But is the rift between the simple rules that I have now, and the rules I will need for artificial general intelligence that large?

It probably isn't. The more likely case is that I simply cannot see them. I am absolutely awed and cowed by the profoundity of multiplicative update rules. I cannot see beyond updating a weighted moving average. That is my limit.

11:45am. The reality is that whether it be me or anybody else, we are all blind when it comes to machine learning. Mike Jordan might be a superhuman math machine, but he cannot see what is right either. Otherwise he would propose the right rules and the Singularity would start getting under way.

Multiplicative updates! Backprop is one of them. And whatever AGI will require will be another. It will be something like a leap from AC to CFR. Something that will allow the agents to move from current fake hierarchies to stable composable ones you'd expect to find in the biological brain.

In the past few days I've had this itch that I wanted to scratch by learning more Bayesian stuff. I've missed the essence of Bayesian algorithms last time, so I wanted to review them.

The result - message passing is simple. There is nothing more complex in it than any of the other graph algorithms. While thinking how to deal with nonlinearities which would require too expensive integration, I though of how I could replace the update rules with heuristics, and immediatelly backprop rules sprung to mind. Backprop really is the simplest thing one could do.

11:50am. The full Bayesian thing is to just multiply and sum up the probabilities, it is just another kind of multiplicative update rule. Put heuristics and make things more efficient and you automatically go in the direction where backprop lies. This is the conclussion I've reached from studying belief propagation yesterday and thinking about it during the night.

11:55am. At no other time do I feel like a greater fool when I try to evaluate these multiplicative update rules.

Wanting to cause the Singularity? Wanting to make money from ML? Wanting to save my mother?

I am an idiot. I cannot even see a single step ahead when I challenge myself to explain just what it is that I understand in these rules. I cannot modify them to get the true essence of learning.

12pm. Ultimately, whether my own goals are at all tractable depends on how far we are from the essence.

If from the present level, the update rules will require many steps of modification then I will fail in my quest and not move beyond being a mediocrity for the rest of my life.

But if we are only a few steps away, then I would be a fool not to chase Singularity with all my power.

If we are only a short distance away from the goal, then the current deep learning infrastructure won't require drastic changes. All my programming accumulation will only become more valuable with algorithmic advances.

12:05pm. I lack humbleness and caution which is why I keep trying to break through. Instead I should be like a hunter patiently waiting for the trap to be sprung.

I've completely lost sight of my objectives.

I do actually think that the true rules will be simple. There will be a great insight accompanying them, but the end result will be enough to satisfy anybody.

Complex rules will be necessary for domain specific targets. This is generally how things go, HM for example could be 20 lines of prolog, but in a complex system they blow up to over a 1000 of lines. The same goes in nature. Nature blows up the complexity of the genome. This happens in genetic programming algos as well. This happens in software on which teams work on.

Software benefits from being done all in one mind. What would take me a 1k lines, would take a team 10k and more.

1:30pm. Done with breakfast. I am still dwelling on things.

https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/04/evolving-reinforcement-learning.html

This was interesting.

It just goes to show how little I know. I can't reason out any of the changes. I need a cultivator's mindset. A farmer would not agonize about a potato not being an orange. Neither would he wish the plants were sentient. His job is to maintain the environment and nourish the plans properly.

That is exactly what my job should be with the RL agents. I'll do my own experiments of course, but most of the algorithmic gains should come from the outside.

4:20pm. I've been lying in bed filled with anxiety.

I've been thinking about my reasoning.

5pm. On the surface, the goal might be to train a RL agent, but what I really want deep down is to understand learning algorithms better.

This is purely because of my anxiety. I can do the training pipeline with some effort. But I can't understand learning. Therefore, learning itself is what occupies so much of my thoughts to the point of paralysis. I did no programming at all today again. That is half a week wasted, trying obsessively to push my inspiration to no awail.

I am trying to pivot my goal. Even if I cannot understand learning, I sure can study it. I can pick and choose and test.

Since I can't improve my thinking directly, what I should do is build my neural lab.

Imagine I had a live brain I could study and measure. What I would do is try to code up a neural net and try to make it behave as much as possible as the real thing.

Imagine if I had such circumstances and such a goal. I'd measure all the neurons, their inputs and outputs and start things off by fitting some polinomial to them. Then I'd transfer those activation functions to the artifical one. I'd carefully track the gradient updates in the real brain and study how credit assignment is done there.

This would be real science, and something on par with what I could do.

Instead here I am trying to Imagine, and it is an endless slugfest of claims and counterclaims over what should and should not be. None of that has a real basis in anything. I could do this for 100 years and not make any progress on understanding intelligence.

5:10pm. It is a pity I do not have a live brain I could poke around in, but I can do all the other parts. This is what I should focus on. This is where my hope for improvement should lie in.

I should build my virtual brain lab and study the net as the training progresses. Just like with the replay buffer except moreso.

I should keep track of the weight norms, the inputs and gradient moving averages, everything that could be useful.

For Leduc and Holdem, I should know by heart what the right initializations are for the various layers.

Study, be patient. Don't try to imagine so much. It is too complex for me to anticipate what is right and wrong.

5:15pm. Though, I finished the tabular MC CFR, I can't find even a little bit of interest inside of myself to make the next step.

Honestly, if things are like this and I wanted to make money I'd rather get an actual job. I can't put my faith in something I can't reason or anticipate.

But it is not like I don't believe in making AI.

Therefore, my actual goal needs to be something different. What I should do is study. I'll need the UIs to make things ergonomic because who is going to watch the weights from the command line. I'll take the l1 norm of them and visualize them as black/white boxes.

5:25pm. This is what it comes to ultimately. I spent the last 6 years working on a language and a ML library and who knows what else, but none of that matters. What I know and understand is all insignificant.

What I did by picking a goal and then implement tabular CFR in both forms was right. Now that I am moving to the NN version, the most important thing is to study how the nets behave in practice. And I do not just mean watching the loss function move.

Who cares about the theory. Forget the opinions. I should implement things and then study them.

5:30pm. I can get money through a job. I can implement the player and train them. I can do whatever I set my mind out to do in programming.

But I can't understand these rules. Therefore, most of my effort should go towards studying them. I should study and study and watch their behavior in real life instead of my imagination.

...Enough of this. Let me read that Baki and Yugioh storytime thread. I can't believe Dex is still not up. I think it is time to start looking for replacement. Maybe I should even start on my anime backlog.

5:35pm. As for what I am going to do tomorrow, after I cement my will, I am going to bring back the old project. I won't compile to union types directly, mostly because the two operations are equivalent and I do not want to waste my time rewriting everything.

I only need to compile to actions and rewards for the NN anyway, and I can do that using a special node setup that does that.

I'll do a conservative extension instead of wrecking everything.

It doesn't matter what I do, either approaches are right.

I need to get back on track. AIs is both my biggest hope and my biggest weakness.

In 2018 I botched it. I never bothered looking inside and focused on implementation details only. Right here and right now, I am going to master the proper procedure for studying these algorithms.

Read any paper and they just give you the loss curves. That is not enough. I should know everything."

Nonparametric Bayesian Methods: Models, Algorithms, and Applications III

Let me take a break before I move on to this lecture.

https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/staged/blob/main/types2021/abstract.pdf

This got posted on the PL sub and I am skimming it.

3:20pm. I suppose this is in fact the right direction to develop staging in. Spiral is just a midpoint in the development of partial evaluation and having it top down would make things easier. But nonetheless, it would be too much work for me. I am not a PL researcher.

My attention is split between two fields, and my focus should have been on ML from the start.

...

Also, sigh. My mother got the latest results of analysis and it does not look good. It is some kind of cancer and she will have to go to chemotherapy. She seems fine now, but I can tell the reaper is getting closer. Will I have to experience her funeral a few years from now?

Things like this happen. Whether it is me or anybody else, the lack of control over what goes in the body, and the extreme complexity will kill us all. The results of nature's accumulation and development is what makes us, but it makes for a great hurdle to exceed.

If I had to face death myself, I'll do it, but I do not want it to be for such a stupid reason. Neither do I want this to happen to people I care about.

Nature is something to be exceeded as much as respect. You can respect it, but if it is going to kill you anyway, you might as well oppose it.

3:30pm. If I am being honest, causing the Singularity in the next 3 years, seems wildly unrealistic. At least for me. Maybe there is some genius in the world who could do it. I myself, the best I could do is get enough money to put her into cryosleep instead of a grave during this time.

Will I even be able to do this? It is not like I've been any successful in the past.

Maybe this experience will serve as a reminder not to slack off. I am going to finish these lectures today, and start work on the NN agent the first thing tomorrow. I can't let myself bear the endless wave of failure.

3:55pm. Done with chores. Let me resume.

Really, I haven't accomplished much in the last 6 years. Compared to the guy giving the talk, his insight is on an entirely different level than mine.

4pm. Focus me. Let me go for the second round.

4:20pm. https://youtu.be/2H2n4iUYpZE?t=1295

He mentions Arron Cinlar's book 'Probability and Stochastics' here. He mentions it is focused on Poisson distributions rather than Guassians.

https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387878584

Ah it is Ehran Cinlar. Ok, I'll get the book from Libgen. I am in such a mood.

4:25pm. The math he is showing there, yes, it is beyond me, but it does not seem as far as it would be usually. Usually, I'd be completely flummoxed at what the point is, but I can sort of appreciate it now.

Maybe all my efforts did have some point to them.

4:30pm. Forget the book for now, I'll leave it in the folder. Let me get back to the lecture.

5:05pm. https://youtu.be/2H2n4iUYpZE?t=3095

I am not sure I am paying attention to this anymore, but thankfully the video is almost over. I'll take a look at the next one as well. I also want to watch the belief propagation one. This is what Youtube search got me when I put in Bayesian message passing. This is one the algorithms I implemented in the PGM course, but never quite internalized much like the rest of them. I want to revisit it. I know that PGM book has algorithms in it. I might try skimming it tomorrow.

Damn, are these lectures droning. Some integral here and there as he talks about some abstract thing.

My programming ability while strong in human relative terms is just so insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Without the self improvement loop, I'll attain and hold on to nothing.

I am relying that the community at large comes up with some better algorithms than those that exist now.

https://youtu.be/EUUyQbtUXR0
Nonparametric Bayesian Methods: Models, Algorithms, and Applications IV

I really hope this has some actual algorithmics. So far the title of the series really does not deserve the algorithm part. It barely had anything on them.

Let me continue. I really am sleep right now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2QIUAzB4I
Where The Really Hard Problems Really Are?

The title of this caught my attention. I'll take a look at it later.

5:40pm. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26907176

I am reading the Cerberas thread from yesterday instead of watching the video. Let me go for the video for 5 more minutes. At this point, the lectures have exceeded my boredom threeshold and I am running on fumes.

No forget that video. This is how my math excursion usually go. Instead of math lectures, what I really want is algorithms I can think about and obsess over. Let me take a look at the belief propagation video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meBWAboEWQk
Belief Propagation

6:05pm. https://youtu.be/meBWAboEWQk?t=893

This kind of hierarchy is much more biologically plausible than what backprop does. I do want to study this for a while.

I do want a tour of the algorithms once again. I implemented this during the PGM course, but could not get much out of it due to insufficient understanding at the time. Right now I want to at least get the basics stored in the back of my mind.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE2ITg_hGnI
On Gradient-Based Optimization: Accelerated, Distributed, Asynchronous and Stochastic

This is a talk by Mike Jordan. I wonder what he has to say on the subject. Not expected him to talk about this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJGwqhbwqjA
Elchanan Mossel (MIT): Simplicity and Complexity of Belief Propagation

I'll also leave this talk for tomorrow.

Right now my fatigue is over the limit. I do not have the will for yet another lecture.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2QIUAzB4I
Where The Really Hard Problems Really Are?

Let me also this again so I can take a look at it.

6:20pm.

///

>Time for an AI winter
with AI chips burning 15KW? No chance for the winter in sight. Some chances for AI hell though.

///

Oh lol. From that Cerberas HN thread.

Let me stop here. Maybe I'll watch a bit on the Belief Prop video on the sly if I feel like it. But probably not. Rest is important.

Right now, there is only a week left in a month. I'll spend a few days studying Bayesian algorithms, just enough to satisfy me and then I am going to seriously get on work on finishing that poker player and getting on from that stage of my life. Once the computer is doing most of the work instead of me, I know I will have made it."

sigh.
same shit different day.
would have liked to write this program only once.
maybe i should screw their whores
maybe whoeevr runs this fucking bullshit could spend some time enforcing the actual law and preventing them from molesting children
and trading them among one another
and keep them from deleting my things and i could have been spending time working and retaining better habits i formed in my fucking 30s
before they traumized the shit out of me and replaced my family.
