Preliminary Blood Magic and Occultism Progression

Reworked ID removals to use ID replacements where valid. This requires an update to KubeJS.

Eidolon will open up the Blood Altar, Alchemy Table, and Low Grade rituals in Occultism, opening up some extra crafting mechanics. Blood Altar Tier 2 and up will require parallel progress in Occultism.

Petal Apothecary can make Sprouted Fungus, making a simpler way to create potions. I'm thinking enchanting should be pretty late game, considering the power level. We have a lot of really fancy potions and a cool new system with Ars Nouveau for making some very powerful brews, but enchants almost entirely invalidate potions. By making them easier and enchanting later, I'd hope to get people to use them a bit more.

Alchemy Table recipe for Nocturnal Powder and Illumination powder added. Nice reagents for other crafting, and very handy when searching for mobs early on.

Cutting Fluid made a bit easier, but more varied. Now requires snake rattles (farmable), apatite dust (goes a long way), charcoal dust, and plant oil. This should hopefully give magic players a decently automatable ore doubling system.

Considering boosting output for ores, considering Create's Milling is also fairly early game.

Otherstone now crafted from Arcane Stone

Leather Stripe now a cutting board recipe

Spirit Attuned gem now made from Shadow Gem

New Recipe for Divination Rod

Impure White chalk moved to Alchemy Table

White Chalk moved to Blood Altar

Occultism Bowl recipes moved to Enchanting Apparatus

##### 2021-05-05 10:54:52 by Marko GrdiniÄ‡

"9:10am. I am up. Yesterday I started the interview by Ilya Sutskever, but was too tired to finish it. I'll do that now. I'll also spend some time in the geometric DL paper. After that I think I'll feel like getting some programming done.

I am still thinking what exactly is beyond poker.

Yeah, there are bigger and better games. And short-term trading would have some interesting challenge to it. But the true promise of AI is not training an agent on some game, but giving it the rewards and punishments personally and sculpting it to your liking over time.

Given how sparse the signals would be in that regime, most of the learning would have to be unsupervised.

So to master unsupervised learning I should be cultivating a net that can dream. Images, music and writing. I should integrate the senses into one.

9:20am. This is something that should be my main priority in the medium term. Right now though, it is just too expensive. If the price could come down by 100x, it might be viable.

9:25am. Long term, the ultimate goal is to create an agent that is capable of learning on its own and independent action. If an agent would be capable of that, I could teach it to self improve.

9:30am. Let me chill just a bit and then I will start with the interview. After that the paper. After that I'll see whether I can get some programming done.

It is just so dissapointing, all of this. To put in so much effort and only get this far. But I must keep going. Life is not about leisure, but about imposing your will on nature.

11:05am. I should have just read the paper instead of spending time on the interview. Let me do that then.

I won't watch any more of this stuff. Maybe after a few years, but I can't expect anything from these right now.

11:10am. I feel tired and it is too much. I like it when I can reason things out in regular programming. In ML I seem to constantly be swimming in a sea of ambiguity. It is just too much. Wanting to win in these circumstances is too much.

I need to dream more. I need to aim far beyond poker.

But like with those experiments yesterday, I can't take responsibility for winning or losing.

If I'd made money I'd be happy. If I lost it, I'd be sad. Money is important.

But it is like with stocks, I cannot take responsibility for them going up or down. Whether I make money or not is completely out of my hands.

I depend on the world, but I cannot control what it does.

11:10am. I could make the agent in a month and start making money, but strangely enough I cannot believe in that. The odds of it might be high, but maybe I've learned.

If I got a job, then the goal of making money would be realistic as I have a guarantee that I'd get paid.

But what guarantees do I have here?

Ultimately no matter what I do in ML, I will be gambling.

Isn't this the main factor why I thought it would be okay to make a language and study for a long time before making a move? I feel deeply troubled by the uncertainty and wanted at all costs to lower my risks.

If I wanted to make a game, I could make my plans and implement them in code. And I'd have a game.

But here, I do not have any guarantees whatsoever.

11:25am. The reason why I made Spiral is because deep down I fear ML, so I wanted to control as much as I could before starting the journey. I wanted to conquer challenges that could realistically be conquered.

11:30am. Forget the paper. Let me focus on this rant.

11:35am. I can't control whether other people like me or not. I can't control whether I will make money or not. I can't control too many factors in my life.

So the measure of my satisfaction should never depend on those uncontrolable factors. My happiness should not depend on whims of fate. I should never chase or compare myself to others.

11:35am. Yes, maybe in the future I will get a chance to cause the Singularity. Maybe I will get a chance to teach the agent to self improve. Maybe I will get much better hardware and will be able to cultivate the arts. The chance to lead my agents into battle, whether it be in poker, trading or higher games might come.

At some point I might have the chance to crack biology, cure all disease and resurrect those frozen human self-improver seeds.

I might be somebody great in the future. The god of the Transcendi.

But none of those things matter right now.

11:40am. I need to remember. Whether it be poker in the present, or all the past work that I've done, what really matters is the work. The work that I've put in and that I will put in.

That is the true measure of satisfaction. I cannot do more or less than this. The effort is the ultimate guarantee.

As the one controling my body and steering my mind, the only goal I can pursue is consistency. Who knows what might happen tomorrow? Who knows what kind of inspiration my subconscious will draw out?

Maybe the meticulously crafted scheme for how to optimize the RL agents that I came up with will not pan out. I am very sure that it won't fail, but it is not like my past best efforts have never failed.

11:50am. When it is time to work you work. And when it is time to relax you remind yourself that the work is worth doing.

I've completely lost sight of my goals. I've lost sight that the last six years have always been a struggle. I often seem to forget that.

When I play games, I play them because they are fun. Maybe ultimately the Singularity is just an excuse to push myself into the work worth doing.

12pm. It is pitiful that I do not have the Inspired Desire, otherwise I'd never have trouble being consistent. Right now what I should do is rest and internalize what really matters.

Forget poker. Forget AI. I can't deal with the risks.

What I can do is keep putting in the effort and stacking my advantages.

12:05pm. Just what are my failures and regrets, compared to the work that I've put in? Just what is the point of the ghosts haunting me?

I should believe whatever is necessary to achieve my goals.

How old am I now? I should know well enough, that there is a difference between the worth of a person, and the worth of a person to myself. Kids live in the world of morality. Adults live in the world of later.

The worth of myself to myself should be the cultivation that I am doing. But I should not judge the worth of others to myself based on how much effort they are putting in. If they want to beocme wastrels that is fine. I should not judge based on moral code. The worth of others to myself is how much benefits they bring to my own cultivation.

This is the true measure of value that I should internalize. Bad things happen when I venture away from it and start listening to my emotions.

To begin with, if I listened to my emotions I'd never have begun this journey at all.

12:10pm. This is an ideal spot to restructure my beliefs a bit. Reaffirm them.

I should not treat work as some unpleasant thing before I get to the fun stuff. When I get the Inspired Desire I won't drown myself in trivialities and empty pleasures. Instead it will give me the power to make the unpleasant and necessary into pleasant and necessary.

That what is necessary is unpleasant is just proof of my lack of fitness.

But I can reflect on this and make an effort to exceed my human frailties.

In the future this fatigue and this issue of tedium will stop being an issue.

12:20pm. I need to remind myself. Forget money, and forget power. Commanding powerful agents is not the power I can control. The real power is the effort that I've put in. And that is the truth. That is what really matters.

12:25pm. Is the last six years of programming effort nothing? Is my life nothing but an endless fall downwards? Are the skills I've attained nothing? Is pushing my mind to its limits every day meaningless? Is it all meaningless just because I haven't made a cent? And because I still haven't created that agent? And because I do not understand the secrets of intelligence?

If I suffer, that cannot be because of the world itself. If I suffer, that must surely be because my values are conflicting. I put in the effort, but deep down I believe that effort is the sin and laziness is a virtue. I keep working, but I harbor dreams of being a wastrel.

12:35pm. I should do programming because programming is worth doing. Not because I need to implement the individual pieces to make that agent to make money to make bigger agents etc.

Who knows how long all of that will take. I feel tired just thinking about it already.

So the first goal is to derive satisfaction from what I do day to day. When I get into it, programming is not so bad.

12:50pm. Let me get breakfast. Then I will read 30 chapters of Reverend Insanity. I want to see Fang Yuan become a venerable. Then I will see whether I can convince myself to start. I should not force myself.

I should make it so that I do not want to do anything other in life than program. My desire should come from my belief.

Maybe I should like in the past take a nap during the workday and confine myself away from distractions."

Implemented custom select controls because apple hates web developers

They'd rather keep pushing their 2007 era strange form control styles
even though they're horribly outdated, ugly and hard to style. The
only way to override is a full nuking of the default styles, which means
we have to then implement the frigging arrow icon using hacks which would
then conflict with all other sensible browsers so we have to nuke their
styles aswell to ensure some stupid backgroud hack is used everywhere.

I bet apple don't even use their shite default control styles and nuke
them also, Lets see. Yup, First thing I see on the top of their homepage
is a locale select dropdown custom built from about 10 HTML elements. FML

For #2709

If I don't show up and miss a day, it's likely because there's something so compelling, dire, & proved to be the strategically dominant strategy. Otherwise, I'm trying to be comfortable with how good this can really be b/c I'm also celebrating a 10 year long sprint in this career so you're seeing the fruitition of my hard work, patience, & faith at the same time as I am. Damn, I had no idea things could connect like this and how quickly the problems I thought would still be relevant tomrorow ended up not being so. Anyway, just wanted to explain why it seems like I'm so emotional & sentimental about this. I waited a very long time to see this version of myself that I have always dreamed of being, becoming, and growing into. Now I can enjoy my own solitude b/c I'm an eng right now and it's been a while since I have been able to sit for 12-20 hours a day working away on a keyboard alone. Different roles require diffferent lifestyle, habits, & routines to maximize the yield. Beyond that, not much has changed. Trying to enjoy the last bit of childhood I have left to make-up before I get too old for that. It's okay, you will always have your life together better than I will. Don't be afraid of the mess though. If you thought it would be linear growth, HA! Higher highs and higher lows.

All my functions getting initiated; it's got me scared.

Fixes a fuck ton more harddels (#58779)

Redoes how geese handle eating shit, it was fucking stupid and caused harddels, and while this method is technically slower in the best case, it's a fucking goose
Fixes action related harddels, I hate how they work but at least this way they won't hold refs.
Fixes the hierophont causing its beacon to harddel
Removes the M variable from megafauna actions, it was used like a typed owner and caused harddels, so I burned it
Fixes target and targets_from harddels, replaces all setters of target with LoseTarget and GiveTarget, which should help maintain behavior. I'm not sure if this breaks anything, but if it does we should fix the assumptions that code makes instead of reverting this change
Fixes more area_senstive_contents related harddels, we need to allow the mob to move before clearing out its list.
Fixes marked object harddels (I'm coming for you admin team)
Fixes a language based human harddel
Fixes managed overlay related harddels (This was just emissive blockers, but I think this is a good safety net to have. If we clear the overlay list we should clear this one as well)
Fixes bot core harddels, I hate the fact that this exists but it has no reason to know who its owner is
Adds a walk(src, 0) to simple_animal destroy, it's the best bang for the buck in terms of stopping spurious harddels. Walk related harddels aren't that expensive in the first place, since byond does the same thing I'm doing here, but this makes finding mob harddels easier, so let's go with it
I fixed another source of part harddels, I hate fullupgrade so much
Fixes all the sound loop harddels

feat(Buttons): ColorModes + Props + Refactor + Refs Oh My! [GM-211] [REACH-856] [GM-192]

* Buttons now use `ButtonBase` to match with `Anchor`.
* Removes extra tagged templates to reduce Emotion Label spam and reduces internal style overhead.
* Button Colors are now serialized as variables inside of the base component depending on which mode they are.
* Buttons will now default to the current ColorMode if they have not been passed a prop.
* Also fixes a prop forwarding bug with CTAButton where inner component was not getting props forwarded.
* Adds all button types to the ColorMode example (small and large).
* Buttons now will use the current mode in context unless specified otherwise. Since all dark mode buttons are specifically configured this way there should be no changes to ANY existing button colors.
* Buttons now come with a few system props to make life easier including spacing layout and positioning. See prop reference here https://gamut.codecademy.com/storybook/?path=/docs/foundations-system-props--layout. Please note that these will cause issues with behavior if used incorrectly. Changes to display and padding may break button styles in some cases.
* All Buttons now accept a ref!

Various chem changes

Oxycodone buffed somewhat. On initial injection, restore 20 stamina. Gradual staminaloss removed, replaced with slight toxicity (0.2/tick). When it runs out, add 3 ticks (0.3 seconds) of stun, to mitigate microdose injector memes. Still doable, you just can't stay up with a wielded gun while doing so.

Synaptizine buffed somewhat. On initial injection, restores 30 stamina. Duration of positive effects doubled, toxin damage and metabolism rate halved, for an overall 200% increase in duration of positive effects. When it runs out, add 10 ticks (1 second) of stun, to mitigate microdose injector memes. Also still doable, you just still can't stay up with a wielded gun while doing it.

Russian Red. OH BOY.
Russian Red buffed significantly, to fill the T1 emergency healchem role better, and maybe be actually usable.
Now restores 50 stamina on mob_add. Still heals 50 brute and burn and 25 toxin over 10 ticks. Cloneloss dropped from 20 per 10u to 5 per 10u.
Upon mob delete, warns you, waits 10 seconds, then deals a 100 tick stun (10 seconds). Shaking can get you up normally, and some other anti-stun chems can help.
!!ADD TIMER FOR STUN once you find out how timers work properly instead of shitcoding one!!

Peridaxon plus nerfed slightly. 10 staminaloss/tick added, for a total of 100 stamina gone per injection. It was too good. Still is really good, but not an on-the-go med anymore, gotta slow down for 12-15 seconds.

Regular Quick Clot buffed slightly. 0.2 bloodheal/tick added. Unit for unit, it's as good as iron, but takes 4 times as long. One pill will restore ~20% of your blood, but will take about 7 minutes. But hey, no side effects and a straight buff.

Nanoblood added. 5u dose is standard. One dose will heal 60 bloodloss (~10%) over 25 ticks, but will do 1 toxin and 6 stamina damage/tick (total of 25 toxin and 150 stamina).
This is the T2 blood restoration chem, and should not be used in combat. Overdose and crit OD do increasing amounts of toxin damage.

Update How Shipping Options & Confirmation Types are defined (#113)

* Update How Shipping Options & Confirmation Types are defined

One of the major issues I have seen contractors have is they don't understand that confirmation types doesn't work like a grab bag, it is basically just overwriting a known confirmation type and you can only have 1 to 1. This was also frustrating for the magic strings present in Shipping Options, now there is an enum they can use and it also works like a dictionary on the definition side.

* So Damn Pretty it hurts

I always forget to format it.

* increment major version for carrier-api

* increment major version for shipping-runtime

* increment major version for connect

* ðŸ¤– major release ðŸ“¦(s): carrier-api, shipping-runtime, connect

* Don't bump connect cli or shipping runtime

Neither of these would be effected by these changes, and should continue using the older version since we intend on sun setting them.

* Update yarn lock file

* update yarn

"9:25pm.

///

In my youth I knew the hardships of the world,

Yet I still aspired to soar above the clouds.

A journey of cold winds and uncertainty, A lone traveler experiences a life of ups and downs.

A heart of steel forged from countless setbacks, A lifetime of effort to forge one sword.

Today my sword aims beyond the clouds,

Refine Gu! Refine Human! Refine Heaven!!

///

10:10pm. I'll pause RI here at chapter 2218. Only ~100 chapters are left translated and 200 left to go until I am done. Let me go to bed early for once here. Tomorrow, I will spend the entirety of the bed in bed.

This blockade feels much like the time I did the COOL compiler project in 2015. When it was time to do the codegen phase, I was so surpressed with the complexity of the task that I struggled for a week before starting.

I really do fear deep learning a lot.

The dark thoughts that kept bursting from my subconscous yesterday come from this wound. I am surprised myself at the depth of my trepidation. This puts my desperate behavior to gather inspiration in 2018 in a whole new light.

I don't think I feared it this much in 2018, but my failures during that period only intensified.

I need to overcome this. If I can break through, the wall of terror keeping me at bay right now will turn into fuel that will propel me forward."
