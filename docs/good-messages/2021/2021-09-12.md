finally was able to refactor the stupid fucking storage functions, right
now it is NOT idea, i have two different functions for something that
feels like it should be one thing, but the tests pass so that's nice and
each function is getting smaller. I had some INSANITY around the work in
our reader function, i simply couldn't get it to run because I was
trying to return the result directly rather than unwrapping with within
a var FIRST, and then passing back the result in an OK() once you have
done the operation. One of those small things rust requires

Remove `scmmoveme`

So, I ended up breaking supercrewmate spawning with that roomchange
refactor. However, upon investigating how to fix it, I was running into
a weird interpolation issue due to scmmoveme, as well as the companion
spawning in the ground in "Very Good". And I was wondering why I or no
one else ended up running into them.

Well, as it turns out, scmmoveme ends up doing absolutely nothing. There
are only two instances where scmmoveme is used. The first is if you
respawn in "Very Good", and somehow have your scmprogress set to that
room. But that's impossible, because whenever you respawn, your
scmprogress is always set to the one after the room you respawn in. Even
if you respawned in the room previous to "Very Good" (which is "Don't
Get Ahead of Yourself!"), it still wouldn't work, since the logic always
kicks in when a gotoroom happens, and not only when a supercrewmate is
actually spawned. Since the scmprogress doesn't match, that case never
gets triggered, and we get to the second time scmmoveme is used, which
is in the catch-all case that always executes.

This second instance... also does nothing, because since we just
respawned, and our scmprogress got set to the room ahead of us, there is
no supercrewmate on screen. Then getscm() returns 0, and the player is
always indice 0, so the only thing we end up doing is setting the
player's x-position to their own x-position. Brilliant.

Anyway, this code results in interpolation issues and the supercrewmate
spawning in the ground on "Very Good" if you die, when my fix is
applied, because my fix moves this logic around to a different frame
order, and that actually ends up making scmmoveme no longer dead code.

So to recap: we have dead code, which looks like it does something, but
doesn't. But if you move it around in a certain way, it ends up having
harmful effects. One of the joys of working on this game...

It's also hilarious that it gets saved to the save file. Why? The only
time this variable is true, it is for literally less than a frame,
because it always gets set to false, because you always respawn using a
gotoroom whenever the supercrewmate dies, because you never respawn in
the same room as a supercrewmate, because Intermission 1 was
deliberately designed that way (else you'd keep continually dying since
the supercrewmate wouldn't move out of the way).

Using R Studio create Machine Learning models to predict Employee decisions based on different factors. 

Problem Statement:
A company has been in industry since a long time. Their business had been increasing quite well over past, however in recent years, there has been a slowdown in terms of growth because their best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely. The firm is not very happy with the company’s best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely. The  firm has employed you to find out insights in the company employee data and find out an answer as to know why best and most experienced employees are leaving prematurely.

Solution:
As a first step the VP of the company has planned to know the useful insights out of the employee data available. Using R, he also wanted his team members to give him a forecast model to predict which employees could be leaving the company, as well as answer to why their best and most experienced employees are leaving  prematurely.  This  will  help  him  plan  his  next  steps  to  avoid  the  churn  out.  

Requirements:
•A visualization and distribution (of all the employee relative fields)
•Forecast using different machine learning models•Comparison among different machine learning models and cross validating through them test and train set•Find out why best and most experienced employees are leaving prematurely.•Give a final prediction model to forecast Actions to be Performed
•Set the Directory and load the dataset into R, verify that the data is loaded correctly
•For finding the insights out of our data several techniques can be used. Find the correlating values of the attributes of our data.Visualize the characteristics of the whole data and only the people who left, use plots and histograms. Evaluate the values of each attributes for both left and non-left employees. Analyse  the  department  wise  turnouts  and  find  out  the  percentage  of  employees leaving from each department.
•Build  a  classification  model  to  forecast  what  are  the  attributes  of  people  who  leave  the company.Build  models  using  Decision  Tree,  Random  Forest,  Naïve  Bayes  and  SVM techniques and find out the most accurate one.

Data to be used:
The dataset being used is HR_data. It consists of dimensions like:
•Employee satisfaction level
•Last evaluation
•Number of projects
•Average monthly hours
•Time spent at the company
•Whether they have had a work accident
•Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
•Department
•Salary
•Whether the employee has left.

Tools required: RStudio.

A lot of bugfixes, and changes and minor additions, and readme.md fucking up the commit log.

- Put the standard and stationary turret marines under the default Marines category, any new marines will be added there too most likely.
- Fixed a bug that caused the marine to try and run to a nearby turret by simply having a large enough target.
- Added damage types for each of the marines' attacks, basically for more compatibility and interaction with my other actors. And for other modders to use to say make a custom enemy immune to the marines' rifle fire.
- Made the rifle also give you primary clip ammo, instead of only magazine ammo.
- Increased the turret sighting range of the marine from 512 MU to 768 MU.
- Reduced the kickback of the turret bullets, turns out that property works, but only on pushable actors, who were now flung away from a single hit.
- Fixed a bug that made the stationary turret marine display the messages the standard marines do when you press use while on their Spawn state.
- Fixed the marines to only throw grenades if their target is within 512 MU, instead of trying to throw them at far away targets too.
- Fixed a bug that caused the marine to just wander around and do nothing sometimes.
- Changed the dropped clips the marines leave to not always lean in the same angle when on the floor.
- Fixed some more bugs I forgot to put on this log lol.
- Made the marines take 2x damage from the bullets of the turret emplacement or the APC turret, while the stationary turret marines take only 1.5x damage. Making the standard marines more resilient when on a turret would require me to introduce an inventory token, which would then create 10 bugs that would persist even after reverting the code changes. So I'm not doing that to prevent myself from going insane coding these marines.
- Fixed the obituary that displays when the player is killed by a marines' grenade.
- Removed the Wander state and all references to it and put its' code in the built-in Idle state, this fixed a bug that caused the marine to not react to anything after killing the player, somehow.
- Removed all debug console messages.

shishu: notch-city: Add 3 mode display cutout handler [2/3]

[@AgentFabulous - POSP]
- Introduces the HideCutout and StatusBarStock overlay used in the
  3 mode display cutout handler. The HideCutout overlay is necessary
  since we can't register a content observer in the display manager code.
  We only have access to resources during boot. Thus, leave this as an
  overlay and let the config and overlay change methods handle this.
  Though we can probably do statusbar stock height toggling in the
  SystemUI code without overlays, I kinda got lazy by the end, just
  live with it god damn it xD

Compete in Facebook Hacker Cup '21 Round 1

points: 42/100 pts ^_^
- "To advance to Round 2, you must have scored at least 24 points in this round." ^_^
  -> advancing, thank god last year not repeated!
rank: 1946/9042 (out of ~12692 contestants)
- 5th among the 6 friends
  - Barry had time during the night?
    - but solved A3 as the only among all friends
      - not even fhlasek
  - others have overpassed him
    - figured out that A1, A2 and B are easy and fast
    - perhaps started 1hr ahead
PERCENTILE: >78% (~ >84% overall) :-/ ^_^
- but a 24hr round
  - slept at night :-D

Analysis
--------

- came late by ~1h
  <- late schedule
     - MMM + Headspace
     => DON'T PLAN ANYTHING TOO CLOSE TO THE COMPETITION (EVEN WHEN 24HRS)!!
     => OR SACRIFICE SCHEDULED THINGS BEFORE!
  <- Internet connection issues :-(
     - in the 1st hour :-/
     - in the final hours :-(
     => USE MOBILE DATA + HOTSPOT TO LOAD PROBLEM STATEMENTS!
- tried using brute-force verifyiers
  - see A2/check_with_brute.sh
- last min struggle w/ the A3
  - perhaps spent a bit too much time on implementing 2 brute-force verifyiers

A1: AC
- simple state machine
  - keep track of last non-'F' state
    - initialize to '?'
    - increment when changing from a non-initial (non-'?') state
- could have solved faster
  - took extra care for correctness
  - a bit too tired late in the evening
  => SOLVE EASIEST AS SOON AND AS FRESH AS POSSIBLE!!
     => PERHAPS START SOLVING THE EASIEST PROBLEM 1ST W/O READING OTHER STATEMENTS AHEAD!

A2: AC
- verified via brute-force verifier
  - see A2.bruter.cpp
  - and check_with_brute.sh
- loop over each position
  - keep track of sum of F() values at all suffixes over each position
  - increment to result
  - when different from the last state, then increase by +=prevPos+1;
    - where prevPos is (0-based) index to last position w/ the state

- hesitations/slowdowns:
  - how to store last state and last position?
    - originally idea w/ just prevPos index and storing the whole string W
      - but waste of mem
      - only char of last state needed
    => PLAN MEMORY OPTIMIZATIONS AHEAD OF IMPLEMENTING!

B: AC
- ad-hoc construction
  - fill w/ 1's only
  - except for bot{Right,Left} corner
    - put the remainder need for total sum/shortest distance of {A,B}
- proof:
  - considering only 1's values
    -> can't get shorter path than Manhanttan distance
    + the remainder needed = exactly {A,B}
  - no path can't get shorter than this
    - e.g. hitting the other corner (non-1' value) would only lead to greater or equal distance
- hesitations/slowdowns:
  - originally idea to fill the middle (non-boundary) region w/ 1000
    - to avoid going there
      -> no need, can't use 0 as value!
      - all 1's ok
  => ALWAYS SIMPLIFY AD-HOC CONSTRUCTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!!!
     - FOR THE EASE OF IMPLEMENTATION AND LIKELY DEBUGGING!

A3: unfinished - undebugged :-/
- perhaps spent a bit too much time on implementing 2 brute-force verifyiers :-/
  - A3.brute1.cpp based on A1 solver + brute over all (start,end) pairs
  - A3.brute2.cpp based on A2 solver
- cumbersome/lengthy math formulas
  - inductively calculate for +1 char operation
  - inductively calculate for *2 operation
  - via keeping track of sum{Prefixes,Suffixes}
- hesitations/slowdowns:
  - also broken logic when realizing that W+W might need additional hand switch on the boundary
    -> solvable via extra condition and states:
       - `if (firstState!=lastState) { // extra handswitch in-between the 2 replicates`
- implemented, but WA on samples :-(
  - lengthy :-/
    - ~80 LoCs :-/
  - works correctly w/ cases w/o '.'
  - couldn't figure out until last min
    - wrong formula?
   => ALWAYS START IMPLEMENTING AHEAD TO HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO
   FINISH (EVEN WHEN 24HRS)!!
- not sure yet why it doesn't work
  -> to debug!
- Barry did manage to solve!
  -> to upsolve!!

Final edits on question text

I removed an entire sentence, and struggled with whether or not this was a good idea. My thinking is that the information about the configuration folder was confusing, but not in a way that provided a question distractor. I wanted the question to be clear, and for the learner to have to think about the command or syntax. I also considered how I would read this sentence if English were not my first language and how I would parse this information. In the end, I decided to go with the shortest, clearest question possible. But I definitely concede that my lack of experience with Terraform could mean that I was removing pertinent information. If this were real life, I would ask my SME a few questions:
1. What exactly are we testing with this question? I would want clarity on the knowledge and behavior we are looking to test. My thought was that the question is asking if the learner knows how to access the key, or file, using the correct Terraform syntax. Maybe this is not quite it, though.
2. Does the learner need the additional context in order to make this decision? Perhaps the location of the file is required to choose between these options. I looked at docs, but never found anything to make me feel 100% confident in my decision.

Grief Project

+ Started working on the bargaining game, I feel like everything is getting out of hand a bit. I don't have time to work on this anymore. I feel bad I can't but that's how it is. I'll give myself a couple days to pull everything I have together and have a "playable" build so that I can share it with my colleagues but yeah, that's it for now. Ouff.
+ With the barganing game I wanted to make the user feel like they have power over something but they actually don't. I think I just need to adjust it timewise so that it makes sense and theres not too much time between the realization that nothing you do matters and the end of the game.

feat: remove evoked berserk, increase *Rage berserk chance

Step-by-step we have been cutting back on items that add active
abilities to the 'a' menu: even with the quiver these abilities are
often forgotten by players for ui reasons since they only come from
artefacts (+Inv is the remaing exception) so aren't frequently
encountered. A player can't forget to use a "passive" ego.

*Rage was meant as a bad property. With a 5% chance to berserk it was
small enough that one could take a swing here and there and not expect
to berserk (making it an unreliable source of zerk), but large enough
that a player trying to use it had to approach fights expecting to go
berserk in every fight.

This commit removes +Rage in favor of giving *Rage a greater chance to
trigger berserk, currently 20%. This leans into the "always be ready to
zerk", while being low enough that it's not a guaranteed immediate
berserk in desparate situations. The insrcription is changed simply to
"Rage".

When it comes to changing unrands:
- Leech and Bear Spirit might want lower (or 0) Angry values, but for
  now they both get the standard 20% for clarity;
- the necklace of bloodlust, which has a swap penalty and extra zerk
  powers, gets a 50% zerk chance
- the wrath of Trog, with its swap penalty, keeps its 50% zerk chance
- the Zealot's sword gets the standard 20% chance;

The chance contribution is shown in the item description, and the total
zerk chance is shown in the character overview if nonzero.
