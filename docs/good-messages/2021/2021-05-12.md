Create Fulfill your dream of becoming a doctor by pursuing MBBS abroad 2021-22 Twinkle InstituteAB

There are nearly thousands of Indian Medical students that face the foremost downside of obtaining admission in an exceeding world category medical University for following MBBS. solely a couple of students manage to clear the NEET examination for obtaining a seat in government medical universities whereas the remaining aspirants carry on looking for alternatives privately institutes. Middle- category family cannot afford the high donation of fees privately medical universities in the Asian nations. thus in such a scenario, they are available to hunt for foreign medical universities which give the best answer for Indian medical students. Most of the International medical universities in specific countries square measure providing MBBS courses and different medical courses at a cheap price that is not the case in Indian medical universities.

There square measure several countries like China, Ukraine, Georgia, Bangladesh, Kirghizstan, and Russia today that supply top quality of medical education at a really low price costs. per annum students from completely different countries like Asian nation, Africa, Deutschland, and Asian country, etc square measure ready to review MBBS in Russia all over nations. A number of the highest designated countries by scholars square measure the countries like Russia, Ukraine, Bangladesh, China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Kirghizstan. The medical universities offered by these specific countries square measure all recognized by the foremost organizations like UN agency, United Nations agency and MCI. The pattern of study is followed following International info in most the countries.

The quality of medical education in abroad best medical universities in Russia is sort of higher and satisfactory that is way higher as compared to Indian medical faculties. Students not solely like cheap medical education however additionally the simplest quality of education matters is provided to the scholars within the medical faculties abroad. Admission criteria of MBBS abroad are incredibly straightforward and simple going. one among the foremost blessings of learning in such Universities is that there’s no have to be compelled to seem for any exam or clear any English-speaking check like IELTS and TOEFL.

Most of the schools provide a Medical program of period five to six years, together with one year of place. once the completion of their course of MBBS Abroad, the scholars solely have to be compelled to complete these vital steps like clear the MCI screening test(FMGE) and complete a minimum of one year of observation from the Asian nation.

After all these processes square measure completed, if the scholar is inquisitive about learning for postgraduate then he will apply for USMLE exams from the USA. If he clears the examination conducted then the scholar will study PG in the USA.

Advantages of learning MBBS Abroad in Russia

Students people who have an interest in learning MBBS Abroad aren’t needed to clear any test for obtaining admission for the MBBS course. The admission method is dispensed on the idea of the marks scored on the twelfth board.
because the medical universities an abroad square measure recognized by MCI (Medical Council of India), Asian nation students don’t have to be compelled to worry as once finishing their MBBS education abroad they will simply come back back and observe in India.
several medical Universities abroad offer scholarships additionally for college kids.

"1:45pm. Let me read Freiren.

The paper itself is really making me think about the importance of future information. If the paper is right and it is, then it is no wonder that OpenAI require batches of a million for their bots.

You absolutely need the hindsight information in real world tasks. The current techniques will not cut it. I do not actually need these techniques for poker, I can just hack the simulator to give the net all the info that it needs, but...I should understand this more in depth.

The subject of hindsight credit assignment is worth studying. So I should spend some time on this paper. Let's not hurry to start programming.

1:50pm. I really love this part of Freiren where she is autistically exploring every nook and cranny of a floor before moving on to the next one.

2:10pm. Yesterday it was interesting that both the transformer paper moved LN after the activation just before they got used as inputs. I can't remember what I did in the char RNN, but I think it was relu + LN rather than LN + relu. In the past I did not understand this, but now my knowledge should be enough to correctly interpret why that makes optimization easier.

My optimization scheme might make it unecessary, but it is always better safe than sorry. I'll try it out both ways with and without LN.

2:20pm. 28/32. Just what is this F here? I get the benefit of hindsight information, but how would you learn noise info? Like in that key door example, putting in future information would not have any effect if the number of apples is not given.

3:35pm. I think I get the paper in its entirety. That fi is just the hindsight state. It is nothing big at all.

The complications with the paper are maintaining the independence assumptions. They do a complicated thing which I barely get, but I can think of a better way.

What if instead of learning just `Q(H,A,F)`, the agent also learns `Q(H,A)`, that is without the hindsight information.

Then `W=Q(H,A,F) - Q(H,A)` could be considered the value of the hindsight info for the action taken.

Then the Qs for all the actions could be `Q'(H,A)=Q(H,A) + W`. This I could use for calculating the mean in tabular CFR methods. I am worried about the situations caused by taking actions that result in scenery switching which would cause the hindsight info to be completely irrelevant for those actions.

But the way the algorithm reweights that `P(H,A)` bothers me. They went all out to jack the standard PG training and made it quite complicated.

I wasn't going to, but let me look at the previous HCA paper.

4:15pm. Ok, I think I get a bunch of things now. I do not trust any of these algorithms. Their reweighting schemes are suspicious. As shady as regular PG is, the way it uses baselines is intuitive.

4:20pm. If I had to train an agent on a bigger game than poker, I'd use the variant I proposed above instead of any of the algos in these papers.

4:25pm. Forget hindsight methods. I won't have too much trouble dealing with them when the time comes.

No wait, that assumption I made that `Q'(H,A)=Q(H,A) + W` might not necessarily hold. With a different action, that W might flip signs or be worth something else...

How complicated. I'll throw this in the same pile as long term credit assignment. And speaking of that...

https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06721
Optimizing Agent Behavior over Long Time Scales by Transporting Value

Let me take a break first. I've been focusing on these papers for a while.

4:35pm. I think that the standard way of doing thing would be the best. Forget W, just put the all the data right there even if there is a chance it might not have been trained on.

5:10pm. I am back. Let me read that paper I linked to. Forget about hindsight learning. It is not what I should be focusing on.

> In AI research, the problem of how to learn rational behavior that is temporally far-sighted is known as the credit assignment problem3–5. An AI agent must evaluate the utility of individual actions within a long sequence. To address the credit assignment problem, deep learning has been combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to provide a flexible class of architectures and algorithms that can be used practically to estimate the utility of courses of action for behaving agent models engaged in sensorimotor tasks in complex environments.

> These algorithms have almost exclusively borrowed the assumptions of discounted utility theory2, 6, 7 and achieve credit assignment using value function bootstrapping and backpropagation8 (deep RL). Practical and convergent deep RL algorithms discount the future, reducing their applicability for problems with long delays between decisions and consequences9, 10 .

> Conspicuously, humans and animals evidence behaviors that deep RL cannot yet simulate behaviorally. These come for example under the headings of latent learning11, 12, prospective memory13 , and inter-temporal choice14, and encompass learning and decision-making that occurs either without task reward, or when rewards are recouped at long delay from relevant choice points. It has been argued that hominid cognitive ability became truly modern when new strategies for long-term temporal credit assignment and planning emerged, leading to abrupt cultural shifts and immense changes in social complexity and human achievement15. Algorithmic progress on problems of long-term credit assignment may similarly lead to profound magnification of the range of decisionmaking problems that can be addressed computationally.

This paper was reference to in the HCA paper and it caught my eye. Long term credit assignment is one of my weak points. It is good that other people are working on it. I had no idea about those last few sentences. Without thinking about it, I just assumed that all animals had long term memory.

5:30pm. The paper is not much. It is just a hack test.

There isn't anything elegant on the market that combines hindsight, unsupervised learning and long term credit assignment to train RL agents. In fact, any of these individual 3 is hacky. There will be more on them.

I don't think that `Counterfactual Credit Assignment in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning` will be the last word on hindsight. Adding two extra nets that need optimizing is a huge burden and lacks elegance. Even of them even needs a strange constrained optimization algo.

5:40pm. What do I do here? I am satisfied with my efforts today. I do not feel like starting programming now.

5:45pm. It is difficult to come up with new ideas. Rather than using hindsight, for poker it is much smarter to just include the opponent's card. That is the way to go when doing variance reduction. For large games I'd just pass the inputs, including the future ones into the net as they are. No need for complicated stuff from these papers. Or my bad `W` idea. Whatever bias related degradation this would introduce will more than be made up by not needing to optimize two extra nets.

5:50pm. I'll admit, passing future inputs as they are is pretty nonsensical. What I'd really want is for them to be refined into something that would be useful regardless of the actions taken in the future trajectory. Eventually something more elegant will show up.

5:55pm. Now I am obsessing about that. Forget it. Tomorrow, I will do the uniform player and home in on doing the linear player. Future agents that do learning as well as humans can and have all the learning issues solved is something the future me can deal with.

Right now I a pauper so I should take the pennies tossed my way.

I absolutely need to focus. I need to do the uniform, linear, deep, and then the transformer agent. I need to get my things going. I had my fun with papers in the last two weeks, but now it is time to strike the iron and forge the blade. I'll do it a bit at a time.

6pm. Let me have some fun here. I feel like my mind has been in its normal state for the last few days. I should be able to program like this."

"10:10am. Let me chill a bit and then I will start. I want to study the two credit assignment papers by Dabney.

10:30am. Enough fun. Let me start.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09464
Counterfactual Credit Assignment in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning

> In contrast, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms such as policy gradient methods (Williams, 1992; Sutton et al., 2000) perform simple time-based credit assignment, where events and rewards happening after an action are credited to that action, post hoc ergo propter hoc. While unbiased in expectation, this coarse-grained credit assignment typically has high variance, and the agent will require a large amount of experience to learn the correct relation between actions and rewards. Another issue of model-free methods is that counterfactual reasoning, i.e. reasoning about what would have happened had different actions been taken with everything else remaining the same, is not possible. Given a trajectory, model-free methods can in fact only learn about the actions that were actually taken to produce the data, and this limits the ability of the agent to learn quickly. As environments grow in complexity due to partial observability, scale, long time horizons, and large number of agents, actions taken by the agent will only affect a vanishing part of the outcome, making it increasingly difficult to learn from classical reinforcement learning algorithms. We need better credit assignment techniques

This seems pretty interesting. I wonder if it will turn out to be doing something better than what I had in mind. If that turns out to be the case, I should use it.

> CCA-PG also outperforms State- and ReturnConditional HCA, which do use hindsight information but in a more limited way than CCA-PG.

I guess I do not need that other paper.

10:55am. 4/32. I do not really understand how to calculate that hindsight quantity. Also how does it relate to the self probability?

I can see that it reweights the value estimate so that the current action probability in it is pushed towards something...maybe towards being uniform?

Actually, that does have implications on my own method. In my own method I do in fact reweight the Qs so the self reach probability is ommitted. But...that is a different thing from this.

11:35am. 25/32. I am mostly done with the paper, but this is difficult for me to understand. If I could work out how the update is derived from simpler models on my own, that would particularly help my understanding. It seems that this section is for that.

11:45am. > Interestingly, if we replace ∆i by the argmax of softmax of the ∆, we obtain a gradient estimate similar to that of the cross-entropy method, a classical and very effective planning algorithm (De Boer et al., 2005; Langlois et al., 2019).

I should look into the CEM at some point.

11:50am. I don't get a lot here, but I do get that they are making random numbers explicit in the Q estimate thereby making the entire model deterministic.

12pm. At any rate, now that I see this I can understand that...Ah, wait. There is variance from the the community card reveals. Knowing the opponent card does not give me minimized variance in poker.

True min variance is when everything is known by the Q function.

1:20pm. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/243015/why-do-variance-reduction-methods-work-well-and-are-there-any-backfire-experie

Done with breakfast. I want to study this more. I do not get the paper, but it is really making me think how future information can be used to do variance estimates. I am starting to get what the phi factor is, but in that case, what is the point of the reweighting? The paper is rather compilcated. I am wondering why not just shove all the future data into the Q function and call it a day?"

Fixed the bug for blocks not being deleted. I think.

I spent way too much time on this.

The most interesting thing about King Charles the First,
Is that he was 5'6" at the start of his reign,
But only 4'8" tall at the end of it.

Because of

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England (Puritan)
Born in 1599, died in 1658 (September).
Was at first (only) MP for Huntingdon (but then)
He led the Iron Side Cavalry at Marston Moor in 1644 and won.
Then he founded the New Model Army, and praise be, beat the Cavaliers at Naseby.
And the King fled up North, like an axe, to the Scots.

But under the terms of John Pimms' 'Solomn League and Covenant',
The Scots handed King Charles I over to

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England (and his warts)
Born in 1599, died in 1658 (September)
But, alas (Oi Vay!), disagreement then broke out (between)
The Presbyterian Parliament and the military
Who meant to have an independent bent and so,
The second civil war broke out and the round head ranks
Faced the cavaliers at Preston, Lancs.,
And the King lost again, silly thing (stupid King).

And Cromwell sent Colonel Pride
To purge the House of Commons of the Presbyterian Royalists,
Leaving behind only the Rump Parliament

Which appointed a High Court at Westminster Hall
To indict Charles I for Tyranny (gasp).
Charles was sentenced to death
Even though he refused to accept that the court had
Jurisdiction (say goodbye to his head).
Poor King Charles laid his head on the block (January 1649)
Down came the axe and

In the silence that followed,
The only sound that could be heard was a solitary giggle from.

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England (Ole)
Born in 1599, died in 1658 (September)
Then he smashed (Ireland), set up the Commonwealth (and more!).
He crushed the Scots at Worcester, and beat the Dutch at sea in 1653, and then

He dissolved the Rump Parliament,
And with Lambert's consent wrote the instrument of Government
Under which Oliver was Protector at last, The End!

Preliminary Blood Magic and Occultism Progression

Reworked ID removals to use ID replacements where valid. This requires an update to KubeJS.

Eidolon will open up the Blood Altar, Alchemy Table, and Low Grade rituals in Occultism, opening up some extra crafting mechanics. Blood Altar Tier 2 and up will require parallel progress in Occultism.

Petal Apothecary can make Sprouted Fungus, making a simpler way to create potions. I'm thinking enchanting should be pretty late game, considering the power level. We have a lot of really fancy potions and a cool new system with Ars Nouveau for making some very powerful brews, but enchants almost entirely invalidate potions. By making them easier and enchanting later, I'd hope to get people to use them a bit more.

Alchemy Table recipe for Nocturnal Powder and Illumination powder added. Nice reagents for other crafting, and very handy when searching for mobs early on.

Cutting Fluid made a bit easier, but more varied. Now requires snake rattles (farmable), apatite dust (goes a long way), charcoal dust, and plant oil. This should hopefully give magic players a decently automatable ore doubling system.

Considering boosting output for ores, considering Create's Milling is also fairly early game.

Otherstone now crafted from Arcane Stone

Leather Stripe now a cutting board recipe

Spirit Attuned gem now made from Shadow Gem

New Recipe for Divination Rod

Impure White chalk moved to Alchemy Table

White Chalk moved to Blood Altar

Occultism Bowl recipes moved to Enchanting Apparatus

Wednesday, May 12th, 2021 - the new, new music show! Normally scheduled for a Tuesday, today's new music show is a little different, but mainly behind the scenes in constructing the playlist and promoting it. Instead of playlisting the show immediately after I wake up, I listened a little more casually to music throughout the day and picked out tracks for the first hour that jumped out at me. The second half was put together more traditionally, but none of this matters to you! Most importantly I wanted to go back to a more easier going show, less focused on the promotion and more on the music and the experience. I had a lot of fun and made some new friends too! Hope you enjoy it! Squirrel flower.
