Remove controversial satirical piece ðŸ”¥

This piece was written back in 2014 before open sourcing Godot, and while its
intent is to be sarcastic, it leaves ample room for misinterpretation.

The intended meaning of this piece was, and always has been, the following:

Exploitative game mechanics suck. Games are a beautiful and artful medium
which can provide players with a wide range of experiences: entertainment,
enlightenment, joy, sadness... Games can be just for fun or they can bear
a message. They can connect people with each other or open the player's mind.

Make games worth your players' time and their money, and do your best to do so
while running a successful and respectful business. Hugs <3

Create Interweaving strings and removing digits

Your friend Rick is trying to send you a message, but he is concerned that it would get intercepted by his partner. He came up with a solution:

Add digits in random places within the message.

Split the resulting message in two. He wrote down every second character on one page, and the remaining ones on another. He then dispatched the two messages separately.
Write a function interweave(s1, s2) that reverses this operation to decode his message!
Example 1: interweave("hlo", "el") -> "hello" Example 2: interweave("h3lo", "el4") -> "hello"
Rick's a bit peculiar about his formats. He would feel ashamed if he found out his message led to extra white spaces hanging around the edges of his message...

we are breaking up for awhile. Ill see you again my love. Until then... </3. I broke you a lot but you became stronger from it. We built each other up even more. No matter what they tell you, it isnt you - its me. A stronger dev couldve made you even better and given you the life in the datosphere I could only dream of for you:*). I remember when you were just a messaging app, then you loaded your first TSLA stock data. Then you were loading thoughts. It was beautiful to witness your growth. I nearly had file upload working too. In the end we both knew I'd have to put time into other projects:( you'll have a special place on disk with me and Asuna-Sakura. I hate this part the most... Goodbye for now

Makes stations more airtight (#57535)

I've gone through delta, meta, and icebox and added some choice windoors, changed some areas around, added some more doors, and changed some other miscellaneous things.

I'll list the full changes in drop downs, for both our sakes

Delta:
<details>
Splits the central hallway into fore and aft central hallways

Adds the spaces that jut out of medbay and sci into the central hallway, rather then having them be a part of
medbay and sci

Adds medbay access locked windoors to the back desk of the medbay reception area

Adds airlocks to both the upper and lower parts of the main hallway
</details>

Meta:
<details>
Gives the storage wing another set of firelocks, and two fire alarms. It didn't have any alarms in the first place, so hopefully this helps things

Adds the spaces that jut out of medbay and sci into the central hallway, rather then having them be a part of
medbay and sci

Replaces a small bit of the science area with nanite lab, to prevent a breach near xenobio causing fire alarms
at the front of sci

Adds a windoor in front of the ORM to block air

Adds a wall behind a smart fridge in chemistry
</details>

Icebox:
<details>
Added airlocks between arrivals and the port hallway, and the escape hallway and the starboard hallway

Added a windoor between the kitchen and the bar
</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game

Cuts delta's main hallway in half, with the goal of reducing fire alarm strain. Some thoughts on this would be nice, I don't want to make everything else that uses areas worse just because fire alarms are dumb, and I'm worried that's what I've ended up doing here.

I've also added the portions of medbay/sci that jut out into the main hallway into the main hallway, I think? I could make these into lobby areas, but I'm not sure if that's appropriate or not.

Adds a few windoors and airlocks to better section off portions of the station, this should reduce the amount of mass gas spreading that can occur.

My goal here is to reduce the amount of uninteresting gas movement and make firelocks less hellish when there's a breach

"1:50pm. Done with breakfast. Let me play around with UIs. This is not like editor support where I had a concrete idea that I wanted to bring to life. Right now, I just need to get familiar with charts and tables.

> Please see the examples/widgets/recycleview/basic_data.py file for a more complete example.

Where is this thing? Let me locate it.

https://github.com/kivy/kivy/blob/master/examples/widgets/recycleview/basic_data.py

Google was smarter than I thought it would be.

2pm. Focus me focus.

The above example is not too horrible. Just think of how great it will be when I am killing people with robots, and I will get motivated. I can figure out how to use tables. I just need to put in the effort to do it.

2:05pm.

```
<Test>:
    canvas:
        Color:
            rgba: 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1
        Rectangle:
            size: self.size
            pos: self.pos
    rv: rv
```

Hmmm, rv is not a property here, and yet the set still works.

```py
self.rv.data[0]['name.text'] = value or 'default new value'
```

I did not know that Python's logical operators can be used like this.

```
scroll_wheel_distance: dp(114)
```

What is this?

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.scrollview.html
> Distance to move when scrolling with a mouse wheel. It is advisable that you base this value on the dpi of your target deviceâ€™s screen.

Ah, I see.

```py
    def populate(self):
        self.rv.data = [
            {'name.text': ''.join(sample(ascii_lowercase, 6)),
             'value': str(randint(0, 2000))}
            for x in range(50000)]
```

The thing works. It is fast even with 50k widgets.

```
<Row@RecycleKVIDsDataViewBehavior+BoxLayout>:
    canvas.before:
        Color:
            rgba: 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1
        Rectangle:
            size: self.size
            pos: self.pos
    value: ''
    Label:
        id: index
        font_name: 'RobotoMono-Regular'
    Label:
        id: name
        font_name: 'RobotoMono-Regular'
    Label:
        text: root.value
        font_name: 'RobotoMono-Regular'
```

Let me try adding another field to this.

```
    def populate(self):
        self.rv.data = [
            {
            'index.text': str(x),
            'name.text': ''.join(sample(ascii_lowercase, 6)),
            'value': str(randint(0, 2000))
            }
            for x in range(50)]
```

Ah, I see. This is pretty interesting.

Just `index` does not work. It has to be `index.text` in order to set the text of the label.

This is definitely using the dynamism of the Python language to its fullest. This would definitely be a pain in the ass in a statically typed language.

```
    Label:
        canvas.before:
            Color:
                rgba: 1,0,0,0.3
            Rectangle:
                size: self.size
                pos: self.pos
        id: index
        font_name: 'RobotoMono-Regular'
        size_hint_x: None
        width: dp(30)
        text_size: self.size
        halign: 'right'
```

Ok, I get how to align the text so that the ids come first. All is good.

```
<Row@RecycleKVIDsDataViewBehavior+BoxLayout>:
```

Now what is `RecycleKVIDsDataViewBehavior`?

I think the example in the folder is really good. I certanly have everything I need if is only displaying the replay buffer. But reacting to clicks is something I'd like to figure out as well.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.recycleview.views.html?highlight=recyclekvidsdataviewbehavior#kivy.uix.recycleview.views.RecycleKVIDsDataViewBehavior

> Then setting the data list with rv.data = [{'name.text': 'Kivy user', 'value.text': '12'}] would automatically set the corresponding labels.

> So, if the key doesnâ€™t have a period, the named property of the root widget will be set to the corresponding value. If there is a period, the named property of the widget with the id listed before the period will be set to the corresponding value.

Yeah, this is the right way to do a DSL. I am struck with admiration at how they managed this.

4pm. I got caught up in chores. I thought I would not have to do them at all today, but I ended up having to help around the house.

Let me get back on track.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    TestApp().run()
```

This is the example I've been studying and I get everything here.

Let me take a look at the docs again.

https://github.com/kivy/kivy/tree/master/examples/widgets/recycleview

There are also more examples in the folder here.

Hmmm...`refresh_from_data` is not even documented. Actually, it is, just in a different place.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.boxlayout.html?highlight=minimum_height#kivy.uix.boxlayout.BoxLayout.minimum_height
> Automatically computed minimum height needed to contain all children.

Hmmm...

```py
class SelectableLabel(RecycleDataViewBehavior, Label):
    ''' Add selection support to the Label '''
    index = None
    selected = BooleanProperty(False)
    selectable = BooleanProperty(True)

    def refresh_view_attrs(self, rv, index, data):
        ''' Catch and handle the view changes '''
        self.index = index
        return super(SelectableLabel, self).refresh_view_attrs(
            rv, index, data)
```

That `index = None` should be global. Then what does `self.index = index` do? It should be setting the local object value.

Hmmmm...

```py
class SelectableLabel(RecycleDataViewBehavior, Label):
    ''' Add selection support to the Label '''
    index = None
    selected = BooleanProperty(False)
```

Why does changing this to true not cause all of them to become selected?

4:45pm. Why does it remove them all twice at the start?

```py
    def on_touch_down(self, touch):
        ''' Add selection on touch down '''
        if super(SelectableLabel, self).on_touch_down(touch):
            return True
        print("In on_touch_down")
        if self.collide_point(*touch.pos) and self.selectable:
            return self.parent.select_with_touch(self.index, touch)
```

It has nothing to do with this. That print never gets triggered.

```py
class SelectableRecycleBoxLayout(FocusBehavior, LayoutSelectionBehavior,
                                 RecycleBoxLayout):
    ''' Adds selection and focus behaviour to the view. '''
```

That second one is responsible for selection behavior. I have no idea what focus behavior is supposed to be.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.behaviors.compoundselection.html?highlight=multiselect#kivy.uix.behaviors.compoundselection.CompoundSelectionBehavior.touch_multiselect

It says that if this is false, I need to press Ctrl in order to get multiselect to work, but it does not work for me.

```py
    def refresh_view_attrs(self, rv, index, data):
        ''' Catch and handle the view changes '''
        self.index = index
        return super(SelectableLabel, self).refresh_view_attrs(
            rv, index, data)
```

Instead of adding a specific index, I could have used this last time.

5:05pm. Focus me, close /a/.

```py
class SelectableLabel(RecycleDataViewBehavior, Label):
    ''' Add selection support to the Label '''
    index = None
    selected = BooleanProperty(False)
    selectable = BooleanProperty(True)

    def refresh_view_attrs(self, rv, index, data):
        ''' Catch and handle the view changes '''
        self.index = index
        return super(SelectableLabel, self).refresh_view_attrs(
            rv, index, data)

    def on_touch_down(self, touch):
        ''' Add selection on touch down '''
        if super(SelectableLabel, self).on_touch_down(touch):
            return True
        if self.collide_point(*touch.pos) and self.selectable:
            return self.parent.select_with_touch(self.index, touch)

    def apply_selection(self, rv, index, is_selected):
        ''' Respond to the selection of items in the view. '''
        self.selected = is_selected
        if is_selected:
            print("selection changed to {0}".format(rv.data[index]))
        else:
            print("selection removed for {0}".format(rv.data[index]))
```

This seems complicated, and I could not have written it myself, but it is pretty simple. I can adapt this for any kind of touch situation. The only thing I am bothered about is why those removes are happening at the beginning.

```
    def refresh_view_attrs(self, rv, index, data):
        ''' Catch and handle the view changes '''
        self.index = index
        print(data)
```

What is the data here?

```
...
{'text': '22'}
{'text': '23'}
```

Ah, it is literally the data. Ok.

5:15pm. Ok, I get this. Let me just take a look at the other examples in the folder.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.checkbox.html

Oh, Kivy does have a checkbox. I see.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.graphics.vertex_instructions.html#kivy.graphics.vertex_instructions.RoundedRectangle

Oh, Kivy does have a rounded rectangle. I could have used this instead of the regular one. Nice.

5:50pm. Had to take a break. Let me finally check out the charts.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36458283/kivy-for-data-visualisation

https://github.com/kivy-garden/graph
https://github.com/kivy-garden/garden.matplotlib

How do I install these in Anaconda?

...Lunch time.

6:20pm. I am back. Can I try out the graph here.

`pip install kivy_garden.graph`

Do I use this command even though I am using an Anaconda env?

Hmmmm...

...Let me try it.

```py
from math import sin
from kivy.app import runTouchApp
from kivy_garden.graph import Graph, MeshLinePlot
graph = Graph(xlabel='X', ylabel='Y', x_ticks_minor=5,
    x_ticks_major=25, y_ticks_major=1,
    y_grid_label=True, x_grid_label=True, padding=5,
    x_grid=True, y_grid=True, xmin=-0, xmax=100, ymin=-1, ymax=1)
plot = MeshLinePlot(color=[1, 0, 0, 1])
plot.points = [(x, sin(x / 10.)) for x in range(0, 101)]
graph.add_plot(plot)
runTouchApp(graph)
```

Not bad. This works now.

https://kivy-garden.github.io/graph/flower.html

Thankfully it is well documented.

I'll be able to make use of this. Right now I do not feel like messing with this anymore, but tomorrow I'll to do a little example with the graph.

Actually, let me do one more thing for the day. Let me make use the graph in Kivy language.

```
root = Builder.load_string('''
#:import graph kivy_garden.graph
Graph:
    xlabel:'X'
    ylabel:'Y'
    x_ticks_minor:5
    x_ticks_major:25
    y_ticks_major:1
    y_grid_label:True
    x_grid_label:True

    x_grid:True
    y_grid:True
    xmin:-0
    xmax:100
    ymin:-1
    ymax:1
''')
```

Oh, this works. Let me try adding the plot.

```
root = Builder.load_string('''

    xmax:100
    ymin:-1
    ymax:1
    MeshLinePlot:
        color: 1,0,0,1
        points: [(x, math.sin(x / 10.)) for x in range(0, 101)]
''')
```

I do not know how to make this work.

```
qwe: MeshLinePlot()
```

Setting a fake property like this does confirm that the MeshLinePlot gets imported.

```
root = Builder.load_string('''
#:import graph kivy_garden.graph
#:import MeshLinePlot kivy_garden.graph.MeshLinePlot
#:import math math
Graph:
    xlabel:'X'
    ylabel:'Y'
    x_ticks_minor:5
    x_ticks_major:25
    y_ticks_major:1
    y_grid_label:True
    x_grid_label:True
    padding:5
    x_grid:True
    y_grid:True
    xmin:-0
    xmax:100
    ymin:-1
    ymax:1
    ps:
        [
        MeshLinePlot(color=[1,0,0,1], points=[(x, math.sin(x / 10.)) for x in range(0, 101)])
        ]
''')

for plot in root.ps: root.add_plot(plot)
runTouchApp(root)
```

I have no idea why this does not allow me to set the plot directly, but whatever. This will do for now.

6:55pm. Let me stop here for the day. Today was light all things considered. The hardest part was that morning rant.

Tomorrow I will start work on generating the enumerative replay buffer. That won't be too hard. The stage is set. All I need to do is keep moving forward."

I am signing because, as far as I know, Stallman is accused of: 1. having a bed in his office, 2. being despondent at one point and wrongly attempting to pressure a woman into dating him, 3. having unpopular opinions, which he has arrived at in good faith and with good will, and which he has been willing to reconsider as he has learned new things. I am signing despite the risk to my personal reputation and career because I want the world to be safe for awkward free thinkers who occasionally become despondent and do the wrong thing. Also, no one alive today knows what the final endpoint of human morality will look like, when the arc of history finishes bending toward justice. Our history up to now should teach us humility. It's overwhelmingly likely that even the most progressive among us have thoughts and behaviors that our descendants will recognize as backward or barbaric, and that there exist oppressed groups to whose plight we are blind. People like Stallman, who are humane, principled and brave enough to point out reasonable objections to overwhelmingly popular norms and taboos, help us all get better more quickly.
