Today was more James and the Emily Rose "Scam". This sparked further by what the Dibney Cru suspect was a Craigslist ad she posted using the name "Emily Rose" that she forgot about. The timing of the Email thru SL she found, and the ad are both in 2017 when a lot of this started getting ramped up for some people with her.  Frankly none of us are buying that its not her and she forgot about it, or did some shady deals with that name and is now trying to hide it. She often goes into these "I was blamed I am the Victim" phases when she has done something she does not want us to find or she knows was dicey and she is now trying to hide. None of us are buying her story.

She also went back after Candy. Trying to "Warn" her over the "Emily Rose Scam". Again, attacking a previous victim for not wanting to be friends with her, due to her atrocious behavior. And to make matters worse, Caps locking her letters, which after seeing the screen shots, she knows that is yelling. She was typing fine prior to Candy telling her to leave her alone, but as soon as there was push back from Candy's side, she went caps locks. Anyways, when Candy pushed back with the "Leave me Alone I do not want to be your friend" spiel we have all been given, Emily started in with the typical Bully/Narcissistic behavior rage when she was not given another victim to abuse. One who we at the Dibney Cru has supported and backed when we found her on DeviantArt(DA). Thankfully we were told this morning, that Emily Blocked Candy, and we feel a party is due for Candy! How long Emily will keep her blocked is uncertain but for now, a Victory has been made!

Another thing that came into notice for some of us, is that while we have all been quiet, we have agreed radio silence is needed, Emily has grown bolder with her attempts to get a reaction from us. Besides Candy, we have all stayed silent. And for good reason. But we noticed she is cycling faster that we have been quiet. Resulting in the conclusion that without our participation she is going further mad. It really is a sad life for her. She has literally three or four people at best that likely talk to her voluntarily, and the ones she wants to interact with are the ones she has repeatedly bullied, victimized, and harassed for years now. The ones who want nothing to do with her. Who have repeatedly said they are not her friends, will not be her friends, has no desire to be her friend, and want nothing to do with her.  She screams about Karma, but this is Karma in its purest form. 

Another thing came up, which has me inkling. Either she is reading the forums, or is reading this. But the fact she brought up yesterday that we all feel she has the mentality of  a 5 to 12year old in a 30 years old body.  Despite her raging screams she is growing up and all that, which not a single one of us believes that. She is still raging and screaming like she did when this began back in 2018, and further back.  It is the mere fact she is aware others see her in that light. Frankly if she shut up, moved on her with her life, and actually told her doctors what is going on, in an attempt to truly grow up, many of us would be more inclined to not so much see her in a better light, or believe her words, but take a more introspective look at what she is doing, as compared to rolling our eyes and commenting in our group why we do not believe a single thing she posts or types. We would still not reach out to her, or try and friend her, but perhaps be a bit easier in our thought process. Do I believe she will ever do such a thing? No. And here is why. She is truly a Narcissist. If you look at her recent purchases, with money that could have been saved, used for bettering her life, in a grander scheme of things, you can tell it is all about the aesthetic of looking like she has "Means." And what I mean by  that is, she wants to give off the feel that she is worldly and has money to do what she wants. In truth she is on disability, and has nothing but what the government gives her. She has no other source of income. So her possession to happiness ratio is skewed.  And by that I mean she attributes possessions to happiness. To those of us who have been poor, or know the reality that possessions do not make one happy, but the people who love and care about you and you them, or the good you do in the world, or even the love you give out, is what can make you happy, she doesn't grasp that. Having Empathy, true not faked Empathy as she often does, can yes make one sad, but doing something about anothers pain, and helping, can bring joy and happiness to you, she doesn't get that. It is simply not in her nature.  And it shows in her spending habits. She equates Happiness to Possessions. Not Happiness to the Love you Share. So she brags about $50 dollar keyboards to look like a fancy gamer, but doesn't take into consideration, that money could have been used to help someone, when there are millions of people in the US right now, hurting badly! Instead of worrying about a Tripod or spending hundreds at best buy, she could have stocked up at Walmart or the local grocery store, and donated a portion (Like $10) to helping feed a local food bank, or a charity to help those that are starving right now due to this pandemic. She could have offered to clean a neighbors house, or her own. Or found a neighbor and offered to pay them to help her clean, and then pay them to do it. She could have bragged, and we would have all been shocked! She helped someone else out, and her apartment was cleaned. But again its about her and only her, not anyone else.

This comes down to another thing I have noticed. She doesn't care about her surroundings. I noticed it with others who are unmedicated behavioral disordered individuals, that their surroundings mean little to them. Especially those like her, who are not aware they are, not quite right, their surroundings to them look fine. To those of us that see it, it is not. Take for instance her desk. Its always disgusting! She does not take care of her possessions. Look at the necklaces she has if you see the picture of the new keyboard. 3 necklaces just left on the desk to tangle and tarnish. I can say even at my lowest depressive state, my jewelry was always hung up or put away. I even made Boho Log hangers to display them so they can grace my room and be organized. But hers is just left like trash, amidst all the other garbage on her desk. Her floor is another example. It doesn't look like its Vacuumed at all. It looks like under her desk, there are chicken bones and dust bunnies just chilling underneath. GROSS! Even her couch looks unkept.  Even in my lowest 2 years ago, I pitched 19 bags of stuff 2 weekends after my truly lowest point. Even now, my rooms may look cluttered, but everything is organized and out of the way. My floors are vacuumed, my kitchen and bathroom are clean, there are no dust bunnies or chicken bones chilling anywhere.  I know for some that is not true, depression takes a tole that even cleaning is hard. But she is clearly not depressed, and has no excuse to not have a clean kept home. But its apart of that Narcissist behavior. She only cares about is her. What she can brag about. The Cat, the things she gets it. Not it really loving up to her or anything else. It is always  "Look the cat is fine!" Fine the cat is fine, but its obviously not loved. Its trapped and depends on you to take care of it. Doesn't mean you love it. And again to the possession thing. She gets it all these toys and other things, but its to brag. Not to make it really happy. Not to do it because she loves it. She has never once said she loves it. Me. I love my old lady, I miss my Oscar badly. I love(d) both my babies. She does not even use the terms that denotes that emotion. And that comes to my next conclusion. She doesn't feel those emotions, leading to Aislinn's theory that Emily is a Sociopath.

But that is all for today.

Remove ancient unused "wear_id" var on xenos (#51236)

Come, let me tell you a story of the old days----of SHITCODE.

AGhhhhh.

Once upon a time, SS13 code was terrible (who are we joking, it still 
is, but that's a story for another day), and when any carbon subtype, 
minus humans, talked over radio, it would runtime.

Of course, coders set about fixing this problem---can't have nonsense 
like that, so...of course, the most logical thing was done.

Instead of solving the awfulness that was not only using the wrong 
istype check and a wonderful colon override as well: 
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/9eb0e80ae7f57040b9178c637efb4bac33ce3d16/code/game/objects/radio/radio.dm#L148

A "Fix" was applied instead: 
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/9eb0e80ae7f57040b9178c637efb4bac33ce3d16#diff-b5f801c8078b7d8dd9f0661b359dfa9e

Whereby `var/obj/item/card/id/wear_id = null` was added to monkeys and 
aliens to "fix" them having an ID holder and not throwing a 
runtime.........Thus ensuring:

Fox would find it one day and call this utterly moronic and while also 
ensuring that all future carbon mobs created without implementing this 
same "fix" would have the same exact problem.

Then radio code got rewritten to be non-stupid and this still hung 
around until today.

The End

How to save aliases when using fish shell

First, apologies if I have submitted two pull requests, I'm not a developer and this is my first time contributing to something that isn't my personal repository.

This is something I initially found confusing. I installed fish shell based on a recommendation online and didn't realize that the alias command behaves differently. It creates the alias just as bash would but only for the current session. I think that many newcomers that happen to have fish installed may become confused that when their aliases are gone the next session.

If you are interested it may be nice to add a section on fish shell here as I personally find it a great "quality of life tweak". If you are interested let me know and I can draft something up.

Apply transform to constrain RBFKernel lengthscale in LCEMGP (#643)

Summary:
## Motivation

This adds a transform to `UniformPrior` in `LCEMGP` class to convert real values to constrained values in `[0, 2]`. Otherwise, with distribution validation enabled (which will be the default once https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48743 is merged), this throws an error in `Uniform.log_prob` method. We were facing this issue in an internal FB test that uses botorch.

While this fixes the specific issue, my thinking is that this transform should ideally be applied automatically within `gpytorch.priors`. That said, my understanding of the codebase is very limited, so would love to hear others' thoughts on this.

### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?

Yes

Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/pull/643

Test Plan:
Turned `Distribution.set_default_validate_args(True)` and succesffully ran `test_contextual_multioutput.py: ContextualMultiOutputTest.testLCEMGP` with a fixed seed and increased `maxiter` (this test fails without the fix).
