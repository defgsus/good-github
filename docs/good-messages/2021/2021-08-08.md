Add button to open integrity report

Fucking hell I hate UI code so much. I know this is a shitty way  to handle adding the button, but I tried making my own XAML window and XL never loaded it so I forced it in. 

This could probably be cleaned up or made into its own window, but it works and I never want to touch WPF again.

BACKPORT: tcp: instrument tcp sender limits chronographs

This patch implements the skeleton of the TCP chronograph
instrumentation on sender side limits:

	1) idle (unspec)
	2) busy sending data other than 3-4 below
	3) rwnd-limited
	4) sndbuf-limited

The limits are enumerated 'tcp_chrono'. Since a connection in
theory can idle forever, we do not track the actual length of this
uninteresting idle period. For the rest we track how long the sender
spends in each limit. At any point during the life time of a
connection, the sender must be in one of the four states.

If there are multiple conditions worthy of tracking in a chronograph
then the highest priority enum takes precedence over
the other conditions. So that if something "more interesting"
starts happening, stop the previous chrono and start a new one.

The time unit is jiffy(u32) in order to save space in tcp_sock.
This implies application must sample the stats no longer than every
49 days of 1ms jiffy.

saalim :- Drop rate_app_limited from tcp header (already present)

Rewrite everything

* Remove all resolution specific scripts and replace them with a single
  one
* Update README.md with more information
* Divide Width when calculating correct pixel
* Add exit keybind
* Makefile: Compile to a specific output directory
* Makefile: Echo current file that is compiling
* Remove explicit true from if statement
* Add support for most resolutions I could use
* Found a way to get 4k so I could test 4k resolution and it kinda
  fucked up my explorer and shit so never again hopefully LOL
* Remove newRes.js (fuck yavascript)

Don't use a specific color

Now it just checks if it's between two colors. Still not perfect because
if someone is using some sort of saturation or similar, they will not
have the same color. Even then it depends 'cause sometimes screenshots
aren't affected by that. Would autohotkey be affected by that? I don't
fucking know and no one but me is using this shit so no one else will
even read this shit lmao fuck you.

# Pandas-Challenge
HeroesOfPymoli

Pandas Homework - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

Background
The data dive continues!
Now, it's time to take what you've learned about Python Pandas and apply it to new situations. For this assignment, you'll need to complete one of two (not both)  Data Challenges. Once again, which challenge you take on is your choice. Just be sure to give it your all -- as the skills you hone will become powerful tools in your data analytics tool belt.

Before You Begin


Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Pandas Challenge you choose. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: HeroesOfPymoli or  PyCitySchools.


Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.


Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.



Option 1: Heroes of Pymoli

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
Your final report should include each of the following:

Player Count

Total Number of Players


Purchasing Analysis (Total)

Number of Unique Items
Average Purchase Price
Total Number of Purchases
Total Revenue


Gender Demographics

Percentage and Count of Male Players
Percentage and Count of Female Players
Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed


Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

The below each broken by gender

Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value
Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender




Age Demographics

The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)

Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value
Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group




Top Spenders

Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

SN
Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value




Most Popular Items

Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):

Item ID
Item Name
Purchase Count
Item Price
Total Purchase Value




Most Profitable Items

Identify the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

Item ID
Item Name
Purchase Count
Item Price
Total Purchase Value



As final considerations:

You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
You must submit a link to your Github/Git Lab repo that contains your Jupyter Notebook.
You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
See Example Solution for a reference on expected format.

Error handling for adding todos.

Previously when you'd add a todo the todolist component would just
delete the todo text you typed which is fine unless it errors. The
validation for todos has a character limit that's somewhat small so if
someone went through the trouble of typing out a bunch it kinda sucks to
have it all deleted, and without warning because it wouldn't notify you
that it failed. Now it won't clear the field unless it was successful
and if it wasn't it'll show an error toast saying your todo is too long.

ConsoleReaderThread: fixed UTF-8 paths getting corrupted on the way to the subprocess in some cases
I was never able to reproduce this, but it appears that Windows breaks the character encoding of command parameters (and also unicode environment variables, even though UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT should be set in php-src) when the file path contains Unicode characters (such as Cyrillic).
We workaround this problem using base64, which is an abysmally shitty hack, but not worse than using a subprocess for ConsoleReader in the first place. PHP fucking sucks, and so does Windows.
closes #4353

qcacld-3.0: Defer HDD initialization.

 * ALso rely on userspace writing to /dev/wlan, Wi-Fi
   HAL writes "ON" or "OFF" to /dev/wlan.

 * Use this method to initialize hdd as it's a safer
   way to ensure both wlan_mac.bin and WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini
   are ready to be read.

 * This also eliminates the needs for horrible hacks
   to read the userspace file.
