OpenVSP 3.25.0

About five years ago, Justin Gravett made his first contributions to
OpenVSP.  He has had his hands in pretty much every version since 3.9.0
and has been the source of most of the progress for about the last
three and a half years.

Justin started by adding the 2D SVG and DXF export followed by XPatch
export support.  He expanded our API coverage to be far more complete,
also writing API documentation with examples for every routine.

Justin has kept the VSPAERO GUI up with Dave Kinney's continuous
progress, also developing the VSPAERO V&V script.  The OpenVSP v3
Incarnation of FEAMesh structures capability was written by Justin.
It represented a huge capability leap from what was in v2.

Justin developed our capability to export intersected STEP and IGES files
including BREP solids.  He also developed the Generic XSec lending great
freedom to geometry modeling.

I'm sure I'm missing other contributions.  All along the way,
he has found and fixed countless bugs across the codebase.

OpenVSP isn't losing Justin - but we are going to see less of him.  He
is moving on to the next adventure in his life where OpenVSP will be
more of a side hustle than his main gig.  We wish him luck and extend
the greatest of thanks for all he has done for OpenVSP.


On to the 3.25.0 release...


This version is mostly bug fixes, but also has a significant update to
VSPAERO.  Everyone should upgrade.

We have dropped the pre-built binaries for Win32.  Our build system was
having trouble finding Python for Win32, so we're going to drop it and
see if anyone notices.  If this is a problem for you, ask on the Google
Group and we'll figure something out.

We hopefully have finally resolved the Python version issues we've had.

Win64 should be at Python 3.6.8
MacOS should be at Python 3.6.14
Ubuntu 20.04 should use 'apt-get install python3' which is 3.8.10
Ubuntu 18.04 should use 'apt-get install python3' which is 3.6.9

If the consensus is that we should move our Windows/MacOS Python support
forward, we should be able to do so easily -- help us form a consensus
on the Google Group.

Is anyone out there using OpenVSP Python API with Python 2?

VSPAERO v6.2.0 comes with lots of bug fixes and improvements including
span load distribution plots for thick-surface solutions.  The
VSPAERO viewer now does screenshots with PNG files and adds some
animation generation support across platforms.  Generating
a movie requires ffmpeg somewhere in your path.

The force/moment calculations are all re-written to use the
Kutta Jukowski theorem for lift and drag, but explicit downwash
calculations at edge centers (instead of loop averages).  Some differences
are seen in drag, so Cd is calculated from the KJ theorem, but it
also writes out Cdi as calculated from a TE / Trefftz-type method.
They should generally match for steady cases.

We now include OpenVSP and VSPAERO support for the experimental
*.vspgeom file.  There are features to add and bugs to work out, but
this will eventually be the only way of communicating geometry from
OpenVSP to VSPAERO.  Think of it like a free development preview.

Features:
 - Updated VSPAERO Solver, Viewer, and CPSlicer to v6.2.0
 - Support for ReCref sweeps in VSPAERO
 - Adds reading of VSPAERO *.polar results
 - Improves behavior of vertical scroll bars
 - Add Mach and set name to Wave Drag output and file name (thanks anwarmou)
 - Improves drag and drop for skinning parameters (thanks anwarmou)
 - Improves detection of feature line and planar part intersections
 - Improves Debian installation instructions (thanks Cibin Joseph)

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixes for Total Wing Parameter Calculations
 - Fixes crash with exactly aligned Prop XSecs
 - Fixes upper/lower design mode for BORGeoms
 - Fixes multiple issues with parameter links
 - Fixes memory leaks in FEA Mesh and resizable columns
 - Updates shell property specification in NASTRAN export
 - Fix clearing of VSPAERO CpSlicer results
 - Fixes Python version specification in GitHub Actions build
 - Fixes update issue for Variable Presets
 - Fix problem with VSPAERO viewer not launching

Other:
 - Increases minimum CMake version from 2.8 to 3.1

Support and default to generating Atom feeds

This includes several breaking changes, but they’re easy to adjust for.

Atom 1.0 is superior to RSS 2.0 in a number of ways, both technical and
legal, though information from the last decade is hard to find.
http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Rss20AndAtom10Compared
has some info which is probably still mostly correct.

How do RSS and Atom compare in terms of implementation support? The
impression I get is that proper Atom support in normal content websites
has been universal for over twelve years, but that support in podcasts
was not quite so good, but getting there, over twelve years ago. I have
no more recent facts or figures; no one talks about this stuff these
days. I remember investigating this stuff back in 2011–2013 and coming
to the same conclusion. At that time, I went with Atom on websites and
RSS in podcasts. Now I’d just go full Atom and hang any podcast tools
that don’t support Atom, because Atom’s semantics truly are much better.

In light of all this, I make the bold recommendation to default to Atom.

Nonetheless, for compatibility for existing users, and for those that
have Opinions, I’ve retained the RSS template, so that you can escape
the breaking change easily.

I personally prefer to give feeds a basename that doesn’t mention “Atom”
or “RSS”, e.g. “feed.xml”. I’ll be doing that myself, as I’ll be using
my own template with more Atom features anyway, like author information,
taxonomies and making the title field HTML.

Some notes about the Atom feed template:

- I went with atom.xml rather than something like feed.atom (the .atom
  file format being registered for this purpose by RFC4287) due to lack
  of confidence that it’ll be served with the right MIME type. .xml is a
  safer default.

- It might be nice to get Zola’s version number into the <generator>
  tag. Not for any particularly good reason, y’know. Just picture it:

    <generator uri="https://www.getzola.org/" version="0.10.0">
	Zola
    </generator>

- I’d like to get taxonomies into the feed, but this requires exposing a
  little more info than is currently exposed. I think it’d require
  `TaxonomyConfig` to preferably have a new member `permalink` added
  (which should be equivalent to something like `config.base_url ~ "/" ~
  taxonomy.slug ~ "/"`), and for the feed to get all the taxonomies
  passed into it (`taxonomies: HashMap<String, TaxonomyTerm>`).
  Then, the template could be like this, inside the entry:

    {% for taxonomy, terms in page.taxonomies %}
        {% for term in terms %}
            <category scheme="{{ taxonomies[taxonomy].permalink }}"
		term="{{ term.slug }}" label="{{ term.name }}" />
	{% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}

Other remarks:

- I have added a date field `extra.updated` to my posts and include that
  in the feed; I’ve observed others with a similar field. I believe this
  should be included as an official field. I’m inclined to add author to
  at least config.toml, too, for feeds.
- We need to have a link from the docs to the source of the built-in
  templates, to help people that wish to alter it.

Update README.md

## How to setup/deploy.

### Read these notes carefully before proceeding. 
 - Edit any mentions of @OnePunchSupport to your own support chat
 - Your code must be open source and a link to your fork's repository must be there in the start reply of the bot [See this](https://github.com/AnimeKaizoku/SaitamaRobot/blob/shiken/SaitamaRobot/__main__.py#L25)
 - Lastly, if you are found to run this repo without the code being open sourced or the repository link not mentioned in the bot, we will push a gban for you in our network because of being in violation of the license, you are free to be a dick and not respect the open source code (we do not mind) but we will not be having you around our chats
 - This repo does not come with technical support, so DO NOT come to us asking help about deploy/console errors

<details>
  <summary>Steps to deploy on Heroku !! </summary>


Fill in all the details, Deploy!
Now go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/(app-name)/resources ( Replace (app-name) with your app name )
REMEMBER: Turn on worker dyno (Don't worry It's free :D) & Webhook
Now send the bot /start, If it doesn't respond go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/(app-name)/settings and remove webhook and port.


  [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/nryadav7412/AshXSerena)

</details>  
<details>
  <summary>Steps to self Host!! </summary>

  ## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Please make sure to use python3.6, as I cannot guarantee everything will work as expected on older Python versions!
This is because markdown parsing is done by iterating through a dict, which is ordered by default in 3.6.

  ### Configuration

There are two possible ways of configuring your bot: a config.py file, or ENV variables.

The preferred version is to use a config.py file, as it makes it easier to see all your settings grouped together.
This file should be placed in your SaitamaRobot folder, alongside the __main__.py file. 
This is where your bot token will be loaded from, as well as your database URI (if you're using a database), and most of
your other settings.

It is recommended to import sample_config and extend the Config class, as this will ensure your config contains all
defaults set in the sample_config, hence making it easier to upgrade.

An example config.py file could be:

from SaitamaRobot.sample_config import Config

class Development(Config):
    OWNER_ID = 254318997  # your telegram ID
    OWNER_USERNAME = ""  # your telegram username
    API_KEY = "your bot api key"  # your api key, as provided by the @botfather
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database'  # sample db credentials
    JOIN_LOGGER = '-1234567890' # some group chat that your bot is a member of
    USE_JOIN_LOGGER = True
    DRAGONS = [18673980, 83489514]  # List of id's for users which have sudo access to the bot.
    LOAD = []
    NO_LOAD = ['translation']


If you can't have a config.py file (EG on Heroku), it is also possible to use environment variables.
So just go and read the config sample file. 

  ### Python dependencies

Install the necessary Python dependencies by moving to the project directory and running:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt.

This will install all the necessary python packages.

  ### Database

If you wish to use a database-dependent module (eg: locks, notes, userinfo, users, filters, welcomes),
you'll need to have a database installed on your system. I use Postgres, so I recommend using it for optimal compatibility.

In the case of Postgres, this is how you would set up a database on a Debian/ubuntu system. Other distributions may vary.

- install postgresql:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install postgresql

- change to the Postgres user:

sudo su - postgres

- create a new database user (change YOUR_USER appropriately):

createuser -P -s -e YOUR_USER

This will be followed by you need to input your password.

- create a new database table:

createdb -O YOUR_USER YOUR_DB_NAME

Change YOUR_USER and YOUR_DB_NAME appropriately.

- finally:

psql YOUR_DB_NAME -h YOUR_HOST YOUR_USER

This will allow you to connect to your database via your terminal.
By default, YOUR_HOST should be 0.0.0.0:5432.

You should now be able to build your database URI. This will be:

sqldbtype://username:pw@hostname:port/db_name

Replace sqldbtype with whichever DB you're using (eg Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, etc)
repeat for your username, password, hostname (localhost?), port (5432?), and DB name.

  ## Modules
   ### Setting load order.

The module load order can be changed via the LOAD and NO_LOAD configuration settings.
These should both represent lists.

If LOAD is an empty list, all modules in modules/ will be selected for loading by default.

If NO_LOAD is not present or is an empty list, all modules selected for loading will be loaded.

If a module is in both LOAD and NO_LOAD, the module will not be loaded - NO_LOAD takes priority.

   ### Creating your own modules.

Creating a module has been simplified as much as possible - but do not hesitate to suggest further simplification.

All that is needed is that your .py file is in the modules folder.

To add commands, make sure to import the dispatcher via

from SaitamaRobot import dispatcher.

You can then add commands using the usual

dispatcher.add_handler().

Assigning the __help__ variable to a string describing this modules' available
commands will allow the bot to load it and add the documentation for
your module to the /help command. Setting the __mod_name__ variable will also allow you to use a nicer, user-friendly name for a module.

The __migrate__() function is used for migrating chats - when a chat is upgraded to a supergroup, the ID changes, so 
it is necessary to migrate it in the DB.

The __stats__() function is for retrieving module statistics, eg number of users, number of chats. This is accessed 
through the /stat command, which is only available to the bot owner.

## Starting the bot.

Once you've set up your database and your configuration is complete, simply run the bat file(if on windows) or run (Linux):

python3 -m SaitamaRobot

You can use [nssm](https://nssm.cc/usage) to install the bot as service on windows and set it to restart on /gitpull 
Make sure to edit the start and restart bats to your needs. 
Note: the restart bat requires that User account control be disabled.

For queries or any issues regarding the bot please open an issue ticket or visit us at [One Punch Support](https://t.me/OnePunchSupport)

Added "FR33THY" all-in-one guide

Well, I'm not getting friends while "fucking with the big guys" but there are reasons why his guide is listed under "negative tweak examples" and those reasons are:
- He answers interesting questions without giving a "real answer" or changes the subject.
- He does not answer at all.
- The guide claims a lot without giving evidence or reference links to my and other projects. Making a video tutorial or guidance about my and other people's work without even giving any credits is low for "YouTube stars".
- Giving people advice to e.g. disabling "4g decoding" in your BIOS is questionable, this improves the mining performance a lot, he should mention drawbacks or that such options are helpful for e.g. mining reasons. His SecureBoot configuration is also more than questionable, SB is a huge topic on it's own and security should (in my opinion) come before performance ALWAYS because been a gamer is not an "excuse" for not "hardening" specific hardware/software related things.
- His registry tweak section does not even work anymore under Windows 10Rs3+ e.g. "MenuShowDelay" is placebo and is handled internally, you can set whatever you want there, it does nothing. Same like Game Bar and GameDVR, it does not work anymore like the way he thinks it does, I say he blindly copied several things without testing it first or do proper research.
- The so called "anti cheat flag" got removed from ProcessHacker's source code and does not work like he explains it would work. Steam, origin & Co. do not detection ProcessHacker anymore, the "cheat problem" (debugging) thing was solved long time ago.

DO I "shit talk" this guy or his work?
NO, but I say he should consider to mention:
- Possible drawbacks
- Make clear that this is his own preference and is not substantial to security nor gaming itself.
- He should make clear what the goals are
- He should give proper credits, most of "his findings" are definitely not his own.

[change] make windows link statically

This breaks builds on ArchLinux MinGW ATM, but it's THEIR FAULT and not
mine.

The reason why I'm building like this is pretty obvious:
 * It so much easier to add modules as a single DLL file instead of
   having a fucking rat's nest to deal with.
 * It makes my life as a packager (THAT) much easier.
 * Makes automation less painful for Windows builds
 * Saves the precious braincells of my users and myself.

Gilded Rose Requirements Specification
======================================

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a
prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.
Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We
have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named
Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that
we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:

	- All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
	- All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
	- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

	- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
	- The Quality of an item is never negative
	- "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
	- The Quality of an item is never more than 50
	- "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
	- "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
	Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
	Quality drops to 0 after the concert

We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

	- "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything
still works correctly. However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the
goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in shared code
ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like, we'll cover
for you).

Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase above 50, however "Sulfuras" is a
legendary item and as such its Quality is 80 and it never alters.

Create README.md

<p>These are the F3Z files for 2021 The Cyrcle Phone 4G enclosure.</p>

<p>Additional Materials Needed for Assembly:</p>
Uses the following eight (8) McMaster Carr screws (4 for the skeleton, 4 for the back shell)
- 5mm Screws: JIS Steel Flat Head Screws, M1.6 x 0.35 mm Thread, 5mm Long, 91305A004 https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/127/3293/

<br><p>Tips for printing:</p>
- Calibrate your machine first. The walls are thin and will test your 3D printer's tolerances.
- Print the "back shell" separately, face down, and use rectilinear supports inside to make the back of the shell smooth. Use pliers to grab and twist the support material out from the inside of the "back shell". The inside will end up being rough, but the outside smoothness will feel nice in the hand.
- Print the "faceplate" face down on a glassy surface for a nice and smooth face. We typically use a contrasting color (black) for this piece, and consequently have to print it separately.
- Print the "outer ring" with the tabs up, face down, because you will want the face of the "outer ring" to be smooth, and allow the slight indentations for the ports to print well on top. (You can sand away any irregularities that may occur with the tabs later since they end up hidden in the design.)

<br><p>History:</p>
<br>In July 2020, industrial designer Wesley Millora submitted an entry for The Cyrcle Phone 4G enclosure contest held on MyMiniFactory and won "Best Exterior" out of 64 submissions.
<br>In September 2020, dTOOR solicited Millora for a bid to update the design for injection molding purposes, which he then submitted.
<br>Months rolled by as dTOOR continued to work on software development.
<br>In late December 2020, Millora was contacted by dTOOR Founder & CEO Christina Cyr, formerly asking him to join the team. Since Millora was on vacation, and working on another project at the time, Cyr also asked permission to use Millora's design in the meantime, since units needed to be submitted to China for testing by January 10th.
<br>In short, these files were created by dTOOR Founder & CEO Christina Cyr in January 2021, specifically based on (and only after obtaining consent) Wesley Millora's images submitted for The Cyrcle Phone 4G enclosure design contest on MyMiniFactory, with the intention of Millora joining the team at a later date when he was available. Millora joined the team in March 2021 to update the design for injection molding purposes.
<br>As such, these files are not absolutely identical to the final product, as they have been designed to print (more) reliably on a 3D printer (slightly thicker walls, no 3% wall incline required for injection molding, etc.). These 3D-printer-friendly files were used for all of our evaluation models. In our experience, these files can be printed fairly reliabily with most PLA filaments on most 3D printers, so that you can have any color (or sparkle) you want. These files are also provided to you so that you can enhance the design to better fit your style (rabbit ears, etc.). We would love it if you could share photos of your designs on social media and tag us at #cyrclephone so that we can see what you've added. Have fun!

"6:35pm. Actually, I really should just let the thing train now and over the night. Let me go for it. That way when I wake up I'll be able to tell right away whether my training works. If I close here I'll just be wasting time. I might as well open the case in order to air it out.

7:15pm. Tried playing vs the checkpoint 4 player. Back to being an aggrodonk.

I have no idea, I want to pivot, but let me instead keep running it. I do get the feeling that I am not doing it right, but I can't overcome the lack of hardware so easily. If I get no results by tomorrow, I'll change the way the training is done.

7:35pm. Let me try agent 5.

7:40pm. It is still quite bad, but at least it looks like it is learning something. It is not a dumb aggrodonk. Instead it makes small bets, and sometimes calls down with pairs. It is still highly exploitable as it will keep reraising and then folding 90% of its stack again and again.

But this behavior is still much more refined than folding all the time or making massive bets and calling down with anything all the time.

It is not out of the question that it might turn into something good eventually. It is worth seeing whether it improves in the coming iterations or if it degenerates back into an aggrodonk. If that happens, I'll have to retry the training with bigger replaement gaps. I am afraid that if I make the gaps too big the action prob softmax will saturate.

Though I've changed Hellinger distance to log softmax, I am still not sure if normed square or softmax are better when feeding the values directly. I can't assume either thing.

The training here is so unstable that I have no choice to just pick one and stick with it.

Running sweeps is way out of the question. This is the curse of having small compute resources.

8:30pm. Let me try agent 6. It is not an aggrodonk, but it barely moved from the previous one. It keeps folding to reraises preflop even with very strong hands.

I poker really such a difficult game that this is the best they can do?

Actually their behavior is pretty interesting. Why would they put so much money in only to fold at the end?

This reminds me of the behavior of the Poker Academy Pro 2 bots. They too were very liberal with raises, but would fold unless they had top pair. It made them very exploitable. To think I would see this behavior again.

8:45pm. Well, maybe the bots will get to a decent level over the night.

It is too bad I lost the game somewhere, I remember looking for it and couldn't find a download for it either. One interesting part is that it had that GTO limit HU player. That one was tough as nails, I did my best, but could not find a way to beat it.

9pm. The way the agent 6 acted, it would push strong hands for longer before folding. This is quite interesting, and it is not like agent 5 which would push everything before folding. Agent 6 would only push weak hands to about 30% of its stack.

So it is learning. I probably won't have to increase the replacement length.

9:25pm. It is weird. It refuses to call down even with top pair for some reason. Trips are fine though.

9:30pm. Oh 7 is done. Let me see how it progressed. I am glad I let it run, this is fun.

I has similar behavior to before, but it has learned to call down with KK preflop.

Folded AA on the flop. It is dumb as a rock.

10:20pm. 5 iterations till 8 is baked. What a difference a even 100x fold in performance would make. It would be at 800 by now.

The sheer amount of time it is taking it to get to a halfway competent level is insane.

I could theory train this for months, but do I feel like having my GPU burn away for 24/7 during that time. I also like to turn my PC off during the night.

I'll do that. Once it hits 8 I will abort. Absolutely nothing in the world is worth distrupting your sleep for.

10:30pm. Let me give 8 a try. Hmmm, did I forgot to try out 7?

10:45pm. It really is getting better. Right now it actually knows to call down with pairs. Apart for the sake of showdown, it never seems to call to see the next street, it only ever raises and folds. And it does so in a very exploitable way, but gradually it is getting better.

I want to see how good it can get. Let me leave it overnight after all."

kthread: add kthread_create_worker*()

Kthread workers are currently created using the classic kthread API,
namely kthread_run().  kthread_worker_fn() is passed as the @threadfn
parameter.

This patch defines kthread_create_worker() and
kthread_create_worker_on_cpu() functions that hide implementation details.

They enforce using kthread_worker_fn() for the main thread.  But I doubt
that there are any plans to create any alternative.  In fact, I think that
we do not want any alternative main thread because it would be hard to
support consistency with the rest of the kthread worker API.

The naming and function of kthread_create_worker() is inspired by the
workqueues API like the rest of the kthread worker API.

The kthread_create_worker_on_cpu() variant is motivated by the original
kthread_create_on_cpu().  Note that we need to bind per-CPU kthread
workers already when they are created.  It makes the life easier.
kthread_bind() could not be used later for an already running worker.

This patch does _not_ convert existing kthread workers.  The kthread
worker API need more improvements first, e.g.  a function to destroy the
worker.

IMPORTANT:

kthread_create_worker_on_cpu() allows to use any format of the worker
name, in compare with kthread_create_on_cpu().  The good thing is that it
is more generic.  The bad thing is that most users will need to pass the
cpu number in two parameters, e.g.  kthread_create_worker_on_cpu(cpu,
"helper/%d", cpu).

To be honest, the main motivation was to avoid the need for an empty
va_list.  The only legal way was to create a helper function that would be
called with an empty list.  Other attempts caused compilation warnings or
even errors on different architectures.

There were also other alternatives, for example, using #define or
splitting __kthread_create_worker().  The used solution looked like the
least ugly.

Add files via upload

- A new menu item was added: Music! I spent GODDAMN DAYS, and you finally can change volume and soundtracks!
- Added the first soundtrack by Daniel (a.k.a. Anfim)! It won't play from the beginning, so you need to start the song in the Music menu. It's 13 minutes long, by the way:)
- Added a scene by Melonmallow. In Night Club, you will be able to "Look for troubles" if you are drunk (60 intoxication) and lewd (60 corruption) enough. Do this, and you'll be rewarded with a quick outside fun;3
- Now you can wash your hands and legs in school WCs (both girls and boys)
- Some variables, layout errors and typos were fixed
- Now, whenever you apply makeup and new lips color, you'll be "notified" about the changes
- Now, no makeup still gives you +2 to attractiveness and any lipstick - +5
- Now you can see the link "Buy lewd stuff" (in the Laptop) if your corruption is higher than 40
- Tried to fix the broken pics of magazines in the brother's room. Now there are 4 of them, and the phantom fifth one... is still broken, yep
- Added 7 new gifs for webcam actions

Added a bio 

 Hi, 
my name is Shaun Nord and I am currently attending Southwest tech to receive a certificate in Java Software Development. 
This repository exists so that I may save my future assignments in my next class, "Object Oriented Programming."
I was born and raised in Riverside California. I met my spouse while attending high school and now we have been together for 17 years. I joined the United States Airforce, and served for six wonderful years. The Air Force has taught me to be a leader, and has taught me great problem solving skills. While in the Air Force I had three beautiful daughters. When I left the Air Force I struggled to find what I wanted to do with my life, and now I have discovered programming and I love it.  The reason I wanted to start programming is because I enjoy problems. I like to fix things when they go wrong, and I like the way it makes you want to pull your hair out. I also would like the freedom from having to drive to work and punch a clock, it leaves me more time with my family.

Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change... That. Is. Crazy. The first time somebody told me that, I dunno, I thought they were bullshitting me, so, boom...I shot him! The thing is... He was right. And then I started seeing, everywhere I looked, everywhere I looked all these fucking pricks, everywhere I looked, doing the exact same fucking thing... over and over and over and over again thinking, 'This time is gonna be different, no, no, no please... This time is gonna be different'.
