Pipeguns: Elitism Edition (#56322)

About The Pull Request

The core of the PR:

The improvised shotgun that was is dead and removed.

Now we have Pipeguns. Pipeguns are bolt action rifles that have a damage multiplier that reduces their damage to 75%, and can be modified to fit the rare 7.62mm bullets. If you want to that is.

The pipegun also slowly increases in misfire probability for every shot at a rate of 5% per shot.

Pipeguns can also be upgraded to Regal Pipeguns. These contain more bullets, don't misfire and don't have a damage multiplier. To acquire one is a maint secret, only available to lucky assistants who come across the diary of a dead assistant. The probability of finding the book is quite, quite low.

Bandoliers now fit individual 7.62mm. Because why not. Currently they're available in stripper clips that fit into most combat belts so this is mostly a style preference at the moment

Other shit

Ammo modification and misfire behaviour is now generalized to all ballistics. You can now make any gun misfire and any internal magazine gun swap ammunition.

Misfires are not a flat chance. Instead, they increment as the gun fires over time.

Ports over this PR Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13#12274 which I felt was pretty neat conceptually for making some weapons weaker.

Makes the icemoon hermit's mosin into a regal pipegun, just to get mosins out of easy access.
Why It's Good For The Game

Improvised shotguns were one of my favourite weapons to horribly abuse while they were utterly broken a nice alternative, but I fully support moving towards curbing gun power curve. Part of that should include looking at improvised weapons like this which are seeing considerable usage with the removal of buckshot and slugs.

Initially I wanted to pair this with a PR of my own to bop Mosins on the skull along with it, but #56319 is already doing that, and while it's a very lenient approach to my own (I was going to remove them entirely from cargo), I respect it.

Changelog

cl
add: Replaces improvised shotguns with Pipeguns (with a special variant for those willing to go through arbitrary bullshit to acquire it and sheer good luck).
add: Now all guns can be set to misfire and swap ammunition.
add: Misfire chance is incremental as you fire the weapon, and not a flat static chance. This can be reset by using a piece of cloth on the gun and 10 seconds of cleaning.
balance: This has been applied to the detective revolver, but it only increments while using .357 bullets.
add: Guns can have damage multipliers attached for the bullets they fire. The pipegun (but not the regal version) is the first example with a 75% damage output.
balance: The Ice Hermit now has a regal pipegun instead of a Mosin Nagant.
balance: The bandolier fits 7.62mm.
balance: You can construct receivers and rifle stocks in the crafting menu.
balance: Detaches the magical rifles from the boltaction subtype, since they are just basically not using any variables attached to that subtype and made from a series of early returns.

chore(rds): add PG12.5 and deprecate PG9.5 and PG9.6 (#12998)

Added PostgreSQL 12.5 version.

Also, I got a friendly email from AWS that some versions of PG will be forcefully updated, and I've decided to mark PG9.5 and 9.6 as deprecated. (Feb 2021 and Nov 2021 EOLs respectfully).

> Amazon RDS is starting the end of life process for PostgreSQL major version 9.5. We are doing this because the PostgreSQL community is planning to discontinue support for PostgreSQL 9.5 on February 11, 2021 [1].
> 
> Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 will reach end of life on February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.6 will reach end of life in late 2021. Hence, we strongly encourage you to upgrade your databases running PostgreSQL major version 9.5 to 12 or greater at your convenience before February 16, 2021. PostgreSQL 12 contains major innovations including JSON path queries per SQL/JSON specifications and pluggable table storage interface [2]. PostgreSQL 13 introduced parallel processing of indexes with the VACUUM command and improved duplicate data handling by B-tree indexes [3]. Both versions contain numerous fixes to various software defects in earlier versions of the database.
> 
> If you do not upgrade your databases before February 16, 2021, RDS will upgrade your PostgreSQL 9.5 databases to PostgreSQL 12 during a scheduled maintenance window between Feb 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC and March 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC. On March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC, any PostgreSQL 9.5 databases that remain will be upgraded to version 12 regardless of whether the instances are in a maintenance window or not.
> 
> You can initiate an upgrade of your database instance — either immediately or during your next maintenance window — to a newer major version of PostgreSQL using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface. The upgrade process will shut down the database instance, perform the upgrade, and restart the database instance. The database instance may be restarted multiple times during the upgrade process. While major version upgrades typically complete within the standard maintenance window, the duration of the upgrade depends on the number of objects within the database. To avoid any unplanned unavailability outside your maintenance window, we recommend that you first take a snapshot of your database and test the upgrade to get an estimate of the duration. To learn more about upgrading PostgreSQL major versions in RDS, review the Upgrading Database Versions page [4].
> 
> We want to make you aware of the following additional milestones associated with upgrading these databases that are reaching end of life.
> 
> Now through March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - You can initiate upgrades of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to PostgreSQL 12 or higher at any time.
> February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - After this date and time, you cannot create new RDS instances with PostgreSQL major version 9.5 from either the AWS Console or the CLI. RDS will also automatically upgrade PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 within the earliest scheduled maintenance window that follows. Restoration of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 database snapshots will result in an automatic upgrade of the restored database to a still supported version at the time.
> March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - RDS will automatically upgrade any remaining PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 whether or not they are in a maintenance window.
> Should you have any questions or concerns, the AWS Support Team is available on the community forums and via Premium Support [5].

##### 2021-02-16 01:53:55 by Ryan Kelly

A little experiment with macros instead of build scripts.

This commit is basically me messing around with procedural macros,
to try them out as a potential future iteration of the UniFFI
developer experience.

As a crate author, I think it would be amazing not to have to
worry about .udl files and build scripts and what-not, but
instead be able to declare my API with a macro and have Rust
just take care of the details. This commit is a tiny experiment
in that direction, based on existing features of UniFFI.

The idea is that I can wrap my Rust code in a little macro
like this:

```
[uniffi_macros::declare_interface]
pub mod my_component {
  ...my rust code goes here...
}
```

And I can provide a corresponding `my_component.udl` file that
declares the interface, and all the Rust scaffolding code just
gets taken care of automagically.

I still have to provide a `.udl` file, but I hope you can imagine
one day the possibility of generating the interface definition
directly from the Rust code that is decorated by the macro.
Not any time soon! But one day...

well here we are taking the quicker route you'd think this would be so much quicker but with all the built in delays heh...

p.s. you assholes enjoying pretending a plague is killing america rather than the corrupt rich sucking the money out of the country.

one must wonder how they feel now ?
all the people who conspired and left us all in the dirt and corrupted us for fun without telling us about their ridiculous background system, which our fucking parents signed us up for without consulting us first.. just so they could make us suffer.

what a great tradeoff
now they're all dead eyed slaves, moreso than they ever were, and i watch them die and i laugh a little. not to the point of their moronic delusion thinking life is much better for me.
but :)
please die, so the last of us who were decent humans who would have loved our offspring unlike all of them, can repopulate the world with people better than us without these people conspiring to ruin them and us.

Provide ability to customise cljfmt code formatting

**Describe the solution you'd like**

It should be possible to provide a custom formatting configuration for
cider-nrepl/cljfmt. The cljfmt configuration format is described here:

  https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt#configuration

The desired solution should have a defcustom variable where the
configuration can be provided.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

A workaround to this solution is to use an after-save-hook as
described here:

https://github.com/dzer6/cljfmt-graalvm

However, in this case, the two formatters (cider, external cljfmt)
will keep fighting each other causing an awful user experience.

**Additional context**

In https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/2907 Bozhidar Batsov
commented:

 > You can just disable dynamic (REPL-powered) indentation if you
 > don't rely on it
 > https://docs.cider.mx/cider/0.26/config/indentation.html
 > Alternative you can completely override the indentation logic of
 > clojure-mode and provide whatever implementation you want. CIDER
 > simply hooks into it and adds new indentation rules there
 > dynamically when connected.

To which Brunno Bonacci responded:

  > However, I still think that this ticket stands. Having the
  > possibility to configure the cljfmt indentation rules is a
  > nice-to-have feature.

Apply transform to constrain RBFKernel lengthscale in LCEMGP (#643)

Summary:
## Motivation

This adds a transform to `UniformPrior` in `LCEMGP` class to convert real values to constrained values in `[0, 2]`. Otherwise, with distribution validation enabled (which will be the default once https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48743 is merged), this throws an error in `Uniform.log_prob` method. We were facing this issue in an internal FB test that uses botorch.

While this fixes the specific issue, my thinking is that this transform should ideally be applied automatically within `gpytorch.priors`. That said, my understanding of the codebase is very limited, so would love to hear others' thoughts on this.

### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?

Yes

Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/pull/643

Test Plan:
Turned `Distribution.set_default_validate_args(True)` and succesffully ran `test_contextual_multioutput.py: ContextualMultiOutputTest.testLCEMGP` with a fixed seed and increased `maxiter` (this test fails without the fix).
