Create Strezless Musick Metadata

I'm really very much new to this and I've been trying to get cleared from spamming wiki by accident to be honest. I'm just an indie artist who always wanted to do music and though all odds seem to be against me by nature you guys would'nt believe the crazy life I've expirienced which I'm working on publishing and getting it distributed asap. I wanna leave a book on this earth before I go be in peace with my dear mom whom passed when I was fourteen years old. I'll apprecciate the help from any kind person who cares. Thank you and look out for Strezless Musick Productionz coming soon maybe. Bye now.

Drop support for Serverless Framework

It's been a pain in the ass to maintain, and since this is a hobby project I don't have the time nor energy to support a deployment target I no longer use.

This package exports everything you need to configure an Apollo server for whichever flavor of Apollo Server you like, so if you want to figure out how to deploy it directly to AWS you can. Personally, I'd recommend going with Netlify or Vercel functions as they take care a lot of the deployment headaches for you.

Major rewrite / Added 'JQuery' Branch.

    Alright, this commit as stated in the title is quite a transformation.
Unfortunately, after looking deeply into the issues with fetch() which
causes the React app to revert to default state, it is clear that React
is not the appropriate tool for the job. This is because we are not
building an interactive UI meant to manage a web-based tool.

    React is primarily intended to manage the appearance and data management
of the page due to user events generated by interacting with various items
on the page. When a call to fetch() is made, this forces a reload of the
page causing React to revert to default. Even when attempts are made to
'alter' the default state, the entire JS file is reloaded and executed
again from the beginning, making any change entirely ineffective. For
example, when data was sent to the server from the Submit page using a
'sendData()' function attached to a button, the default starting location
was set to SUBMIT. Because App.js is entirely reloaded and executed, however,
the default state is once again reset to HOME after the fetch() call
terminates. Turning the links in the <Topnav> components into clickable
text elements worked for changing the page, because they did not use a
fetch() in their eventListener, they simply changed the state without
forcing a reload, and thus we ran into the problem a little later.

    It is perhaps possible to use React to create this site, however
more advanced tools would be required to keep certain data persistent
through a page reload. This is overkill!

    The solution now is to simply inject some JS directly into the HTML
page to handle DOM changes. While React makes it very easy to synchronize
DOM changes in data and appearance, the situations that necessitate this
are not present in this site and its behaviors. Using a VERY popular library,
nearly considered an extension to JS, called JQuery, we can easily capture
any element in our DOM, which we can then alter in any way we desire. The
idea for searching the database is as follows:
    1. Use fetch() to ask the server for database info, sending our search
       criteria in the request.
    2. After fetch() completes, remove all rows in the results table, which
       may contain results from a previous search.
    3. Create a new <tr> for each result returned from the server, each
       containing the specific information for the entry.
    4. Add these <tr> elements to the table.

    The solution may not seem that advanced, but using React to do something
similar does not produce the same behavior under the hood. When a page reload
occurs, many React-generated JS scripts execute to rebuild the view of the
page, which results in the reset to default. When the page is reloaded here,
there is no JS whatsoever that does this, except for what we explicitly write.
Now, the page displays our results until we search something else or refresh the
page.

    I'd love to go into further detail, but sadly I am not entirely sure
what React is doing behind the scenes, or whether React is truly the problem.
This solution is both appropriate for the task, and much simpler to grasp.

Looks like it's Jquery for the win.

Anyway, the website is now divided into pages. The Submit page successfully
adds a record to the backend database. The Search By Name page now successfully
sends a "GET" request for a given name, and displays ALL results that contain
or match exactly to the text in the input field. Front-end / Back-end
communication is complete! All that is left now is to add fields of data
to display, and fields of data to add a new record. If we decide to make the
jump, the site can now sit on a public server and will perform as intended.
Most changes to the site now will mostly be cosmetic. New and smarter searches
may be added as well.

[ASTRIE] Added a new fortune: *** 176; 12021 H.E.

Your love is like a tidal wave, spinning over my head

Drownin' me in your promises, better left unsaid

You're the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasy

The invincible winner and you know that you were born to be

You're a heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker

Don't you mess around with me

You're a heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker

Don't you mess around, no, no, no

Your love has set my soul on fire, burnin' out of control

You taught me the ways of desire, now it's takin' its toll

You're the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasy

The invincible winner and you know that you were born to be

Specialize vault items some

Items that are going to be kept (artifacts and magic armor) have a much higher chance of special properties.

After the one-in-ten check for a random major property, a new 1-in-4 check is made for a themed property.
-Holy vault
--items are blessed
--may be made of silver or gold
--may give fire, cold, elect, or reflection.
--may have fire, cold, elect, holy, any alignment, wrathful, or vorpal damage

-Devil vault
--items are cursed
--may be made of gold or green steel
--may give fire, cold, elect, or magic resistance
--may have fire, cold, elect, unholy, axiomatic, life draining, or flaying damage

-Demon vault
--items are cursed
--may be made of gold or iron
--may give acid fire, cold, or magic resistance
--may have acid fire, cold, magic, unholy, anarchic, life draining, or flaying damage

Add wrathful, life draining, and living weapons to the list of generic special properties.

The assets are in, placed in and working, pathfinding is borked...

If I'm being entirely honest, I kinda didn't focus on this game too much had life in the way and other assessments (This isn't an excuse) I'm sorry but this is as much as I could do and I'll submit it regardless of its finish product. I thank everyone who still put effort towards the game especially the art team fantastic job! Programming was left to be desired... Thanks Jayden for doing most of the functionality I ended up doing the UI

Fix hasMessageAvailable return true but can't read message (#10414)

### Motivation

I temporarily fixed this problem in PR https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/10190.
Now we have found a better way, this way can avoid the seek, then avoid trigger another reconnection.
Thank you @codelipenghui  to troubleshoot this issue with me all night.

We have added a lot of log and found that this issue is caused by some race condition problems. Here is the first reason:
https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/f2d72c9fc13a33df584ec1bd96a4c147774b858d/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/ConsumerImpl.java#L1808-L1818
Now we have an acknowledgmentsGroupingTracker to filter duplicate messages, and this Tracker will be cleaned up after seek.

However, it is possible that the connection is ready and Broker has pushed message, but `acknowledgmentsGroupingTracker.flushAndClean(); ` has not been executed yet. 

Finally hasMessageAvailableAsync returns true, but the message cannot be read because it is filtered by the acknowledgmentsGroupingTracker


### Modifications
clean the tracker when connection was open

### Verifying this change


(cherry picked from commit f69a03b28d29689eaf910e0b99994fa250adb213)

Updating documentation/profiles a bit (#3)

* Make print sheet semi-transparent

[stewl[(https://forum.snapmaker.com/u/stewl) pointed out that the print sheet should be semi-transparent so you can see through it when looking from below the print bed. Drop the transparency down a bit to something that looks good when looking through the bottom.

* MatterHackers Build PETG Filaments

Didn't really change much from @mrworf's original PETG settings except the temperature and the color. These are still very much a work in progress, I haven't done any actual tuning yet, but they're working for the models I'm making.

* MatterHackers Build PETG Print Settings

Just my current print settings, note that I haven't done much physical tuning, I've mainly been just looking at the output of the slicer and seeing if it's what I want.

* Organization

Organizing filament/print/machine settings into some folders

* A350 configuration notes

* Remove color override

Removing the thumbnail color override

* Adding usage and contributing instructions

Adding some instructions for contributing such that we can share e.g. print/filament settings across devices (I don't need a A250 printer configs).
Also adding some instructions for using these configs, as I kinda had to figure it out myself.

* Fixing intro

This repo now supports multiple printers, fix the intro to reflect that.

* Add credit for stefix

He did all the hard work on this model, his legacy deserves credit.

* Fix link

didn't preview before saving....
