Revert "Do a big ol' banner every morning"

This was a half-cut commit. What was I even thinking? It's shit.

It's a total hack, too- it doesn't even show up in the commands list-
I even had to hack around displaying commands because it was so ill
thought out.

Instead, I've created a noddy little bot that prints an MOTD. Same
effect, and without compromising this project with a hidden command.

This reverts commit 29a3bfcbecc99a2ad3137bc6cf1d0ef079c26f72.

CPP: use all memory

I finally found a program that tested the limits of (d)cpp -- UltiMusE 3.
And boy, did it! I was able to get it working by adding a bunch of memory
pages to the initial reservation (for stack space), but that would cause
an unacceptable level of wasted stack space in the general case, meaning
fewer macros available to programmers, and I don't want that. I want to be
able to use as much stack as I need, _or_ use as many macros as I want.

It seemed like the OS-9 C architecture was conspiring to keep me from being
able to supply the best of both worlds, until I found ibrk().

In Unix (and OS-9) C the low-level memory allocator that forms the basis
for malloc() is sbrk() (short for "set break" which makes sense on old Unix
but nowhere else).

On OS-9, calling sbrk() with a positive number means you are asking for a
pointer to a memory location, and possibly requesting "new-to-you" memory
to be added to your process space. Once you run out of free space, sbrk()
fails and you don't get more memory. Meanwhile, your initial memory
allocation is used for your stack and pretty much _only_ your stack. Adding
more memory using the shell's #nnK stuff doesn't give C programs more
memory, it actually takes memory away from sbrk (and thus malloc), making
your program harder to run.

HOWEVER... ibrk() is able to come to the rescue. ibrk() works just like
sbrk(), only instead of requesting more memory from OS-9, it just doles
out pointers from within the initial allocation. This can suck too, because
you're passing out pointers to the same region of memory your stack comes
from, and that's usually pretty small, so it's not unlikely that you're
shooting yourself in the foot...

...unless you just ask for All The RAM in your initial allocation. So,
let's do that. We're using ibrk() to get our memory, and making the linker
give (d)cpp 40K of initial memory, shared between stack (which grows from
the top of memory) and heap (which grows from the bottom of memory). If
they meet, there will be a big boom, so try not to use lots and lots of
defines in very large programs?

Also, #ifdef out the odd-size memory request block -- it should only affect
word-addressed machines.

Hello

:octocat: Hi there! Thanks for visiting!

üéÅ Changelogs
normal
v3.0
v3.1
v3.2 latest
üå∏ Setup
This is step-by-step how to install these .files for automatic setup OpenboxWM custom environment.

Introduction of Linux Rice
Please read this and/or this.
Installation (dependencies)
Customize your choice about dependencies below, this is my complete setup as I use single OS, single OpenboxWM with my preference utility application. In fact, what is in the column is a minimal recommendation.

Detailed environment
Please refer to wiki/Detailed-Environment.

Warning!
This configuration is highly dependent to bash, sed, and coreutils.
Assume that you are using sudo or doas. Installation feels like LFS? üòÜ

Attention!

Rofi must be above version 1.6.x, so for Debian-based you may need to compile manually from source. - issue
If your Linux distribution repository only contains pure rxvt-unicode without patch for wide unicode and others, an example is on Arch Linux which provides pure rxvt-unicode and rxvt-unicode-patched version in the AUR repository. The problem is that the urxvt in the AUR hasn't been updated yet, and the link for the urxvt source-code for that version has been removed from the original link. Therefore, use rxvt-unicode from the main repo of each linux distribution that you use. Debian is different (already patched). - issue
You may want to use polkit-gnome instead of lxsession / lxpolkit. Because, currently the lxsession in Gentoo/Linux is really bad (dependency hell).
Debian & Ubuntu (and all based distributions)
sudo apt install rsync python psmisc x11-utils imagemagick ffmpeg wireless-tools openbox pulseaudio
alsa-utils brightnessctl nitrogen dunst tint2 gsimplecal rofi qt5-style-plugins lxpolkit xautolock
rxvt-unicode xclip scrot thunar thunar-archive-plugin thunar-volman ffmpegthumbnailer tumbler

oh-my-zsh & plugins optional
picom
obmenu-generator

Arch Linux (and all based distributions)
Make sure your AUR Helper is yay or paru.

yay -S rsync python psmisc xorg-xprop xorg-xwininfo imagemagick ffmpeg wireless_tools openbox 

pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa alsa-utils brightnessctl nitrogen dunst tint2 gsimplecal rofi 

qt5-styleplugins lxsession xautolock rxvt-unicode-patched xclip scrot thunar thunar-archive-plugin

neofetch w3m htop picom-git obmenu-generator gtk2-perl playerctl xsettingsd
oh-my-zsh & plugins optional

Another Linux Distribution

Optional: betterdiscord, geany + geany plugins, gimp, nano + nano syntax highlighting, neovim, spotify, termite, xfce4-power-manager.

Installation (dotfiles)
Are all directories required? ü§î
Please refer to wiki/Detailed-Environment.

Most of .files
You can clone or download as a archive. After that put all files in the dotfiles folder to user's home directory.

Assume you are cloning in the /Documents directory for example.

cd /Documents/ && git clone https://github.com/owl4ce/dotfiles.git
I recommend with rsync.

rsync -avxHAXP --exclude '.git*' --exclude 'LICENSE' --exclude '*.md' dotfiles/ ~/
Explanation

Options	Function
-a	all files, with permissions, etc..
-v	verbose, mention files
-x	stay on one file system
-H	preserve hard links (not included with -a)
-A	preserve ACLs/permissions (not included with -a)
-X	preserve extended attributes (not included with -a)
-P	show progress
--exclude	exclude files matching PATTERN
Differences

cp is for duplicating stuff and by default only ensures files have unique full path names.
rsync is for synchronising stuff and uses the size and timestamp of files to decide if they should be replaced. It has many more options and capabilities than cp.
I recommend to not deleting dotfiles folder after cloning from this repository, because to make upgrades easier. Read the update section.

Icons
Note
pushd is same as cd, but can return back to the first directory (checkpoint).

pushd ~/.icons/ &&
    tar -Jxvf Papirus-Custom.tar.xz && tar -Jxvf Papirus-Dark-Custom.tar.xz &&
    sudo ln -vs ~/.icons/Papirus-Custom /usr/share/icons/Papirus-Custom &&
    sudo ln -vs ~/.icons/Papirus-Dark-Custom /usr/share/icons/Papirus-Dark-Custom &&
popd
Why I need to link icons to user system resources? ü§î
That's needed by dunst in order to display most of icon from notification that spawned by application.

Refresh Font Cache
fc-cache -rv
Root Privileges with SUID
brightnessctl
others if needed
For brightnessctl, I recommend adding users to video group.

sudo chmod u+s $(command -v brightnessctl)
The step you are waiting for
The final step is login into openbox-session, basically login from display manager you use such as lightdm, gdm, etc.

Note
Make sure the sh symlinks to bash, as it's very dependent on bash.

[ "$(readlink /bin/sh)" != "bash" ] && sudo ln -vfs bash /bin/sh
If you are using ~/.xinitrc without display manager, simply add

Systemd Linux Distribution

exec openbox-session
Init-Freedom Linux Distribution

exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session openbox-session
Then you can proceed to user's configuration. Explore!

Additional
Suggested replacement commands

ls ‚ûú exa
~/.zshrc

...
134 alias ls="exa -lgh --icons --group-directories-first"
135 alias la="exa -lgha --icons --group-directories-first"

...

cat ‚ûú bat
Suggestion for tiling users



I recommend compiling it from source. Then put zentile binary your PATH, for example in ~/.local/bin/

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# To run in the background (detached)
zentile &!
To kill (or pkill)
killall zentile
" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: relative !important; margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(201, 209, 217); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji"; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(13, 17, 23); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">

# To run in the background (detached)

zentile &!

# To kill (or pkill)

killall zentile

Update
Since I recommend using rsync from start, the easiest way is to list the files that will not be updated to avoid changing personal files with files in this repository. First, update local repository with git repository.

Remember where you cloned this repository.
For example, from the start we assumed that it was in /Documents.

cd /Documents/ &&

pushd dotfiles/ && git pull && popd
Then list the files excluded by rsync (PATTERN). For example,
/Documents/owl4ce_drsyncexc

.git*

LICENSE

*.md

*.joy

BetterDiscord

geany

GIMP

gtk-3.0

config.conf

nvim

autostart

environment

tray

shared

sidebar

termite

Thunar

xfconf

.fonts

.nothing

.mpd

.gtkrc-2.0

.zshrc

.nanorc

.Xresources

.xsettingsd
Use find command to check PATTERN,

find dotfiles/ -iname 'PATTERN'
and whatever the file is. Next, of course is rsync.

rsync -avxHAXP --exclude-from /Documents/owl4ce_drsyncexc dotfiles/ /

User's Preferences required
/.owl4ce_var
Manage all your settings there. I hope all comments there are easy to understand. ^^

User's Tray Icons
/.config/openbox/tray
An example is turning on nm-applet, because by default I don't use it and use networkmanager_dmenu instead.

How about battery indicator?
Because on the tint2 panel I turned off battery status. Alternatively, install xfce4-power-manager and enable system tray icon in xfce4-power-manager-settings.

Remove hashtags for all your needs, then relogin openbox-session.

Warning! Putting a tray here means that when switching Visual Mode, the program will be restarted.

Audio Server optional
/.config/openbox/autostart

This is optional for Linux distributions that don't use systemd as their init, actually pulseaudio can be triggered from increasing-decreasing audio volume.
QT Themer (env var) optional
/.config/openbox/environment
This is optional if you're having issues like blind text with background from Mechanical Theme (Fleon GTK), as it basically uses plugins (QT5 to GTK2). Remove gtk2 after the equal sign, then relogin openbox-session.

üí¨
Widget? We don't do that here. My main philosophy in building this is as a minimal replacement for Desktop Environment without any desktop decoration e.g icons and widgets, but it can be adapted to taste of user with an overall theme based on one color palette and can be easily switched between Mechanical-Eyecandy. I admit, the downside is that it relies heavily on the GNU/Linux operating system since bashism is not POSIX-compliant to other shell. Most of the size of this repository is large due to wallpapers, icons, and git caches.Please don't underrate, I've configured them all since April 2020 and have been stuDYING them since October 2019. Awesome open-source. If you support it, star it or make a PR. Or if there is a problem with configuration (please check previous issues if any) you can make an issue here. Also if you want a discussion.Thank you!Feel free to modify.. under GPL-3.0Why openbox? Really a perfect next-gen window manager, easily configurable, and less resources usage.Openbox isn't dead, but completed features.

#### Monday 2021-06-21 10:29:33 by Œ£œÑŒ≠œÜŒ±ŒΩŒøœÇ "Coornio/8924th" ŒíŒªŒ±œÉœÑœåœÇ

It's been a long time coming.

Though not entirely done yet with the new featured addition, I reckoned it was a good time to save up the accumulated changes. Here we go! 

stdlib.cfg -- Addition of the keyboard hook variables, and modification of keyswitch to call upon a new function that will hijack keyboard input.

stdedit.cfg -- Removal of some useless vars, `entdirection` (the function called with R+scroll in edit)  can now rotate certain entities in all their possible directions based on the selected side of the entity's bounding box. Experimental `suncamangle`,  `suncamdist` and `sundir` UI, that's a WIP and on hold until I can learn to math.

defaults.cfg -- Fixed `vdirdelta` parameters on arrow keys, re-added the missing binds for BACKSPACE (not sure when/why those disappeared).

helpers.cfg -- `coswave` and `sinwave` were missing float operators, added those. Other coswave functions were modified to ensure the X value is always positive (countermeasure for millis overflowing to negative). The biggest change here is the *finally* fixed `vdirdelta` function. After a ton of trial and error, blood and tears over how "annoyingly" a certain face has flipped coordinates on only one axis, it now works flawlessly and one can at last offset or scroll a texture in the direction they want! Constricted by a fixed directional input no more! Also renamed a couple experimental UIs, and you'll also notice a function meant for translating. I will return to that in the future.

style.cfg -- Just some comments added.

lib.cfg -- This place is a bit of a mess at present.. the biggest additions being `UIadvancedfieldLA` and `UIadvancedfieldRA`, for left and right aligned text respectively. These new fields are practically fully configurable and look so much better than the `UIbasicfield` that was sparingly used thus far due to its scaling issues, lackluster interaction control and styling constraints. There's also  `.UI_KBreset` to init the new field's values, `.UI_KBinput` to handle the keyboard hijack behavior (configurable for more field types!!), `UIcaret` which is what its name implies and I need to make it local to the fields, it's useless outside of them, `UI_KBclose` which is a failsafe to kill a field's jack should the UI that it resided in goes away (still working on that).. Other changes include an OOB var for each UI (Out Of Bounds -- basically a glorified uihover check, might remove this after since it was an experiment) as well as a "shelf" var. That is used for situations where you might want to make some UI element *slide in*  ;-)  to view when you hover over a box. Used in the character profile UI, but uiclip restrictions kind of hold us back now as it won't clip in the -X and -Y directions BLEH. Last minor changes are the functions for the shelf behavior I just mentioned, the display value of sliders being *above* the slider line, the removal of `diagline` from the tooltipbox.. 

main.cfg -- Returned the button for player profile configuration and renamed it. Removed the entire segment on the right side of the menu that previously held an alt version of player-setup.cfg's contents. Added a call to define the `KBhook` UI at the end and start it up immediately. It is invisible and it only exists to allow left/right clicks outside of an actual UI to close an active field.

player_setup.cfg -- Bit of an overhaul. The weapon buttons now slide in from the bottom of the model preview. The name was supposed to slide in from the top, but due to the aforementioned issue with uiclip, it will instead always display right over the model preview. That part is a bit of a mess due to experiments with the fields, will be cleaned up in a followup commit. The loop for the color boxes was cleaned up just a bit. 

recorder.cfg -- Do not reset moview/movieh when the UI opens if a recording is still going on. 

server_browser.cfg -- Removed diagline call for an inline instead to avoid errors.

That's about it for now! More changes will follow as we go.

Update map.js

Attached is the most current gist file for the data hub map, and I'll make sure to update the Table of Availability. There is a meeting tomorrow that we'd love to have everything updated for if possible - do you think that would be do-able?

Switch IP query from dig to curl

For some reason the DNS approach wasn't working out on
WireGuard+Mullvad. Using curl/HTTP for this is all-around shittier
and less reliable, but such is life. This also makes the IPv4 and IPv6
config options always return the same thing as eachother, but I'm going
to leave them both in place anyways because this is a personal fork and
I want to keep my config largely compatible with the main repo.

rad push HedgeLib
ok skyth <3

So if you somehow didn't know, yes, I rewrote it again. For the last time this time. Seriously. I promise.

The decision to switch to C was made in a bad time in my life when I was in a really bad mental state and honestly it just didn't make any sense.
I just wanted something fresh and new to work on to help better distract me from stuff going on in my life at the time. That was the only reason I did it.

Problem was, it wasn't just a silly decision without a good reason behind it, it was an actively bad decision that actually added a ton of completely unnecessary coding work and slowed development down by a HUGE amount completely unnecessarily.
So I've rewritten it one final time in C++.

From here on out I intend to:
- ACTIVELY commit and push (aka "stop treating pushes as releases")
- NEVER rewrite HedgeLib again

I also plan to adopt a new style suggested by Skyth that's actually somewhat similar to C# HedgeLib while still allowing direct loading and such if you want to do that.
This style is already in-use in the new HH model/material/texture stuff and the HL scene stuff present in this commit.

The shader stuff in this commit is not yet in this style and will be changed to match it soon. I wasn't going to commit this all yet due to some things being unfinished like this, but skyth, death, and others highly encouraged me to do so as they rightfully pointed out I've been treating my commits as releases and need to stop doing that. It compiles. That's good enough for a commit (many projects don't even care about that!).
