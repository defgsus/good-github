v3.2 latest
üå∏ Setup
This is step-by-step how to install these .files for automatic setup OpenboxWM custom environment.

Introduction of Linux Rice
Please read this and/or this.
Installation (dependencies)
Customize your choice about dependencies below, this is my complete setup as I use single OS, single OpenboxWM with my preference utility application. In fact, what is in the column is a minimal recommendation.

Detailed environment
Please refer to wiki/Detailed-Environment.

Warning!
This configuration is highly dependent to bash, sed, and coreutils.
Assume that you are using sudo or doas. Installation feels like LFS? üòÜ

Attention!

Rofi must be above version 1.6.x, so for Debian-based you may need to compile manually from source. - issue
If your Linux distribution repository only contains pure rxvt-unicode without patch for wide unicode and others, an example is on Arch Linux which provides pure rxvt-unicode and rxvt-unicode-patched version in the AUR repository. The problem is that the urxvt in the AUR hasn't been updated yet, and the link for the urxvt source-code for that version has been removed from the original link. Therefore, use rxvt-unicode from the main repo of each linux distribution that you use. Debian is different (already patched). - issue
You may want to use polkit-gnome instead of lxsession / lxpolkit. Because, currently the lxsession in Gentoo/Linux is really bad (dependency hell).
Debian & Ubuntu (and all based distributions)
sudo apt install rsync python psmisc x11-utils imagemagick ffmpeg wireless-tools openbox pulseaudio
alsa-utils brightnessctl nitrogen dunst tint2 gsimplecal rofi qt5-style-plugins lxpolkit xautolock
rxvt-unicode xclip scrot thunar thunar-archive-plugin thunar-volman ffmpegthumbnailer tumbler

oh-my-zsh & plugins optional
picom
obmenu-generator

Arch Linux (and all based distributions)
Make sure your AUR Helper is yay or paru.

yay -S rsync python psmisc xorg-xprop xorg-xwininfo imagemagick ffmpeg wireless_tools openbox 

pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa alsa-utils brightnessctl nitrogen dunst tint2 gsimplecal rofi 

qt5-styleplugins lxsession xautolock rxvt-unicode-patched xclip scrot thunar thunar-archive-plugin 

thunar-volman ffmpegthumbnailer tumbler viewnior mpv mpd mpc ncmpcpp pavucontrol parcellite 

neofetch w3m htop picom-git obmenu-generator gtk2-perl playerctl xsettingsd
oh-my-zsh & plugins optional

Another Linux Distribution

Optional: betterdiscord, geany + geany plugins, gimp, nano + nano syntax highlighting, neovim, spotify, termite, xfce4-power-manager.

Installation (dotfiles)
Are all directories required? ü§î
Please refer to wiki/Detailed-Environment.

Most of .files
You can clone or download as a archive. After that put all files in the dotfiles folder to user's home directory.

Assume you are cloning in the /Documents directory for example.

cd /Documents/ && git clone https://github.com/owl4ce/dotfiles.git
I recommend with rsync.

rsync -avxHAXP --exclude '.git*' --exclude 'LICENSE' --exclude '*.md' dotfiles/ ~/
Explanation

Options	Function
-a	all files, with permissions, etc..
-v	verbose, mention files
-x	stay on one file system
-H	preserve hard links (not included with -a)
-A	preserve ACLs/permissions (not included with -a)
-X	preserve extended attributes (not included with -a)
-P	show progress
--exclude	exclude files matching PATTERN
Differences

cp is for duplicating stuff and by default only ensures files have unique full path names.
rsync is for synchronising stuff and uses the size and timestamp of files to decide if they should be replaced. It has many more options and capabilities than cp.
I recommend to not deleting dotfiles folder after cloning from this repository, because to make upgrades easier. Read the update section.

Icons
Note
pushd is same as cd, but can return back to the first directory (checkpoint).

pushd ~/.icons/ &&
    tar -Jxvf Papirus-Custom.tar.xz && tar -Jxvf Papirus-Dark-Custom.tar.xz &&
    sudo ln -vs ~/.icons/Papirus-Custom /usr/share/icons/Papirus-Custom &&
    sudo ln -vs ~/.icons/Papirus-Dark-Custom /usr/share/icons/Papirus-Dark-Custom &&
popd
Why I need to link icons to user system resources? ü§î
That's needed by dunst in order to display most of icon from notification that spawned by application.

Refresh Font Cache
fc-cache -rv
Root Privileges with SUID
brightnessctl
others if needed
For brightnessctl, I recommend adding users to video group.

sudo chmod u+s $(command -v brightnessctl)
The step you are waiting for
The final step is login into openbox-session, basically login from display manager you use such as lightdm, gdm, etc.

Note
Make sure the sh symlinks to bash, as it's very dependent on bash.

[ "$(readlink /bin/sh)" != "bash" ] && sudo ln -vfs bash /bin/sh
If you are using ~/.xinitrc without display manager, simply add

Systemd Linux Distribution

exec openbox-session
Init-Freedom Linux Distribution

exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session openbox-session
Then you can proceed to user's configuration. Explore!

Additional
Suggested replacement commands

ls ‚ûú exa
~/.zshrc

...
134 alias ls="exa -lgh --icons --group-directories-first"
135 alias la="exa -lgha --icons --group-directories-first"

...

cat ‚ûú bat
Suggestion for tiling users



I recommend compiling it from source. Then put zentile binary your PATH, for example in ~/.local/bin/

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# To run in the background (detached)
zentile &!
To kill (or pkill)
killall zentile
" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: relative !important; margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(201, 209, 217); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji"; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(13, 17, 23); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">

# To run in the background (detached)

zentile &!

# To kill (or pkill)

killall zentile

Update
Since I recommend using rsync from start, the easiest way is to list the files that will not be updated to avoid changing personal files with files in this repository. First, update local repository with git repository.

Remember where you cloned this repository.
For example, from the start we assumed that it was in /Documents.

cd /Documents/ &&

pushd dotfiles/ && git pull && popd
Then list the files excluded by rsync (PATTERN). For example,
/Documents/owl4ce_drsyncexc

.git*

LICENSE

*.md

*.joy

BetterDiscord

geany

GIMP

gtk-3.0

config.conf

nvim

autostart

environment

tray

.nothing

.mpd

.gtkrc-2.0

.zshrc

.nanorc

.Xresources

.xsettingsd
Use find command to check PATTERN,

find dotfiles/ -iname 'PATTERN'
and whatever the file is. Next, of course is rsync.

rsync -avxHAXP --exclude-from /Documents/owl4ce_drsyncexc dotfiles/ /

User's Tray Icons
/.config/openbox/tray
An example is turning on nm-applet, because by default I don't use it and use networkmanager_dmenu instead.

How about battery indicator?
Because on the tint2 panel I turned off battery status. Alternatively, install xfce4-power-manager and enable system tray icon in xfce4-power-manager-settings.

Remove hashtags for all your needs, then relogin openbox-session.

This is optional for Linux distributions that don't use systemd as their init, actually pulseaudio can be triggered from increasing-decreasing audio volume.
QT Themer (env var) optional
/.config/openbox/environment
This is optional if you're having issues like blind text with background from Mechanical Theme (Fleon GTK), as it basically uses plugins (QT5 to GTK2). Remove gtk2 after the equal sign, then relogin openbox-session.

Widget? We don't do that here. My main philosophy in building this is as a minimal replacement for Desktop Environment without any desktop decoration e.g icons and widgets, but it can be adapted to taste of user with an overall theme based on one color palette and can be easily switched between Mechanical-Eyecandy. I admit, the downside is that it relies heavily on the GNU/Linux operating system since bashism is not POSIX-compliant to other shell. Most of the size of this repository is large due to wallpapers, icons, and git caches.Please don't underrate, I've configured them all since April 2020 and have been stuDYING them since October 2019. Awesome open-source. If you support it, star it or make a PR. Or if there is a problem with configuration (please check previous issues if any) you can make an issue here. Also if you want a discussion.Thank you!Feel free to modify.. under GPL-3.0Why openbox? Really a perfect next-gen window manager, easily configurable, and less resources usage.Openbox isn't dead, but completed features.

bpf: do not change gso_size during bpf_skb_change_proto()

This is technically a backwards incompatible change in behaviour,
but I'm going to argue that it is very unlikely to break things,
and likely to fix *far* more then it breaks.

In no particular order, various reasons follow:

(a) I've long had a bug assigned to myself to debug a super rare kernel
crash on Android Pixel phones which can (per stacktrace) be traced back
to bpf clat ipv6 to ipv4 protocol conversion causing some sort of ugly
failure much later on during transmit deep in the GSO engine, AFAICT
precisely because of this change to gso_size, though I've never been able
to manually reproduce it.
I believe it may be related to the particular network offload support
of attached usb ethernet dongle being used for tethering off of an
IPv6-only cellular connection.  The reason might be we end up with more
segments than max permitted, or with a gso packet with only one segment...
(either way we break some assumption and hit a BUG_ON)

(b) There is no check that the gso_size is > 20 when reducing it by 20,
so we might end up with a negative (or underflowing) gso_size or
a gso_size of 0.  This can't possibly be good.
Indeed this is probably somehow exploitable (or at least can result
in a kernel crash) by delivering crafted packets and perhaps triggering
an infinite loop or a divide by zero...
As a reminder: gso_size (mss) is related to mtu, but not directly
derived from it: gso_size/mss may be significantly smaller then
one would get by deriving from local mtu.  And on some nics (which
do loose mtu checking on receive, it may even potentially be larger,
for example my work pc with 1500 mtu can receive 1520 byte frames
[and sometimes does due to bugs in a vendor plat46 implementation]).
Indeed even just going from 21 to 1 is potentially problematic because
it increases the number of segments by a factor of 21 (think DoS,
or some other crash due to too many segments).

(c) It's always safe to not increase the gso_size, because it doesn't
result in the max packet size increasing.  So the skb_increase_gso_size()
call was always unnecessary for correctness (and outright undesirable, see
later).  As such the only part which is potentially dangerous (ie. could
cause backwards compatibility issues) is the removal of the
skb_decrease_gso_size() call.

(d) If the packets are ultimately destined to the local device, then
there is absolutely no benefit to playing around with gso_size.
It only matters if the packets will egress the device.  ie. we're
either forwarding, or transmitting from the device.

(e) This logic only triggers for packets which are GSO.  It does not
trigger for skbs which are not GSO.  It will not convert a non-GSO mtu
sized packet into a GSO packet (and you don't even know what the mtu is,
so you can't even fix it).  As such your transmit path must *already* be
able to handle an mtu 20 bytes larger then your receive path (for ipv4
to ipv6 translation) - and indeed 28 bytes larger due to ipv4 fragments.
Thus removing the skb_decrease_gso_size() call doesn't actually increase
the size of the packets your transmit side must be able to handle.
ie. to handle non-GSO max-mtu packets, the ipv4/ipv6 device/route mtus
must already be set correctly.  Since for example with an ipv4 egress mtu
of 1500, ipv4 to ipv6 translation will already build 1520 byte ipv6 frames,
so you need a 1520 byte device mtu.  This means if your ipv6 device's
egress mtu is 1280, your ipv4 route must be 1260 (and actually 1252,
because of the need to handle fragments).  This is to handle normal non-GSO
packets.  Thus the reduction is simply not needed for GSO packets,
because when they're correctly built, they will already be the right size.

(f) TSO/GSO should be able to exactly undo GRO: the number of packets
(TCP segments) should not be modified, so that TCP's mss counting works
correctly (this matters for congestion control).
If protocol conversion changes the gso_size, then the number of TCP segments
may increase or decrease.  Packet loss after protocol conversion can result
in partial loss of mss segments that the sender sent.  How's the sending
TCP stack going to react to receiving ACKs/SACKs in the middle of the
segments it sent?

(g) skb_{decrease,increase}_gso_size() are already no-ops for GSO_BY_FRAGS
case (besides triggering WARN_ON_ONCE). This means you already cannot
guarantee that gso_size (and thus resulting packet mtu) is changed.
ie. you must assume it won't be changed.

(h) changing gso_size is outright buggy for UDP GSO packets, where framing
matters (I believe that's also the case for SCTP, but it's already excluded
by [g]).  So the only remaining case is TCP, which also doesn't want it
(see [f]).

(i) see also the reasoning on the previous attempt at fixing this
(commit fa7b83bf3b156c767f3e4a25bbf3817b08f3ff8e) which shows
that the current behaviour causes TCP packet loss:

  In the forwarding path GRO -> BPF 6 to 4 -> GSO for TCP traffic, the
  coalesced packet payload can be > MSS, but < MSS + 20.

  bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4() will upgrade the MSS and it can be > the payload
  length. After then tcp_gso_segment checks for the payload length if it
  is <= MSS. The condition is causing the packet to be dropped.

  tcp_gso_segment():
    [...]
    mss = skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size;
    if (unlikely(skb->len <= mss)) goto out;
    [...]

Thus changing the gso_size is simply a very bad idea.
Increasing is unnecessary and buggy, and decreasing can go negative.
