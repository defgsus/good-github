Adds Extrovert and Introvert Quirks (#56490)

Adds Extrovert and Introvert quirks. Removes the free bar moodlet, gives it to extroverts, makes a corresponding library moodlet for introverts. Introvert and Extrovert are blacklisted and therefore mutually exclusive.

Seems a bit thin, could we do x?
Yeah sure, and I'd appreciate feedback on where you'd like to see these quirks go. I want to start basic with "where do they spend their free time?" Rather than trying to do something big like moodlets for speaking a lot/little, especially because that seems a bit unbalanced and we already have a quirk that penalizes speech. I'm also looking to avoid unrealistic stereotypes, speech penalties to introverts are kind of unreasonable, introverts aren't inherently bad at talking, they just like alone time.

Why make it free?
I'm taking away a pre-existing moodlet that was free for everyone, also positive quirks are capped at 6 and I see this quirk as being essential to character building so I would prefer not to make someone pick between giving any sort of depth to their character and their powergaming loadout.

Having players define their character as introverted or extroverted and reinforcing the decision through gameplay mechanics is a great way to get them thinking about their character beyond an avatar to make other spacemen horizontal with. I'd argue that it is as foundational as decisions like gender, species, and age.
This opens up the library as a social space, as the two people who take introvert might occasionally run into each other when they are recovering mood and sanity there.

Created hallway, rigged up player functionality in that scene

Note to self, when making a scene where the player is just moving between them, just copy and paste the scene and edit from there. It's a pain in the ass to re-rig everything up from prefabs because it's easy to forget certain connections.

New data: 2021-01-30: DATA RECENTLY CHANGED. SEE NOTES.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

Revise historical data: cases (MB, ON, QC, SK); mortality (MB).

SK did not provide testing data today. They also did not update their usual daily case CSV.

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “The data also report 46 new deaths, for a total of 9,763. Among these 46 deaths, 14 have occurred in the last 24 hours, 23 have occurred between January 23 and January 28 and 9 have occurred before January 23.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

Finish printing a verse with and without highlighting.

1) static size_t characters_printed was introduced to allow printing
functions to update the value printed.

2) kjv_maximum_line_length() was relocated new kjv_current_line_length().

3) kjv_current_line_length() calculates the line being printed. This
function recognizes suppress_highlights.

4) kjv_output_verse() has been simplified.  word_length, line_length,
and next_length are calculated before being in if statements.

5) Example output are listed below:

5a) kjv 1 john 1:8-9 -b -d -w 45 produces the output below:

1 John 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us.

1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

5b) kjv 1 john 1:8-9 -b -w 45 produces the output below:

1 John

1:8	If we say that we have no sin, we
	deceive ourselves, and the truth
	is not in us.

1:9	If we confess our sins, he is
	faithful and just to forgive us
	our sins, and to cleanse us from

Born in garbage, lived in garbage, and will die in garbage, that's my projection for your miserable little life. See you in ten years when you're living out on the street. Piece of shit. I would love to meet such a wannabe male like yourself. You see, you aren't a 'real man.' You are just a pathetic little fake hiding in some rundown apartment spewing controversial crap on some random video on YouTube. Half the girls I know could wipe the floor with someone like you.

Support running as a rofi mode

A much requested feature was to be able to run `rofimoji` as a rofi
"mode". With this, you could, for example, have a combi mode with
different character sets.

However, rofi unfortunately (and sometimes understandably) limits the
features of its modes. The most annoying is that you cannot call
`xdotool` to type into another window. So with the mode, the best you
can do is to copy to the clipboard.
Secondly, all the custom shortcut mappings are gone, and we must use the
default ones which are not easy to remember.
Finally, selecting more than one character is also impossible.

Is it worth it? I'm not sure, but we can try.

Issue: #44

Correct issue with \cr\lf in `jsrReadFile`

Honestly getting pretty sick of Windows.
You see, Windows uses \cr\lf as default line endings in files, so, when
opening a file without specifying the `b` access mode, it does whatever
the fuck it wants and starts converting line feeds between unix-mode and
windows-mode messing up the file more often than not.
The real fun part is that the returned count of read bytes by `fwrite` is
not the same as the count returned by ftell(SEEK_END), causing all sorts of troubles.
I finally decided to slap the `b` access flag on all file accesses, and just deal with
stupid carriage returns rather than bugs in the file reading logic
caused by unsynchronized ftell/fread return values.
The more i program in C for Windows, the more it amazes me. And not in a
good way.

fixed about me

"I learned early on in my childhood the joys of how art and beauty bring to people. I constantly sought out new techniques to experiment with art. In the process of discovery, I grew through the struggles of failure and adaptation. College led to graphic design, where I learned the joy of storytelling, communication, and storytelling. Today, I continuously strive to create work that breaks away from fleeting trends to build a lasting design. I believe that effective communication is the most important aspect of any brand. This mission is united with my love for studying the language and drive of brands. In my free time, I visit art museums and daydream about Porsche 911 and Taycan. "

Fix #60

The simple fix for getting out of sync is to only display document
highlights if the cursor is found in any of the ranges. I avoided using
this because the spec doesn't say the cursor must be in one of the
ranges. However, from my personal experience it seems that this is the
case, if I turn out to be wrong, I'll revert this which will result in
things getting out of sync when doing shit like macros.

Merge #327

327: Prepare 0.5.11, removing linking to pre-built binaries. r=therealprof a=adamgreig

_I don't really like this. These semver hacks are getting out of hand and are mega cursed._

In https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/issues/288 it's reported that crates which use cortex-m 0.5 (such as our discovery book) have started to fail to build in some cases because of duplicate symbols such as `__cpsid` exported from the pre-built binaries.

It turns out in 0.5.10 we continue to link against a pre-built binary, but don't use it as the `asm` module is instead exported from `cortex_m_0_6` (i.e. 0.6.7, which itself exports it from 0.7.1).

What I don't understand is why this issue didn't appear before now, since it seems like 0.6.4 and below should have also exported these symbols and so should have also collided. I'd love some light on what's going on there.

This potential PR would release a 0.5.11 which just stops linking the pre-built binaries (and adds 0.5.9/10 to the changelog). I've tested that this change fixes the Discovery build, so it's one way we could fix this. Open to other, less cursed, suggestions too.
