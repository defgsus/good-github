WIP: Completely re-imagine the project

Okay, this is a doozie.

I kept thinking about the DEFINE-TREE macro and how much I hated it.
Its MASSIVE, the code is ugly, and its awkward to use.  I kept
thinking about how I wanted generic functions with static dispatch.
It would make DEFINE-TREE so much nicer!

Yeah, there are inline generic functions, but they suck.  They're
skin-deep!  Its so easy to find yourself in a situation where the
compiler doesn't have enough information to eliminate the type
dispatch.  E.g. introducing a helper function can easily break the
type information unless you're very careful.  Also, it inverts the
compile order.  The functions provided by DEFINE-TREE would need to be
compiled AFTER all tree types were defined.  Gross.

I really wished I had C++ templates, honestly.  That's not a thought I
ever thought I'd have!  I went down a rabbit hole of learning about
how exactly they work so I could model them in this project, but
ultimately I decided it was WAY overkill for my needs.

At the same time, I was thinking about how annoyed I was that uses of
generic functions were slipping in here and there just because it was
so awkward to do anything else.  For example, the ITERATOR-TOOLS
module had several calls to generic functions.  I wanted my
implementations of the data structures to be GF-free, but keeping it
that way was proving difficult.

I saw a way for these two problems to be solved at the same time.  If
DEFINE-TREE's functions took in something akin to a C++ vtable, then
they wouldn't need to call any GFs but would still be able to find the
right functions for traversing and manipulating the tree.  Neat!

Ah shoot, but that would lose the neat property of DEFINE-TREE where
all the function calls are completely static.  Vtable dispatch is
probably faster than a GF, but its not as nice as the static dispatch.

Okay, but that's where the idea of C++ templates come in.  What if I
could, on demand, create a "specialized" version of the DEFINE-TREE
functions that consulted a *specific* vtable instead of an arbitrary
one.  Then, a little compiler macro magic would be all it takes to
make the calls to vtable functions into static calls.  Neato!

At that point, why would I use GFs anywhere?  I could just pass
interface objects around and specialize the functions consuming them
as I see fit.

So that's what I did.

"11:25am. Tonight was hell. I barely slept due to all the anxiety; despite 12h in bed I am quite tired right now. On the plus side, I've really worked out the training loop. As it turns out, I am going to have to train the value-action networks differently from the policy net. L1 losses and frequency based sampling are not the right thing for it. L2 and uniform sampling is what is right. This gives me extra complications, but I am used to this by now.

11:30am. ML training really is like a compiler pass. Lucky me that my skills in this are top notch.

And my understanding of ML is good enough that I can inovate on my own.

I still don't understand deep CFR though. So I am basing my design decisions off SARSA and what I've read in the papers by Lanctot near the end of 2019.

I'll see how it goes.

11:35am. Let me chill and then I will get started with the Python videos.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pliF6TkDpxk
Python Top GUI Frameworks For 2020 | Introduction & Installation

I've watched this yesterday, and I see that there are a lot of Python UI videos on Youtube. I should watch some of them and play around. That will be my mission for the day. Also I found out that Python has async/await. I am going to have to extend the language to handle those features. They are not a priority at the moment though.

1:05pm. Done with breakfast and chores.

https://youtu.be/YXPyB4XeYLA?t=970

I about 16m of this during the break. I do not like the Tk stuff. When I did the Lithe library in F#, I had a lot of trouble making things functional with the Gtk library.

I was confused whether Tkinter had anything to do with the Gtk library, but seeing how root is passed into the controls as an argument, I am starting to think that yes, it does.

I should try it out. If the controls can be created without passing in the parent, then I am wrong. But in the F# library they had to be due API limitations.

In the videos that I watched yesterday Kivy stood out to me so I might want to go for that instead.

1:35pm. Let me start the day. Let me move to a PyQt video. Then I'll check out Kivy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrEVihl-E4
Introduction to GUIs in Python with PyQt5

2:05pm. The PyQt video was interesting.

I really should try out the Tkinter example just to make sure that my bias is right.

2:25pm. Had to take a break. Let me resume.

```py
from tkinter import *
root = Tk()
myLabel1 = Label(text="Hello World!")
myLabel2 = Label(text="My name is mrakgr!")

myLabel1.grid(row=0,column=0)
myLabel2.grid(row=1,column=0)
myLabel1.master = root
myLabel2.master = root

root.mainloop()
```

Before I left, I tried this and it works. Honestly, I am not sure what to think. I do not remember what the problems with Gtk were exactly.

https://dev.to/amigosmaker/python-gui-pyqt-vs-tkinter-5hdd

> Tkinter can indeed be useful for those that want to design a fundamental and rapid GUIs for Python scripts, yet for a more advanced programming result, almost all programmers opt for the functionalities that come with PyQt.

> They admit it is worth mastering the advanced knowledge of PyQt due to the professional programming results that come along.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a6yj5g/pyqt_vs_tkinter/

PyQt seems to have more mindshare. Ok.

PyQt5 Python 3 Tutorial

Before I dive into this, let me check out wx and Kiva.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/3pif4k/tkinter_vs_pyqt_vs_wxpython/

Hmmm...

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1FgJUcJJ03vIgXI9BvOBdoc0S3PuzcRb
Wxpython GUI Programming

Ah, whatever. Let me start with these vids.

2:50pm. Ok, this is worth going through on fast forward. I am going to mash that right button and check out all of these. After that I'll just pick one and roll with it.

...The connection broke. Let me reset the router.

2:55pm. It is taking it forever to restart.

Let me restart the PC.

3pm. Holy shit, it is still down. This sometimes happens, but usually it comes back right away.

...Let me try restarting it again. At this point I have no choice but to kee pdoing that until the connection unscrews itself. I am not sure why this sometimes happens? Is the router firmware being crap? Who knows.

3:05pm. The router light seem to be fine, but I still do not have access to it.

Agh, what the hell? How am I supposed to get anything done like this.

3:10pm. I've switched the connection from wifi to the slower terrestrial one. And it is back. I actually forgot about this until my father reminded me. Probably the Internet budget ran out and I got cut off.

Let me finally resume. This waste 20m of my time.

https://youtu.be/yw9j5VpXaXI?list=PL1FgJUcJJ03vIgXI9BvOBdoc0S3PuzcRb&t=218

I really hate how he creates a new class for everything. This is OO at its worst.

https://youtu.be/Lzca_iUo7RY?list=PL1FgJUcJJ03vIgXI9BvOBdoc0S3PuzcRb&t=387

OO at its worst. I am not sure whether wx is supposed to be used like this, or if it is just the author of this video hacking things through.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ8PTCcU3J0
Python GUI Crash Course [ PyQt5, wxPython, Kivy, TKinter, Pyside2 ]

Let me check out the Kivy course by this guy and I'll contrast it with the other one.

https://youtu.be/YJ8PTCcU3J0?t=17888

I'll admit, this library does look the most interesting out of all of them. I am going to give Kivy a try first.

3:35pm. https://youtu.be/YJ8PTCcU3J0?t=18368

So it not just his style. Kivy is more functional as a library. He also showed briefly that unlike Tkinter it has proper layout controls instead of just calling pack or grid. Yeah, I am leaning toward Kivy. Let me just Google reactive Python on the side.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+reactive+programming

It has a bunch of stuff. Ok, good. I will need this.

Without Hopac, I won't have channels, but even in the Spiral editor support I only ever use them in one place and they are replaceable there. I did a large amount of thinking and ended up completely just using promises and their streams for everything instead.

Python has many flaws, Cython has many flaws, but none of those matter to me. The one thing it did get right is having reference counting. Even if it did not get even that right, RC alone is enough to set it apart as being suitable for ML.

Let me resume the Kivy course.

3:55pm. Ok, enough of this guy. I'll pick Kivy and stick with it unless I get a good reason to do otherwise.

Let me check out the PyRx videos.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD9LmtMpjeo
Introduction to Reactive Programming with RxPY

Let me watch this and some others. After that I'll install Kivy and start playing with this. I am going to bring all of this together.

https://youtu.be/yD9LmtMpjeo?t=1009

Getting familiar with PyRx will allow me to get familiar with Python concurrency in general. I would not be surprised if there is a scheduler for Kivy in there somewhere.

4:55pm. Had to leave for lunch. It was unexpected early today.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kXaLh8Fz3k
John Reese - Thinking Outside the GIL with AsyncIO and Multiprocessing - PyCon 2018

Youtube shown me this on the sidebar and it seems interesting.

But first let me finish those Rx videos. I am right pressing through them as they are so basic so I am making swift progress.

5pm. Done with the basic vid. Let me take a look at the course I linked to.

https://youtu.be/tZZJCsncbbk?list=PL1A418Fn3fORAnrEIwMiP04vsLzzusEjK&t=45

This definitely seems interesting.

Let me go for it.

5:35pm. I seem to be taking breaks often today. Let me resume.

5:45pm. Forget the course. I've seen enough of it. Let me watch the talk by John Reese.

6:20pm. I seem to be surfing /g/ on the side more than I am listening to the talk. Well that was only for the last 5m of it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLkfnc_UMcE
Nathaniel J. Smith - Trio: Async concurrency for mere mortals - PyCon 2018

Let me watch this one last.

Now that I am Googling youtube vids for Python concurrency, I see that there is a 3h one on the top of the page.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18B1pznaU1o
Tutorial: Santiago Basulto - Python Concurrency: from beginner to pro

I'll leave this for later.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y408pjAoxes
Trio: Structured Concurrency for Python

Actually, let me go for this more recent talk.

Tonight was hell, but the day was pretty leisurely. Tomorrow will be similar. I will install Kivy the first thing and start grinding away at it. I'll write Spiral bindings for it and Rx, and integrate the two into one whole.

Then I will implement some of the games in it. Being able to play against the agents is a goal I will strive to reach.

6:50pm. https://youtu.be/y408pjAoxes?t=1144

Handling of exceptions was one of the issues for me with Hopac. I wonder what Trio's solution for this will be.

7:30pm. Let me stop here for the day.

Today was educational. It has been a while since I spent the day just watching vids.

Tomorrow I will be playing around with Kivy and try writing bindings for it in Spiral. I am not sure whether I will manage to get to the point of implementing all of the Elm pattern, but it won't take me too long to get a handle on it.

After that is done, I'll get back to the game and tie it together. After that I'll get back to ML in earnest."

drivers: convert shrinkers to new count/scan API

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Convert the driver shrinkers to the new API. Most changes are
compile tested only because I either don't have the hardware or it's
staging stuff.

FWIW, the md and android code is pretty good, but the rest of it
makes me want to claw my eyes out.  The amount of broken code I just
encountered is mind boggling.  I've added comments explaining what
is broken, but I fear that some of the code would be best dealt with
by being dragged behind the bike shed, burying in mud up to it's
neck and then run over repeatedly with a blunt lawn mower.

Special mention goes to the zcache/zcache2 drivers. They can't
co-exist in the build at the same time, they are under different
menu options in menuconfig, they only show up when you've got the
right set of mm subsystem options configured and so even compile
testing is an exercise in pulling teeth.  And that doesn't even take
into account the horrible, broken code...
