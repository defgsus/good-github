New data: 2021-02-22: See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (BC, MB, ON, SK).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “11 new deaths, for a total of deaths of 10,318: 2 deaths in the last 24 hours, 9 deaths between February 15 and February 20.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

Grammar, spelling, etc.

Grammar, spelling, etc. I'd love to help more. I was looking for the android app code to fix up some of the interface issues. If someone can point me to that I'd be happy to help.

I think Kardia/Kai has a bright future and I'm very interested in helping however I can. This is just to get started and introduce myself. I'd like to be involved as much as I can.

Added fucking fuck aquifer link gotten from the fucking government which hasnt been functioning since these idiots staged an economic recession years ago.

as they are doing now while explaining all the people that would have died of old fucking age during this time period.

anyway.

fun fun.

so the elevation files would take wayyyyy more space than i presently have available.

so, water, food stores, a weather source, i need a uv index average, roadways, elevation, ground cover, presence of harmful species etc.

supposedly there are sensed ground cover data that can also be gotten from the government i mourn like an italian widow mourns their dead mafia slain goddamn husband.

#### Tuesday 2021-02-23 04:40:47 by Nicolas Williams

asn1: X.681/682/683 magic handling of open types

Status:

 - And it works!

 - We have an extensive test based on decoding a rich EK certficate.

   This test exercises all of:

    - decoding
    - encoding with and without decoded open types
    - copying of decoded values with decoded open types
    - freeing of decoded values with decoded open types

   Valgrind finds no memory errors.

 - Added a manual page for the compiler.

 - rfc2459.asn1 now has all three primary PKIX types that we care about
   defined as in RFC5912, with IOS constraints and parameterization:

    - `Extension`       (embeds open type in an `OCTET STRING`)
    - `OtherName`       (embeds open type in an        `ANY`-like type)
    - `SingleAttribute` (embeds open type in an        `ANY`-like type)
    - `AttributeSet`    (embeds open type in a  `SET OF ANY`-like type)

   All of these use OIDs as the open type type ID field, but integer
   open type type ID fields are also supported (and needed, for
   Kerberos).

   That will cover every typed hole pattern in all our ASN.1 modules.

   With this we'll be able to automatically and recursively decode
   through all subject DN attributes even when the subject DN is a
   directoryName SAN, and subjectDirectoryAttributes, and all
   extensions, and all SANs, and all authorization-data elements, and
   PA-data, and...

   We're not really using `SingleAttribute` and `AttributeSet` yet
   because various changes are needed in `lib/hx509` for that.

 - `asn1_compile` builds and recognizes the subset of X.681/682/683 that
   we need for, and now use in, rfc2459.asn1.  It builds the necessary
   AST, generates the correct C types, and generates templating for
   object sets and open types!

 - See READMEs for details.

 - Codegen backend not tested; I won't make it implement automatic open
   type handling, but it should at least not crash by substituting
   `heim_any` for open types not embedded in `OCTET STRING`.

 - We're _really_ starting to have problems with the ITU-T ASN.1
   grammar and our version of it...

   Type names have to start with upper-case, value names with
   lower-case, but it's not enough to disambiguate.

   The fact the we've allowed value and type names to violate their
   respective start-with case rules is causing us trouble now that we're
   adding grammar from X.681/682/683, and we're going to have to undo
   that.

   In preparation for that I'm capitalizing the `heim_any` and
   `heim_any_set` types, and doing some additional cleanup, which
   requires changes to other parts of Heimdal (all in this same commit
   for now).

   Problems we have because of this:

    - We cannot IMPORT values into modules because we have no idea if a
      symbol being imported refers to a value or a type because the only
      clue we would have is the symbol's name, so we assume IMPORTed
      symbols are for types.

      This means we can't import OIDs, for example, which is super
      annoying.

      One thing we might be able to do here is mark imported symbols as
      being of an undetermined-but-not-undefined type, then coerce the
      symbol's type the first time it's used in a context where its type
      is inferred as type, value, object, object set, or class.  (Though
      since we don't generate C symbols for objects or classes, we won't
      be able to import them, especially since we need to know them at
      compile time and cannot defer their handling to link- or
      run-time.)

    - The `NULL` type name, and the `NULL` value name now cause two
      reduce/reduce conflicts via the `FieldSetting` production.

    - Various shift/reduce conflicts involving `NULL` values in
      non-top-level contexts (in constraints, for example).

 - Currently I have a bug where to disambiguate the grammar I have a
   CLASS_IDENTIFIER token that is all caps, while TYPE_IDENTIFIER must
   start with a capital but not be all caps, but this breaks Kerberos
   since all its types are all capitalized -- oof!

   To fix this I made it so class names have to be all caps and
   start with an underscore (ick).

TBD:

 - Sort object sets, and binary search them in _asn1_decode_open_type().
 - Check all the XXX comments and address them
 - Apply this treatment to Kerberos!  Automatic handling of authz-data
   sounds useful :)
 - Apply this treatment to PKCS#10 (CSRs) and other ASN.1 modules too.
 - Replace various bits of code in `lib/hx509/` with uses of this
   feature.
 - Add JER.
 - Enhance `hxtool` and `asn1_print`.

Getting there!

Make it reasonable

So I started this as a joke to poke fun at the horrible things people do
to Java. In reality I really respect Java and honestly the Spring
webflux stuff is cool as heck.

I'm keeping the ridiculous version in a branch but honestly I'm going to
just make this a "real" app and less of a performance art piece.

chore(emacs): remove configuration

I really wanted to make it work, because .org is amazing, and the
plugin system is fairly more advanced, but the truth is, I can't get
used to how slow it feels, and how brittle package interactions can be.

I did love the fact that you could do litterate programming, and some of
the niceties around prose writing, but that wasn't enough for me.

##### What's Changed

-   What `1984` means to you? To us, this number means PR [#&#8203;1984](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/1984), one of the oldest PRs we had open and... finally merged! 😅 Thanks to an amazing contribution by [@&#8203;seglo](https://togithub.com/seglo), we now provide an example of testing Kafka clusters where multiple `KafkaContainer`s are connected into one network. Try it!
-   Another "old" PR is [#&#8203;3180](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3180) by [@&#8203;oussamabadr](https://togithub.com/oussamabadr). Those of you who run Selenium tests with Testcontainers will appreciate this newly added option to use (scrollable!) MP4 format instead of FLV.
-   The connection with Ryuk (our watchdog sidecar container) now sets the socket timeout and retries the failures - helps with some rare networking edge cases. ([#&#8203;3682](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3682)) [@&#8203;diegolovison](https://togithub.com/diegolovison)
-   The logs consumer no longer adds extra new lines thanks to [#&#8203;3752](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3752) by [@&#8203;perlun](https://togithub.com/perlun)

#### Tuesday 2021-02-23 18:38:50 by Marko Grdinić

"11:25am. Tonight was hell. I barely slept due to all the anxiety; despite 12h in bed I am quite tired right now. On the plus side, I've really worked out the training loop. As it turns out, I am going to have to train the value-action networks differently from the policy net. L1 losses and frequency based sampling are not the right thing for it. L2 and uniform sampling is what is right. This gives me extra complications, but I am used to this by now.

11:30am. ML training really is like a compiler pass. Lucky me that my skills in this are top notch.

And my understanding of ML is good enough that I can inovate on my own.

I still don't understand deep CFR though. So I am basing my design decisions off SARSA and what I've read in the papers by Lanctot near the end of 2019.

I'll see how it goes.

11:35am. Let me chill and then I will get started with the Python videos.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pliF6TkDpxk
Python Top GUI Frameworks For 2020 | Introduction & Installation

I've watched this yesterday, and I see that there are a lot of Python UI videos on Youtube. I should watch some of them and play around. That will be my mission for the day. Also I found out that Python has async/await. I am going to have to extend the language to handle those features. They are not a priority at the moment though.

1:05pm. Done with breakfast and chores.

https://youtu.be/YXPyB4XeYLA?t=970

I about 16m of this during the break. I do not like the Tk stuff. When I did the Lithe library in F#, I had a lot of trouble making things functional with the Gtk library.

I was confused whether Tkinter had anything to do with the Gtk library, but seeing how root is passed into the controls as an argument, I am starting to think that yes, it does.

I should try it out. If the controls can be created without passing in the parent, then I am wrong. But in the F# library they had to be due API limitations.

In the videos that I watched yesterday Kivy stood out to me so I might want to go for that instead.

1:35pm. Let me start the day. Let me move to a PyQt video. Then I'll check out Kivy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrEVihl-E4
Introduction to GUIs in Python with PyQt5

2:05pm. The PyQt video was interesting.

I really should try out the Tkinter example just to make sure that my bias is right.

2:25pm. Had to take a break. Let me resume.

```py
from tkinter import *
root = Tk()
myLabel1 = Label(text="Hello World!")
myLabel2 = Label(text="My name is mrakgr!")

myLabel1.grid(row=0,column=0)
myLabel2.grid(row=1,column=0)
myLabel1.master = root
myLabel2.master = root

root.mainloop()
```

Before I left, I tried this and it works. Honestly, I am not sure what to think. I do not remember what the problems with Gtk were exactly.

https://dev.to/amigosmaker/python-gui-pyqt-vs-tkinter-5hdd

> Tkinter can indeed be useful for those that want to design a fundamental and rapid GUIs for Python scripts, yet for a more advanced programming result, almost all programmers opt for the functionalities that come with PyQt.

> They admit it is worth mastering the advanced knowledge of PyQt due to the professional programming results that come along.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a6yj5g/pyqt_vs_tkinter/

PyQt seems to have more mindshare. Ok.

PyQt5 Python 3 Tutorial

Before I dive into this, let me check out wx and Kiva.

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/3pif4k/tkinter_vs_pyqt_vs_wxpython/

Hmmm...

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1FgJUcJJ03vIgXI9BvOBdoc0S3PuzcRb
Wxpython GUI Programming

Ah, whatever. Let me start with these vids.

2:50pm. Ok, this is worth going through on fast forward. I am going to mash that right button and check out all of these. After that I'll just pick one and roll with it.

...The connection broke. Let me reset the router.

2:55pm. It is taking it forever to restart.

Let me restart the PC.

3pm. Holy shit, it is still down. This sometimes happens, but usually it comes back right away.

...Let me try restarting it again. At this point I have no choice but to kee pdoing that until the connection unscrews itself. I am not sure why this sometimes happens? Is the router firmware being crap? Who knows.

3:05pm. The router light seem to be fine, but I still do not have access to it.

Agh, what the hell? How am I supposed to get anything done like this.

3:10pm. I've switched the connection from wifi to the slower terrestrial one. And it is back. I actually forgot about this until my father reminded me. Probably the Internet budget ran out and I got cut off.

Let me finally resume. This waste 20m of my time.

https://youtu.be/yw9j5VpXaXI?list=PL1FgJUcJJ03vIgXI9BvOBdoc0S3PuzcRb&t=218

I really hate how he creates a new class for everything. This is OO at its worst.

https://youtu.be/Lzca_iUo7RY?list=PL1FgJUcJJ03vIgXI9BvOBdoc0S3PuzcRb&t=387

OO at its worst. I am not sure whether wx is supposed to be used like this, or if it is just the author of this video hacking things through.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ8PTCcU3J0
Python GUI Crash Course [ PyQt5, wxPython, Kivy, TKinter, Pyside2 ]

Let me check out the Kivy course by this guy and I'll contrast it with the other one.

https://youtu.be/YJ8PTCcU3J0?t=17888

I'll admit, this library does look the most interesting out of all of them. I am going to give Kivy a try first.

3:35pm. https://youtu.be/YJ8PTCcU3J0?t=18368

So it not just his style. Kivy is more functional as a library. He also showed briefly that unlike Tkinter it has proper layout controls instead of just calling pack or grid. Yeah, I am leaning toward Kivy. Let me just Google reactive Python on the side.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+reactive+programming

It has a bunch of stuff. Ok, good. I will need this.

Without Hopac, I won't have channels, but even in the Spiral editor support I only ever use them in one place and they are replaceable there. I did a large amount of thinking and ended up completely just using promises and their streams for everything instead.

Python has many flaws, Cython has many flaws, but none of those matter to me. The one thing it did get right is having reference counting. Even if it did not get even that right, RC alone is enough to set it apart as being suitable for ML.

Let me resume the Kivy course.

3:55pm. Ok, enough of this guy. I'll pick Kivy and stick with it unless I get a good reason to do otherwise.

Let me check out the PyRx videos.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD9LmtMpjeo
Introduction to Reactive Programming with RxPY

Let me watch this and some others. After that I'll install Kivy and start playing with this. I am going to bring all of this together.

https://youtu.be/yD9LmtMpjeo?t=1009

Getting familiar with PyRx will allow me to get familiar with Python concurrency in general. I would not be surprised if there is a scheduler for Kivy in there somewhere.

John Reese - Thinking Outside the GIL with AsyncIO and Multiprocessing - PyCon 2018

Youtube shown me this on the sidebar and it seems interesting.

But first let me finish those Rx videos. I am right pressing through them as they are so basic so I am making swift progress.

5pm. Done with the basic vid. Let me take a look at the course I linked to.

https://youtu.be/tZZJCsncbbk?list=PL1A418Fn3fORAnrEIwMiP04vsLzzusEjK&t=45

This definitely seems interesting.

Let me go for it.

5:35pm. I seem to be taking breaks often today. Let me resume.

5:45pm. Forget the course. I've seen enough of it. Let me watch the talk by John Reese.

6:20pm. I seem to be surfing /g/ on the side more than I am listening to the talk. Well that was only for the last 5m of it.

Trio: Structured Concurrency for Python

Actually, let me go for this more recent talk.

Tonight was hell, but the day was pretty leisurely. Tomorrow will be similar. I will install Kivy the first thing and start grinding away at it. I'll write Spiral bindings for it and Rx, and integrate the two into one whole.

Then I will implement some of the games in it. Being able to play against the agents is a goal I will strive to reach.

6:50pm. https://youtu.be/y408pjAoxes?t=1144

Handling of exceptions was one of the issues for me with Hopac. I wonder what Trio's solution for this will be.

7:30pm. Let me stop here for the day.

Today was educational. It has been a while since I spent the day just watching vids.

Tomorrow I will be playing around with Kivy and try writing bindings for it in Spiral. I am not sure whether I will manage to get to the point of implementing all of the Elm pattern, but it won't take me too long to get a handle on it.

After that is done, I'll get back to the game and tie it together. After that I'll get back to ML in earnest."
