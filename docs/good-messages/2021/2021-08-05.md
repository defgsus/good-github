Continue wild-ass guessing to try to make the browser use a proxy

...but continue making the OS (and other apps) go direct, because
if we don't do that, then we have to fiddle-fuck around making that
proxy exist on the enrollment network, or we can't do policy updates.

x86_64: expand kernel stack to 16K

While I play inhouse patches with much memory pressure on qemu-kvm,
3.14 kernel was randomly crashed. The reason was kernel stack overflow.

When I investigated the problem, the callstack was a little bit deeper
by involve with reclaim functions but not direct reclaim path.

I tried to diet stack size of some functions related with alloc/reclaim
so did a hundred of byte but overflow was't disappeard so that I encounter
overflow by another deeper callstack on reclaim/allocator path.

Of course, we might sweep every sites we have found for reducing
stack usage but I'm not sure how long it saves the world(surely,
lots of developer start to add nice features which will use stack
agains) and if we consider another more complex feature in I/O layer
and/or reclaim path, it might be better to increase stack size(
meanwhile, stack usage on 64bit machine was doubled compared to 32bit
while it have sticked to 8K. Hmm, it's not a fair to me and arm64
already expaned to 16K. )

So, my stupid idea is just let's expand stack size and keep an eye
toward stack consumption on each kernel functions via stacktrace of ftrace.
For example, we can have a bar like that each funcion shouldn't exceed 200K
and emit the warning when some function consumes more in runtime.
Of course, it could make false positive but at least, it could make a
chance to think over it.

I guess this topic was discussed several time so there might be
strong reason not to increase kernel stack size on x86_64, for me not
knowing so Ccing x86_64 maintainers, other MM guys and virtio
maintainers.

Here's an example call trace using up the kernel stack:

[ Note: the problem is exacerbated by certain gcc versions that seem to
  generate much bigger stack frames due to apparently bad coalescing of
  temporaries and generating too many spills.  Rusty saw gcc-4.6.4 using
  35% more stack on the virtio path than 4.8.2 does, for example.

  Minchan not only uses such a bad gcc version (4.6.3 in his case), but
  some of the stack use is due to debugging (CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is
  what causes that kernel_map_pages() frame, for example). But we're
  clearly getting too close.

  The VM code also seems to have excessive stack frames partly for the
  same compiler reason, triggered by excessive inlining and lots of
  function arguments.

  We need to improve on our stack use, but in the meantime let's do this
  simple stack increase too.  Unlike most earlier reports, there is
  nothing simple that stands out as being really horribly wrong here,
  apart from the fact that the stack frames are just bigger than they
  should need to be.        - Linus ]

that xD Never XD Ok, not gonna lie - will probably tottaly forget to
split that in multiple commits that make more sense - or, if I'm beeing
honest, that make any sense at all, so... Good luck future me looking at

gave up on making sheet auto save on disappear. issue was that ".onDisappear" would trigger every time you tapped on a picker since each picker was its own page. So if I tried to have it save and reload onDisappear then you wouldn't be able to use the pickers. Ended up going with Apple's solution in the Clock app, which is to add a save button on the sheet. Pickers and Save button all should be working, will look for more bugs later. Fun fact on the origins of this solution: I wanted to make this app so that I could write down my massive list of shows and movies I gotta watch, rather than going Steve Rogers style and writing it in a little notebook (or in my current case, the iOS notes app). So I put it all together except for the final piece, getting the save on disappear to work, which I really wanted to get done. But after a few days of just trying everything I could think of, and searching online, I was setting my morning alarm when I noticed even apple uses the save navigation bar button. So instead of going to bed, here I am a few hours later having decided to pull an all nighter and just get this app done. Might have taken a bit longer tonight than it should have, since I'm watching superman: man of tomorrow right now. It's actually really good. Originally I was sad that they were switching art styles, cause I LOVE the ones from Justice League: War and that whole movie DCAU, but after giving man of tomorrow a shot, I'm not too against it. Of course, its not as good as the old style imo, but its kinda Invincible-y and they story of this movie is pretty sweet and wholesome. Would recommend :)

 According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

Update README.md

Gave a much needed lift to the README for the master debacle change.
Remember the hundred of thousands of whites who died in Americas little civil war. Where's the rewards for those dencendants? And the appropiate triggers and all that?

Here's a little fact of reality: You alone is responsible for your actions and the future, relying on people who are dead for clout is fucking pathethic. No excuses. If you want to join civilization, act civilized. It's that simple. If I spent all day making excuses I'd get nothing done, exactly like you.

TT | 3471 | "Introduce allow-list and disallow-list for blocks."

This is meant to be treated as a request for comments.

I haven't spent a lot of time trying to document everything yet. I did spend some time writing type declarations in JSDoc until my comments ended up becoming larger than the actual implementation itself to which I started to question the value at that point. I can include them if it makes sense to do so.

The general idea behind this work is that there is a desire to allow the Gutenberg Block Editor to restrict the block types it offers in various contexts it is presented in to the customer.

The changes found here should, in theory, only impact the blocks presented in the block picker, and not affect the blocks displayed within the editor if someone were to manually modify the markup.

The "requirements" that I thought seemed reasonable to me would be:

+ If you pass in neither an allow list nor a disallow list, then proceed by using all core blocks.
+ If you pass in an allow list, and not a disallow list, then proceed by only including what is in the allow list from the entire set of core blocks.
+ If you pass in a disallow list, and not an allow list, then proceed by including the entire set of core blocks sans the blocks in the disallow list.
+ If you pass in both an allow and disallow list, then proceed by removing blocks named in the disallow list first and then only keeping the blocks named in the allow list from the resulting set of the disallow list. However, this use case isn't realistic in my opinion. The consumer should only provide an allow or disallow list whichever is more convenient for the context. An allow list is preferred when the amount of blocks we'd like to present to the customer is small. The disallow list is preferred when the amount of blocks we'd like to present is large.
+ If you pass in an allow list that does not include `core/paragraph`, as that appears to be the minimum needed block, then ensure it's included in the allow list.
+ If you pass in a disallow list that includes `core/paragraph`, then ensure it is removed from the disallow list.

I made an assumption that `core/paragraph` was a require block at minimum because when the disallow list didn't allow it to be registered, the application would crash at runtime. So I made a "needed blocks" list to make vital blocks be ignored from the allow or disallow lists.

I can add tests that reflect the requirements defined above. I did look for existing tests for this module and wasn't able to find them, but I may just not be understanding the general testing strategy.

+ `packages/block-library/src/common.js` - I added a new `common` module to be shared between the entry point module for `web` and for `native`. Otherwise, I would likely have to add a duplicate implementation of the newly introduced `registerCoreBlocksByName` function, and that causes IDE warnings about redundancy.
+ `packages/block-library/src/index.js` - I exposed an entry point to register a subset of the complete collection of Gutenberg Editor Core Blocks called `registerCoreBlocksByName`. It is intended to allow registration of a subset of blocks by their `name` defined in their respective `block.json` declarations. I gave some thought into whether or not more than the `name` field would be convenient if we'd like to overwrite other fields from the block declarations when registering, but I kept it simple for the sake of getting the general idea of the implementation across. That can always be a minor enhancement.
+ `packages/block-library/src/index.native.js` - I organized the general set of core blocks to be returned from a `__experimentalGetCoreBlocks` to keep it homogenous with the `web` entry point especially since `__experimentalGetCoreBlocks` and `registerCoreBlocks` are transitive dependencies of the newly added `registerCoreBlocksByName` function. I also exposed an entry point to register a subset of the complete collection of Gutenberg Editor Core Blocks called `registerCoreBlocksByName` to keep it homogenous with the `web` implementation explained above.
+ `packages/react-native-editor/src/index.js` - I updated the entry point of the `react-native-editor` package to accept two new props passed in from the native bridge within the WordPress Android or iOS apps called `acceptBlocks` and `rejectBlocks` to be treated as an "allow" and "disallow" list. The naming was difficult so I can rename it if something else may make more sense from the perspective of the consuming application. These two new props are passed to the new registration entry point, i.e., `registerCoreBlocksByName`.
