[MIRROR] emissive blockers are now just an overlay (with kickass fucking graphs). FUCK YOU MAPTICK (#195)

* emissive blockers are now just an overlay (with kickass fucking graphs). FUCK YOU MAPTICK (#57934)

currently emissive blockers are objects added to the vis_contents of every item. however mutable appearances as overlays can serve this role perfectly well and according to my tests should cause less maptick per item. for mobs mutable appearances dont work for reasons i dont understand so instead this adds the em_block object to overlays instead of vis_contents. these both use atom/movable/update_icon() now

graphed test results in pr

### Name of my software/tool/service/technology/project:

[**Deletion Day**](https://deletionday.com)

### Explain why it's a Humane Technology

Deletion Day directly opposes the privacy and security overreaches perpetrated by today’s tech industry.

### Sourcecode is available…

[…on Github](https://github.com/deletionday/site/)

### Is there a similar software/tool etc., that already exists?

I’ve found instances of one-off data deletion events, for instance:

- [The International Association of Privacy Professionals Deletion Day (2018)](https://iapp.org/news/a/data-deletion-day/)
- [Montgomery Public Schools’ “Data Deletion Week”](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/05/schools-monitor-students-online-activity)

…but as far as I know, this is the first effort to form a recurring awareness campaign around this issue.

### Motivations, goals, and purpose

Excerpt from [deletionday.com](https://deletionday.com):

> New technologies have the power to reshape civilization. Transformative developments like the calendar and the printing press not only reorganized society; they fundamentally changed how individuals thought. Today, digital storage is cheap and abundant. As it pervades everyday life, it has shifted our expectations about permanence. In this age of internet-connectedness and cheap digital storage, we no longer need to forget.
>
> We encode our heart rates, travel plans, and friendships into permanent storage. We welcome each minor convenience, and assume that sharing and storing are positive forces – or at least, that it may come in handy later.
>
> It’s worth considering who this benefits.
>
> Industries exist with the sole purpose of scraping photos and information about you to store, analyze, and sell. Advertisers, insurance companies, and police departments profile you based on your browsing history. Photos, video, and audio recordings can be used to generate realistic “deepfakes”. Doxing and harassment campaigns are on the rise.
>
> The data you store online does not belong to you.
>
> You may be aware of this reality from the news, or just a feeling in your gut. But it can be hard to know how to respond when so much of our attention and identity are wrapped up in the Internet.
>
> On the topic of identity, it’s worth asking if uploading this much of ourselves to an unsympathetic, persistent medium was ever a good idea. As people, we grow and change. Maintaining a consistent personal brand may hamper our ability to grow as people; digital footprints don’t fade.
>
> Deletion Day challenges the prevailing notion that “more is more”. In a culture that strives for permanence, we celebrate ephemerality, growth, and change. On April 4th, a chorus of Delete keys will ring out across the world. We hope you’ll join us.

New data: 2021-03-28. See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (AB. ON), mortality (ON).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “2 new deaths, for a total of 10,647 deaths: 0 deaths in the last 24 hours, 2 deaths between March 21 and March 26.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

Contributed Scenes, Avery Dismissal

Features:

- Exhibitionist players can now strip and wait in a stall for an audience in the park restrooms. Promiscuous players can take it further. Written in collaboration with Kinky_One.
(Note: Currently, this can only be done at dusk or night time. Feel free to remove that constraint if you deem it appropriate. It would only require the deletion of a single check.)
- Exhibitionist players can now leave the lake while exposed without making a plant top or skirt.
- Avery can now be dismissed at very high rage. Written in collaboration with ArachneSilk.
- The game will now remove a love interest from the list of selectable love interests if they are dismissed, and tell the player when they are dismissed.

Fixes:

- Fixed cases of Robin and Avery being initialized manually, resulting in their .state variable being an empty string instead of "active" after initialization.
- Fixed an oversight in the robin_location widget, hopefully we can use this for Robin's schedule soon, we need bathtime with Robin damn it!
- The player will no longer warp to the men's restroom after washing their face in the women's restroom, like some kind of cheesy horror game opening scene.
- Fixed a line of text describing the player thrusting out their breasts during a flaunting event that would never appear because of an extra underscore that was greedy for attention.
- Fix for NPCs telling a crossdressing player that it's their fault for looking like a boy or a girl, but referring to the player incorrectly as the gender they were crossdressing as instead of their actual gender.
- Fix for a wolf pair event saving the same wolf twice.

Tons of changes trying to get the keyboard capture fields to work. Their content can now be written to file and they work on a basic level, but they are extremely buggy and janky and also from a UX perspective the way they work now is not very good. Because when they hold a shortcut, they basically function as a shitty, weird popup button.

So in the future we're changing everything and having the shorcuts display in a popup button, and we'll only use the capture views for what they were named after - capturing input.

The horrible code I wrote for the current implementation doesn't work right anyways and this should make it a lot easier to make things work more reliably.

I did this yesterday, but this is in no way what I want the stop level state to be.

When it comes to placing coordinates, I feel like what Kivy does with its properties is the right way to go. Yet, seeingly the only way to get the same effect using my own method is to go in this direction.

This forces me to write too much boilerplate.

That I did not know how to deal with it was making me stressed. I constantly keep making comparisons to Svelte. I keep thinking about reactivity in terms of observables, but that is wrong. I need to think about it in terms of properties.

I want to internalize a new way of doing things. First let me start with the top level state.

```
type player = { pot : i32; stack : i32; card : string }
type state = {
    me : player
    opp : player
    community_card : option string
    actions : array leduc.action
    cont : leduc.action -> ()
    trace : string
    }
```

This is more along the lines of what I had in mind.

The front end state should not be used for keeping track of actual player weights and such. The continuation for the game should be the fanciest part.

The front end is just for the displayable part of the state.

The back end state is where I should do all the actual functionality. Forget mixing up the front end and the backend.

11:20am. The reason why I am finding Kivy confusing is because it actually has a simple property system that I'd want to use. In Avalonia I did all my thinking in terms of observables. So I am not used to it.

```
inl init_state () : state = {
    me = {pot=0; stack=0; card=" "}
    opp = {pot=0; stack=0; card=" "}
    community_card = Some: "J"
    actions = ;[]
    cont = fun _ => ()
    trace = ""
    }
```

Much better.

```
union msg =
    | Action: string * array leduc.action * (leduc.action -> ())
    | StartGame

type player = { pot : i32; stack : i32; card : string }
type state = {
    me : player
    opp : player
    community_card : option string
    actions : array leduc.action
    cont : leduc.action -> ()
    trace : string
    }

inl init_state () : state = {
    me = {pot=0; stack=0; card=" "}
    opp = {pot=0; stack=0; card=" "}
    community_card = Some: "J"
    actions = ;[]
    cont = fun _ => ()
    trace = ""
    }
```

This is good.

```
type obj = $"object"
nominal widget = obj
nominal layout_widget = obj
nominal app = obj
nominal prop a = {
    read : () -> a
    set : a -> ()
    subscribe : (a -> ()) -> rx.disposable
    }

inl (<<;) (prop a) (prop b) = prop {
    read = fun () => a.read(), b.read()
    set = fun a',b' => a.set a' . b.set b'
    subscribe = fun f =>
        inl f _ = f (a.read(), b.read())
        inl c = rx.disposablem.composite()
        rx.push c (a.subscribe f) . rx.push c (b.subscribe f)
        rx.toDisposable c
    }
```

Let me revisit this a little. I need it to read the property during the first subscription.

```
inl prop1 forall m. (event_name : string) (f : obj -> ()) (x : m) =
    inl f (x : tuple) = f $"!x[1]"
    inl uid : obj = $"!x.fbind(!event_name,!f)"
    disposablem.create fun () => $"!x.unbind_uid(!event_name,!uid)"
```

Huh, I am confused. Where is that suppose to come in? Here?

11:50am.

```
inl (<<;) (prop a) (prop b) = prop {
    read = fun () => a.read(), b.read()
    set = fun a',b' => a.set a' . b.set b'
    subscribe = fun f =>
        inl f _ = f (a.read(), b.read())
        inl c = rx.disposablem.composite()
        rx.push c (a.subscribe f) . rx.push c (b.subscribe f)
        rx.toDisposable c
    }
```

I am thinking about this.

No, I did not think this through properly yesterday. The way to deal with properties is to make them behavior subjects. Then they should be combined using combineLatest.

https://ninmesara.github.io/RxPY/api/operators/combine_latest.html

```
inl combineLatest2 forall a b. (a : observable a) (b : observable b) : observable (a * b) =
    !!!!Import("rx")
    $"rx.observable_latest(!a,!b)"
inl combineLatest3 forall a b c. (a : observable a) (b : observable b) (c : observable c) : observable (a * b * c) =
    !!!!Import("rx")
    $"rx.observable_latest(!a,!b,!c)"
inl combineLatest4 forall a b c d. (a : observable a) (b : observable b) (c : observable c) (d : observable d) : observable (a * b * c * d) =
    !!!!Import("rx")
    $"rx.observable_latest(!a,!b,!c,!d)"
inl combineLatest5 forall a b c d e. (a : observable a) (b : observable b) (c : observable c) (d : observable d) (e : observable d) : observable (a * b * c * d * e) =
    !!!!Import("rx")
    $"rx.observable_latest(!a,!b,!c,!d,!e)"
```

Let me do a few of these like so.

```
nominal prop a = {
    get : () -> a
    set : a -> ()
    obs : rx.observable a
    }
```

Let me do it like this.

```
inl size_hint_x forall t {toWidget}. (x : t) =
    inl m x = if $"!x is None" then None else Some: x
    inl get () : option f64 = m $"!x.size_hint_x"
    prop {
        get
        set = fun (v : option f64) =>
            match v with
            | Some: v => $"!x.size_hint_x = !v"
            | None => $"!x.size_hint_x = None"
        obs = fun () =>
            rx.create (fun f =>
                rx.onNext f (get())
                bind1 "size_hint_x" (fun _,b => rx.onNext f (m $"!b")) x
                )
        }
```

Yeah, it is more along these lines.

But damn is writing these properties complicated

```
            rx.create (fun f =>
                rx.onNext f (get())
                bind1 "size_hint_y" (fun _,b => rx.onNext f (m $"!b")) x
                )
```

Let me not paste this everywhere.

```
inl prop1 event_name get m x () =
    create (fun f =>
        rx.onNext f (get())
        bind1 event_name (fun _,b => rx.onNext f (m $"!b")) x
        )
```

```
inl size_hint_x forall t {toWidget}. (x : t) =
    inl m x = if $"!x is None" then None else Some: x
    inl get () : option f64 = m $"!x.size_hint_x"
    prop { get set = function
            | Some: v => $"!x.size_hint_x = !v"
            | None => $"!x.size_hint_x = None"
        obs = prop1 "size_hint_x" get m x
        }
```

Let me abstract this even more.

No it is fine.

```
obs : rx.observable a
```

Ah, screw it. Let me do it like this.

```
inl x forall t {toWidget}. (x : t) =
    prop {
        set = fun (v : f64) => $"!x.x = !v"
        read = fun () => $"!x.x"
        subscribe = fun f => bind1 "x" (fun _,b => f $"!b") x
        }
```

You know what, screw this.

I do not feel like making all these shitty wrappers.

The amount of work involved in making Rx work for all of this is huge, and the end result will be worse than what Kivy language offers me.

I just could not stop obsessing about it. I had to know how to implement all that I needed in Rx.

The answer is...

```
nominal prop a = {
    get : () -> a
    set : a -> ()
    obs : rx.observable a
    }
```

Make use of properties.

Now let me leave this aside.

```
packages: |core-
modules:
    types-
    r64
    serialization/
        dense/
            array
        sparse/
            int
    utils-
    torch/
        utils-
    sampling
    nodes/
        utils-
        cps
        main-
    leduc
    agent/
        utils-
        uniform_random
        neural_random
        human
    cps_test
    main
```

Let me go to this previous plan.

https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/Fabulous.XamarinForms/

```fs
/// The view function giving updated content for the page
let view (model: Model) dispatch =
    View.ContentPage(
        content=View.StackLayout(
            children=[
                if model.Pressed then
                    yield View.Label(text="I was pressed!")
                else
                    yield View.Button(text="Press Me!", command=(fun () -> dispatch Pressed))
            ]
        )
    )
```

That having said, I really am curious how diffing is done for commands here.

12:35pm. No forget this.

I can't believe I essentially wasted the last two weeks. I did great work during the first two in fixing the editor support of Spiral, but I literally haven't move a step closer towards my goals.

This is despite me wanting to!

March just went by in the blink of an eye. This is just too scary.

I feel like I could work for another month on the Rx based UI library.

Ahhh, why is this happening? Looking at the last 3 month more broadly, my progress has been a lot slower than it should.

```
root = Builder.load_string('''
<Table@FloatLayout>:
    canvas:
        Line:
            width: 2
            rectangle: self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height
    Stack: # Stack
        id: my_stack
        canvas:
            Line:
                rectangle: self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height
        text: 'Stack: ' + str(self.chips)
        x: root.x + root.width * 0.075
        y: root.y + root.height * 0.075
        font_size: sp(30)
        size_hint: None, None
        size: self.texture_size
```

Let me focus back on this.

Doing this was great. Could I replace this with a `pos_hint`?

```
    Stack: # Stack
        id: my_stack
        canvas:
            Line:
                rectangle: self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height
        text: 'Stack: ' + str(self.chips)
        pos_hint: {'x': 0.075, 'y': 0.075}
        font_size: sp(30)
        size_hint: None, None
        size: self.texture_size
```

Oh great, it does work!

```
        x: root.x + root.width * 0.6
        y: root.y + root.height * 0.925 - self.height
```

What about this?

```
pos_hint: {'x': 0.6, 'top': 0.925}
```

Yeah, this does work.

```
        x: op_card.right + dp(20)
        top: op_card.top
```

This works as well. Why did I have to subtract the height manually last time?

```
        x: root.center_x - self.width/2
        y: root.center_y - self.height/2
```

Let me smooth this out as well.

```
pos_hint: {'center_x': 0.5, 'center_y': 0.5}
```

Yeah, these are the kinds of improvements I should have been focusing on.

```
        x: root.center_x - self.width / 2
        y: root.y + root.height / 4
```

This should come next.

```
        pos_hint: {'center_x': 0.5}
        y: community_card.top + dp(10)
```

I have no idea why top and right were not working for me previously, but it does not matter.

1:05pm. Everything is fine as long as you have the language. Kivy's reactive language is exactly what I needed.

As far as size is concerned, it is ideally designed without having to go the lengths of Svelte. It really takes advantage of Python's OO capabilities.

Yes, Svelte is better, but how much effort going that length would take if Kivy's designers decided to do it?

It is really a pity I was too dumb to take advantage of this back in 2016 when I was using WPF, but things are fine.

1:05pm. Now focus me. What I need to think about is the back-end and the front-end state.

The front end state should just be the back-end state projected to it. The communication in the opposite direction should be done via callbacks.

1:10pm. Let me stop here so I can have breakfast."

Makefile: don't needlessly "rm $@ $@+" before "mv $@+ $@"

Now that preceding commits have moved the generation of objects and
scripts in the Makefile to use the "[...] -o $@+ && mv $@+ $@" pattern
we can stop removing "$@" and "$@+" before the rule is run.

I suppose that we could leave this at removing "$@" before we start
out, per the "age old convention" comment in[1]. I.e. instead of:

    rm -f thing thing+
    prepare contents for thing >thing+
    mv thing+ thing

Do:

    rm -f thing
    prepare contents for thing >thing+
    mv thing+ thing

Since the removal of "thing+" is redundant as we're about to clobber
it anyway, but we might be so paranoid as to be guarding against mv(1)
leaving behind a corrupt "thing".

But I think guarding against "mv" failing is a step too far in
paranoia, let's just rely on the "[...] -o $@+ && mv $@+ $@" pattern
working instead.

Especially as we'll see in a follow-up commit, we're just about to use
the GNU make ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" feature, which will reliably do this
for us.
