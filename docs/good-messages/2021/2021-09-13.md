minmax - iterators, min, max.
This problem set was quickly passet - but I completed it by cheating
a little and casting an interator into a list so I could loop over
it twice.  I couldn't think of any other way of doing it without
rebuilding all of max/min.  As it turns out that was the objective
of this problem set, an in depth proble of the iterator protocol
to build our own min and max.
There's a ton of other interesting things that are learned in this
problem set - including clean tuple unpacking/packing to
keep code looking nice/short.  Lots of use of the
next() and the StopIteration exception.
Particularly intereseting for what seemed like such a short
problem set was the approach towards returning a "named" tuple.
I was not aware, but there are at least *four* ways of doing this.
One could do the classical "create a class" - but then there
are three other approaches - the collections.namedtuple,
the typing.NamedTuple (and Any which is used in the definitnion)
And finally the dataclass approach - my second experience with it.
The first and last require you to create your own __iter__ if you
want to unpack the values from them - a yield min and yield max
one after another.   I definintely want to repeat this problem set - as
it includes a ton of useful concepts.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.
To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: 

Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you.
Stay at least 1 metre apart from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.
Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings.
Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
If you feel unwell, stay home and self-isolate until you recover.
 COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.

Most common symptoms:

fever
cough
tiredness
loss of taste or smell.
Less common symptoms:

sore throat
headache
aches and pains
diarrhoea
a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes
red or irritated eyes.

Serious symptoms:

difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
loss of speech or mobility, or confusion
chest pain.
Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.  Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. 

People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home. 

On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days. 

 


Stay informed:

"8:45am. Let me chill for a while. Any mail? A reject from UKG. Something from Indeed and SO. The Green Hills application has 72 applicants. Wow, that is a lot of competition. It says the employeer reviewed it. Unsubscribed from both.

8:55am. I want to chill, but I do not have anything I want to particularly do it with right now. Games are straight out, and I only have shitty novels waiting for me. Anime would take too long as well.

9am. Ok, let me read the Baki thread, this should be a non-made up translation.

9:10am. Let me start for the day.

I spent some time thinking about addressing and I think I understand it.

There are similarities between tabular RL and prop prog. Not in the algorithms themselves, but how the monadic implementation would work. There are also lessons I can take from tabular CFR when doing addressing.

Let me go through the intro to PPL book again. I want to make sure to absorb it properly. After that I am not sure.

Right now I have a complete grasp of Omega's semantics and will be able to use it for real tasks. I should also check out Turing which is another PPL in Julia.

9:15am. I am sure of it now - it is not deep learning, but prob prog that is the next evolutionary step after tabular RL.

9:20am. Let me start on the book.

138/218. Let me start from the middle.

9:25am. Hmmm, actually if it is poker, it would not be a bad idea to control the randomness the way a PPL does it instead of just sampling blindly.

...I messed up and added WebIO into the Omega library. Now it is precompiling everything again. Julia's compilation takes far too long even with all the staging.

9:35am. With prob prog, there is actually potential for me to combine it with tabular CFR. I never realized this before.

9:45am. Since I will be moving to Julia, it might be good to make time to read the dev docs.

https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/reflection/

Not today. Instead of a C backend, since the Cython one is so shitty, it might be a good idea to do a Julia one instead. A C backend would be helpful for an AI chip, but I do not anticipate getting it anytime soon. And it would be useless on its own as C has no libraries for me to use so I have no interest in working on it now.

Julia is different. It has a large ecosystem that a Spiral backend for it could take advantage of.

The game I made is extremely slow in Cython since object allocations are so expensive in it. But in Julia I would not be surprised for it to be on par with .NET. And unlike .NET, I could take advantage of Flux to do ML.

9:50am. Focus me. Let me read the book, and then I'll take a look at Zenna's examples. This time even if they are broken I have the knowledge I need to fix them.

One side quest I need to take on is to get familiar with how Julia does specialization. If I could do that, I'll be able to anticipate what kind of performance my programs will have. Right now I am blind as to how Julia optimizes.

10am. I am not really focusing on the book. Instead I am thinking how I could combine prob prog with different methods to train the poker agent on the side. But this is fine. Reading the book while giving my subconscious time to digest the recent gains in understanding and determine the next course of action is fine.

10:35am. 158/218. Let me focus on chapter six.

10:45am. 162/218.

> Support for forking can be implemented in a number of ways. In Chapter 4 we wrote evaluators that could be conditioned on a trace of random values to re-execute a program in a deterministic manner.

Actually, let me backtrack a bit to chapter 4. I want to make sure of how it does traces. As I said, I wasn't really paying attention to the book the first time around. Maybe if I had, maybe I would not have been so surprised by how prob spaces work in Omega.

11:35am. Ah, I see. If I am going to do nested optimization - Bayesian inference on top of sampling CFR for example, in order to make it deterministic what I could is make the random seed a top level variable.

Then that could be optimized as a part of the process. This is amazing.

That having said, NN ops can be nondeterministic which would wreck the idea, but tabular CFR would do fine. Seriously, what I am thinking here is wizardry. It would be unimaginable to the me of a few weeks ago.

12:45pm. 127/218. I do not entirely understand the acceptance criteria for MH, but nevermind that for now. Let me stop here for breakfast.

12:50pm. I'll watch some vids later to get a theoretical sense for it, but it does not matter at the moment. As I read the book, I am thinking how I could use the prob prog machinery for that agent. There are a lot of possibilities. Towards the end I'll even look at variational inference. I am going to cover all of it.

I am going to do it on the third run. The first one was a library building exercise, the second one with NNs was serious. They both failed.

If I cannot do it using probabilistic programming I'll accept my lot in life as a commoner. But until then I'll continue down this path of transcendence. As long as there is the slimmest chance to win it is my duty to pursue it."

Now, open the Cash App Earn software that you just downloaded.

As soon as you open the application, it will show you that you will earn $75 after completion of each task and the money will be transferred on your Cash App once you have earned $150 or more.

The app asks users to install the application and once the apps are installed and used, the user receives $150 on their Cash App in a short duration.

¶Free Cash App Money 2021 Generator No Human Verification¶

Do not send money to somebody you never understand who is promising to deliver you something at a subsequent time. Always verify those you send money to and also cover them after you receive that which you purchased. Scammers frequently promise a good or service without ever providing proof that it actually exists. This includes promising to find you a cheap flat or offering an apartment at a much slower speed than normal, but demanding you to ship them a deposit first (e.g., before touring the prospective rental). Never send money to somebody you never understand who is promising to deliver you something at a subsequent time - like the apartment leasing. If you fail to verify who someone is or the validity of what they are offering, it's probably a scam. Cash App is made in 2015 as Square Cash app, is really a mobile app designed for sending and receiving money.

It is readily available for iOS along with Android users, and establishing a free account is free of charge. Cash App can be used to instantly send and receive payments within the USA, however it won't do the job for international exchanges. It is possible to join your bank accounts or your own debit/credit card to ship out payments. Cash App also provides users with a free Visa debit card that's connected along with your Cash App balance and can be used in making purchases online and in stores, or even to get ATM withdrawals.

Now, Cash App does not support PayPal. With approximately 24 million monthly active users in 2021, Cash App has been meant to be considered peer-reviewed support. In theory, you should put it to use to make despite your friends after dividing taxi fare or to refund 50 percent to an own sister because they paid to your Mother's Day gift in full. It is not uncommon that Cash App is used for giving loans out or paying for products and services, which renders plenty of chances for possible scams and fraud. Cash App payments are supposed to become instant and, consequently, irreversible.

While you do have many options to try to secure your money back throughout the app, there is no guarantee that they are going to always do the job. Just in the event you are dealing with a legitimate retailer and also the purchase has been finalized over Cash App, you should begin the refund process through the app. If you sent money to the wrong person or even the total amount had been wrong, the sooner you understand it, the better as you might continue to find a way to cancel the payment. In the event that you suspect fraudulent transactions or in the event that you think you've been scammed, you may try to dispute the charges by simply requesting Cash Support for assistance.Free Money From Cash App, How To Get Free Money On Cash App Hack, Square Cash App Hack 2021, Cash App Hack Free Money, Get Free Cash App Money, Cash App Hack, How To Get Free Money On Cash App, Cash App Free Money Real, Cash App Money Generator, Cash App Money Free, Cash App Reward Code Hack, Free Money On Cash App Real, Make Money Earn Free Cash App, Cash App Hack June 2021, Cash App Hack May 2021

-----------------------------------------------------

I have been hearing about the Cash App for a while now, but I wasn’t sure if it was legit or safe. The app seems to have a bad rap since scammers like use the app to target unsuspecting users.

But the truth is, there are scammers using every money app you can think of, so it’s not fair to associate Cash App with these scams (I’ll show you how to avoid those later).

So I decided to download the app to get the full experience and let my readers know if there are legitimate ways to get free money on Cash App instantly.

So far I am pleasantly surprised with the app and excited to share the details with you below.

Cash App is a free money management app that allows you to send and receive money virtually, accept direct deposits, transfer money to and from your bank accounts, and invest money in the stock market and Bitcoin. There are different ways to get free money on Cash App as long as you protect it as you would your wallet.

In this Cash App review I’ll answer questions like:

Is Cash App legitimate? Absolutely. If you use Cash App for the purposes it was intended for (to buy/sell, manage deposits, and invest), you will have no trouble with it. It’s a legit virtual wallet for your money.

Is Cash App safe? Absolutely. As long as you avoid sending money to strangers who are trying to scam you (if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is), then Cash App is safe to use. Be sure to always know who is on the receiving end of your cash before hitting “send.”

Cash App Pros

§   Generous sign-up bonus and referral bonus opportunity

§   Easy person-to-person transactions

§   User-friendly, simple interface

§   Simple investment tool for beginners

§   Optional prepaid debit card to limit personal spending

Cash App Cons

§   Scammers target Cash App users

§   It’s nearly impossible to get money back after sending a payment

§   Transfers from Cash App to a bank account take 2 business days (or instant for a fee)

I sent five bucks to my husband’s Cash App and he sent five bucks back. This simple cash swap didn’t cost us a cent, and we both activated our bonuses!

We received $30 in bonuses between the two of us (out of a possible $45):

§   I received a $10 Invitation Bonus for using a Cash App free money code (use CBRJPKR).

§   I received a $15 Invitation Bonus for inviting my husband to Cash App and sending him five bucks.

§   My husband received a $5 Invitation Bonus for sending me five bucks back.

Complete Offers and Surveys

Taking those $750 surveys that send money to Cash App is a legit way to get free money.

To start earning immediately, join InboxDollars, which is one of my favorite paid task websites. InboxDollars is similar to those $750 Cash App offers you’ll often see ads for (which require you to complete 10 offers). The difference is that InboxDollars pays you to complete one offer at a time, and you can skip the ones you don’t like.

As a member of InboxDollars, if you only want to complete one offer, you can get paid for it without losing out on the entire opportunity. While with RewardZone, if you complete nine out of 10 offers, you earn nothing.

Remove the external notion of an MTThread.

Before this commit we required users to create threads through the MT struct, so
that we could pass those threads an `MTThread` structure. This works well if you
know from the very beginning that you're creating a yk interpreter, but will not
work if you e.g. embed a yk regex interpreter inside a wider program that's
otherwise ignorant about yk (and may create threads via another API).

The "obvious" solution is to make `MTThread` a thread_local, but if we do that, we
also have to make MT a global. And that's more-or-less what this commit does,
with the minor tweak that it hides `MTThread` from the outside world.

Users can access the MT struct via `MT::global()` at any point in their program:
`MTThread` is a thread local that is used by `MT` internally but doesn't need to
be exposed to the user.

This makes the API simpler to use, perhaps slightly icky in some ways (we've all
been brought up to believe that globals are bad!), but probably powerful enough
to carry us for a decent distance with, hopefully, only minor tweaks.

Internally, this clearly needs work: `MT`s are initialised eagerly but
`MTThread`s lazily; and the horrible `with` hack needed to get an `MTThread`
reference to `hot_location` is best not mentioned in polite company. Those can,
I believe, be finessed in future PRs without changing the external API. Put
another way: this commit is as close to "minimal change" as I think I can get.

michael m - enlightenment history

The characterization of the Enlightenment as “man’s release from his self-imposed tutelage” by Kant hints at the heart of this social movement as a turning away from blind submission to authority and faith in favor of individual human reason and liberty. This entailed a sharp criticism of traditional religious interpretations of the world, as exemplified particularly by Voltaire’s famous attacks on religion and Gibbon’s criticism of Christianity as contributing to the social decay and ultimate downfall of the Roman Empire. It was also a movement concerned with nation-building and national consciousness, which interacted varyingly with post-Reformation religious thought, both syncretically and critically.

History was appropriated by some Enlightenment writers as a means by which to derive a scientific understanding of human social interaction and provide a template from which to improve human society. It was also used to justify rising nationalist sentiment and revolutionary Republicanism. More often, history was seen as the causal result of social and economic forces alongside the religious instead of just explicit divine Providence. Though the treatment of God and Providence varied among Enlightenment thinkers, the secular was often promoted over the religious even by religious writers, who saw the hand of God as secondarily hidden behind the actions of men and institutions.

It is interesting that in a work of historiography that points out the primacy of white European thought and civilization in European Enlightenment historians’ writings, every historian mentioned is white and European. Was there no Enlightenment outside of Europe? And if the answer here is “no,” then what were comparable modes of historiographical thought outside of Europe, whether contemporary with the European Enlightenment or not? Surely, important developments in Enlightenment-era thought concerning historiography that shape the discipline today did not all come from Europe and European thinkers, alone. If they did, it reflects poorly on modern historiography to disregard or downplay such modes of doing history that do not come from a strictly European background. Of course, this is a brief survey of Enlightenment developments and only a few thinkers are introduced in the short chapter but I think it would benefit the overall picture immensely to hear something about Enlightenment historiography from a non-European perspective.

"1:35pm. Done with breakfast. Let me read a chapter of Hero King, then the Satanophany raw. After that I'll resume the book. After that, I'll take a peek at that Turing PPL. I won't study the source like for Omega, I am just curious what state it is in.

1:50pm. One more chapter and then I'll start.

1:55pm. Let me resume.

2pm. This book really deserves praise on how clearly it is written. The algorithms in particular are easier to understand than anywhere else.

2:20pm. 133/218. Ok, I am not too interested in this. Let me skim these parts so I can get back to chapter 6.

2:55pm. 165/218. Here they talk about the addressing transformation. This is something I am particularly interested in.

3:05pm.

> In this rule, we begin by translating the expression e0, which returns a transformed function e 0 0 that now accepts an address argument. This address argument is updated to reflect that we are now nested one level deeper in the call stack. To do so, we assume a primitive (push-addr α c) which creates a new address by combining the current address α with some unique identifier c which is generated at translation time.

I am starting to understand why in Omega they took such a complex approach with the vectors for ids.

3:20pm.

> The result of this translation is that each sample and observe expression in a program will now have a unique address associated with it. These addresses are constructed dynamically at run time, but are well-defined in the sense that a sample or observe expression will have an address that is fully determined by its call stack. This means that this address scheme is valid for any HOPPL program, including programs that can instantiate an unbounded number of variables

This is more conservative than what I had in mind, but it is not wrong at all. I am overthinking things on my end for the sake of efficiency.

3:25pm. Ok, the addressing transformation is a piece of cake. It isn't really necessary to do it at every function call, the sample and observe expressions (when CPS'd) would be enough.

3:30pm. Let me take a break here.

3:40pm. https://turing.ml/stable/

1.4k stars, this is quite popular.

4:10pm. Let me resume. I'll go through the turing tutorials quickly.

4:15pm. I am still thinking about the addressing. Nothing is really satisfying to me.

Actually, instead of all this complicated stuff, shouldn't it be possible to just fetch the address pointer at the current address and use that? That would be ideal for something like Omega. No need to give an unique id to every statement.

Ah, no that would not work with multicore. Then the current source location would not be a bad alternative. Something like a string that could then be compared using ref equality. That would work great. Much better than these global counters.

Ok, focus me on the Turing tutorial. What did the Omega docs have to say about it?

> Turing: Omega does not yet suport likelihood based inference, although it is planned, so use Turing if that is the case. Turing currently has more infernece procedures implemented. Omega is more flexible, likely faster, and supports causal and distributional inference.

Is it really faster? I'd guess that Omega is far from optimal, though I know nothing about Turing yet.

> In Omega you condition on predicates
> Omega supports likelihood free inference
> Omega supports causal inference
> Omega is fast (and type stable)

Is it really type stable? I am going to have to familiarize myself with this aspect of Julia. But a lot of the code examples would not be possible to type in first order logic, not unless Julia pevals very aggressively.

Let me add Turing to the package repo. It will take forever so I might as well take a head start.

4:50pm. Lunch time.

5:50pm. Let me do the chores here.

6pm. Ok, I've skimmed the Turing tutorial. It is boring statistics stuff, not nested optimization which I'd need for a poker agent.

What is next? I'd like to at least take a peek at the Turing source. Let me clone it.

6:15pm.

```jl
export  @model,
```

Damn it, where is this macro?

6:20pm. No I can't find it. Turing's source code is nothing like Omega. It is not even large.

I'll study it tomorrow. I want to see what magic does it do.

https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/blob/3b46cd0a469891009fc9b61ffb9b66cbef779cff/docs/src/for-developers/compiler.md

> In this section, the current design of Turing's model "compiler" is described which enables Turing to perform various types of Bayesian inference without changing the model definition. The "compiler" is essentially just a macro that rewrites the user's model definition to a function that generates a Model struct that Julia's dispatch can operate on and that Julia's compiler can successfully do type inference on for efficient machine code generation.

Yeah, where is it?

https://github.com/TuringLang/DynamicPPL.jl

6:25pm. I'll have to study DynamicPPL if I want to understand Turing. Turing itself is just the frontend for this.

6:30pm. This is a good spot to stop for the day and get some game time in. Given the direction I am going in, studying Turing would not be a bad idea at all.

Besides this, what I wanted to do was finally move to Zenna's examples. I still haven't really found the perfect scheme for addressing in PPLs. I said about getting the source location, but that would not work due to type reflection capabilities of Julia. To make it work correctly I'd need the source of the monomorphic compiled code.

This is hard.

6:35pm. Well, it is fine. I'll figure it out eventually. Let me do it all properly here. The next things on my list are the Turing source and Zenna's examples. With effort I will get through them to where I want to get to.

I cannot be held back by this. PPLs do have the potential to surmount the poker obstacle, but I need to cultivate my understanding of them first. This is what I am supposed to be doing.

I was too naive to think I'll be able to get anywhere in AI without mastering probabilistic reasoning first. If having to learn PPLs is my punishment I will accept it wholeheartedly."

New monster sounds

This is the result of one of Amy's feared "brainstorming sessions", where she has nothing better to do and therefore wastes her time thinking up features that could be included into slex. :D It's also very bare-bones, they have to be fully implemented so that they actually do something, obviously.

For the record, these will actually make the game easier in a way. Yes, really! Shambling horror types spawn with random monster sounds, and all the available ones (that normal monsters can have; they can't roll e.g. shopkeeper sounds) are equally likely, so they have a significantly above-average chance compared to regular monsters to roll MS_SUPERMAN, a really destructive one. By adding new monster sounds, the proportion of horrors that spawn with the superman taunts is smaller, so they appear less often as a result and the game is therefore less annoying.

Rodneyans and scriptors are gonna benefit too, because we'll add lots of script-generated monsters that use the new sounds too, so the proportion of such monsters with MS_SUPERMAN decreases as well.

But... another time. It's late and I'm tired now. Good night.

Feat, fix: Finalize Popoffbot

This commit finalizes a working version of Popoffbot, complete with
database integration and async functionality.

Commit 11d8ec6 introduced two variables to keep track of 1) Ben's most
recently liked tweet and 2) the most recently liked tweet from the day
before. Because of the way Heroku's Dyno's work, the variables were
cleared every time the application finished its processes. This forced
me to learn how to use Postgres, which was a real challenge.

I watched a ton of videos on Postgres and got a general idea of how it
worked. Problems kept popping up when I tried to integrate Heroku's
Postgres, though. Conceptually, I think I had a different understanding
of how the database would exist relative to Heroku's servers. In any
case, I got it working by making a database request that ignored any SSL
requirements. This could, in theory, jeopardize the privacy of the
database. I don't think anyone will be hacking me. Touch wood.

The next hurdle was figuring out asynchronous Javascript stuff. Turns
out, I had a really bad understanding of callbacks, promises, and
async/await. So, I had to watch a ton of videos on it and experiment
with await statements. Through trial and error, I figured out where to
use await so that the compare function didn't assume there was a new
tweet when the database info was undefined.

All this refactoring turned out for the best, though, as it allowed me
to introduce better modularity. Each major process exists in its own
file now.

Finally, I went ahead and adjusted the node scheduler for Heroku's UTC
conventions and hid the variable file from github. Tomorrow at noon,
we'll see what happens.

For future additions, I'll probably review the code to see if I can find
places where the code could be refactored for performance or style.
I also want to add functionality for this bot's namesake: Peter Popoff's
Miracle Spring Water. I think Ben could do with some of that, too.

B: generate static plans for image sub steps

[#6274]

This is a squashed commit that included a TON of commits so I'm sorry
for the terrible commit message!

Previously, we pushed the creation of image check and get plans into the
planner but did it through individual steps wrapped together through on
successes. This brought some complications such as needing to change how
it is rendered in the web UI and also made it difficult to read the build
plan. This commit keeps the creation of the image check and gets in the
planner but rather than running them separately and tieing the step and
it's image check/get through the ImageFrom field, we inline the image
plans directly in the step itself. Because of this, all FetchImage
within each step that needs an image only needs to run the
preconstructed plan and retrieve the results from the run state.

There will be an ImageGetPlan and ImageCheckPlan added to each step plan
that requires an image. Each step will run these constructed plans,
similar to how it works now but only difference is it no longer needs to
create the plans.

The logic for the current FetchImage needs to be moved into the task
step since it still needs to create substeps for dynamically fetched
task configs.

Image check steps store versions in the runstate, which is then grabbed
by the get step and used. We modified the version grabbed from the get
step to not be specific to the put step, since we are now using it for
check steps as well. The planID specified by ImageSpecFrom actually
stored more results than just the ImageSpec, so let's make the name more
accurate.

The Check step stored just the version, but the Put step stored the
version and the metadata. We couldn't find a use for the
`VersionResult.Metadata` anywhere so let's only store the Version
instead

- add test coverage, most of the image spec generation logic will be
tested in the get step tests
- it would be painful to maintain different codepaths for when the
task config is known vs when it's dynamically fetched

TODO:
- pass the varsourceconfig through the scheduler into the build plan
- figure out why we're storing runtime.VersionResult, do we actually use
the VersionResult.Metadata in any subsequent operations?
- Because we removed generating new scopes in FetchImage, it's now
possible for artifacts generated by get step to collide with image get
steps. The solution we're thinking of is to split the artifact
repositories into 3, resource, resourceType, and anonymousResource. This
way we can rely on the guarantees provided by ConfigValidate (i.e. no
duplicate resource or resourceType names) and flatten the run state
without worrying about if a get for a resource type named "foo" will
collide with a resource named "foo".

Stabilize monster emotions (anger/morale) (#51543)

* Cap some anger increases; fix minor leash bug

As suggested by @Venera3 on the dev discord, trying to get monsters a
bit more sensible in combat by limiting anger increases. Also fixed a
minor bug with the leash code which had temporarily-friendly monsters
completely ignore a leash around their necks in planning movement.

* First part of more-sensible cooldowns

This increases the rate at which a monster's anger or morale returns to
its base amount, from once per 10 turns to either once per 8 turns or,
if anger/morale is 15+ away from the base amount, once per 4 turns.
Future modifications will have cooldowns happening properly after being
outside the reality bubble.

* Further fixing on regen_morale case

Having regen_morale should not put the monster above its normal morale
(or anger), even if one or both are below 0.

* Put anger/morale back while outside reality bubble

There is code in process_triggers, enhanced by this PR, to bring
monsters back to their baseline anger and morale. However, this did not
function while outside the reality bubble, nor was it caught up when
the monster came back into the reality bubble.

This commit fixes this problem for "normal" anger/morale returning,
with rounding chosen to avoid roll_remainder; it does not take into
account regen_morale, however.

* Formatting
