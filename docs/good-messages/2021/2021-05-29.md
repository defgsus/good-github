Modify values for various foods (#765)

* Modify values for surf&turf; vegemite stuff

Increased food values of surf and turf, vegemite on toast, and cheese vegemite toast decreased food value of vegemite.

* Update food.zs

* Update food.zs

* A metric crapton of changes

Beetburger partly unnerfed (16->12->14)
Cantaloupe nerfed
Toast sandwich buffed
Garlic bread buffed, as this divine substance should be
Caesar salad buffed (though I feel like there should be a separate crouton item made from the toast, so salads aren't unreasonably filling)
Stuffed mushroom buffed
Salmon patties buffed
Fried egg buffed (partly why beet burger was buffed, as this is an ingredient)
Pork lettuce wrap buffed
PB&J buffed
PB banana sandwich buffed
Chili chocolate buffed
Hearty breakfast untouched, it would be a waste of ingredients if nerfed
Maple sausage buffed significantly
Honeycomb chocolate bar nerfed
Fairy bread significantly buffed. Consume the fae.
Chocolate bacon nerfed
Pepperoni nerfed
Non-durian milkshakes buffed
Naan buffed
Paneer tikka masala buffed
Hot and sour soup buffed
Peking duck buffed
Char siu nerfed
Apple fritter nerfed
Creeper cookie buffed significantly. Why it doesn't make you explode or resist explosions, I don't know.
Meatloaf sandwich greatly buffed, somewhat against my judgement but the math checks out
Nether wings untouched, blazes are relatively easy to farm once you find a nether fort, and you get 3 powder per rod.
Cookies and milk buffed
Crackers and derivatives untouched for now, I think crackers should be nerfed and you should get multiple from the recipe (e.g., only 1 shank, but the recipe gives 2).
Lastly, chicken dinner buffed.
Kale list parts dealt with: 1, 2 (partly), 7, 12, 14, 15, 21-25, 27-36, 38, 40.

* Changes from other half of Kale's list

Buffed ham and cheese sandwich
Buffed butter cookie. Butter and sugar cookies should yield 2-3 from their respective recipes.
Buffed chips and dip. I personally don't think chips should be a thing in the game, but that's just me.
Tater tots buffed. Looking at the mashed potatoes recipe, it should probably add another ingredient, like heavy cream or milk, since it's so good for what it requires.
Buffed steak fajita. Smores could use a buff, an ingredient nerf, or a doubling (recipe makes two).
Crispy rice puff cereal buffed.
Tomato herb chicken buffed.
Ham and pineapple pizza buffed. Insert pineapple on pizza joke here.
Mettbrotchen buffed.
Egg roll buffed
Steak tartare buffed
Bacon pancakes buffed
Kale chips buffed(?) at Kale's request (still only half a shank, but with high saturation).
Slime gummies buffed
Betteranimals venison nerfed. Twilight venison untouched because magic twilight deer or something.
BBQ chicken pizza buffed
Chicken cordon bleu buffed
Chocolate coconut bar buffed, reluctantly
Gyudon buffed
Fried bologna sandwich buffed
Regular bologna sandwich buffed
Musubi buffed
Buffed cooked tofuduck, nerfed cooked tofus worth more that 1.5 shanks
Lamb kebab nerfed, sauced lamb kebab buffed
Sweet ham pickle sandwich buffed. Number of words used to say it unfortunately unnerfed.
Growthcraft cooked rice buffed
Kale list items fully or partly finished: 41-56, 59-64, 66-68, 73, 76.

* Nerfed Suadero

One last tiny change, nerfing a food I've used and abused throughout my beta 5 playthrough. Steak should not gain 2 full shanks just from adding cooking oil.

* Buffed Pumpkin Pie

Brought pumpkin pie to around the level of the apple pie. The harvestcraft recipe should probably be removed, sticking with the better with mods recipe and/or adding a kettle recipe.
