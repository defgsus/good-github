Completely revert to a time before mypy.

Mypy, static type checking, all this sort of stuff?
1 out of 5 stars. There is definately a time and place
for mypy, static type checking, and all this sort of stuff.
Perhaps if I had used type annotations from the start,
or if the codebase was in a better architectural state,
it would work a lot better.

However, right now, implementing mypy has increased
the amount of code smells, reduced the readability
and evolvablity of the code, and for the love of
god it does not even type check on runtime- leading
to very confusing error messages.

Perhaps this is a rage quit moment- and a more
eloquent commit message can be written in a blog post
or something along those lines later, but right now,
it just does not seem worth it, for this project,
to use static type checking.

It's time to take a nap istg. Maybe I'll return
to mypy later, but right now, it's not the tool
for the job, at all.

Remove ObjCThemis.xcodeproj (#704)

* Remove ObjCThemis.xcodeproj

The idea behind building "objcthemis.framework" has been to unify import
syntax between Carthage and CocoaPods. Unfortunately, it turned out to
be a mistake. "objcthemis.framework" does not work without
"themis.framework" being present alongside it because of how module
resolution works. Despite "objcthemis.framework" providing the same
"themis" module as "themis.framework", the compiler will look for a
framework named "themis.framework" when resolving "import themis".

Moreover, the original issue that "objcthemis.framework" has been called
to rectify can be resolved more elegantly by importing the module:

    @import themis;

which work well with "themis.framework" in both Carthage and CocoaPods.

Since "objcthemis.framework" does not bring any value, remove it. Move
all new things added to ObjCThemis.xcodeproj into Themis.xcodeproj
(such as testing Swift 4 vs 5). Remove the import warning. Now Carthage
will build only one framework: "themis.framework" from Themis.xcodeproj.

I am sorry for the trouble and confusion of this fizzled migration.

* Change "product name" to "themis"

Make sure that Xcode targets produce "themis.framework", not
"objcthemis.framework".

* Recreate Xcode schemes

It seems that some components stick the schemes after renaming. Recreate
them to make sure that we're building "themis.framework" and there are
no traces of the old Xcode project.

* Bring back proxy umbrella header "themis.h"

Since the framework is named "themis.framework", its umbrella header
is expected to be called "themis.h". The actual umbrella header for
ObjCThemis is "objcthemis.h" which we simply include.

* Use alternative imports in unit tests

One of the reasons for "objcthemis.framework" existence was to run
ObjCThemis unit tests from Xcode. Initially, "themis.framework" has
prevented that due to import issues, and "objcthemis.framework" has
allowed #import <objcthemis/objcthemis.h> to work. Now that latter
is gone, the unit-tests are broken again.

However! It seems that using modular imports works for Xcode and
Carthage (which uses Xcode project). The bad news here is that it
*does not* work for CocoaPods, which still works only with the old
form because CocoaPods does some special wicked magic with headers,
putting them into the "objcthemis" directory.

I do not have much time and willingness to deal with this stupidity
anymore right now, so here's a compromise: Carthage uses its form,
CocoaPods use their form, and you get this TODO to maybe get rid of
this wart some time later.

The Harris–Benedict equation estimates the number of calories your body needs to maintain your weight if you do no exercise. This is called your basal metabolic rate, or BMR.

The formula for the calories needed for a woman to maintain her weight is

BMR = 655 + (4.3 × weight in pounds) + (4.7 × height in inches) – (4.7 × age in years)

The formula for the calories needed for a man to maintain his weight is

BMR = 66 + (6.3 × weight in pounds) + (12.9 × height in inches) – (6.8 × age in years)

A typical chocolate bar will contain around 230 calories. Write a program that allows the user to input his or her weight in pounds, height in inches, age in years, and the character M for male and F for female. The program should then output the number of chocolate bars that should be consumed to maintain one’s weight for the appropriate sex of the specified weight, height, and age.

nano: include all the syntaxes that come with nano

this is a bit of pain because nano is installed by homebrew under /usr/local, but on debian/ubuntu under /usr.
Because nano barfs if any of the directories doesn't exist, we can only reasonably assume that /usr/local/share and
/usr/share exist, but not which one of them includes the nano directory. The wildcard thankfully suppresses the error,
but may cause issues if multiple versions of nano are installed as e.g. nano-5 and nano-4.

On the systems I use and manage this is not the case, but it may be someday, so I'll keep my eyes out for a way to fix
the ugly hack

Solved the usings problem, need to make some more tests but should be ok

the re-Trie-val tree was implemented to keep track of strings and to access and look them up quickly. That way I know if I have a using without doing a bunch of string comparisons, I just use the Trie tree and access their look up tables. the data structure is missing the delete function, I'll get it in later for completeness sake but for now it really is not needed. Perhaps I can use this tree in other places. I should take care to use it too often as it is kind of memory heavy. Fast as hell though.

some code cleanup, some thoughts and notes.

I will stop using stringGroup inside state machine. I will save it all in the state machine group. String group will either be discontinued or limited to internal use in string_stuffz, where I would have to compile it seperately and make it static aka internal.. Or I will end up doing it completely different :) Any way, string group will not be used from inside state machine.

Oh yeah, also, trie_node and its functions will be moved from string_stuffz as well! there will be data structure files.

Modify values for various foods (#765)

* Modify values for surf&turf; vegemite stuff

Increased food values of surf and turf, vegemite on toast, and cheese vegemite toast decreased food value of vegemite.

* Update food.zs

* Update food.zs

* A metric crapton of changes

Beetburger partly unnerfed (16->12->14)
Cantaloupe nerfed
Toast sandwich buffed
Garlic bread buffed, as this divine substance should be
Caesar salad buffed (though I feel like there should be a separate crouton item made from the toast, so salads aren't unreasonably filling)
Stuffed mushroom buffed
Salmon patties buffed
Fried egg buffed (partly why beet burger was buffed, as this is an ingredient)
Pork lettuce wrap buffed
PB&J buffed
PB banana sandwich buffed
Chili chocolate buffed
Hearty breakfast untouched, it would be a waste of ingredients if nerfed
Maple sausage buffed significantly
Honeycomb chocolate bar nerfed
Fairy bread significantly buffed. Consume the fae.
Chocolate bacon nerfed
Pepperoni nerfed
Non-durian milkshakes buffed
Naan buffed
Paneer tikka masala buffed
Hot and sour soup buffed
Peking duck buffed
Char siu nerfed
Apple fritter nerfed
Creeper cookie buffed significantly. Why it doesn't make you explode or resist explosions, I don't know.
Meatloaf sandwich greatly buffed, somewhat against my judgement but the math checks out
Nether wings untouched, blazes are relatively easy to farm once you find a nether fort, and you get 3 powder per rod.
Cookies and milk buffed
Crackers and derivatives untouched for now, I think crackers should be nerfed and you should get multiple from the recipe (e.g., only 1 shank, but the recipe gives 2).
Lastly, chicken dinner buffed.
Kale list parts dealt with: 1, 2 (partly), 7, 12, 14, 15, 21-25, 27-36, 38, 40.

* Changes from other half of Kale's list

Buffed ham and cheese sandwich
Buffed butter cookie. Butter and sugar cookies should yield 2-3 from their respective recipes.
Buffed chips and dip. I personally don't think chips should be a thing in the game, but that's just me.
Tater tots buffed. Looking at the mashed potatoes recipe, it should probably add another ingredient, like heavy cream or milk, since it's so good for what it requires.
Buffed steak fajita. Smores could use a buff, an ingredient nerf, or a doubling (recipe makes two).
Crispy rice puff cereal buffed.
Tomato herb chicken buffed.
Ham and pineapple pizza buffed. Insert pineapple on pizza joke here.
Mettbrotchen buffed.
Egg roll buffed
Steak tartare buffed
Bacon pancakes buffed
Kale chips buffed(?) at Kale's request (still only half a shank, but with high saturation).
Slime gummies buffed
Betteranimals venison nerfed. Twilight venison untouched because magic twilight deer or something.
BBQ chicken pizza buffed
Chicken cordon bleu buffed
Chocolate coconut bar buffed, reluctantly
Gyudon buffed
Fried bologna sandwich buffed
Regular bologna sandwich buffed
Musubi buffed
Buffed cooked tofuduck, nerfed cooked tofus worth more that 1.5 shanks
Lamb kebab nerfed, sauced lamb kebab buffed
Sweet ham pickle sandwich buffed. Number of words used to say it unfortunately unnerfed.
Growthcraft cooked rice buffed
Kale list items fully or partly finished: 41-56, 59-64, 66-68, 73, 76.

* Nerfed Suadero

One last tiny change, nerfing a food I've used and abused throughout my beta 5 playthrough. Steak should not gain 2 full shanks just from adding cooking oil.

* Buffed Pumpkin Pie

Brought pumpkin pie to around the level of the apple pie. The harvestcraft recipe should probably be removed, sticking with the better with mods recipe and/or adding a kettle recipe.
