libctf: eliminate dtd_u, part 5: structs / unions

Eliminate the dynamic member storage for structs and unions as we have
for other dynamic types.  This is much like the previous enum
elimination, except that structs and unions are the only types for which
a full-sized ctf_type_t might be needed.  Up to now, this decision has
been made in the individual ctf_add_{struct,union}_sized functions and
duplicated in ctf_add_member_offset.  The vlen machinery lets us
simplify this, always allocating a ctf_lmember_t and setting the
dtd_data's ctt_size to CTF_LSIZE_SENT: we figure out whether this is
really justified and (almost always) repack things down into a
ctf_stype_t at ctf_serialize time.

This allows us to eliminate the dynamic member paths from the iterators and
query functions in ctf-types.c in favour of always using the large-structure
vlen stuff for dynamic types (the diff is ugly but that's just because of the
volume of reindentation this calls for).  This also means the large-structure
vlen stuff gets more heavily tested, which is nice because it was an almost
totally unused code path before now (it only kicked in for structures of size
>4GiB, and how often do you see those?)

The only extra complexity here is ctf_add_type.  Back in the days of the
nondeduplicating linker this was called a ridiculous number of times for
countless identical copies of structures: eschewing the repeated lookups of the
dtd in ctf_add_member_offset and adding the members directly saved an amazing
amount of time.  Now the nondeduplicating linker is gone, this is extreme
overoptimization: we can rip out the direct addition and use ctf_member_next and
ctf_add_member_offset, just like ctf_dedup_emit does.

We augment a ctf_add_type test to try adding a self-referential struct, the only
thing the ctf_add_type part of this change really perturbs.

This completes the elimination of dtd_u.

libctf/ChangeLog
2021-03-18  Nick Alcock  <nick.alcock@oracle.com>

	* ctf-impl.h (ctf_dtdef_t) <dtu_members>: Remove.
	<dtd_u>: Likewise.
	(ctf_dmdef_t): Remove.
	(struct ctf_next) <u.ctn_dmd>: Remove.
	* ctf-create.c (INITIAL_VLEN): New, more-or-less arbitrary initial
	vlen size.
	(ctf_add_enum): Use it.
	(ctf_dtd_delete): Do not free the (removed) dmd; remove string
	refs from the vlen on struct deletion.
	(ctf_add_struct_sized): Populate the vlen: do it by hand if
	promoting forwards.  Always populate the full-size
	lsizehi/lsizelo members.
	(ctf_add_union_sized): Likewise.
	(ctf_add_member_offset): Set up the vlen rather than the dmd.

	Always populate the full-size lsizehi/lsizelo members.
	(membadd): Remove, folding back into...
	(ctf_add_type_internal): ... here, adding via an ordinary
	ctf_add_struct_sized and _next iteration rather than doing
	everything by hand.

	(ctf_type_sect_size): Figure out the ctf_stype_t stuff the same
	way here.
	* ctf-types.c (ctf_member_next): Remove the dmd path and always
	use the vlen.  Force large-structure usage for dynamic types.
	(ctf_type_align): Likewise.

New Guns

-Added Avasarala, a new age version of the desert eagle. It's hot shit, as in actual shit, creamy brown runny shit because any IRL gunsmith knows the desert eagle is a terrible fucking gun. Found in gun loot spawns.
-Added "Triple Primary" heavy pistol, a cross forged gun with amazing stats. Has the utterly unique property that allows it to change its caliber from .50 kurtz, .40 magnum, or .35 pistol. Found anywhere cross guns can spawn. The name is a visual pun.
-Added the "tacticool revolver" which is a mateba with a god awful ugly fucking sprite made by eris. It's just a mateba with an overly large scope. Partially a joke weapon, but superior to a standard mateba thanks to less recoil and ... well it has a scope. Found in gun loot spawns.
-Improved the deckard sprite via port from eris, mostly just a pallet improvement that is hard to spot without knowing about the change.

"8:55am. Let me chill for a bit and then I will start.

Yesterday I had time to gather my determination and today I am going to act upon it. Yes, I'll have to deal with recurrent nets eventually, and I'll have a need for different kinds of replay buffers, but forget that. Let me just focus on the feedforward case without worrying how I will generalize this to other kinds of agents.

Just enumerative feedforward agents will be good enough as my first goal. Baby steps.

9:05am. Let me go for the Mahoako thread and then I will start.

I worked non-stop for the past six years. Sure I won't have to work on a language anymore, but by no means does that mean that what I will be doing here is easy. If it is easy, that just means I should fill up the time until I get to the same level of stress as before.

It is going to take time. I am not 5/5 expert in ML, but 3/5 at best. I am an expert in writing compilers, not ML systems. The skills and real world capabilities are going to come when I hit the next tier.

9:20am. Let me start. The most important thing here is to have motivation. Since increasing one's capabilities takes real effort, the path of least resistance is to just learn what you need.

Even I've been tempted to have Spiral sponsors solve my financial needs. It is the easiest thing in the world to take it easy by becoming a slave. Everyone loves being one as long as it is not called that. Instead they think themselves upstanding pillars of society.

It is a powerful urge. I am drawn towards it despite understanding this.

Deep down I'd rather do what I am doing now with other people than alone. It is really a pity nobody, but myself is interested in Spiral. It would have been fun if I could have gotten a few people interested in the same goal.

Right now I am switching to RL, so that particular interest should be broader in scope.

As a wish for the 20s, I really hope my interactions will turn out to be more fruitful than the last ones. The people I talked with in the last six years would have been better off fired from a cannon.

I am going to learn from this.

At some point I am going to have to make an effort to move my 1/5 social skills to something respectable.

9:25am. But well, that does not really matter. I'll deal with the people on the outside when they start to matter.

What matters in life is keeping up your own inner voice and having a firm will.

Being just a little good at interacting with the outside world would actually be a lot worse than what I have now. Imagine if I'd gotten a reply to some of my applications, but something like only a single interested party. Then I'd have a temptation to abandon my current work and get hitched to that. That would significantly negatively impact my long term development.

9:30am. This is kind of the thing, a lot of the people boasting about the importance of social skills aren't 5/5 at them. Real social chads wouldn't waste their time like that. Rather this kind of bullying to the perceived weaker ones is done by the mediocrities.

The NPCs who are only capable of talking to NPCs about the same NPC interests. The people who are only capable of thinking in certain ways and do not have an interest in breaking out, yes perversely that is how those with talent appear to them.

9:35am. Throughout my life I've been living a dream.

I was aware of the competitive nature of life, but I thought that if I'd attained the power of omnipotence that would be unecessary. So the competition of the real world was meaningless in my eyes. It was fine if I was at the bottom of the social ladder, because ultimately that thing was imaginary, and I was seeking a much greater power.

But figuring out the self improvement loop and my experiences since then have changed my mind. I want to compete now and I do not want to let myself be used like in the past. Either by people for status points in their social game, or by food for institutions.

9:40am. When I am around NPCs, I am like an NPC myself. Those people should be crushed. I do not want to waste my valuable will resisting the pull anymore. Instead I want to cut the chain pulling me.

It is time to grow up. It is time to do battle.

What should I do now. First of all, let me modify the players, so that in the terminal nodes, the fin gets called.

Let me start with that.

Programming is nothing fancy. You start with a grand goal and then you peel away at it and do the individual steps.

```
nominal run (p : * -> * -> *) o a r = player p o a -> log_prob -> array a -> (a * log_prob * p o a -> r) -> r
```

Let me change this something like player funs.

9:50am.

```
nominal player_funs (p : * -> * -> *) o a r = {
    action : player p o a -> log_prob -> array a -> (a * log_prob * p o a -> r) -> r
    terminal : player p o a -> f64 -> (() -> r) -> r
    }
```

I've been too indecisive regarding this lately, so I am going to go with the simplest possible design. I'll pass in the reward as a f64 to each of the players.

```
terminal : player p o a -> f64 -> ()
```

Actually let me do it like this. Let me not complicate things.

```
inl nodes_2p forall (p1 : * -> * -> *) (p2 : * -> * -> *) o a ret. (player_funs fp1, player_funs fp2) : game2p o a (pl2 p1 p2 o a * (f64 -> ret) -> ret) = game2p {
    terminal = fun (pid,r) ((p1,p2),ret) =>
        inl r = if pid = 0 then f64 r else f64 -r
        fp1.terminal p1 r . fp2.terminal p2 -r
        ret r
    action = fun pid ar f ((p1,p2),ret) =>
        if pid = 0 then fp1.action p1 (prob p2) ar (fun (a,_,_ as cs) => f a ((apply_changes p1 cs,apply_action p2 a),ret))
        else fp2.action p2 (prob p1) ar (fun (a,_,_ as cs) => f a ((apply_action p1 a,apply_changes p2 cs),ret))
    draw = choice draw
    sample = choice sample
    }
```

Let me do this like so. Yeah, it is fine if I take it easy and make small steps. The exact form of the replay buffer and the nodes is soething I will evolve gradually as I go along.

The fact I can even do this I owe it all to Spiral. Imagine if I were doing thing in Python. No doubt the implementation of the game would be completely interwoven with functionality of the players.

10:30am.

```
    terminal = fun (pid,r) ((p1,p2),ret) =>
        inl r = f64 if pid = 0 then r else -r
        fp1.terminal p1 (reward: r probOpp: exp_log_prob (prob p2))
        fp2.terminal p2 (reward: -r probOpp: exp_log_prob (prob p1))
        ret r
```

Let me do it like this.

```
nominal replay o a = list {observation : nodes.observation o a; reward : f64; prob_self : f64; prob_opp : f64}
```

`replay` should be a record.

```
nominal rarray a = $"list"
```

It is beyond annoying that I cannot pull this outside the module. Well, I could, but then I lose the ability to compare it for equality.

```
instance equable rarray t = fun x1 x2 =>
    if length x1 <> length x2 then false
    else
        let rec loop i = if i < length x1 then index x1 i = index x2 i && loop (i+1) else true
        loop 0

instance comparable rarray t = fun x1 x2 =>
    if length x1 < length x2 then LT
    elif length x1 > length x2 then GT
    else
        let rec loop i =
            if i < length x1 then
                inl x = comp (index x1 i) (index x2 i)
                if eq_is x then loop (i+1) else x
            else EQ
        loop 0
```

You know what. It is my own language, so I'll loosen the orphan instance check. Rather than the same module, I'll restrict it to being in the same package.

```fs
let assert_orphan_instance_check (prot_id : GlobalId) (ins_id : GlobalId) = if (prot_id.module_id = module_id || ins_id.module_id = module_id) = false then errors.Add(r,OrphanInstance)
```

Let me change this to `package_id`.

```fs
let assert_orphan_instance_check (prot_id : GlobalId) (ins_id : GlobalId) = if (prot_id.package_id = package_id || ins_id.package_id = package_id) = false then errors.Add(r,OrphanInstance)
```

```fs
| OrphanInstance -> "The instance has to be defined in the same package as either the prototype or the nominal."
```

Together with the shadow check this should do the trick.

There is was need to be so strict here.

```
nominal replay o a = rarray {observation : list (nodes.observation o a); reward : f64; prob_self : f64; prob_opp : f64}
```

Let me do it like this.

```
nominal stateless o a = ()
type replay_element o a = {observations : list (nodes.observation o a); reward : f64; probSelf : f64; probOpp : f64}
nominal replay o a = rarray (replay_element o a)
```

11:10am. I am getting lost in thoughts.

```
inl create dispatch = player_funs {
    action = fun (player p : player replay card action) opp_prob dist next =>
        dispatch (p.observations, dist, fun x => next (x,p.state))
    terminal = fun (player {observations probSelf state=(replay rep)}) (reward: probOpp:) =>
        r64.add rep {observations reward probOpp probSelf=exp_log_prob probSelf}
    }
```

At any rate, here is the human player. I did a bit of refactoring so the args match up better. Compared to v0.09, refactoring in Spiral v2 is just as smooth as it is in F#.

11:15am. Let me think, and not about the next Simulacrum arc. What comes next?

The UI. I have everything else, now it is time to tackle it.

```

The argument must be a signed numeric type.
Got: u32
```

Huh...Ah, inded. It is u32. I forgot about this. Good thing the partial evaluator warned me.

Ok, the old thing runs. I need to focus on the UI.

```
open kivy
open lithe

union msg =
    | Clicked

type state = {
    times_clicked : u32
    }

inl model (x : state) = function
    | Clicked => {x with times_clicked#=((+) 1)}

inl view dispatch (state : _ state) =
    inl (~+) x = +state x
    boxlayout [
        -orientation Vertical
        children [
            label [-text "Press the button."]
            button [
                +text fun {times_clicked} =>
                    if times_clicked = 0 then "Click me."
                    else $"f\"The button has been clicked {!times_clicked} times.\""
                @on_press (fun () => dispatch Clicked)
                ]
            ]
        ]

inl main () =
    inl app = appm.create()
    inl _ = rx.subscribe (loop {times_clicked=0} model view) (appm.root app)
    appm.run app
```

This works when I paste it as is into the new project. Good.

Ok, I'll do it in the simplest way possible. Before I start, let me replace the label with a text box.

```
inl view dispatch (state : _ state) =
    inl (~+) x = +state x
    boxlayout [
        -orientation Vertical
        children [
            label [
                +text fun {times_clicked} =>
                    if times_clicked = 0 then "Press the button."
                    else $"f\"The button has been clicked {!times_clicked} times.\""
                ]
            boxlayout [
                -orientation Horizontal
                -size_hint_y 0.2
                children [
                    button [
                        -text "Click me."
                        @on_press (fun () => dispatch Clicked)
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
```

Let me add a text box widget.

11:45am. https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.html?highlight=kivy%20uix#module-kivy.uix

Let me take a break here. I do not need a text input after all. I'll make use of the label.

12:30pm. Done with breakfast. Let me do the chores here."

"1:05pm. Done with chores. Let me resume.

As my first trick, before I move on to putting in the human player into the UI...

```
open kivy
open lithe

union msg =
    | Clicked

type state = {
    times_clicked : u32
    }

inl model (x : state) = function
    | Clicked => {x with times_clicked#=((+) 1)}

    inl (~+) x = +state x
    boxlayout [

        children [
            label [
                +text fun {times_clicked} =>
                    if times_clicked = 0 then "Press the button."
                    else $"f\"The button has been clicked {!times_clicked} times.\""
                ]
            boxlayout [
                -orientation Horizontal
                -size_hint_y 0.2
                children [
                    button [
                        -text "Click me."
                        @on_press (fun () => dispatch Clicked)
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]

inl main () =
    inl app = appm.create()
    inl _ = rx.subscribe (loop {times_clicked=0} model view) (appm.root app)
    appm.run app
```

Instead of having the button do the usual thing, how about a I make the button click start the game?

```
inl main () =
    inl p1 = agent.neural_random.create()
    inl p2 = agent.uniform_random.create()
    loop.for' (from:0u32 nearTo:100) (fun i =>
        open nodes
        inl Empty = player {probSelf=to_log_prob 1; observations=Nil; state=agent.stateless()} |> dyn
        inl r = leduc.game (nodes.cps.nodes_2p (p1, p2)) ((Empty,Empty),dyn id)
        $"print(\"Reward for player one at iteration \", !i, \" is \", !r)" : ()
        )
```

Let me combine it with this and print the output. This will be a step forward in the integration of the system.

```fs
type t a b c = (nodes.player_funs) (agent.stateless) a b f64
```

Ah, crap. I forgot tight application in the type parser. I have to fix this.

```fs
    and application_tight d =
        let next = expressions
        let inline expr_tight (d: Env) =
            let i = index d
            if 0 < i && i < d.tokens.Length then
                let r,r' = snd (fst d.tokens.[i-1]), fst (fst d.tokens.[i])
                if r.line = r'.line && r.character = r'.character then next d else Error []
            else Error []

        pipe2 next (many expr_tight) (List.fold (fun a b -> RawApply(range_of_expr a +. range_of_expr b,a,b))) d

    and application (d: Env) =
        let next = application_tight
        pipe2 next (many (indent (col d) (<) next)) (List.fold (fun a b -> RawApply(range_of_expr a +. range_of_expr b,a,b))) d
```

```fs
    let fold_applies a b = List.fold (fun a b -> RawTApply(range_of_texpr a +. range_of_texpr b,a,b)) a b
    let apply_tight d = pipe2 cases (many (expr_tight cases)) fold_applies d
    let apply d = pipe2 apply_tight (many (indent (col d) (<) cases)) fold_applies d
```

I've decided to factor out `expr_tight`.

```
type t a b c = nodes.player_funs agent.stateless a b f64
```

No, it is not good enough. This still does not work for me.

```fs
let apply d = pipe2 apply_tight (many (indent (col d) (<) cases)) fold_applies d
```

Because I forgot to route it in the second arg.

```

    appm.run app
```

Let me try it like this.

I wish I was working in .NET, rather than Python, but I'll manage to get through this to the place I want either way. In .NET could use Hopac rather tying up the UI thread, but this is not for serious gaming anyway.

Maybe I could use Rx to start the subject on a different thread.

If I study Rx, I bet I could learn a lot about Python concurrency.

Let me try running this.

```
inl model (s : state) = function
    | Clicked =>
        open nodes
        inl Empty = player {probSelf=to_log_prob 1; observations=Nil; state=agent.stateless()} |> dyn
        inl r = leduc.game (nodes.cps.nodes_2p (s.p1, s.p2)) ((Empty,Empty),dyn id)
        inl ts = $"f\"Reward for player one is {!r}.\\n\"" : string
        {s with text#=fun t => $"!t + !ts"}
```

Forgot about the newline here. A far bigger problem though is that the label text extends beyond the button.

Yeah, labels are unsuitable for text display after all.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.label.html?highlight=text%20box#kivy.uix.label.Label.shorten
https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.label.html?highlight=text%20box#kivy.uix.label.Label.text_size

It might be possible to constrain it.

```
instance text_size label = fun (a,b) x =>
    match a,b with
    | (Some: a), (Some: b) => $"!x.text_size = (!a,!b)"
    | (Some: a), None => $"!x.text_size = (!a,None)"
    | None, (Some: b) => $"!x.text_size = (None,!b)"
    | None, None => $"!x.text_size = (None,None)"
```

Let me give it a try.

I really hate this, as instead of it being relative to the size of the control, now I am giving this hard pixel info. Clearly label is the wrong thing for the job here.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.vkeyboard.html

Right now I am going through all the documented Kivy widgets and wondering whether I should switch to PyQT.

Oh, yes. Let me publish a patch. I did that type parser fix.

2:15pm. https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.pagelayout.html

You know what, I am not sure that a mobile UI framework is what I want. I never even owned a mobile phone in my life. Why did I pick Kivy out of all things?

I wanted to avoid Gtk at all cost as I know from my .NET experience that it is trash. So that leaves PyQt and that other QtWidget framework.

2:25pm. No, Kivy is not good. It is too small. It does not even have charts, I am sure as hell not going to do my own chart widget.

Since I don't intent to develop for mobile, the extra UI stuff to support that is cruft for me.

Let me commit here."

Create Becoming a Doctor From Russian Medical Colleges 2021 Twinkle InstituteAB

MBBS in Russia for Indian has became one in every of the best-suited countries for following MBBS. We have a tendency to all are cognizant of the very fact that Russia is one in every of the leading countries of the planet United Nations agency is known for its advanced teaching techniques. What the remainder of the country is attempting to implement it of Russia is already living in it.
There is little question that Russia is associate degree applicable country from each angle so as to pursue for a medical career. However since the country is incredibly advanced in technology and is known for victimization top-notch ways to show, folks would suppose that itâ€™s terribly expensive and rather than selecting this country theyâ€™ll select any of the opposite country. However keeping apart the fable, Russia is actually a reasonable country for following associate degree MBBS in Russia.
The medicine study desires the medical instrumentation particularly once it involves explore concerning sensible data.

Indian medical students expect the time once they are given the live sensible sessions as a result of, in MBBS, sensible is what matters at the top and applying it ideally in their career. In Russia, they specialize in each theoritical and their sensible sessions that arenâ€™t to be lost as a result of the engineering they use whereas teaching to their students. Itâ€™s the most reason why every year there are numerous medical aspirants from all round the globe go for obtaining an admission in Top Ten Medical University in Russia.
All the Russian medical institutes of life science are well recognized by the Medical Council of Bharat and are being listed underneath United Nations agency. A doctor graduated from any Top Universities in Russia for MBBS from any medication course is thought as a acknowledged and well-known doctor as expected round the world.
And the history itself speaks concerning it. Students United Nations agency are to Russia for achieving their MBBS degree are earning pretty fine in their careers and not simply learning however conjointly totally enjoying their faculty life in Russia. They will be at liberty as a result of no load of bearing serious expenses, vast donations. Also the semester system of Russia moreover as India are constant.
Russia is barely country renowned for its balanced population, their technology, their culture, and their tremendous beauty. The country is so one in every of the powerful and most important countries all round the world.
If we have a tendency to remark Russia, itâ€™s placed in northern continent covering borders of the ocean in between the North Pacific ocean and Europe. Itâ€™s a population of 147 million folks that makes it qualified to occupy the ninth place among the worldâ€™s most inhabited countries list.
The country isnâ€™t famed for its richness, well being and sweetness for creating it an ideal destination to travel except for their Russia Medical College also.
The country has several medical universities for MBBS study that are well recognized underneath the list of United Nations agency and MCI and are renowned for his or her world category MBBS Abroad education. Thatâ€™s what makes the country distinctive and ideal to pursue MBBS from.
Every year, youâ€™ll expect four thousand Indian medical students coming back to Russia for following MBBS degree in life science out of that, 2000 are presently finishing MBBS in Russia. Because of reasonable expenses and acknowledged faculties, Russia has forever been on a prime of a listing of Indians medical students to try to to MBBS from. India-Russia sensible relations has forever been the speak the city. However, it doesnâ€™t depicts that thereâ€™s one thing wrong between these 2 countries.

Itâ€™s forever sensible to possess a healthy competition which is what these 2 countries is attempting to keep up. However as way as medical education thinks about, Russia is incredibly liberal and sort of hospitable to Indians. Each economic and cultural relations between these 2 countries are on sensible terms which can even be one in every of the most reasons why Russian medical students are forever kind and humble with USA. Since all the expenses is thus terribly reasonable, students donâ€™t have to be compelled to consider before selecting the country for MBBS study and also the cherry on the cake is that you just wonâ€™t feel alone pr being left over as there are variety of Indian restaurants accessible in Russia wherever youâ€™ll have your own countryâ€™s preparation. Study Medicine in Russia is valid in India moreover as in alternative countries. However rather like the other countries, youâ€™re needed to clear the MCI test (FMGE) in India when that youâ€™re geared up to start out your clinical follow as associate degree MBBS doctor in India. The degree isnâ€™t simply valid in Bharat however conjointly in alternative countries like UK, US, Australia, Kingdom of Norway and in more moreover.

When passing the MCI take a look at, one will work anyplace be it in a very government sector or having your own personal one in Bharat. Since we have a tendency to all grasp that Russia may be a Christian country, the bulk of the general public follow solely Christianity. However because the country doesnâ€™t believe discrimination and settle for all, youâ€™ll simply realize some Pagan and Muslims there too aside from this, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism also are a part of the country however they belong to the minority sector. However once it involves the celebration, notwithstanding that faith does one follow, youâ€™ll be absolve to celebrate your pageant blithely and youâ€™ll realize Russian having joys too.

I'm a tab person now, reasoning in body

From https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/

Nobody talks about the real reason to use Tabs over Spaces

hello,

i've been slightly dismayed, that in every tabs-vs-spaces debate i can
find on the web, nobody is talking about the accessibility consequences
for the visually impaired

let me illustrate with a quick story, why i irrevocably turned from a
spaces to tabs guy

- i recently worked at a company that used tabs

- i created a new repository, and thought i was being hip and modern,
so i started to evangelize spaces for the 'consistency across
environments'

- i get approached by not one, but TWO coworkers who unfortunately are
highly visually impaired,
    and each has a different visual impairment

	- one of them uses tab-width 1 because he uses such a gigantic
font-size

	- the other uses tab-width 8 and a really wide monitor

	- these guys have serious problems using codebases with spaces,
they have to convert, do their work, and then unconvert before
committing

	- these guys are _not_ just being fussy â€” it's almost surprising
they can code at all, it's kind of sad to watch but also inspiring

- at that moment, i instantaneously conceded â€” there's just no
counter-argument that even comes close to outweighing the accessibility
needs of valued coworkers

- 'consistency across environments' is exactly the problem for these
guys, they have different needs

- just think of how rude and callous it would be to overrule these
fellas needs for my precious "consistency when i post on stack overflow"

- so what would you do, spaces people, if you were in charge? overrule
their pleas?

from that moment onward, i couldn't imagine writing code in spaces under
the presumption that "nobody with visual impairment will ever need to
work with this code, probably", it's just a ridiculous way to think,
especially in open-source

i'll admit though, it's a pain posting tabs online and it gets bloated
out with an unsightly default 8 tab-width â€” however, can't we see
clearly that this is a deficiency with websites like github and
stackoverflow and reddit here, where viewers are not easily able to
configure their own preferred viewing tab-width? websites and web-apps
obviously have the ability to set their own tab width via css, and so
ultimately, aren't we all making our codebases worse as a workaround for
the deficiencies in these websites we enjoy? why are these code-viewing
apps missing basic code-viewing features?

in the tabs-vs-spaces debate, i see people saying "tabs lets us
customize our tab-width", as though we do this "for fun" â€” but this is
about meeting the real needs of real people who have real impairments â€”
how is this not seen as a simple cut-and-dry accessibility issue?

i don't find this argument in online debates, and wanted to post there
here out in the blue as a feeler, before i start ranting like this to my
next group of coworkers ;)

is there really any reason, in favor of spaces, that counter balances
the negative consequences for the visually impaired?

cheers friends,

ðŸ‘‹ Chase
