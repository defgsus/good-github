ML3M Rebalancing

Originally, the ML3M was intended to be a little bit stronger. The healing values for the Brute, Burn, Omni, Toxin, and Antirad cells, have been adjusted according to what was initially planned. 
Base Tier's now heal 10 per shot, for a total of 40 damage healed, up from 20.
Second Tier's now heal 20, instead of 10.
Third Tier's heal 40, instead of 20. 

Omni 1 heals 5's for brute, burn, and toxin, and 30 for oxy, up from half those values. Omni 2, is 10's and 60, and Omni 3 is 20's and 120. 

Antirad Cell had its toxin heal bumped up from 2.5 to 5, and its radiation-heal from 150, to 350. I wasn't originally going to touch this one, but the text said "It's 150 because that's equal to five units of arithrazine", and... it wasn't. So, I bumped it up to actually be equal to 5u of Arithrazine's worth of radiation healing.

Stabilizer Cell, CorpseMend, Resistance, Haste, and the size-changing cells, were not touched.
The reasons for this are as follows:

- The healing laser was simply not strong enough to ever tend to more than one patient. Healing 20-40 damage per cell just isn't enough, even if you had several clips full of cells, it just wasn't viable.
- As a result of this, it was seldom if ever used. Field Medics rarely if ever took it with them. In nearly every round I've played, it was left exactly where it was spawned, collecting dust. 
- I'd like to make it a more proper treatment option. It wouldn't be equal to reagents used in your usual Medbay setting, or surgical repair, but if it's modified to actually fulfill its niche as a rapid, contact-free treatment option, it could be relied on more by Field Medics. There is so much potential for this device as an "in the field" healing tool, and I'd like to see it done well. We have no shortage of people who would like to see non-chemical-based treatment options. We might as well make it useful enough to actually use.

Here are a few issues people brought up in Discord when I floated this idea.
"But, Tempest, you're doubling everything? That's a huge change! Won't this result in the ML3M overshadowing other treatment options?"
Certainly not. Currently, with tier-2 cells that only heal up to 40 damage, this is actually worse than basic first-aid in terms of raw healing ability, as the cutoff for first aid healing is 50 damage on a limb. First aid and reagents will still be the most convenient, most readily available, and overall most-used manner of treatment for injuries that can be treated using those methods. All this change would do is allow the ML3M to also have its uses, and stop being overshadowed by everything else. 

"Okay, but what if it DOES actually become The New Meta and becomes the favored tool for healing?"
I wouldn't see it as an issue if Chemistry gets dethroned, in all honesty. They'd both take quite a bit of prep-work to use. You have to make multiples of every chem if you want a solid stock, and you'd need multiples of every cell if you want proper coverage and healing-ability, since even with these changes you're expending 1-3 cells per patient. And, unless you get multiple ML3M's made, only folks who are gonna have one are the CMO, and whoever nabs the spawned one first. 

"But wouldn't this result in less departmental cooperation between Medical and Science now that Medical will require fewer cells?"
Most likely, no. If anything, I'd think there would be an increase, round-to-round, if this becomes a more viable and wanted tool, more people will ask for cells. Personally, my list of requested cells would stay the same, but I'd be sending that request in more often since I know it'll actually be useful rather than having it just to have it. Tier 2 cells are still going to be desirable, and I'm still probably not going to order Tier 3's because of the cost, but that's just me. It's still going to be incredibly weak at roundstart, and better cells will be that much nicer to obtain.

"But Tempest! If you get the highest tiers of cells, and a lot of them, you could fix anything that doesn't require surgery!"
Well, if Science had the time and mats, then sure, you could gather up a large enough collection of cells, and you probably could indeed do this for one or two badly injured patients... ... ...and I could accomplish the same goal if I'm given 20 seconds in a chem-lab. The ML3M is more costly to use, the cells cost resources, have to be recharged after 4 shots, and you only start with a base tier Burn, Brute, and Stabilizer cell. Each shot from a base level burn/brute cell is the equivalent of 1.25u of bicaridine or kelotane. This change would make it 2.5. Base level cells are still going to be next to useless for anything other than the most minor of injuries. Chemistry will still be the dominating powerhouse it always has been, but at least you can use this tool, provided the PR goes through, instead, more often.

"Tempest, this thing just wasn't intended to be used to fully heal people..."
A couple people have said this, and to be honest, it's silly. In our medical system, there's very little distinction between what can "heal a little bit" and what can "heal fully", because it all comes down to the fact that everything works off of damage values. If Option A heals 5 damage, and Option B heals 50... Both are capable of "healing fully" if you have enough Option A, it's just a question as to whether or not that's practical. Currently, the ML3M's healing values can't really even be used to even partially heal injuries, unless you have a large number of cells. You'd expend all of your charges on one patient and then you've got a paperweight taking up storage space until you can get to a recharger. 

Now, as for issues that I personally see? Biggest one is probably the Toxin cell. If I remlember correctly, the base Toxin cell is the same tech requirement as the Second Tier Brute/Burn cells. This PR doesn't fix that, and I don't really see it as a huge priority since I don't think anyone uses the toxin cells as it is, but yeah. Might need to be fixed at some point if this PR goes through.

And, absolute worst case scenario, let's say that this PR screws everything up, turns the Tether upside down, and now Medbay is dominated by a bunch of blue laser beams flying everywhere like it's the new Star Wars Trilogy (but actually better because those movies kinda set a low bar)... this PR was really easy to do. The only long part about it was typing all of this up. We can just bump the numbers down if this ends up sucking really bad, ezpz.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

Pipeguns: Elitism Edition (#56322)

About The Pull Request

The core of the PR:

The improvised shotgun that was is dead and removed.

Now we have Pipeguns. Pipeguns are bolt action rifles that have a damage multiplier that reduces their damage to 75%, and can be modified to fit the rare 7.62mm bullets. If you want to that is.

The pipegun also slowly increases in misfire probability for every shot at a rate of 5% per shot.

Pipeguns can also be upgraded to Regal Pipeguns. These contain more bullets, don't misfire and don't have a damage multiplier. To acquire one is a maint secret, only available to lucky assistants who come across the diary of a dead assistant. The probability of finding the book is quite, quite low.

Bandoliers now fit individual 7.62mm. Because why not. Currently they're available in stripper clips that fit into most combat belts so this is mostly a style preference at the moment

Other shit

Ammo modification and misfire behaviour is now generalized to all ballistics. You can now make any gun misfire and any internal magazine gun swap ammunition.

Misfires are not a flat chance. Instead, they increment as the gun fires over time.

Ports over this PR Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13#12274 which I felt was pretty neat conceptually for making some weapons weaker.

Makes the icemoon hermit's mosin into a regal pipegun, just to get mosins out of easy access.
Why It's Good For The Game

Improvised shotguns were one of my favourite weapons to horribly abuse while they were utterly broken a nice alternative, but I fully support moving towards curbing gun power curve. Part of that should include looking at improvised weapons like this which are seeing considerable usage with the removal of buckshot and slugs.

Initially I wanted to pair this with a PR of my own to bop Mosins on the skull along with it, but #56319 is already doing that, and while it's a very lenient approach to my own (I was going to remove them entirely from cargo), I respect it.

Changelog

cl
add: Replaces improvised shotguns with Pipeguns (with a special variant for those willing to go through arbitrary bullshit to acquire it and sheer good luck).
add: Now all guns can be set to misfire and swap ammunition.
add: Misfire chance is incremental as you fire the weapon, and not a flat static chance. This can be reset by using a piece of cloth on the gun and 10 seconds of cleaning.
balance: This has been applied to the detective revolver, but it only increments while using .357 bullets.
add: Guns can have damage multipliers attached for the bullets they fire. The pipegun (but not the regal version) is the first example with a 75% damage output.
balance: The Ice Hermit now has a regal pipegun instead of a Mosin Nagant.
balance: The bandolier fits 7.62mm.
balance: You can construct receivers and rifle stocks in the crafting menu.
balance: Detaches the magical rifles from the boltaction subtype, since they are just basically not using any variables attached to that subtype and made from a series of early returns.

Expose kotlinc's -Xfriend-paths to all jvm/android kt rules under the attribute 'assocates=' (#465)

Associates lets a library associate it self to other libraries, making them part of the same module. This is constrained such that while multiple libraries may be associated, they must all shard the same module, and so cannot associate to anything that is part of a different module. These module relationships are in the bazel build graph, not the contents of the jars as such.

This module membership is transitive (within the above-mentioned constraint), though strict-deps would stop that. Also, only kotlin targets can be associated.

Per discussions across several media, the name "associates" was chosen over "friends" (despite the kotlinc flag being -Xfriend-paths) as that is the terminology used in the gradle kotlin plugin, which is kotlin's primary delivery vehicle, and to avoid confusion with the C++ friends concepts. The pre-existing "friends" attribute is preserved for backward compatibility with a warning. Future PR will add a flag to turn off that support, and then we'll delete it.

kt_jvm_import does not include this facility, but these can just set their module_name in common to participate.

Android should work, but because kt_android_* is a macro not a rule, the implicit target //my/android/library:mytarget_kt should be friended, since it has a KtJvmInfo. The //my/android/library will macro-resolve into an android_library. Until the android rules get the right kind of love, such that we can make a rule that has KtJvmInfo AND android-whatever providers, this simply is a known limitation we'll have to live with.

Also, the prior implementation shoved the full transitive closure (all jars, kotlin or no) of the friend= into the -Xfriends-paths flag, which is awful. This PR does break that, in case people were relying on that by some oddity. The fix is to just add the targets directly.

Fixes #211

Action rewrite

>500 lines to <150. 2 years progress makes a difference. This rewrite feels super basic, and that's cause it is. It's super easy (now) to do this compared to 2 years ago. I'm still writing 500 line things, but they're not boring-to-edit super repetitive things.

2 years goes from >500 lines for a stupid basic sentence generator to >500 lines for a feature-rich Game of Life web app with saving, loading, downloading, uploading, and more

Still maybe 2 years ago I shouldn't have wrote that bad? It was literally just a bunch of if/else statements and a bit of string manipulation, as in the tiniest bit. I remember thinking there was probably a way to do what this commit did 2 years ago, but I didn't know what that way would be. Ahh, the time before I knew what objects or arrays were. Not a very good time actually. Now is much better.

Fix mounts being usable after a disk is ejected

This probably fails "responsible disclosure", but it's not an RCE and
frankly the whole bug is utterly hilarious so here we are...

It's possible to open a file on a disk drive and continue to read/write
to them after the disk has been removed:

    local disk = peripheral.find("drive")
    local input = fs.open(fs.combine(disk.getMountPath(), "stream"), "rb")
    local output = fs.open(fs.combine(disk.getMountPath(), "stream"), "wb")
    disk.ejectDisk()

    -- input/output can still be interacted with.

This is pretty amusing, as now it allows us to move the disk somewhere
else and repeat - we've now got a private tunnel which two computers can
use to communicate.

Fixing this is intuitively quite simple - just close any open files
belonging to this mount. However, this is where things get messy thanks
to the wonderful joy of how CC's streams are handled.

As things stand, the filesystem effectively does the following flow::
 - There is a function `open : String -> Channel' (file modes are
   irrelevant here).

 - Once a file is opened, we transform it into some <T extends
   Closeable>. This is, for instance, a BufferedReader.

 - We generate a "token" (i.e. FileSystemWrapper<T>), which we generate
   a week reference to and map it to a tuple of our Channel and T. If
   this token is ever garbage collected (someone forgot to call close()
   on a file), then we close our T and Channel.

 - This token and T are returned to the calling function, which then
   constructs a Lua object.

The problem here is that if we close the underlying Channel+T before the
Lua object calls .close(), then it won't know the underlying channel is
closed, and you get some pretty ugly errors (e.g. "Stream Closed"). So
we've moved the "is open" state into the FileSystemWrapper<T>.

The whole system is incredibly complex at this point, and I'd really
like to clean it up. Ideally we could treat the HandleGeneric as the
token instead - this way we could potentially also clean up
FileSystemWrapperMount.

BBut something to play with in the future, and not when it's 10:30pm.

All this wall of text, and this isn't the only bug I've found with disks
