i have nothing to say about this problem

This problem took SO damn long. It is really hard so I didnt really expect to come up with the solution on my own, but what the hell. Even just understanding the solution is hard. The math at the beginning is super annoying. Its basically an mid level amc question with grunt work mixed in with annoying implementation. After rereading a thousand diff solutions, I somewhat understood what to do.

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bon-appetit/problem

Two friends Anna and Brian, are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. Each will only pay for the items they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion. You must determine if his calculation is correct.

For example, assume the bill has the following prices: . Anna declines to eat item  which costs . If Brian calculates the bill correctly, Anna will pay . If he includes the cost of , he will calculate . In the second case, he should refund  to Anna.

Function Description

Complete the bonAppetit function in the editor below. It should print Bon Appetit if the bill is fairly split. Otherwise, it should print the integer amount of money that Brian owes Anna.

bonAppetit has the following parameter(s):

bill: an array of integers representing the cost of each item ordered
k: an integer representing the zero-based index of the item Anna doesn't eat
b: the amount of money that Anna contributed to the bill
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the number of items ordered and the -based index of the item that Anna did not eat.
The second line contains  space-separated integers  where .
The third line contains an integer, , the amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her share of the bill.

Constraints

The amount of money due Anna will always be an integer
Output Format

If Brian did not overcharge Anna, print Bon Appetit on a new line; otherwise, print the difference (i.e., ) that Brian must refund to Anna. This will always be an integer.

Sample Input 0

Explanation 0
Anna didn't eat item , but she shared the rest of the items with Brian. The total cost of the shared items is  and, split in half, the cost per person is . Brian charged her  for her portion of the bill. We print the amount Anna was overcharged, , on a new line.

This email was a joke about my old Unix professor

... from community college, Bernie Cosell ... he had the 8th email
address on the internet. That was circa 2006 and I was a real shit who
didn't pay attention at all. Basically, i had Stage 4 Dunning-Kruger,
coupled with a "Golden Boy" complex.

These days, I'd give anything just to see emacs open on someone's
laptop, but I live in Roanoke, so it's been *literally 7 years* since
that's happened... It's unbelievable the number of hours i've spent
googling things that I just didn't have the "magic words" to query. Ahhh
social isolation...

... anyways

[varnish] overload the binaries with scripts

This is a follow-up of #9914. The now current approach works well EXCEPT
when people exec into the container with `bash` or whatever since the
entrypoint can't work it magic.

So, the blunt approach is to create a series of trampoline scripts that
will just add `-n /var/lib/varnish` before all arguments. It's not super
elegant, and I'm not a fan of overloading `PATH` but:
- it works transparently
- you can easily bypass the trampoline by using the binary's absolute
  path

I decided against generating the scripts from the `Dockerfile`s to avoid
escape hell, but I can be convinced otherwise if it makes reviews
easier.
