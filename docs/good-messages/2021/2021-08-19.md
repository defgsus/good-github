Nice big refactor of Experience component,
got this work experience data on firebase.

loaded this data, using grid we now
have a two pain smart / dumb component
window display, where companies ive worked for
are displayed on left and when a selection is made,
job info and responsiblities are shown on right.

Added a timeout for loading screens across the
site, so these dont flash for a milisecond, in cases
where user has already navigated to the page once.
need to make the fns that call firestore async, so
we dont have cases where timeout finishes, but
documents havent been retrieved from snapshot.

fixed some quality of life / responsiveness things
across the site, such as margin issue with avatar
img on homepage.

Decently Large Overhaul

Please look through the code before merging. I am relatively new to Java and may have made dumb mistakes. Below is a changelog of everything I've done.

A couple things to also note:
- Any code I've added should be well commented as to help with any issues that may arise.
- This has not been tested outside of localhost and some usage of Clumsy.
- Again, I'm relatively new and can make stupid mistakes.

Changelog:

Combat -

AimAssistF:
- Added inside vehicle exempt (while in a vehicle useless rotation packets are sent. mojang best)
AimAssistI:
- Added teleport exempt (can false while teleporting)
- Added small buffer (still falses a lot. The check itself needs work. I dont do combat stuff, so cant help you there)
VelocityB:
- New check
- Simply not stable enough yet to put as the main velocity check, but I am unable to improve it myself. Attempted to use "prediction" to
an extent. Once the player has above 200ms it is just absolutely destroyed. Capable of detecting 99.99999% velocity at 0 ping at the 20th
velocity tick, sure, but ping just kills it.

Movement -

FastClimbA:
- Added velocity support to the non-buffer part
FlyA:
- Completely redid the check
- Using the generic vertical friction design with likely overcomplicated code. Same required air ticks as previous FlyA, but no buffer.
- Accounts for fall speed too (untested)
- Partial velocity support
- Despite using the same methods as VelocityB, it is pretty stable with high ping (tested with Clumsy on localhost, 300 ping)
- NOTE: It may require a small buffer. This has not been tested in a proper environment. Use with caution.
FlyB:
- Completely redid the check
- Should detect most air jumps much easier as its more strict (permanently saves going down until you touch the ground rather than just
looking at the previous)
FlyC:
- Instead of running the modulo again, I used the util that is already in the PositionProcessor
- Added a backup version of the same check which also checks for an air block below. Should not be false-able, so can have no buffer. May
not always be flagged, but a 0 buffer check is nice.
FlyD:
- New check
- Modulo checks can be bypassed by stable flying at .0 of a block or something else that the modulo will return 0.0 for. Due to this,
this check checks for air blocks below the player. They arent really quick and may take longer than FlyC in some scenarios, but its a
good backup to cover stable flights
JesusA:
- Fixed false positive of walking on things like lilypads over water falsing, but it may lead to a bypass where you can walk on water
if you walk along a wall.
MotionA:
- Added Near Vehicle exemption
MotionB:
- I didnt change anything but I do want to mention that its irrelevant now. FlyA includes the same type of check. The only possible
difference where MotionB catches something that FlyA doesnt is the exemptions.
MotionC:
- Added climable exemption
- Changed maxHighJump velocity addition from 5 ticks to 10 ticks after. Occasional falses at 5.
MotionE:
- Completely redid the check
- Should be more accurate, needs testing TODO
- Looking at the code, Im not even completely sure what some of it does anymore. I coded it late at night at 3 am and am not sure why
theres things like "if (deltaY != lastDeltaY)" in all honesty, but it works well.
SpeedA:
- Completely redid the check
- Added velocity handling

Player -

HandB:
- New check
- Fastplace check based off of speed and consistency. If its a consistent block place speed and under 190ms between placements, its
likely fastplace
ProtocolB:
- Should have fixed issues with Retrooper deprecating in latest PacketEvents
ProtocolK:
- New check
- Checks for noRotateSet, aka refusing the rotation sent by teleport packets
- Uses the new teleport manager (read section below)

Anticheat Base -

PositionProcessor:
- Switched the main handle to use Vector3d. Potential performance save.
- Much more accurate new teleport handler.
- Much better (and more complicated) blockNearHead detection
RotationProcessor:
- Added WrappedPacketOutPosition handler to get yaw/pitch on teleport.
VelocityProcessor:
- Switched the main handle to use Vector3d. Potential performance save.
PlayerUtil:
- Stole an easy method for grabbing blocks near the player from FlappyAC. left a comment crediting where I grabbed it from
Config:
- Only thing I want to note is I added a new theme called Skidusa. For a bit I skidded Medusa (Tecnio gave me permission LOL) and thats
how I learned things about anticheats. Its now rotting in an archived and abandoned repository on my account. This theme is just
something I want to stay as a reference to how I started.
Pom.xml:
- Switched Medusa onto latest PacketEvents. This helps patch a lot of disablers/exploits. Glad, you shouldve done this months ago.

Smart advertising

Hi, I am Bashir Ebrahimi from Iran. I came up with an idea for blockchain and smart contracts, this idea can be very effective and can be easily implemented for many jobs in the world and anywhere in the world. I have studied and experienced blockchains and cryptocurrencies for years to come up with this idea, now this idea is my dream and can even increase the value of your company. In return for implementing this important idea and project, I want to partner with each other and enjoy the benefits of a partnership with a lifetime contract, because implementing this project will always be profitable and efficient. And that for each stadium or team in which the advertisement is done, a token or a special Cryptocurrency is produced and paid to the companies that provide the advertisement by proving the shares, and thus the income, quality and number of advertisements. Increases and also the desired currency becomes valuable. With the implementation of this project, billboards will no longer be limited to one ad, and each billboard can be assigned to one ad from one company, thus giving more ads to the places where the ads are displayed, as well as increasing their income and thus fame. And the speed of introducing companies increases and their income also increases. This idea is very valuable and can save even sports clubs from bankruptcy in this situation of coronavirus and other cases and increase their income and even boost many businesses and companies and other businesses.
I wanted to name this idea smart advertising, because smart advertising not only on digital billboards in stadiums and other places, but everywhere and everywhere in the world, including social networks. And media will also be playable and executable. Smart advertising can be both revenue-generating. These ideas or advertisements can be in the form of a token or a special currency to be traded with.

By implementing this idea, it is possible to expand advertisements everywhere and everywhere, except for digital billboards on sites and everywhere, automatically and online, and this will help to generate more revenue and introduce advertisers, as well as to all displays. Advertisers also generate high revenue, which means increasing the value of blockchain and the value of businesses and their revenue and unlimited economies around the world.
And that for each stadium or team in which the advertisement is done, a token or a special Cryptocurrency is produced and paid to the companies that provide the advertisement by proving the shares, and thus the income, quality and number of advertisements. Increases and also the desired currency becomes valuable. With the implementation of this project, billboards will no longer be limited to one ad, and each billboard can be assigned to one ad from one company, thus giving more ads to the places where the ads are displayed, as well as increasing their income and thus fame. And the speed of introducing companies increases and their income also increases.
Of course, I previously emailed the idea to support@ethereum.org but received no response.

Revamp and move to TypeScript (#898)

## Breaking changes

- Require **Node >= 8.10.0 and npm 5.6.0**
- Move to **Electron 8.1.1**.
- That's it. Lots of care went into breaking CLI & programmatic behavior
  as little as possible. **Please report regressions**.
- Known issue: build may fail behind a proxy. Get in touch if you use one:
  https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/907#issuecomment-596144768

## Changes summary

Nativefier didn't get much love recently, to the point that it's
becoming hard to run on recent Node, due to old dependencies.
Also, some past practices now seem weird, as better expressible
by modern JS/TS, discouraging contributions including mine.

Addressing this, and one thing leading to another, came a
bigger-than-expected revamp, aiming at making Nativefier more
**lean, stable, future-proof, user-friendly and dev-friendly**,
while **not changing the CLI/programmatic interfaces**. Highlights:

- **Require Node>=8**, as imposed by many of our dependencies. Node 8
  is twice LTS, and easily available even in conservative Linux distros.
  No reason not to demand it.
- **Default to Electron 8**.
- **Bump** all dependencies to latest version, including electron-packager.
- **Move to TS**. TS is great. As of today, I see no reason not to use it,
  and fight interface bugs at runtime rather than at compile time.
  With that, get rid of everything Babel/Webpack.
- **Move away from Gulp**. Gulp's selling point is perf via streaming,
  but for small builds like Nativefier, npm tasks are plenty good
  and less dependency bloat. Gulp was the driver for this PR: broken
  on Node 12, and I didn't feel like just upgrading and keeping it.
- Add tons of **verbose logs** everywhere it makes sense, to have a
  fine & clear trace of the program flow. This will be helpful to
  debug user-reported issues, and already helped me fix a few bugs.
    - With better simple logging, get rid of the quirky and buggy
      progress bar based on package `progress`. Nice logging (minimal
      by default, the verbose logging mentioned above is only used
      when passing `--verbose`) is better and one less dependency.
- **Dump `async` package**, a relic from old callback-hell early Node.
  Also dump a few other micro-packages unnecessary now.
- A first pass of code **cleanup** thanks to modern JS/TS features:
  fixes, simplifications, jsdoc type annotations to types, etc.
- **Remove GitHub integrations Hound & CodeClimate**, which are more
  exotic than good'ol'linters, and whose signal-to-noise ratio is too low.
- Quality: **Add tests** and add **Windows + macOS CI builds**.
  Also, add a **manual test script**, helping to quickly verify the
  hard-to-programatically-test stuff before releases, and limit regressions.
- **Fix a very small number of existing bugs**. The goal of this PR was
  *not* to fix bugs, but to get Nativefier in better shape to do so.
  Bugfixes will come later. Still, these got addressed:
  - Add common `Alt`+`Left`/`Right` for previous/next navigation.
  - Improve #379: fix zoom with `Ctrl` + numpad `+`/`-`
  - Fix pinch-to-zoom (see https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/379#issuecomment-598612128 )

Update README.md

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

This project essentially utilizes Python to read a list of products saved to a .txt file, organize them, and output how many products were purchased, albeit through printing out the entire list of products, a specific product searched for by the user, or printing the full list with a histogram of each amount purchased.

What did you do particularly well:

The menu in C++ was updated a few times to ensure it was as symmetrical as I could make it. I also utilized the string method for the menu instead of typing out a lot = symbols for cout << string(50, "=") as an example. This is much better than typing a cout statement with 50 = symbols. The next thing I would say was the actual Python scripts. I haven't played with Python much in a while since most of my focus has been on C++ as of late.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on:

One thing I would do is implement an algorithm that essentially guesses which product a user is searching for in case perhaps they misspell or leave off a character. For example in the current code, if a user searches for "Apple," the program does not find "Apples" in the list because the "s" is missing. This would make the program much more efficient considering the use does not know exactly how a product was typed in. Another useful tool could be implement a "most popular" product that output the highest sold product, and eventually scale the program to include time frames, specific types of product, etc.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network:

The most challenging were probably some of the python scripts. I had to go back a few times to attain correct syntax here and there due to my not using Python for a while. The next was getting the algorithm working correctly. I primarily relied on Google and Stackoverflow for assistance with the algorithm, but once it was implemented correctly everything worked great.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work:

The troubleshooting and error handling can be used in any project. However, one particular skill learned from this project would be actually integrating two languages to solve complex problems. It most likely would have been a very long time before I even looked into having two languages communicate with each other. This project helped shine some light on some very cool things that can be accomplished.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable:

I made the program maintainable by using proper comments explaining what functions or a specific block of code does. This way if I ever come back to it, I will know exactly what was done and why. I made it readable by maintaining those comments as well as using proper spacing and tabbing. Loops, if statements, specific lines of code, etc. are all spaced out, as keeping everything bundled together would look incredibly ugly and hard to read.

lib/list_sort: optimize number of calls to comparison function

CONFIG_RETPOLINE has severely degraded indirect function call
performance, so it's worth putting some effort into reducing the number
of times cmp() is called.

This patch avoids badly unbalanced merges on unlucky input sizes.  It
slightly increases the code size, but saves an average of 0.2*n calls to
cmp().

x86-64 code size 739 -> 803 bytes (+64)

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of low-hanging fruit in a merge sort;
it already performs only n*log2(n) - K*n + O(1) compares.  The leading
coefficient is already at the theoretical limit (log2(n!) corresponds to
K=1.4427), so we're fighting over the linear term, and the best
mergesort can do is K=1.2645, achieved when n is a power of 2.

The differences between mergesort variants appear when n is *not* a
power of 2; K is a function of the fractional part of log2(n).  Top-down
mergesort does best of all, achieving a minimum K=1.2408, and an average
(over all sizes) K=1.248.  However, that requires knowing the number of
entries to be sorted ahead of time, and making a full pass over the
input to count it conflicts with a second performance goal, which is
cache blocking.

Obviously, we have to read the entire list into L1 cache at some point,
and performance is best if it fits.  But if it doesn't fit, each full
pass over the input causes a cache miss per element, which is
undesirable.

While textbooks explain bottom-up mergesort as a succession of merging
passes, practical implementations do merging in depth-first order: as
soon as two lists of the same size are available, they are merged.  This
allows as many merge passes as possible to fit into L1; only the final
few merges force cache misses.

This cache-friendly depth-first merge order depends on us merging the
beginning of the input as much as possible before we've even seen the
end of the input (and thus know its size).

The simple eager merge pattern causes bad performance when n is just
over a power of 2.  If n=1028, the final merge is between 1024- and
4-element lists, which is wasteful of comparisons.  (This is actually
worse on average than n=1025, because a 1204:1 merge will, on average,
end after 512 compares, while 1024:4 will walk 4/5 of the list.)

Because of this, bottom-up mergesort achieves K < 0.5 for such sizes,
and has an average (over all sizes) K of around 1.  (My experiments show
K=1.01, while theory predicts K=0.965.)

There are "worst-case optimal" variants of bottom-up mergesort which
avoid this bad performance, but the algorithms given in the literature,
such as queue-mergesort and boustrodephonic mergesort, depend on the
breadth-first multi-pass structure that we are trying to avoid.

This implementation is as eager as possible while ensuring that all
merge passes are at worst 1:2 unbalanced.  This achieves the same
average K=1.207 as queue-mergesort, which is 0.2*n better then
bottom-up, and only 0.04*n behind top-down mergesort.

Specifically, defers merging two lists of size 2^k until it is known
that there are 2^k additional inputs following.  This ensures that the
final uneven merges triggered by reaching the end of the input will be
at worst 2:1.  This will avoid cache misses as long as 3*2^k elements
fit into the cache.

(I confess to being more than a little bit proud of how clean this code
turned out.  It took a lot of thinking, but the resultant inner loop is
very simple and efficient.)

IPC implementation working

Finally completed the implementation of the IPC protocol!! :)
Many files were modified, but it was all because the IPC protocol needed
a major restructure of almost everything.

The protocol works like so:
There's a server, that will be generating sudoku boards when requested,
with the specifications requested. Then, there's the client, that will
be requesting said board to the server. This is all done through a TCP
socket connection.

The protocol works like so:
1. The connection is established between the client and the server.
2. The client sends the properties of the wanted sudoku. The properties
are the size, represented through a 1 byte unsigned integer, that will
set the dimensions of the board (the board will always be squared), and
the difficulty, represented as another 1 byte integer, that will set how
many blank spaces will be left.
2. The server processes the properties requested by the client and
generates the according board.
3. The data is converted from a sudokuBoard class to a sbFile struct to
minimize the amount of data needed to be sent.
4. The server sends the board data to the client and the connection is
closed.
5. The client then uses the data in any way it wants (for now, we're
just printing the board).

Implementing all of this was a real pain as I had 0 previous experience
with networking, but thanks to Boost Asio's amazing tutorial and the
awesome sehe from
stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/users/85371/sehe), I was able
to accomplish this :)

Fix staging shader and texture reference for copy size

For a very stupid reason, `shaderc` will silently ignore the entry point
specification in GLSL mode. Thanks, for nothing. Okay, with that
resolved we use a hacky solution for virtually rewriting one of the
methods to main because I want to change shader very little when moving
the naga eventually. Well, probably going to result in a full rewrite to
some other language and this will be in vain but fuck it. shaderc gives
me stupid code, I make more stupid code.

Anyways, we're now using a temporary texture because the validation
layer does not permit us from attaching a texture when we're also
writing to it through its storage binding. That seems sensible (even
though we disable write in pipeline operations) so instead we waste some
memory on a transient texture that the GPU knows we won't read and that
we never initialize, hopefully good enough.

This leaves us with 'only' some weird memory reinterpretation happening
by our round trips but the main code is now GO.

Fly-by fixed a bug where I had resolve the size of a register's texture
by using the DeviceTexture as an index into the ImageBufferMap. Which
doesn't have any idea of device textures and doesn't care so this was
incorrect and finally triggered an out-of-bounds instead of causing more
head-ache in the future. Remove that read in favor of good encapsulation
and we now go through the strongly typed `Register` as an index.

gdb: make string-like set show commands use std::string variable

String-like settings (var_string, var_filename, var_optional_filename,
var_string_noescape) currently take a pointer to a `char *` storage
variable (typically global) that holds the setting's value.  I'd like to
"mordernize" this by changing them to use an std::string for storage.

An obvious reason is that string operations on std::string are often
easier to write than with C strings.  And they avoid having to do any
manual memory management.

Another interesting reason is that, with `char *`, nullptr and an empty
string often both have the same meaning of "no value".  String settings
are initially nullptr (unless initialized otherwise).  But when doing
"set foo" (where `foo` is a string setting), the setting now points to
an empty string.  For example, solib_search_path is nullptr at startup,
but points to an empty string after doing "set solib-search-path".  This
leads to some code that needs to check for both to check for "no value".
Or some code that converts back and forth between NULL and "" when
getting or setting the value.  I find this very error-prone, because it
is very easy to forget one or the other.  With std::string, we at least
know that the variable is not "NULL".  There is only one way of
representing an empty string setting, that is with an empty string.

I was wondering whether the distinction between NULL and "" would be
important for some setting, but it doesn't seem so.  If that ever
happens, it would be more C++-y and self-descriptive to use
optional<string> anyway.

Actually, there's one spot where this distinction mattered, it's in
init_history, for the test gdb.base/gdbinit-history.exp.  init_history
sets the history filename to the default ".gdb_history" if it sees that
the setting was never set - if history_filename is nullptr.  If
history_filename is an empty string, it means the setting was explicitly
cleared, so it leaves it as-is.  With the change to std::string, this
distinction doesn't exist anymore.  This can be fixed by moving the code
that chooses a good default value for history_filename to
_initialize_top.  This is ran before -ex commands are processed, so an
-ex command can then clear that value if needed (what
gdb.base/gdbinit-history.exp tests).

Another small improvement, in my opinion is that we can now easily
give string parameters initial values, by simply initializing the global
variables, instead of xstrdup-ing it in the _initialize function.

In Python and Guile, when registering a string-like parameter, we
allocate (with new) an std::string that is owned by the param_smob (in
Guile) and the parmpy_object (in Python) objects.

This patch started by changing all relevant add_setshow_* commands to
take an `std::string *` instead of a `char **` and fixing everything
that failed to build.  That includes of course all string setting
variable and their uses.

string_option_def now uses an std::string also, because there's a
connection between options and settings (see
add_setshow_cmds_for_options).

The add_path function in source.c is really complex and twisted, I'd
rather not try to change it to work on an std::string right now.
Instead, I added an overload that copies the std:string to a `char *`
and back.  This means more copying, but this is not used in a hot path
at all, so I think it is acceptable.
