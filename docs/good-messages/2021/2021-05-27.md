Simplify bot error handling

Allow in DM

More files out of constants

Remove hardcoded guild/channel

moved all constants into one json file, starting to reorganize file structure for refactor

made distinct folders for bot code and data, running is now done through main.py

slowly moving everything away from one file

pulled more commands out of __init__.py

also made new files for various other commands

moved some functions from constants to utils

made some commands dm-only, as intended

changed the way lookupstudent worked so that it doesn't depend on client

stuff-moving-to-other-files complete

namespace got a little polluted in commands.py so i changed an import

obviously i can't test some of the commands like verification, but the bot *should* be functional

on_message is so much shorter lol

rewrote and tested all functions, should be mostly functional

maybe more robust testing is needed, with multiple accounts?

addressed most of the comments that nathan had

added preliminary database stuff

added some participation point stuff

left some TODOs for later

gitignored db and log because it sucks having to clear them every time

100th commit!!

forgot to git add the files

participation points and solve points working

changed pretty much everything to embeds to look nicer

definitely doing to refactor stuff later but this *works* so i'm leaving it

manual accept and review working!

still needs more refactoring

cleaned up code for accept/reject/solve, should be production-ready

generated a new access token for the b01lers-ctf github account

changed around the responses a bit

yeet points working

changed the accept/reject command to be more consistent in behavior

i keep looking back at my code and going 'omg this is garbage'

magic numbers begone

skeleton for github stuff

the stuff that's important should be working

and the stuff that isn't is still in progress

can put user id instead of pinging for most commands, fixed some edge cases involving database

now mentions user on validation

quick fix for handling request

forgot a few variables

added !leaderboard for top 10, changed same code to be consistent with new intents feature

forgot to switch back to prod file

qol changes and bugfixes

forgot to remove testing file again

Add venv/ to .gitignore

Add voice points functionality

Also add varargs to B01lersBotClient constructor to be able to
initialize the bot with intents for testing.

Add database backup each day

Add database backup each day

Update constants.py

forgot to remove test file *again*

Update backup.py

Update solve.py

Add database constants and functions for link aggregation

Add link commands

Increase passive aggressiveness

#### Thursday 2021-05-27 10:05:45 by Marko Grdinić

"9:45am. I am up. Let me chill a little.

9:50am. No reply to the issue I've opened. This is going to be harsh. I'll have to get creative with my use of PyTorch.

10:20am. Let me finish the chapter I am reading and then I will start. I have only 15 chapters of Katahane No Riku left, so I am looking for new things.

10:25am. Let me start.

Hmmmm, what am I going to do? Well, for starters let me make the example from yesterday work. I had some time to think about how to make it effective.

```py
class VarianceMatch(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        y = f(x)
        y_grad_fn = y.grad_fn
        ctx.save_for_backward(x,y,y_grad_fn)
        return y

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_y):
        x,y,y_grad_fn = ctx.saved_tensors
        y_grad_fn.backward(grad_y)
        x.grad *= torch.sqrt(torch.square(grad_y).sum(1) / torch.square(x.grad).sum(1))
        return None
```

Let me go with this. It is worth a try.

```py
y_grad_fn(ctx,grad_y)
```

Ah, maybe like this.

```py
        print(x)
        y = f(x)
        print(y)
        y_grad_fn = y.grad_fn
```

This is trouble. Doing the foward here does not give me the backward function. No doubt, this is on purpose.

Hmmm...I guess it makes sense. This allows me to easily reuse the forward primitives, if it really did give me the backward in the forward, that would just be overwritten anyway.

10:45am. Can I even implement what I want within the constraints PyTorch is giving me? No, not like this.

I am going to have to get that `y_grad_fn` somehow. Otherwise, I can get to work writing my own library.

Let me ask on the PyTorch forums.

https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/what-are-hooks-used-for/40020

> You could pass a function as the hook to register_hook, which will be called every time the gradient is calculated. This might be useful for debugging purposes, e.g. just printing the gradient or its statistics, or you could of course manipulate the gradient in a custom way, e.g. normalizing it somehow etc.

Oh, this is interesting.

https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.Tensor.register_hook

This is not flexible enough for me. I am not sure how to use it anyway.

```py
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function

# Is meant to be arbitrary.
def f(x):
    return x*2

class VarianceMatch(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        y = f(x)
        y_grad_fn = y.grad_fn # Results in None
        ctx.save_for_backward(x,y,y_grad_fn)
        return y

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_y):
        x,y,y_grad_fn = ctx.saved_tensors
        y_grad_fn(ctx,grad_y)
        x.grad *= torch.sqrt(torch.square(grad_y).sum(1) / torch.square(x.grad).sum(1))
        return None

i = torch.scalar_tensor(2,requires_grad=True)
x = VarianceMatch.apply(i)
x.backward(torch.scalar_tensor(1))
print(i.grad)
```

Let me post this on the forum so I can ask how to do this.

11:15am. https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/how-to-implement-a-function-whose-input-and-output-vectors-have-the-same-gradient-variance/122529

11:20am. Ok, what the hell do I do now? Is there anything I can do? I can think of some way using hooks, but that is basically it. I am not sure how to feel about adding hooks on the forward pass. Can I have a hook unregister itself?

11:30am. Now I am reading the isekai thread.

11:35am. Focus me. Let me try the hook idea. Let's not waste the entire day today.

```py
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function

class VarianceMatch(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        y = x * 2
        def h(grad):
            print(y.grad)
            print(grad)
            return grad * torch.sqrt(torch.square(y.grad).sum(1) / torch.square(grad).sum(1))
        x.register_hook(h)
        return y

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_y):
        return grad_y * 2

i = torch.scalar_tensor(2,requires_grad=True)
x = VarianceMatch.apply(i)
x.backward(torch.scalar_tensor(1))
print(i.grad)
```

Let me try this.

No, `y.grad` is not present so that idea is out of the question. I give up. I can't implement this on my own.

Actually, maybe since it is not a leaf node, I should enable the grads for it.

https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/how-do-i-calculate-the-gradients-of-a-non-leaf-variable-w-r-t-to-a-loss-function/5112

Let me try using `retain_grad`.

11:55am. Nope. `y.grad` is simply not there no matter what I do.

12pm. I am just wasting my time here. Let me have breakfast while I think about it. Maybe I will do some research on how to write C++ PyTorch extensions. Right now I am at a dead end, but I can't just spend the whole day doing nothing. I might as well get familiar with PyTorch internals. Maybe this will give me a hint on how to deal with the softmax.

This sucks."

Add Nextcloud major version 21

The biggest improvements Nextcloud Hub 21 introduces are:

  * New High Performance Back-end for Nextcloud Files: Reduces server
    load from desktop clients and web interface polling by 90% while
    delivering instant notifications to users
  * A wide range of performance improvements all over on top, decreasing
    loading times of pages and reducing load on the server
  * Collaborative features: new Whiteboard, author colours in Text and
    Document Templates
  * Nextcloud Talk: Debuts message status indicators, a raise hand
    feature, a group conversation description and more
  * A range of Groupware improvements like drag and drop and nicer
    threading in Mail and syncing social media avatars in Contacts

For more details, the announcement post can be found here:

https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-hub-21-out-with-up-to-10x-better-performance-whiteboard-and-more-collaboration-features/

On our side, we only needed to rebase the no-config-uid-check patch,
which didn't apply because a documentation URL in the code we're
removing has been fixed.

FIXME: Overhaul this commit (note to self: check *every* hunk and
especially remove all those forceEnable flags whenever possible) and
message as soon as there is an official release announcement.

TODO: Reword the paragraph below!

Disable documentserver_community, which is the binary package for
OnlyOffice. The main reason is to avoid hitting the output limit on
Hydra. However, we also want to avoid binary packages nevertheless,
since it's very unlikely that it will work on NixOS anyway.

A metric crapton of changes

Beetburger partly unnerfed (16->12->14)
Cantaloupe nerfed
Toast sandwich buffed
Garlic bread buffed, as this divine substance should be
Caesar salad buffed (though I feel like there should be a separate crouton item made from the toast, so salads aren't unreasonably filling)
Stuffed mushroom buffed
Salmon patties buffed
Fried egg buffed (partly why beet burger was buffed, as this is an ingredient)
Pork lettuce wrap buffed
PB&J buffed
PB banana sandwich buffed
Chili chocolate buffed
Hearty breakfast untouched, it would be a waste of ingredients if nerfed
Maple sausage buffed significantly
Honeycomb chocolate bar nerfed
Fairy bread significantly buffed. Consume the fae.
Chocolate bacon nerfed
Pepperoni nerfed
Non-durian milkshakes buffed
Naan buffed
Paneer tikka masala buffed
Hot and sour soup buffed
Peking duck buffed
Char siu nerfed
Apple fritter nerfed
Creeper cookie buffed significantly. Why it doesn't make you explode or resist explosions, I don't know.
Meatloaf sandwich greatly buffed, somewhat against my judgement but the math checks out
Nether wings untouched, blazes are relatively easy to farm once you find a nether fort, and you get 3 powder per rod.
Cookies and milk buffed
Crackers and derivatives untouched for now, I think crackers should be nerfed and you should get multiple from the recipe (e.g., only 1 shank, but the recipe gives 2).
Lastly, chicken dinner buffed.
Kale list parts dealt with: 1, 2 (partly), 7, 12, 14, 15, 21-25, 27-36, 38, 40.

Summary Changes

-Blackshield synths have been added. These synths focus towards combat, with models ranging from melee, ballistic, and non-lethal. They are faster than soteria synths, but not as insulated as AG synths.
-Blackshield synthetic limbs are now available, they come with the same armor as soteria synthetics but a less chance to malfunction. However, unlike sot limbs, you can't obtain them in round.
-Defibs now log and message admins with the rez sickness levels and stat losses for those who get revived so we can keep track.
-Modified the vision range and aggro vision of hell divers, cerberus, and chimeras to make their AI breaking alot less likely until we get a full patch through, making them far more reliable.
-Fixed an issue with the myrmidon rail pistol so it correctly fires kurtz rail rounds, buffing its power.
-All guild rail guns (myr and reductor) have been massively buffed.
--Reductor rail rifle, +20% damage, higher credit value, more recoil, charge cost per shot reduced by 75%. This makes the rail rifle more like a highly modular high impact rifle with somewhat slow fire speed, much better for frontline fighting.
--Myrmidon rail pistol, recoil increased, charged cost per shot reduced by 50%, fire delay reduced by 45%. Damage mildly buffed due fixing a pathing issue with bullet assignment.
-The conselour stun gun now has its fire modes set to the hand menu, making it easier to switch between taster, stunbolt, and stunshot.
-Implanted arm smg buffed to make it on par with a wirbel wind, giving it good 1 handed suppression ability, moderate damage, amazing recoil control, but shit armor penetration.
-Syndicate storm trooper gunslinger damage buffed due to kurtz ammo fix.

Always use reflect.Values, fix numbers.

Rather than passing around interface{}s everywhere, convert from
interface{} once and use a reflect.Value. This ensures we don't lose any
information about whether a value can be set or not, because
reflect.ValueOf(pointerToStruct).FieldByName("NonPointerField") can be
set but reflect.ValueOf(pointerToStruct.NonPointerField) cannot be.
Easiest just to use reflect.Values everywhere internally.

Numbers were panicking when trying to set them because *big.Float was a
nil pointer. Special-case numbers, allowing provider devs to use any of
the built-in number types, and manually set them, rather than letting
tftypes.Value.As do it for us. This took a lot of work and I am in a
blood feud with the math/big package and also architecture-specific int
sizes (why is the size of an int accessible through the strconv
package?)

Options gained an AllowRoundingNumbers option so we can decide later
whether we want to round or throw an error when provider devs try to put
a value in a type that it won't fit in. Rounding seems nice until you
remember that Terraform hates rounding with a fiery passion that eats
away at its soul. Errors seem nice until you remember my blood feud with
the math/big package.

Primitives got tests. Well, strings. Same difference, really.

Objects got tests. Started getting tests. Then I got distracted with
numbers.

Into is now into, with Into calling into. Recursion hurts my brain. This
is so we can accept an interface{} but recurse on reflect.Values.
