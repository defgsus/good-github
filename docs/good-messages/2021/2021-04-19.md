GET commits by query str w/auth w/@octokit/rest

To be honest, this was a nightmare because of the naming of Octokit
packages and how their docs are similar. I really don't want to get
into it right now (I'll let the all-caps speak for itself), but the
takeaway is this:

I WENT WITH PACKAGE `@octokit/rest` FOR GETTING COMMITS, HOWEVER!!!
`@octokit/rest` IS NOT IN ANY WAY `@octokit/core` WHICH IS THE ONE
I USE TO PULL MY REPOS.

Despite how the docs (https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v18) and package repos
without a close look can make them seem similar, the way constructors
of the respective octokit instances and the methods called on it
are entirely different. And in my opinion the `@core` way is much
more confusing than `@rest`, and not as well documented. For now I
will stick with using them for seperate calls, but I may refactor the
`core` one to `rest` later.

Anyways...

With doing the REST package, I decided to finally get around to
adding a token for GH auth. And by decide, the search API requires it.
I then can use that `octokit` instance to do `octokit.search.commits`
and query things under my name. I hardcoded the repo and query for now,
because I tend to try hardcoded examples first. Before merging I will
paramterize the repo and query, or at least the query, depending on
further decisions.

Lastly, I qualified the data sent back in the commits, which I should
do for my repos later.

Addresses #31 (Query repo information from `Repo FC` searchbar from backend)
Addresses #34 (Filter data from returned GitHub API calls)
Project: 'Search GItHub API of my repos'

#### Monday 2021-04-19 11:09:24 by Alexander Batischev

Add LcCtypeEnvVar, a specialization of EnvVar("LC_CTYPE")

Like TzEnvVar, this subclass enforces the use of `on_change` handler
that calls `setlocale`.

Some of our tests also check the result of `setlocale`, skipping the
test if the locale couldn't be set. I wanted to fold that into
`LcCtypeEnvVar::set()`, but this proved to be ugly: to change the return
type of `set()`, I'd have to change the base class, but then:

1. I'd have to pick an arbitrary default result for `set()` when no
   `on_change` handler is set (which is the majority of the cases);
2. something would have to be done about handlers that return nothing.
   `TzEnvVar` is an example of that, because `tzset` itself never fails.
   I thought I'd provide two `on_change` overloads, one for `bool(..)`
   and one for `void(..)`, with the latter being just a wrapper that
   always returns the arbitrary value (say, `true`) -- but that's ugly.

As an alternative, I could make `EnvVar` a template class parameterized
by the handler's return type. I could then change the return type of
`set()` in unison, and also replace `EnvVar` constructor with one that
requires an `on_change` handler, eliminating the need for the arbitrary
default result. This would complicate `EnvVar`, though.

Since both approaches seemed ugly and/or complicated, and they'll only
save us like 3 lines of code, I decided against implementing them.
But I wrote my thoughts down to remember *why* I decided that way :)

Create Best coffee beans for espresso

For many people who live la vida mocha: here's your own go-to. With incredible depth and chocolaty sweetness, then that one packs a wallop you won't forget.
It's probably safe to assume Cuvee Coffee's Karmadillo dark combination espresso is more strong as according to this corporation's website, this tote of dark roast beans"packs enough of a punch to feel as if you were brought back to life." This is fantastic news for those people who are quite literally dead into the world before first sip of strong coffee in the morning touches our spirits.

Central and South American beans associate with black and Ethiopian coffee to generate this batch of best coffee beans espresso for  that's marked with tastes of milk chocolate and caramelized sugar.

Just one shot of coffee brewed from this particular roast may appeal to many sorts of coffee connoisseurs, as the rich, complex flavors are strong enough to endure by themselves, however mix quite well with hot, steamed milk.

Chocolate and peanut butter is, we think, one of the world's great flavor combinations. This Brazilian java delivers a smooth, pleasant expression of the great combo.
Just if its name didn't give it away, Red Bay's Brazilian Cake Lady roast is still a single-origin coffee that awakens from Bahia, Brazil. Why does this thing, you ask? Because a espresso shot made from those ground beans can display the unique variety of flavors only available in java from that region, guaranteeing a purer beverage.

To answer the query that's little doubt in mind -- exactly what do these single-origin beans taste like? -- you'll notice hints of golden raisin, nougat, and citrus zest in this smooth and plump moderate roast. Pay careful attention, and you will pro taste flavors of chocolate, too.

This Brazilian coffee's sweet, cake-like odor will have your mouth watering before your espresso maker's even brewing.

#### Monday 2021-04-19 13:30:26 by Marko Grdinić

"10:15am. I am up. I was restful yesterday so I did not feel like going to bed early, but that ended up straining me. Right now I feel like I haven't gotten enough sleep.

10:20am. I keep iterating what I have to do in my head. Compared to yesterday, I've changed my mind a little.

I realized that the straightforward CFR is not the algorithm I want, instead I should first accumulate counterfactual rewards and then update the policy all at the end. I need to implement this algorithm and compare it to the original. Because this algorithm is closer in nature to the sampling one than the original.

10:30am. Huh, but if this is the right way of doing it, in the NN version, once the value nets absorb the values, how should the policy net samples be weighted?

11:20am. Ugh...I did not think about this problem at all.

It is easy enough in the tabular case to implement whatever algorithm I want. But in the NN version, I will be learning the values. After I learn them, how do I weight the policy net samples?

Suddenly Pure CFR seems a lot more attractive. Maybe I should have gone a step further with that old experiment, instead taken the max of all the values.

11:20am. If I could just learn the value nets and average them to get the policy that will make things a lot easier.

Let me take a look at that Phd I discovered by accident yesterday.

https://github.com/rggibson/open-pure-cfr
Regret Minimization In Games And The Development Of Champion Multiplayer Computer Poker-Playing Agents

Oh great. VS Code has the `Transform to Snake Case` command. Nice find!

11:30am. No, actually, I get how to get the policy values. Sure I might be learning the counterfactual values (divided by the player prob) but once I factor that out, they'll be regular values. Then I should scale the samples as usual.

1:05pm. I am brainstorming like crazy. Let me get breakfast.

2:20pm. Done with breakfast and chores. Let me finally read the thesis. My stress is sky high.

You know what, forget NNs. Forget them for a month or two.

I just realized - to get the baselines, I am not going to be able to train the NNs for the counterfactual values, but the real ones instead.

But just think what sort of problems this gives me.

To get the full equivalence, I'd need to train a NN for the average policy. Then a NN for the policy. Then a NN for the counterfactual values. Then a NN for the actual values.

Just thinking about it hurts me!

I mean, in the damn DREAM paper, they specifically don't train a NN for the avg policy, but average the past ones to lower the approximation error.

But now after this, I have 4 different NNs. Even if I ommit the average policy net, that is still 3.

3 nets who don't have any shared representation. Yes, I should share the representations, but how?

I hate NNs with a passion. I loathe them from the bottom of my heart!

The degree of my understanding is the degree of my connection with these algoriths. I made some progress with the buffer tricks, but that won't be enough.

Of course it is not enough.

Consider those predictive baselines. Since I have the full hidden state, I can just set them to the value directly. What is the analogue of that in the NN space.

In tabular regime, I can easily add and average values together. NNs require a whole compilation pass for the simplest of things. I just can't stand it. I am bashing my head against this wall, and am not getting much in return.

2:30pm. As far as algorithms go, CFR is wonderful. With some effort, I'll be able to make a breakthrough. But NNs...I should leave them out of my plans for now.

I need to focus on thoroughly mastering the tabular case. I'll find the inspiration that I need after that.

3pm. Today I am completely out of it. I am just wasting time.

80/159. This is so tough. Do I really need to be able to replicate these proofs to cause the Singularity? Just what do I have to do to understand this. It is like learning Chinese. Maybe I could do it if I put in the effort, but I know that I simply do not have the time or the energy to properly dedicate myself.

3:05pm. Forget it. Let me do some programming.

Yesterday it was light, but right now I am as stressed as I could be.

I am not in the mood for it at all. But let me just open the editor and copy the project. I'll do it all from scratch. Let me just measure the variance.

I made all sorts of plans, for example with a buffed up CFR algorithm, but now I am just digusted with that because I realized how much complexity this would add on the NN side.

My goals should be as follow:

Verify that the VR MCCFR from the paper works. My implementation has my own tricks, and because of that, clearly things are going wrong.

3:10pm. Based on my understanding, just the thing in the paper should work as well as regular CFR.

Maybe the way I am updating the average policy is wrong? This is one area where I am diverging from how it is done in the paper.

In the paper it is updated outright on line 3. That `(t-1) / t * s + 1 / t s'` is not a form I recognized before, but that thing with the ts is actually how a moving average is conputed inplace. During the night I remembered seeing it in the RL course by Litman and...that black dude.

3:20pm. I can't reason out anything. If I could do this in a braindead fashion like a code monkey, maybe I'd have been more successful.

3:30pm. Forget it. Let me take a nap. I am too angry, pissed and tired to do anything right now. My mindset is completely wrong."

Bug 1704167 - When a pattern ends in whitespace, try to collapse adjacent white-space. r=jfkthame

This I'm not 100% sure. Should be harmless, but it's a bit subtle.
Maybe we should special-case it with "we're at the beginning of the
pattern"? Reasoning below:

The previous patch restores the performance of the original test-case.

However, if you go to the reduced test-case and try to type " re" in the
findbar, we still take a long time. The reason for that is not that the
previous patch is not effective, but that the findbar sends find
requests as soon as you type, and thus we end up with a request to find
" ", which matches a gazillion spaces in the page and causes us to use
tons of memory and time. Finding " re" is actually super-fast :-)

This fixes it, but it is a bit subtle, so thoughts? Perhaps the findbar
should wait a bit to perform the search before sending a query for " "
instead or something? But I'd rather make it fast.

#### Monday 2021-04-19 16:51:44 by Marko Grdinić

"6pm. It is so painful. The pain of not understanding a piece of code is the biggest pain there is. Sigh. I know what I should be doing today, and yet I am overcome by my own limitations.

I want to reason as much as I can. I take pride in going more and more.

Logic is my greatest tool and revel in using it.

But I've reached my limit. I can't do it. I can't understand these ML algorithms by thinking about them. It hurts.

This is the same thing that killed me in high school.

6:05pm. To believe in logic is a curse.

As a kid I tried to reason out the universe and came to the conclussion that it would make more sense if nothing ever existed. Based on the whole that something cannot come out of nothing.

As an adult, in 2019 I made a rigorous study of formal proofs, and what did I discover? Logically, something cannot come out of nothing.

Whenever you have infinities, then the logic breaks down and anything goes.

Logical systems are big on termination checking.

So becoming better at reasoning, only served to deepen the chasm between myself and the universe itself.

6:10pm. I cannot come to an understanding between the view that universe cannot and yet does exist. I cannot mesh the two views. I cannot even imagine what sort of insight would be needed to cross this great chasm of understanding.

My demonic path tells me to assume that the logic is right.

I think this is where my life went wrong. This was my first real loss. When you internalize that you are a living inconsistency, a part of you starts to feel that it is alright to believe in anything.

I wish I lived in an universe whose existence made sense.

A part of me believes in solipsism, even though I don't know what it even is. Deep down I think that only God itself should be conscious being. A part of me believes that this would be justice.

But I have to live with the logical incoherency of me being conscious myself and having to deal with distressing reports of other people reporting being conscious as well.

6:15pm. A part of me due to solipsism as much as trend following believes that the Singularity should happen.

But it is April 2021, and only now am I starting work on sampling CFR. I can barely understand it. Do I really believe I can reach AGI with such a paltry level of understanding and intelligence? Yet, it must happen. Somehow. Just how?

6:20pm. Will years into the future the Singularity not have happened? Will I live out my whole life neither understanding myself nor the universe's existence?

Is the purpose of life the pursuit of happiness rather than power? Would it have been correct to live like an animal and trust my senses more?

6:20pm. For power, rob and cheat and steal...but can you actually steal undertanding the only thing of actual value? Can you cheat intelligence itself? Can you rob the skill of others?

Omnipotence is the greatest purpose, and yet the self improvement loop turns out to be iterative suicide. Necromutation is transcendence.

The demonic dao beckons.

Just how is my mind broken, that I do not understand all the most important things? That I have to live with these regrets? That I cannot summon inspiration as its master, yet live at its whims.

I can't imagine, even if I had a million times higher intelligence than now, how would I make progres on the universe existing problem.

6:30pm. This is my demonic path.

It makes me believe in logic, but confronts me with all the contradictions arising from that. It puts me in a universe that should not exist.

It makes me believe in the puruit of power, but then in a twist reveals that self improvement requires suicide to work. Just to get to it, I'd need to make a human level AI and make its power my own first. It does not tell me how.

It convinces me that both myself and others and animals and teaches me not to trust my senses, yet always in my moments of weakness like now when my reason reaches its end, I can only rely on that and be an animal.

6:35pm. Is this universe really not hell?

This pain I feel right now is surely the pain of not accepting my own limits. My intelligence is not enough, but my path does not allow me such compromises and excuses. My goal is too deeply ingrained to let something like this stop me.

I know deep down that I cannot have power without logic. Stories and superstition are not a substitute for code.

So what if in the future nothing comes to pass in the way that has been forecast. So what if I turn out to be some madman just pushing symbols around.

I cannot deal with the contradictions so the path itself should be responsible for them.

6:45pm. Using is fusing, I really should do some programming, but I am not in the mood right now. It is just too late to start anything. Tomorrow, I am going to forget what I've done so far and focus on getting those sample tests done. That will tell me whether VR MCCFR's variance reduction is working properly.

If not, that will be a huge gain as I will be able to make the agents work. If it does by some chance, things will be quite harder. I'll have to gradually move closer to what the paper says I should be doing."

umabas

Remove other version of VR interfacer: Oculus & Oculus mobile & OpenXR (due to missing Linux so library render, require manual rerendering so file), leaving only OpenVR now.

https://www.keshikan.net/fonts-e.html finally made clock out of it this font yay
@keshikan https://github.com/keshikan/DSEG

fixed rendering manually for Windows, Linux, macOS. the Android to be rendered with older version of Java due to some library incompatible with JDK 13 . https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63503350/general-error-during-semantic-analysis-unsupported-class-file-major-version-57
https://github.com/exercism/support/issues/73
ah, it's the Gradle the Godot has is incompatible with JDK 13. let's go back to
Adopt OpenJDK 7 for now.

add directly change Dynamic Font Data for Super Label and DSEG label.

forgot to complain that keshikan uploaded his precure MIDI he collected to Nico Nico material but is JASRAC protected hence require us to subscribe to Premium Nico Nico, and yes it's paid. sigh, wtf, Nico Nico?! Keshikan pls upload those MIDIs to GIthub and freemidi.org too! oh, pls also Odysee as well! https://Odysee.com/$/invite/@JOELwindows7
hey btw, nice CureSynth! cool and good! my nicovideo profile is https://www.nicovideo.jp/user/52507327 and YouTube is https://www.youtube.com/c/JoelRobertJustiawanPerkedelTech . well, I am not Japanese though. I am Indonesian. yeay.

updated once again the Godot MIDI player. damn man. I wish Godot supports MIDI out here. what do we have here is only Input MIDI. so.. we can only brute force this out with some measures according to that pllugin, thx arlez from BitBucket for the plugin. So it's not performance efficient, especially as shown when you play this on Windows. wow! so laggy! yeah serioysly, @Godot we need MIDI out. I hate to brute force just to get MIDI playing. oh wait, yes! uh not to be confused with Falcosoft's Soundfont MIDI player, that one uses a BASSMIDI library. and I wish someone volunteer to build us BASSMIDI interface to GDNative in Godot. because, we may not have hardware to MIDI out to, and Genos is expensive, $5000. please sign https://www.change.org/YamahaGenosSoundfont ... so the alternative solution is like what http://falcosoft.hu/softwares.html#midiplayer does, using a separate library of BASSMIDI yay. it also supports VSTi. yeah I know, it's insane. BASSMIDI is blobo, I think. and uh, maybe this cannot be official canon, so, be a separate addon. pls.
I need efficient no lag MIDI player! brute forcing (purely GDscript) is laggy on many systems. idk...

oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

addonaiazon. maybe we should stop adding more addon. leave addition of addon as a discrete usage by the DVD instead? idk... I mean, it should only minimal which later to be added by the installation of external ModPCK for specifically the DVD that uses it. right?
uh, whatever idk

pls

memcg: fix swapcache charge from kernel thread context

Commit 284f39afeaa4 ("mm: memcg: push !mm handling out to page cache
charge function") explicitly checks for page cache charges without any
mm context (from kernel thread context[1]).

This seemed to be the only possible case where memory could be charged
without mm context so commit 03583f1a631c ("memcg: remove unnecessary
!mm check from try_get_mem_cgroup_from_mm()") removed the mm check from
get_mem_cgroup_from_mm().  This however caused another NULL ptr
dereference during early boot when loopback kernel thread splices to
tmpfs as reported by Stephan Kulow:

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000360

Also Branimir Maksimovic reported the following oops which is tiggered
for the swapcache charge path from the accounting code for kernel threads:

    acct_process+0x6d/0xa0
    do_exit+0x827/0xa70
    kthread+0xc3/0xf0

This patch fixes the issue by reintroducing mm check into
get_mem_cgroup_from_mm.  We could do the same trick in
__mem_cgroup_try_charge_swapin as we do for the regular page cache path
but it is not worth troubles.  The check is not that expensive and it is
better to have get_mem_cgroup_from_mm more robust.

"ISTJ" : ["The Inspector", "The ISTJ can be considered an intimidating personality type to approach, especially without a prior relationship. ISTJs appear serious, formal, and proper. This personality type places great importance on tradition and old-school values. Patience, hard work, honor and social and cultural responsibility are all cherished by the ISTJ. They are reserved, calm, quiet, and upright. These traits result from the combination of Introversion, Sensing, Thinking, and Judging. The result is a personality type that is often misunderstood."],
"ISTP" : ["The Crafter", "ISTPs are mysterious and oft-misunderstood people. This personality type is typically defined by rationality and logic but is also capable of spontaneity and enthusiasm. The personality traits of the ISTP are tougher to recognize than those of other types. Even people who know the ISTP well cannot always anticipate their reactions. Deep down, ISTPs are spontaneous, unpredictable individuals, but they sometimes hide those traits from the outside world, favoring an approach of logic and culpability."],
"ISFJ" : ["The Protector", "ISFJs are philanthropists. This personality type is always ready to give back, and any generosity received will be returned threefold. The people and things an ISFJ believes in will be upheld, and supported with enthusiasm and unselfishness. This makes this among the most warm and kind-hearted personality types. Harmony and cooperation are important to the ISFJ, and this type is likely to be sensitive to the feelings of others. The ISFJ is valued for their consideration and awareness, and often bring out the best in others."],
"ISFP" : ["The Artist", "ISFPs are introverts but may not always seem this way. Even if an ISFP has difficulties connecting to other people initially, they eventually grow warm, approachable, and friendly. ISFPs are fun to be around and very spontaneous. This makes them the perfect friend to tag along with an activity, planned or unplanned. ISFPs look to live life to the fullest and embrace the present. This ensures they are always keen to encounter a new experience or make a discovery. ISFPs find wisdom in understanding, so they find more value in meeting new people than other introverted personality types."],
"INFJ" : ["The Advocate","INFJs are visionaries and idealists. This personality type oozes creative imagination and brilliant ideas from every pore. They have a different, frequently profound, way of looking at the world that is not always understood. INFJs favor substance and depth in the way they think. This personality type will never accept anything at surface level or refuse to countenance a better way to approach problems. Others may perceive the INFJ as odd or amusing due to this variable outlook on life."],
"INFP" : ["The Mediator","INFPs, like most introverts, are quiet and reserved. This personality type prefers not to talk about themselves, especially upon first meeting a new person. They prefer spending time alone in quiet places. This provides the opportunity for the INFP to make sense of the world around them. INFPs love analyzing signs and symbols, often considering them to be metaphors that have deeper meanings related to life. This personality type can become lost in their imagination and daydreams. This occasionally leads to the INFP drowning in the depth of their thoughts, fantasies, and ideas."],
"INTJ" : ["The Architect","INTJs are true introverts. This personality type tends to be quiet, reserved and comfortable in their own company. INTJs are usually self-sufficient and prefer to work alone than in a group. Socializing significantly drains the energy of this personality type, causing them to need to recharge. Do not weight down an INTJ with small talk! They are more interested in big ideas and theories. When observing the world, INTJs regularly question why things happen the way they do. Uncertainty is the enemy of the INTJ. They excel at developing plans and strategies for every eventuality."],
"INTP" : ["The Thinker","INTPs are highly regarded for brilliant theories and unrelenting logic. This makes sense, as this personality type is arguably the most logical of all. INTPs love patterns, have a keen eye for picking up on discrepancies, and possess the ability to read people. This makes it inadvisable to lie to an INTP. People of this personality type lack interest in practical, day-to-day activities and maintenance. When an INTP finds an environment that provides the opportunity to stretch their creative muscles, there is no limit to the time and energy expended. A sensible and unbiased solution becomes likely."],
"ESTP" : ["The Persuader","ESTPs have an Extroverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Perceptive personality. ESTPs live for social interaction, drawing power from feelings and emotions. This does not mean that ESTPs are flippant. They enjoy logical processes and reasoning, provided this does not stand in the way of freedom in thought and deed. Theory and abstracts will not retain the attention or interest of an ESTP for long. This personality type prefers to leap before they look, fixing mistakes as they go. This is preferable to sitting idle or preparing contingency plans."],
"ESTJ" : ["The Director","ESTJs place a great deal of emphasis on traditional values. These include organization, honesty, dedication and dignity. This personality type believe firmly in doing what they believe is right and socially acceptable. Though the paths towards “good” and “right” are difficult to define, an ESTJ will act as the leader of the pack and extol personal views. They are the epitome of good citizenry. People often look to ESTJs for guidance and counsel, and this personality type will always be happy to provide such assistance."],
"ESFP" : ["The Performer","ESFPs have an Extroverted, Observant, Feeling and Perceiving personality, and are commonly seen as Entertainers. Born to provide amusement and distraction to others and to hog the limelight, ESFPs love to hold court in a group. ESFPs are thoughtful explorers who enjoy learning – and sharing what they learn with others. ESFPs live for company, and typically have strong interpersonal skills. They are lively and fun, and will never decline the opportunity to be the center of attention. Despite this court jester-like demeanor however, ESFPs are warm, generous, and friendly. They are also typically sympathetic and concerned for the well-being of others."],
"ESFJ" : ["The Caregiver","ESFJs are the stereotypical extroverts. This personality type is effortlessly social, born of a need to interact with others. This desire to make others happy usually results in popularity for the ESFJ. The ESFJ often tends to be the cheerleader or sports hero in high school and college. Later in life, they continue to revel in the spotlight. ESFJs are primarily focused on organizing social events for their families, friends and communities. ESFJ is a common personality type and one that is liked by many people."],
"ENFP" : ["The Champion","ENFPs have an Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving personality. This personality type is highly individualistic. Champions are not followers, and care little for the status quo. Instead, they strive toward creating their own methods, looks, actions, habits, and ideas. ENFPs do not welcome cookie cutter people into their circle and loathe being forced to live inside a box. They do enjoy company though – assuming it is the “right” company – enjoying strong intuition when it comes to themselves and others. ENFPs operate from their feelings most of the time. This is no bad thing, as they are highly perceptive and thoughtful."],
"ENFJ" : ["The Giver","ENFJs are eternal people-pleasers. They are extroverted, idealistic, charismatic, outspoken, highly principled and ethical. This set of traits ensures that an ENFJ can usually connect with others of varying backgrounds and personalities. ENFJs rely more on intuition and feelings, living more in their imagination than the real world. This can be troublesome, for the individual themselves and those around them. Rather than living in the, “now” and what is currently happening, ENFJs tend to concentrate on the abstract and what could possibly unfold in the future."],
"ENTP" : ["The Debater","The ENTP personality is among the rarest in the world, which is understandable. Although they are extroverts, ENTPs reject small talk – and may not thrive in social situations. This is especially true is the ENTP is surrounded by vastly different personality types. ENTPs are intelligent and knowledgeable, and as a result they need to be constantly mentally stimulated. This personality types relishes the opportunity to discuss theories and facts in extensive detail, needing little encouragement to set the world to rights. ENTPs are logical, rational and objective in their approach to information and arguments. They expect the same from a debating partner."],
"ENTJ" : ["The Commander","An ENTJ’s primary concern is focus is managing external circumstances with logic and discipline. Once this has been achieved, intuition and reasoning take effect. ENTJs are the most natural leaders among the 16 personality types. This personality type will always relish the opportunity to take charge. ENTJs live in a world of possibilities, often viewing challenges and obstacles great opportunities to push themselves. They have a natural gift for leadership and never shirk from making decisions. Options and ideas will be quickly yet carefully reviewed. ENTJs are “take charge” people who do not like to sit still and allow life to happen around them."]
