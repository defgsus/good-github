"10:05am. I am scheming.

TODO: Monadic syntax.
TODO: Autocomplete.
TODO: Highlight unused vars.
TODO: List and array patterns and literals.
TODO: Guard against stack overflows in the partial evaluator. Try running it on a separate thread.
TODO: Make literal suffices (such as `i64`) be highlighted differently from the rest of the number.
TODO: Make a VS Code theme for Spiral.
TODO: Fix the package removal error. Probably the package errors are not being cleared and linger despite the file being erased.
TODO: Adjust the codegen so that the proxies aren't needed. Move the cases down.

Got rid of the key order on hover and added autocomplete and list and array patterns and literals.

10:10am. I am churning my brain thinking of the paths and what my moves should be.

Leaving the whole thing of making Spiral useful for other people aside, what am I most anxious of?

I've been obsessed about making the agents all this time. I anticipated the future and saw that making the ML libraries for future hardware as the bottleneck. But I sort of have that out of the way. Even algorithms aren't a problem anymore - ensembles and diversity are going to carry me far.

After a year of work I've finally started applying. I'll send out emails every week from here on out. Even if I do not get a reply from one company, I plan to keep sending them different pitches. If I can get them to initiate conversation, I should be able to convince them of Spiral's benefits. I'll only give up on a company if I get a clear reject.

I do not think my first pitch was too good. Maybe the mindset of not wanting to sell myself is wrong. Maybe I should sell both myself and Spiral? I'll try that pitch as well. I'll try composing a resume next time.

10:20am. This whole process of applying will be a slow and steady effort. I'll dedicate one day per week to it. That will be a good pace.

The patience to do it in weekly steps comes from trading for me. So does persistence. I really do feel like I've finally mastered it 6 years after giving up on it.

Back to the matter at hand, the thing I am most anxious of would be UI automation. Even if I had an agent, would it be that easy to interface with games and online sites with it. Not at all!

That particular task feels completely intimidating to me.

Ok, so compared to 2018, I no longer have access to GPU, and it would be a huge chore to build up that infrastucture again. But GPUs are shitty for that anyway, so I should be aiming to use the CPU.

I have Spiral, I can easily implement the latest and greatest CFR algorithms from the papers on it. In one of the papers they used unsupervised clustering to get the right features. I can get an lin alg library and implement K-means or whatever. It is no big deal. It would take me a few weeks of experimentation to get an agent that way.

I won't make my focus making the agent. I've already gone through that before.

Instead, what I need to master is what I haven't done before. 2020 was me growing up and learning UIs and concurrency. I have that down. In 2021 what I should learn is not so much how to make the agent, but how to actually use them. I should get some actual hacking skills.

I've been avoiding this for too long. This is what I should be aiming towards after I finish those TODOs. The TODOs won't take long. In a few weeks I will be through with them. Then I will need something to do if the companies start playing coy with me.

Interviewing and negotiations aren't a big deal. I'll get my chance eventually.

UI automation is what I need to put my effort into.

10:35am. Now let me see if I got any mail. Flakes. Figures.

On Wednesday I'll increase the batch size to 6. I have too many potential sponsors, so I want to increase the pace. If I am getting nothing after a month, I'll add the nano .NET sponsors to rotation as well.

10:50am. Let me do my morning chilling and then I will start.

I wrote the docs, and I finally made the first step forward into the real world. But these interviews are like stocks. You can buy a stock, but then pouring your desire into it will make a lick of difference whether it goes up or not.

I do not want to make a mistake in getting emotionally involved in these interviews and placing expectations on how things should go. Once the stone is cast, it should be let to fly on its own.

If I am going to get emotionally involved with something, that should be the actual programming that I do. Pouring my creativity and inspiration there will make a proportional difference. Unlike trading, the more effort is put into programming, the better the results will be.

10:55am. Besides UI automation, if the interviewing does not send any work my way, I should work towards building up the GPU capabilities back up again. The ML library that I had was good. It would not be bad to bring it back.

A Python backend would not be a bad idea either.

11am. The work never stops. I'll only get a break when I am dead.

11:30am. I am done chilling, but right now, it is exactly the time to have breakfast. Let me do it. Today, maybe I will take some time off from the screen. I've just presented my new motivation, but haven't really internalized it yet. Maybe I will rant for a while.

Work, work, it is always work.

It is lame. I made Spiral because I wanted to protect the functional style I had acquired in F#. I wanted to improve on it too.

But how can I prove it to others that this matters? How can I prove to others that they would benefit from adopting it? I am pessimistic. Back in high school the adventure never started.

And during my trading days, after 4 years of paper trading all I got is 3k to try it out and got nowhere for 2 years after that. So that is 10 years of failure tailing behind me. And now I struck out on my own in programming, but haven't had any success.

Will in the end my desire lead me to ruin?

The treeshold for success is so low, just one sponsor, but it could turn into a nightmare where I get nowhere for months and years. I am mostly saying this not to be pessimistic, but because it has happened to me. In fact, things not going my way is the standard rather than the exception.

11:40am. If my luck is really so shitty that all I can do is rely on myself, I'll make UI automation the last attempt. I'll absolutely master interfacing with the outside world through a virtual PC and employ agents in my undertaking. I'll use CPU-based agents, I'll build back the GPU capabilities of Spiral and use those, whatever.

Maybe I can win on my own. I do not want to have any regrets regarding this.

My 2018 attempt was in the direction of making an agent, sure. I made a GPU-based ML library and that was a great success. But I did not make creating an agent and putting it to real work use a priority. Instead I wanted to make their training completely roboust. I wanted to push my mind and exceed the perceived limitations of backprop.

This time I want to pursue my actual stated goal. And I will use Spiral v2 to do it. If Spiral is really as good as I imagine it to be, this will be its time to shine.

11:45am. There just isn't anything more that I can do apart from try it. Better language than Spiral will exist in the future, but they won't have particularly notable advantages over it. Not if they are made by humans.

Just like SML set the standard for statically typed functional languages, Spiral is the SML of the 21st century. It is the standard for a statically typed language with partial evaluation.

It is the language that has all the potential. If Spiral is not enough, nothing will be.

Right now I am at a pinnacle of my skill. If I cannot beat at least online poker using my current skills, then it is impossible.

What is a few years here and there? To reach my dreams I should be able to put in this kind of work. I am tired, but I was tired in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

2021 is not the year to take a vacation. Things will be busy here.

I am going to exceed my limit once more and master the most crucial skill for using agents in the real world. After that my potential will be bottomless.

11:55am. This is actually wonderful.

When it comes to getting sponsors I do not want to make the same mistake I did during my trading days where I just bought a stock and then spent my time dreaming about how rich I am going to get. I do not want to fire an email and start thinking how impressed the other side will be with Spiral and how great it would be for things to go my way.

During my trading days, I could have done programming on the side, but I did not. I won't allow myself to become mentally reliant on non-allies again. Instead my whole being should always be on cultivating my own abilities. That is the true path."

N-Step-Alpha-beta-pruning (Not copy pasted)

This man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI
Bless. Holy shit. What a fuckin legend.
By not copy pasted, I mean, I couldn't literally just copy paste kaggle code to do it. Maybe I could if I just searched for it on a public notebook, but I gave myself an 'honour' system of only allowing myself to use more of Kaggle's computational resources (search deeper) if I could prune without copy pasting.
Obviously, I used Wikipedia's pseudocode and the video above to help, though. Actually helped me to understand wtf minimax does, much more solidly. 
I also didn't copy paste the minimax and edit. Instead, I wrote out the whole algorithm from scratch because yeah.

IP Lies and Emails

So yesterday was a lesson in idiocy. She attacked James's youtube with accusations that the Phones he has are not hers. I will be uploading the voice mails proving that those phones are hers. One in particular has her screaming "LEAVE MY PHONES ALONE!" As James says all the time "I just shit myself" because when I heard it, all doubt was removed. It will be a 2 part upload as James has over 218 voice mails from this psycho. 

Another thing she attacked him over was the IP address. Okay I have included in this commit, how Static IP works. Layman's terms: It is the permanent address on the phone itself. It is traceable. It is also possible for a phone to have up to 6 different IP address, but the static IP does not change. Also too sim cards are registered to a person, further identifying the device. So he has 2 phones with sim cards with her name all over it. And with static IP addresses connected to her. Funny how when you look up how things actually work, you find out the actual truth instead of cherry picking to fit your narrative, huh!

The ADA. She has been screaming that we are "Picking on her" over her disabilities. No. Just cause she was in Spec Ed does not mean we are picking on her. And the ADA does not cover internet dealings. What it does cover is discrimination in the work and business places. So for an example a work place can not discriminate against an individual with a disability. Same goes for business dealings. For example, if someone with a disability was trying to own a home, the brokerage could not discriminate against them. What it does not cover is trolling and internet dealings. I have disclosed the PDF file and the screen grab of that in this commit.

As well as these words. There are those of us who have been in SPEC ED, or have Family that are in Spec Ed. We know the laws and the workings of the disability acts because we live with them or advocates for them. What we are pointing out is her Actions, her constant harassment, lies, and other insane ramblings. As well as her Cyber Attacks on individuals if they chose to could press charges against her for said harassment and slander. And included in that the threats made against their physical lives, businesses, hobbies, and possible relations.

And the Grand FInale! So she posted her email lastnight. So I put it above the collab that was made showing that the phones james has, the email she recently sent him, and the blog post all show the SAME EMAIL ADDRESS. Yup. All 3 have the same Email address. This is so much better than a smoking gun.  Because not only did she confirm publicly that the email is hers, and you can tell its hers in all three images, but the fact that she can not decipher the truth of what was shown. Those emails have nothing to do with IP addresses or anything else like she claims, like hacking. It confirms she was using the Alias of Emily Rose to try and solicit sex/prostitution on craigslist. She was in fact using that name. IT confirms she has used that email to target her mom's boyfriend with hate.  It confirms that it is her that has done all this horrible acts. 

Evidence is in this repository and its backups.

I am still carrying out some finding to see if there is any potential bug.

## Deployment
Deploying the GitHub Pages from my Desktop
Log into GitHub.
I will have to create a repository which is
 Sampatbraide/third-milestone-project.github.io
after doing that I will upload my project to the repository
this will take a couple of minutes.

 
Moreso I can also use
[MAKE A README](https://https://www.makeareadme.com/)
Type the document format it and transfer it to [GITHUB](http://github.com/)
As I could examine it a re-test by ensuring that everything is working as expected.
