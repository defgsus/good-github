HOW TO ENJOY AN INTERACTIVE MOVIE WITH ALEXA?
A user accesses an interactive movie by asking Alexa to start the movie. Alexa is always ready to start new interactive movies. When a user speaks the magic word "Alexa" and initiates a dialogue with a device that supports the Alexa operating system, the device uploads the dialogue to the Alexa cloud computing service. The Alexa operating system implements a simple interface based on an EPS (Spanish abbreviation for input, process and output), the dialogue is received in the input phase, processed by the Alexa artificial intelligence engine and an output is generated that returns to the device to serve a response to the user who invoked the audiovisual resource. The Alexa operating system manages the technical details to complete a speech recognition and thus understand the request through a natural and standardized communication language. The interactive movie runs online (streaming) within the Amazon Alexa computing infrastructure. The Alexa communication interface is through the client / server interface and implementing a secure protocol for the exchange of digital information over the internet (Wi-Fi connection, mobile data, others). The dialogues between the user and Alexa are encapsulated in a script (written outline of a conversation), the scripts within the technical context of Alexa are encoded in a script with JSON syntax (JavaScript object notation).
The Alexa operating system can understand communication attempts through oral communication, visual communication, and tactile communication.
Original documentary source: [Alexa Skill Kit].

>What is the Alexa Skills Kit?
>The Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) is a software development framework that enables you to create content, called skills. Skills are
>like apps for Alexa. With an interactive voice interface, Alexa gives users a hands-free way to interact with your skill.
>Users can use their voice to perform everyday tasks like checking the news, listening to music, or playing a game. Users can also use their voice to control cloud-connected devices. For example, users can ask Alexa to turn on lights or change the thermostat. Skills are available on Alexa-enabled devices, such as Amazon Echo and Amazon Fire TV, and on Alexa-enabled devices built by other manufacturers.

42.1. Automatically Redirect Ajax Calls to /login

  All sites that loads things via Ajax have one annoying problem: what happens if the user gets logged out due to inactivity? Obviously if the user gets logged out and clicks a link to navigate the whole page, that's no problem. They'll get redirected to the login page.

  But go to a product page and scroll down to the review section. Pretend that I stop right here, go home for the day, eat a delicious dinner, watch Mystery Science Theater 3000 and come back to my computer tomorrow. During that time, my session has timed out. What would happen if I tried to submit this form - which submits into a turbo-frame - without refreshing first?

  Well... let's try it! I'm going to imitate this situation by opening the site in a new tab... and logging out. Back over in the first tab, clear the network requests and submit. Uh, that was weird.

  In the network tools, you can see that it did submit to the reviews page. But then, because I'm not logged in, it redirected to the login page. In the console, we see our favorite error:

    response has no matching <turbo-frame id="product-review"> element.

  That makes sense! The Ajax request redirected to the login page. And so, the frame system followed that redirect and then looked for a product-review <turbo-frame> on that page... which it obviously doesn't have.

  So the user experience here is... not so great. But for any frames that have our data-turbo-form-redirect attribute, this problem is already fixed thanks to the system we just built!

  Check it out. Refresh... log back in and head to the admin section. Remember: this modal does have that attribute on it. So I'm going to repeat our experiment. In the other tab, refresh, then log out. Back on the first tab, when we open the modal, the <turbo-frame> will try to make a request to a page that requires authentication. When we try it... awesome! It redirected the entire page to /login! That's perfect!

  Wrapping the Redirect Response to /login
  - So this problem is fixed in some places... but not everywhere. But we can make this work everywhere.

  In TurboFrameRedirectSubscriber, look at shouldWrapRedirect(). Let's think: if this response is a redirect to the login page and if the request is happening inside a <turbo-frame>, then we definitely know that we want to wrap the redirect so that our JavaScript redirects the whole page.

  Start by checking to see if not $request->headers->get('Turbo-Frame'). In this case, return false. Adding this check was redundant before... because if you have the Turbo-Frame-Redirect header then you definitely have this one. But now it's going to help us detect if we're in a frame and if the response is redirecting to the login page.

  Grab the redirect location by saying $location = $response->headers->get('Location'). Instead of checking to see if this equals /login, let's be fancier and use the URL generator.

  At the top of the class, add a __construct() function with a UrlGeneratorInterface argument... which is just a more hipster way to get the router service. I'll hit Alt + Enter and go to "Initialize properties" to create that property and set it.

  Back down in the method, if $location is equal to $this->urlGenerator->generate(), passing this the name of our login route - app_login - then return true.

  That's it! If the response is a redirect... and the request is happening inside of a frame... and we're redirecting to the login page... then that's a problem. That's going to break the frame. And so, we'll wrap the redirect with our fake redirect so that our JavaScript can navigate things.

  Testing time! Log back in... go back to a product page, scroll down to the reviews, and then, in the other tab, refresh and log out.

  Back in tab number 1, try to submit the review form. Beautiful! We are smoothly redirected to the login page! This problem just got solved for any <turbo-frame> on our site.

  Okay team! Enough with turbo frames! It's time to dive into part 3 of Turbo: Turbo Streams. This feature is probably the smallest of the three, but also the most fun to work with.

How to Sculpt hands | Sculpt Jan 2019 | no. 17

Let me take a look at these.

https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=155
> Don't forget to turn on front face only.

Wait, is that why it would sometimes drag the back? That has to be it. Damn. I should remember to turn that on in the future.

10:55am. https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=400

The way he uses the mask here is exactly what I wanted to know. This is good.

11:10am. https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=1202

This use of lasso mask is so good.

11:20am. https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=1461

More mask brush trickery.

https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=1520

This is great. My previous idea for rotating the finger was to use the grab brush along with a mask, but this is far better.

11:35am. https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=2149

Using the mask here is so much better than what I had.

11:45am. https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=2364

I had this problem as well. I wonder how he will take care of it.

https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=2919

You can even use the pose tool like this? Great.

https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=2928

It is even possible to use the rotate tool.

https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=2933

And there is even the transpose tool.

https://youtu.be/vmaZ_Cp4Q4k?t=3380

Oh this is a nice way of doing it.

12:20pm. Done with the hand sculpting tutorial. I learned quite a bit from it.

Blender Tutorial, Hand sculpting for beginners, how to sculpt hands with explanations

Here is a hand tut by Grant. Before I do anything else, I should thoroughly get familiar with the sculpting tools.

https://youtu.be/gWX5UCzaN-8
My art journey of 3d / Everyone starts bad

Let me watch this and I will have breakfast. Focus me. I do not feel like working on the hand again. Instead I'll target the full body mesh (loli) when I am ready.

12:40pm. https://youtu.be/gWX5UCzaN-8?t=194

Honestly, his work so far was not that good.

https://youtu.be/gWX5UCzaN-8?t=263

This is much immproved.

https://youtu.be/gWX5UCzaN-8?t=829

I feel he draws the mouth too big and the teeth are also too prominent despite being shown only slightly.

2:25pm. Done with breakfast and chores. Let me chill a bit more and then I will start. I know I am being super lazy today, but so be it.

2:45pm. Let me finally start. I've wasted more time during the day than I've studied, but that is about the par for studying. I want the pen tablet to arrive so I can get practicing. One thing I should do is download Photoshop, unless I want to work all in Illustrator, but that does not matter too much for me.

Let me watch the Hand tut by Abbot. But before that, what was the transpose tool. Let me look into that first. I do not see it anywhere on the toolbar.

2:55pm. Ah, that was just the move tool. It works simily to the one in the edit mode. Ok.

3pm. With the pose tool it would be easy to mend a piece of clay at the halfway point. That would allow me to create the mold for the minotaur head sculpture. I forgot what the term for that is, but you often see those ornamental carvings in games.

Actually, would that be true? Let me give it a try now.

3:20pm. Ok, I played around for a bit. The pose tool is not the right thing for the job here. The rotate tool for the masked half around the view axis worked best for me.

That is one thing down. I've also realized that pressing control and shift + control can be used for subtraction and intersection select modes. With this everything is set.

I've also seen the guy use annotations in different ways. I should find a tutorial on that. But first let me see how Grant does the hands.

3:35pm. https://youtu.be/L4UOz1Sygrw?t=45

Here he is saying something about the rake. What is that?

https://youtu.be/L4UOz1Sygrw?t=92

Ah, here is the rake.

Hmmm, I see. It determines how much the grab follows the rotation.

https://youtu.be/L4UOz1Sygrw?t=225

I really like how the nails came out for him.

https://youtu.be/L4UOz1Sygrw?t=382

He is really good. I wasn't sure what I rated him before, but he is at least 4/5. I though that some of the simpler stuff I've seen him do might put him at at least 3/5, but this is quite good. I can rate him higher.

3:55pm. Hmmm, I should aim to do rigging so I can give my models some dynamism.

https://youtu.be/L4UOz1Sygrw?t=523

The skin fold between the thumb and the index finger is very lifelike. How did he manage it?

https://youtu.be/L4UOz1Sygrw?t=675

I meant to ask this earlier, but just what is this thing he is doing with the booloans. This is not the modifier nor the addon that I found. Also I will have to look into how he is doing this armature.

Oh, it is as easy as adding an object. But I see he has more options than me.

Detailed Base Meshes for Sculpting Using Metaballs and Booleans

I linked to this before. Let me go through it. I'll admit though, my desire for sculpting is starting to wane, and I am really getting interested in sketching and 2d drawing again. This will become viable once I get a tablet. I only really want to use 3d models to bolster my ability to do 2d. So I'll be moving back and forth until I reach a satisfactory level in both, but I'll never for example be a match for a dedicated artist. That goes without saying, I'll have to do programming, writing, drawing and music composition. I only have so much of my time to dedicate to getting good at drawing.

I feel like now that I can sort of knock out the shape, I need to get significantly faster. Once I get more efficient I'll properly step into a higher realm of skill.

4:30pm. https://youtu.be/pXAqeyaABYI?t=118

This is pretty interesting.

https://youtu.be/pXAqeyaABYI?t=402

Wait did he say the shift + Z to take out the Z axis? Wow it works. Like this I can easily scale along the XY axes. Great. I'll definitely keep this in mind.

https://youtu.be/pXAqeyaABYI?t=403

I didn't think this would be another hand tutorial, but I am not complaining. These metaballs are a great tool. I should consider doing the chad pirate using it. He mentioned problems with the skin modifier, and it is true, I ran into those same issues myself. I wasn't really happy with how it worked.

https://youtu.be/pXAqeyaABYI?t=603

He says it can be a good idea to defer the joining as much as possible.

4:50pm. > I know that metaballs also have a 'negative' function to remove bits away. I think I have an idea of how that works though.

Done with the video. Here is one of the comments.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDILtiN36AA
Blender 2.91's new Boolean system is INSANE

Let me watch this next. Then I'll take a break to come up with a plan.

I thought I would work on the whole body, but in anticipation of the tablet arriving, maybe it would be good to try out Clip Studio. I installed it weeks ago and haven't run it even once so far. I should also compare sketching in Illustrator vs Photoshop.

https://youtu.be/GDILtiN36AA?t=62

Sigh, how is he doing this. Ok, let me make figuring out booleans the next step.

This caught my attention on the sidebar, but I can't be bothered to watch it now.

At any rate, I've definitely improved my understanding of bool tools. And I've figured out that it is possible to change how the object is rendered in viewport display. Wireframe should really be the default for the bool brush.

5:25pm. Ok, I get how the brush works.

https://youtu.be/FlgLxSLsYWQ?t=319

Look at those price tags.

Committing because Suberspective is basically done and I'm genuinely worried that this computer will die any day now

Changelist:
- Suberspective shaders are basically done, can now combine multiple effects through keywords rather than having manual shader variants
- BlackRoom puzzle more focused around main platform (not quite finished)
- Finally removed _Level4 which was never used
- Added GlobalUpdate to send Monobehaviour like update events to non-Monobehaviour objects
- LevelManager explicitly sets enum values
- LevelManager tries to load non-loaded levels when changing active level
- Set DynamicObject's parent to null before moving it between scenes
- Explicitly assign AudioName enum values
- DimensionObjects no longer do messy Material swaps, instead flips keyword when it needs to turn on thanks to Suberspective
- Created DissolveObject to handle general-purpose Suberspective dissolve effects. Should be improved by not having other scripts set its state directly
- Fixed a floating-point issue with ObjectHover that caused it to drift from its position over long periods of time
- Fixed issue with hovering over Portals
- Portals are kinda fucked right now, next thing to fix
- PortalableObject doesn't change Materials, instead just sets keywords now
- Added experimental way of handling State which changes over time in StateUtils.StateMachine<T>
- Added GetOrAddComponent utility method, probably lots of places where it could be used and isn't yet
- Reworked most Materials in the game to use Suberspective shaders instead
- Removed a lot of unnecessary Materials or shaders from above effort
- Lots of Unity assets had their versions updated (probably when project was upgraded to a newer version of Unity)
