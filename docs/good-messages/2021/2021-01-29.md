ML3M Rebalancing

Originally, the ML3M was intended to be a little bit stronger. The healing values for the Brute, Burn, Omni, Toxin, and Antirad cells, have been adjusted according to what was initially planned. 
Base Tier's now heal 10 per shot, for a total of 40 damage healed, up from 20.
Second Tier's now heal 20, instead of 10.
Third Tier's heal 40, instead of 20. 

Omni 1 heals 5's for brute, burn, and toxin, and 30 for oxy, up from half those values. Omni 2, is 10's and 60, and Omni 3 is 20's and 120. 

Antirad Cell had its toxin heal bumped up from 2.5 to 5, and its radiation-heal from 150, to 350. I wasn't originally going to touch this one, but the text said "It's 150 because that's equal to five units of arithrazine", and... it wasn't. So, I bumped it up to actually be equal to 5u of Arithrazine's worth of radiation healing.

Stabilizer Cell, CorpseMend, Resistance, Haste, and the size-changing cells, were not touched.
The reasons for this are as follows:

- The healing laser was simply not strong enough to ever tend to more than one patient. Healing 20-40 damage per cell just isn't enough, even if you had several clips full of cells, it just wasn't viable.
- As a result of this, it was seldom if ever used. Field Medics rarely if ever took it with them. In nearly every round I've played, it was left exactly where it was spawned, collecting dust. 
- I'd like to make it a more proper treatment option. It wouldn't be equal to reagents used in your usual Medbay setting, or surgical repair, but if it's modified to actually fulfill its niche as a rapid, contact-free treatment option, it could be relied on more by Field Medics. There is so much potential for this device as an "in the field" healing tool, and I'd like to see it done well. We have no shortage of people who would like to see non-chemical-based treatment options. We might as well make it useful enough to actually use.

Here are a few issues people brought up in Discord when I floated this idea.
"But, Tempest, you're doubling everything? That's a huge change! Won't this result in the ML3M overshadowing other treatment options?"
Certainly not. Currently, with tier-2 cells that only heal up to 40 damage, this is actually worse than basic first-aid in terms of raw healing ability, as the cutoff for first aid healing is 50 damage on a limb. First aid and reagents will still be the most convenient, most readily available, and overall most-used manner of treatment for injuries that can be treated using those methods. All this change would do is allow the ML3M to also have its uses, and stop being overshadowed by everything else. 

"Okay, but what if it DOES actually become The New Meta and becomes the favored tool for healing?"
I wouldn't see it as an issue if Chemistry gets dethroned, in all honesty. They'd both take quite a bit of prep-work to use. You have to make multiples of every chem if you want a solid stock, and you'd need multiples of every cell if you want proper coverage and healing-ability, since even with these changes you're expending 1-3 cells per patient. And, unless you get multiple ML3M's made, only folks who are gonna have one are the CMO, and whoever nabs the spawned one first. 

"But wouldn't this result in less departmental cooperation between Medical and Science now that Medical will require fewer cells?"
Most likely, no. If anything, I'd think there would be an increase, round-to-round, if this becomes a more viable and wanted tool, more people will ask for cells. Personally, my list of requested cells would stay the same, but I'd be sending that request in more often since I know it'll actually be useful rather than having it just to have it. Tier 2 cells are still going to be desirable, and I'm still probably not going to order Tier 3's because of the cost, but that's just me. It's still going to be incredibly weak at roundstart, and better cells will be that much nicer to obtain.

"But Tempest! If you get the highest tiers of cells, and a lot of them, you could fix anything that doesn't require surgery!"
Well, if Science had the time and mats, then sure, you could gather up a large enough collection of cells, and you probably could indeed do this for one or two badly injured patients... ... ...and I could accomplish the same goal if I'm given 20 seconds in a chem-lab. The ML3M is more costly to use, the cells cost resources, have to be recharged after 4 shots, and you only start with a base tier Burn, Brute, and Stabilizer cell. Each shot from a base level burn/brute cell is the equivalent of 1.25u of bicaridine or kelotane. This change would make it 2.5. Base level cells are still going to be next to useless for anything other than the most minor of injuries. Chemistry will still be the dominating powerhouse it always has been, but at least you can use this tool, provided the PR goes through, instead, more often.

"Tempest, this thing just wasn't intended to be used to fully heal people..."
A couple people have said this, and to be honest, it's silly. In our medical system, there's very little distinction between what can "heal a little bit" and what can "heal fully", because it all comes down to the fact that everything works off of damage values. If Option A heals 5 damage, and Option B heals 50... Both are capable of "healing fully" if you have enough Option A, it's just a question as to whether or not that's practical. Currently, the ML3M's healing values can't really even be used to even partially heal injuries, unless you have a large number of cells. You'd expend all of your charges on one patient and then you've got a paperweight taking up storage space until you can get to a recharger. 

Now, as for issues that I personally see? Biggest one is probably the Toxin cell. If I remlember correctly, the base Toxin cell is the same tech requirement as the Second Tier Brute/Burn cells. This PR doesn't fix that, and I don't really see it as a huge priority since I don't think anyone uses the toxin cells as it is, but yeah. Might need to be fixed at some point if this PR goes through.

And, absolute worst case scenario, let's say that this PR screws everything up, turns the Tether upside down, and now Medbay is dominated by a bunch of blue laser beams flying everywhere like it's the new Star Wars Trilogy (but actually better because those movies kinda set a low bar)... this PR was really easy to do. The only long part about it was typing all of this up. We can just bump the numbers down if this ends up sucking really bad, ezpz.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

Implement a website via which users can “buy” and “sell” stocks.

C$50 Finance
Implement a website via which users can “buy” and “sell” stocks, a la the below.

C$50 Finance

Background
If you’re not quite sure what it means to buy and sell stocks (i.e., shares of a company), head here for a tutorial.

You’re about to implement C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying IEX for stocks’ prices.

Indeed, IEX lets you download stock quotes via their API (application programming interface) using URLs like https://cloud-sse.iexapis.com/stable/stock/nflx/quote?token=API_KEY. Notice how Netflix’s symbol (NFLX) is embedded in this URL; that’s how IEX knows whose data to return. That link won’t actually return any data because IEX requires you to use an API key (more about that in a bit), but if it did, you’d see a response in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format like this:


{  
   "symbol": "NFLX",
   "companyName": "Netflix, Inc.",
   "primaryExchange": "NASDAQ",
   "calculationPrice": "close",
   "open": 317.49,
   "openTime": 1564752600327,
   "close": 318.83,

   "ytdChange": 0.18907500000000002,
   "lastTradeTime": 1564776000616
}
Notice how, between the curly braces, there’s a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, with a colon separating each key from its value.

Let’s turn our attention now to this problem’s distribution code!

Distribution
Downloading
$ wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2019/fall/tracks/web/finance/finance.zip
$ unzip finance.zip
$ rm finance.zip
$ cd finance
$ ls
application.py  helpers.py        static/
finance.db      requirements.txt  templates/
Configuring
Before getting started on this assignment, we’ll need to register for an API key in order to be able to query IEX’s data. To do so, follow these steps:

Visit iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/.
Enter your email address and a password, and click “Create account”.
On the next page, scroll down to choose the Start (free) plan.
Once you’ve confirmed your account via a confirmation email, sign in to iexcloud.io.
Click API Tokens.
Copy the key that appears under the Token column (it should begin with pk_).
In a terminal window within CS50 IDE, execute:
$ export API_KEY=value
where value is that (pasted) value, without any space immediately before or after the =. You also may wish to paste that value in a text document somewhere, in case you need it again later.

Running
. Start Flask’s built-in web server (within finance/):

$ flask run
Visit the URL outputted by flask to see the distribution code in action. You won’t be able to log in or register, though, just yet!

Via CS50’s file browser, double-click finance.db in order to open it with phpLiteAdmin. Notice how finance.db comes with a table called users. Take a look at its structure (i.e., schema). Notice how, by default, new users will receive $10,000 in cash. But there aren’t (yet!) any users (i.e., rows) therein to browse. + Here on out, if you’d prefer a command line, you’re welcome to use sqlite3 instead of phpLiteAdmin.

Understanding
application.py
Open up application.py. Atop the file are a bunch of imports, among them CS50’s SQL module and a few helper functions. More on those soon.

After configuring Flask, notice how this file disables caching of responses (provided you’re in debugging mode, which you are by default on CS50 IDE), lest you make a change to some file but your browser not notice. Notice next how it configures Jinja with a custom “filter,” usd, a function (defined in helpers.py) that will make it easier to format values as US dollars (USD). It then further configures Flask to store sessions on the local filesystem (i.e., disk) as opposed to storing them inside of (digitally signed) cookies, which is Flask’s default. The file then configures CS50’s SQL module to use finance.db, a SQLite database whose contents we’ll soon see!

Thereafter are a whole bunch of routes, only two of which are fully implemented: login and logout. Read through the implementation of login first. Notice how it uses db.execute (from CS50’s library) to query finance.db. And notice how it uses check_password_hash to compare hashes of users’ passwords. Finally, notice how login “remembers” that a user is logged in by storing his or her user_id, an INTEGER, in session. That way, any of this file’s routes can check which user, if any, is logged in. Meanwhile, notice how logout simply clears session, effectively logging a user out.

Notice how most routes are “decorated” with @login_required (a function defined in helpers.py too). That decorator ensures that, if a user tries to visit any of those routes, he or she will first be redirected to login so as to log in.

Notice too how most routes support GET and POST. Even so, most of them (for now!) simply return an “apology,” since they’re not yet implemented.

helpers.py
Next take a look at helpers.py. Ah, there’s the implementation of apology. Notice how it ultimately renders a template, apology.html. It also happens to define within itself another function, escape, that it simply uses to replace special characters in apologies. By defining escape inside of apology, we’ve scoped the former to the latter alone; no other functions will be able (or need) to call it.

Next in the file is login_required. No worries if this one’s a bit cryptic, but if you’ve ever wondered how a function can return another function, here’s an example!

Thereafter is lookup, a function that, given a symbol (e.g., NFLX), returns a stock quote for a company in the form of a dict with three keys: name, whose value is a str, the name of the company; price, whose value is a float; and symbol, whose value is a str, a canonicalized (uppercase) version of a stock’s symbol, irrespective of how that symbol was capitalized when passed into lookup.

Last in the file is usd, a short function that simply formats a float as USD (e.g., 1234.56 is formatted as $1,234.56).

requirements.txt
Next take a quick look at requirements.txt. That file simply prescribes the packages on which this app will depend.

static/
Glance too at static/, inside of which is styles.css. That’s where some initial CSS lives. You’re welcome to alter it as you see fit.

templates/
Now look in templates/. In login.html is, essentially, just an HTML form, stylized with Bootstrap In apology.html, meanwhile, is a template for an apology. Recall that apology in helpers.py took two arguments: message, which was passed to render_template as the value of bottom, and, optionally, code, which was passed to render_template as the value of top. Notice in apology.html how those values are ultimately used! And here’s why. 0:-)

Last up is layout.html. It’s a bit bigger than usual, but that’s mostly because it comes with a fancy, mobile-friendly “navbar” (navigation bar), also based on Bootstrap. Notice how it defines a block, main, inside of which templates (including apology.html and login.html) shall go. It also includes support for Flask’s message flashing so that you can relay messages from one route to another for the user to see.

Specification
register
Complete the implementation of register in such a way that it allows a user to register for an account via a form.

Require that a user input a username, implemented as a text field whose name is username. Render an apology if the user’s input is blank or the username already exists.
Require that a user input a password, implemented as a text field whose name is password, and then that same password again, implemented as a text field whose name is confirmation. Render an apology if either input is blank or the passwords do not match.
Submit the user’s input via POST to /register.
INSERT the new user into users, storing a hash of the user’s password, not the password itself. Hash the user’s password with generate_password_hash Odds are you’ll want to create a new template (e.g., register.html) that’s quite similar to login.html.
Once you’ve implemented register correctly, you should be able to register for an account and log in (since login and logout already work)! And you should be able to see your rows via phpLiteAdmin or sqlite3.

quote
Complete the implementation of quote in such a way that it allows a user to look up a stock’s current price.

Require that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a text field whose name is symbol.
Submit the user’s input via POST to /quote.
Odds are you’ll want to create two new templates (e.g., quote.html and quoted.html). When a user visits /quote via GET, render one of those templates, inside of which should be an HTML form that submits to /quote via POST. In response to a POST, quote can render that second template, embedding within it one or more values from lookup.
buy
Complete the implementation of buy in such a way that it enables a user to buy stocks.

Require that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a text field whose name is symbol. Render an apology if the input is blank or the symbol does not exist (as per the return value of lookup).
Require that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose name is shares. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer.
Submit the user’s input via POST to /buy.
Odds are you’ll want to call lookup to look up a stock’s current price.
Odds are you’ll want to SELECT how much cash the user currently has in users.
Add one or more new tables to finance.db via which to keep track of the purchase. Store enough information so that you know who bought what at what price and when.
Use appropriate SQLite types.
Define UNIQUE indexes on any fields that should be unique.
Define (non-UNIQUE) indexes on any fields via which you will search (as via SELECT with WHERE).
Render an apology, without completing a purchase, if the user cannot afford the number of shares at the current price.
You don’t need to worry about race conditions (or use transactions).
Once you’ve implemented buy correctly, you should be able to see users’ purchases in your new table(s) via phpLiteAdmin or sqlite3.

index
Complete the implementation of index in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing, for the user currently logged in, which stocks the user owns, the numbers of shares owned, the current price of each stock, and the total value of each holding (i.e., shares times price). Also display the user’s current cash balance along with a grand total (i.e., stocks’ total value plus cash).

Odds are you’ll want to execute multiple SELECTs. Depending on how you implement your table(s), you might find GROUP BY HAVING SUM and/or WHERE of interest.
Odds are you’ll want to call lookup for each stock.
sell
Complete the implementation of sell in such a way that it enables a user to sell shares of a stock (that he or she owns).

Require that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a select menu whose name is symbol. Render an apology if the user fails to select a stock or if (somehow, once submitted) the user does not own any shares of that stock.
Require that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose name is shares. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer or if the user does not own that many shares of the stock.
Submit the user’s input via POST to /sell.
You don’t need to worry about race conditions (or use transactions).
history
Complete the implementation of history in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user’s transactions ever, listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.

For each row, make clear whether a stock was bought or sold and include the stock’s symbol, the (purchase or sale) price, the number of shares bought or sold, and the date and time at which the transaction occurred.
You might need to alter the table you created for buy or supplement it with an additional table. Try to minimize redundancies.
personal touch
Implement at least one personal touch of your choice:

Allow users to change their passwords.
Allow users to add additional cash to their account.
Allow users to buy more shares or sell shares of stocks they already own via index itself, without having to type stocks’ symbols manually.
Require users’ passwords to have some number of letters, numbers, and/or symbols.
Implement some other feature of comparable scope.
Testing
Be sure to test your web app manually too, as by

inputting alpabetical strings into forms when only numbers are expected,
inputting zero or negative numbers into forms when only positive numbers are expected,
inputting floating-point values into forms when only integers are expected,
trying to spend more cash than a user has,
trying to sell more shares than a user has,
inputting an invalid stock symbol, and
including potentially dangerous characters like ' and ; in SQL queries.
Staff’s Solution
You’re welcome to stylize your own app differently, but here’s what the staff’s solution looks like!

https://finance.cs50.net/

Feel free to register for an account and play around. Do not use a password that you use on other sites.

It is reasonable to look at the staff’s HTML and CSS.

Hints
Within cs50.SQL is an execute method whose first argument should be a str of SQL. If that str contains named parameters to which values should be bound, those values can be provided as additional named parameters to execute. See the implementation of login for one such example. The return value of execute is as follows:

If str is a SELECT, then execute returns a list of zero or more dict objects, inside of which are keys and values representing a table’s fields and cells, respectively.
If str is an INSERT, and the table into which data was inserted contains an autoincrementing PRIMARY KEY, then execute returns the value of the newly inserted row’s primary key.
If str is a DELETE or an UPDATE, then execute returns the number of rows deleted or updated by str.
If an INSERT or UPDATE would violate some constraint (e.g., a UNIQUE index), then execute returns None. In cases of error, execute raises a RuntimeError.

Recall that cs50.SQL will log to your terminal window any queries that you execute via execute (so that you can confirm whether they’re as intended).
Be sure to use named bind parameters (i.e., a paramstyle of named) when calling CS50’s execute method, a la WHERE name=:name. Do not use f-strings, format or + (i.e., concatenation), lest you risk a SQL injection attack.
If (and only if) already comfortable with SQL, you’re welcome to use SQLAlchemy Core or Flask-SQLAlchemy (i.e., SQLAlchemy ORM) instead of cs50.SQL.
You’re welcome to add additional static files to static/.
Odds are you’ll want to consult Jinja’s documentation when implementing your templates.
It is reasonable to ask others to try out (and try to trigger errors in) your site.
You’re welcome to alter the aesthetics of the sites, as via
https://bootswatch.com/,
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/,
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/, and/or
https://memegen.link/.
FAQs
ImportError: No module named ‘application’
By default, flask looks for a file called application.py in your current working directory (because we’ve configured the value of FLASK_APP, an environment variable, to be application.py). If seeing this error, odds are you’ve run flask in the wrong directory!

OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use
If, upon running flask, you see this error, odds are you (still) have flask running in another tab. Be sure to kill that other process, as with ctrl-c, before starting flask again. If you haven’t any such other tab, execute fuser -k 8080/tcp to kill any processes that are (still) listening on TCP port 8080.

How to Submit
Execute the below from within your finance directory, logging in with your GitHub username and password when prompted. For security, you’ll see asterisks (*) instead of the actual characters in your password.

##### 2021-01-29 17:12:19 by Marko Grdinić

"2:55pm. Let me catch my breath. I've been in a programming frenzy for the last few days, and with this I should finally be done. Hopefully this should be the last of the bugs in the Cython backend.

I did a good job. I can pat myself on the back here.

3:05pm. I am taking a break here. What comes next?

Really, there is so much stuff left to do. I feel like am absolutely buried in work now.

How about I open a few more feature requests on the Cython side.

4:10pm. https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/

Opened issue 3992 along with two more. This is my wishlist for Cython.

4:15pm. With that I've tied up the loose ends in the Cython repo. If I am lucky maybe this will spur the devs to implement tuples, fixed arrays and stack unions. But even if nothing happens, it is not a big deal. Right now I need Python for its ML libraries. A few years down the road I might go back to .NET.

Let me make a TODO list on the Spiral issue page. Here is the current one:

TODO: Optimize Cython primitive arrays. Compile them to fast numeric ones.
TODO: Cython backend: Use the fast C math library for the inbuilts rather than the Python one. Right now I don't know how to access `logf` though. I don't know how to find out the contents of a Cython module either. Unlike for Python's `dir` does not work.
TODO: Monadic syntax.
TODO: Autocomplete.
TODO: Highlight unused vars.
TODO: List and array patterns and literals.
TODO: Guard against stack overflows in the partial evaluator. Try running it on a separate thread.
TODO: Make literal suffices (such as `i64`) be highlighted differently from the rest of the number.
TODO: Make a VS Code theme for Spiral.
TODO: Spiral build option: Compile monomorphic functions in file. This will allow modules to be compiled as C style libraries. Monomorphic functions would be compiled without name mangling.

...Actually no, I do not want to be responsible for keeping it in two different places. The top of my journal is enough.

There is really a shitload of things to do and I do not feel like tackling any of it right now. Apart from bugs, I'll move my attention away from the compiler for the time being.

It is almost the end of the month, and now that I've reached this milestone it is time to do a review.

4:30pm. First let me tally up my gains for the month.

* The language has seen a lot of bug fixing and is finally in an roboust state.
* I implemented a Cython backend for it.

After my initial failed email burst to potential sponsors 9 days ago, I've decided that I need to raise my profile and will be going down that path. Though now that I actually have a Cython backend, do I feel like doing a repeat of 2018 and reimplementing parts of PyTorch on my own again?

Yes, the v0.09 ML library was an impressive accomplishment, but there has to be a better way to use my time rather than spend a lot of effort and time building it up again just to write a few articles on it. Now that I have the Cython backend, I am not going to be using it. Of course that I'll take the smarter approach and just use what Facebook engineers and the ML community have spent years building up.

So spending a lot of time building up the ML library only to jetisson it afterwards is not my idea of fun. There have to be better profile raising moves. I should do something new. Maybe I can meet an unfulfiled need in the current ecosystem with Spiral rather than retrace old steps? That would be a more effective move anyway.

I just lost way too much initiative working so much on v0.09 only to abandon it in the end. That hurt me greatly. I can't recover from this anymore.

But I don't need to.

Whereas in the past I've would have been embarassed to use Python, using Python through Spiral is the patrician move. It is tolerable. It has potential.

4:40pm. Right now my position is extremely strong. It is way stronger than it was in 2018 even at its peak. I will no longer be trying to fight the Python community, instead I will be able to piggy back on their work.

What I intend to do is get back into ML right away!

Since I have access to Python ML libraries + Spiral's efficiency, I can get to work on the poker games and agents right away.

5:05pm. Had to take a break.

Yes, raising my profile and getting sponsors is the right move. But the earnings potential from regular work pales in comparison to using superhuman abilities in gaming.

I don't really need novel hardware just yet. I can make do with GPUs if it is just poker.

I will need novel hardware eventually, but I do not need it enough to sacrifice my cultivation in skills that I actually need.

Right now Spiral still does not have some essential things like library compilation. It would be good if it develops at a natural pace, much like v0.09, instead of me having to scramble to please some faceless randos at hardware companies.

5:15pm. Fatigue is really hitting me like a brick right now. I've been under stress for a long while, pulled in different directions.

Let me just rant here. I'll save the review for tomorrow.

Let me talk about the sponsors.

At first I was confused how to approach the situation. I made that email, fired it to a few companies and got ghosted and was left puzzled at how to interpret the situation.

Imagine you have 20 or so cute girls you are interested. Then imagine you come up to a few of them an express your desire to have sex with them. You've put in an effort, but won't get the results you want. Why?

Consider the girl's goals. What they want is marriage. They are laser focused on that and won't even consider anything else.

The way to approach persuasion is to always consider the perspective of the other side first. If I want to move them to something more appropriate to my own goals, I need to feign interest in what they want first. That is the way to play the opener.

5:25pm. What do these novel hardware companies want? Workforce. They want elite programmers. They could greatly benefit from adopting Spiral and improving their tooling, but they are not looking for tools at the moment. They want the people.

So to move them to open up access to their hardware and funds, the basic is to feign interest in working for them.

There might be a small chance that one of them would be up to sponsoring Spiral straight up, but I have no interest in pursuing the direct approach anymore. I need to use wisdom and scheme my way to success here.

Yes, it is annoying enough to look for a job in the first place. It is even more annoying to look for a job when you don't want it. But it is for the greater good.

I am going to feign interest and start 'looking' for a job at the companies. Inevitably their offers will be too low to interest me...'but hey look, I made this language that would be great for ML especially for a young company like you. You could cut your costs drastically by becoming a sponsor for just 3k per month? Won't you give it a try?'

5:30pm. This is the way to go here. I'll go with this approach.

It is not like the offers themselves are useless. I will be able to play them one against the other. In case of tragedy, it would to have them on the table.

5:35pm. Back then I made the email message and was not sure how to improve on it. But with a different plan, the results will be different. At the very least, I really doubt I will be ghosted.

5:40pm. Oh yeah, since I am applying, I am going to have to make a resume. This won't be too hard. I am just going to have to embelish my programing work in the past 5.5 years. This won't be too hard.

Really, my problem only is that I have no experience working for other people. But that is only a problem when trying to go through HR checkbox ticker drones. At smaller companies the devs themselves will look at the resume and think about it.

5:50pm. But ultimately, rellying on other people is plan B. Plan A will be to cultivate my ML skills directly once again.

Compared to the last time when I had my hands full making the library, studying ML and trying out my own ideas, I will be running on jet fuel. When I am not bogged down by my own insecurities and diving into random things in order to build up experience, my progress will be much smoother.

5:55pm. I will get all the benefits of Python, and with Spiral on my hands I will never end up in a situation where I can't extract the performance that I need or implement abstractions that I want.

Over the past years, my programming skills have gone way up.

Absolutely nothing will stop me this time. This will be the true beginning that I've sought long ago.

All the potential challenges that I can face will be solved by combination of Spiral + outside libraries. Spiral has the greatest combination of efficiency, expressiveness and interop capabilities in the world.

6pm. My stress is sky high. Tomorrow I will pare the above rant into a review. Then I'll start preparing the resume and the next volley of emails to send out.

After that I'll leave those concerns aside and start February with a clean slate.

Doing the Cython backend was the right move. With it, I suddenly have every library in Python at my disposal. I do not have to do my own thing anymore. I'll take advantage of the work of others and make my own way based on that.

6:05pm. The main challenge will be UI automation.

Like how a year away from Spiral in 2019 built up the inspiration in the background, this time I know enough to make the ML stable right away.

I'll use backprop - I could not beat that, but I'll be borrowing ideas from other fields, in addition to my own, in order to stabilize it. I am going to get absolute roboustness that way.

I'll implement the latest and greatest of CFR and move past this. No more fiddling around with algorithms and parameters for months. I have every intention of making ML the easy part of the process this time around.

The effect of this will be remarkable. Last time this defeated me, and not getting hung up on it will allow me to make really rapid progress.

6:10pm. Let me close here as I am dying trying to keep going. It is time for a real rest."

Expose kotlinc's -Xfriend-paths to all jvm/android kt rules under the attribute 'assocates=' (#465)

Associates lets a library associate it self to other libraries, making them part of the same module. This is constrained such that while multiple libraries may be associated, they must all shard the same module, and so cannot associate to anything that is part of a different module. These module relationships are in the bazel build graph, not the contents of the jars as such.

This module membership is transitive (within the above-mentioned constraint), though strict-deps would stop that. Also, only kotlin targets can be associated.

Per discussions across several media, the name "associates" was chosen over "friends" (despite the kotlinc flag being -Xfriend-paths) as that is the terminology used in the gradle kotlin plugin, which is kotlin's primary delivery vehicle, and to avoid confusion with the C++ friends concepts. The pre-existing "friends" attribute is preserved for backward compatibility with a warning. Future PR will add a flag to turn off that support, and then we'll delete it.

kt_jvm_import does not include this facility, but these can just set their module_name in common to participate.

Android should work, but because kt_android_* is a macro not a rule, the implicit target //my/android/library:mytarget_kt should be friended, since it has a KtJvmInfo. The //my/android/library will macro-resolve into an android_library. Until the android rules get the right kind of love, such that we can make a rule that has KtJvmInfo AND android-whatever providers, this simply is a known limitation we'll have to live with.

Also, the prior implementation shoved the full transitive closure (all jars, kotlin or no) of the friend= into the -Xfriends-paths flag, which is awful. This PR does break that, in case people were relying on that by some oddity. The fix is to just add the targets directly.

Fixes #211

More about the pie game

I've been learning Python for a few weeks now and I wanted to do something to challenge myself. So, I create a fun game by creating a while loop inside of a function. I created 2 functions, one function "my_program" will ask for your name and then read it back to you and then tell the rules of the game. 
I create a second function "chances" when the function is called, the while loop inside of it will commence and from there the user will have 6 attempts to try to guess my favorite flavor of pie. 
I thought it would be cleaner and a little more challenging to combine the function and while loop. This took me a few hours to create and because I'm still learning and to enjoy challenges, as a condition of the if statement, if the user guesses the right flavor, regardless if the guess can be in all caps, lower case or begin with an uppercase letter, it will still be correct. This particular piece was challenging and it took some trial and error and practice to get it correct. Initially, the the loop stopped even when the guess was incorrect. I still have so much to learn still, but this felt so satisfying to finish and see that it works how it  should. I now see what I've been reading how programmers feel when they code and see their finished product after having trial and error and some headbanging moments. It's so worth it to work through it. I wanted to break out of "tutorial hell" and start to create more things and I learned a lot about Python and myself in just creating this game.

I gladly welcome any feedback and happy coding, friends! :)
