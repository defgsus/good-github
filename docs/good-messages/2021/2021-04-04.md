Valyria Tear is an open-source single-player medieval-fantasy 2D J-RPG based
on an extended Hero of Allacrost engine and inspired by classic console
RPGs.

The player incarnates Bronann, a young boy forced to take part into the
struggle for the possession of a mysterious crystal. This powerful artifact
will lead him to discover the actual threat set upon his world, but also
courage and love.

The game has all the features you can expect from JRPG classics: entertaining
story development, colourful map exploration, active side-view battles,
character management, puzzles... It is also translated in several languages.

Added strategy "Swing-High-To-Sky"

## Hello dear community,

I like to share my newest hyperopt with you. I though about how cool it would be to know what's the perfect timeperiod for CCI indicator. In a strategy you do something like this: `dataframe['cci'] = ta.CCI(timeperiod=14)`

You would do this by hand for each timeperiod which is very annoying. Therefore, I created this hyperopt to looking for the perfect timeperiod for the CCI indicator. Please review this pull request very critical and share your minds.

Since the last two months (from 1st Jan 2021 until now) this strategy in BTC/USDT 30m chart had worked **very very** well. After two months I now optimize this strategy again.

I provided both, strategy and hyperopt file, in the attachements.

## Summary
The goal of this hyper-optimization is to find the perfect timeframe of the CCI indicator (from 10 to 100) within a range from -400 to +400. The MACD indicator here is just a favorite of myself, replace with your favorit indicator if you like.
