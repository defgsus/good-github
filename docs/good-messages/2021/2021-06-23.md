# Eliminating-Div-Tags Mentality I'm raw when it comes to coding. I'm just someone who has a passion for gaming, but also found how intriguing coding is. First of all let me breackdown the mental of this project before I tell you what I learn while doing this. When people say coding isn't for everyone they aren't lying to you. It comes with being patient and making a lot of mistakes. A lot of codes and techniques will not work, and one letter out of place and your entire web page is messed up. The ticket attempting and failing. We must come at projects or coding with an open mind and being ok with making mistakes. as much as its frustrating when codes don't work, its rewarding when find out dealing with coding with the vibe that youre going to achieve it. ProgressThere was nothing wrong with the how the live webpage looked, however it was the how the skeleton looked is where the issue lies. My instincts as writer tells me there are a lot of non-semetic div tags, in the new age of coding there is an alternative way to divide a web page in section. I replaced majority of the div tags with semantic tags like <nav>,<article>, <aside>,<figure> and <footer>. There is only one div tag in the skeleton for the navigation bar, so I'm guessing that's the necessary div tag because without it the content on navigation bar is out of place. To go back to writing one of my mentors told me to never repeat a word when starting a new line and the first think that pop out were the excessive div tags websites html. There were too many unnecessacary div tags, but I have better understanding of when and not to use them. Issues:Still having trouble with finding how to find out the issue of the search engine optim. alt attribution. All of the other attributes like

A guy named Vasya attends the final grade of a high school. One day Vasya decided to watch a match of his favorite hockey team. And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. "Piece of cake" — thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.
Input

The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), then follow n lines containing three integers each: the xi coordinate, the yi coordinate and the zi coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body ( - 100 ≤ xi, yi, zi ≤ 100).
Output

Print the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if it is not.

So, the New Year holidays are over. Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two "New Year and Christmas Men" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.

The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.

Help the "New Year and Christmas Men" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.
Input

The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.
Output

Print "YES" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the "New Year and Christmas Men". Otherwise, print "NO" without the quotes.

Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.
Input

The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.
Output

If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).

merge: #7350

7350: Simplify partition service r=pihme a=pihme

## Description

This simplifies the partition service. It gets rid of the map of partition groups and instead uses one partition group.

Review comments:
I would love to hear your opinion on the second commit. The second commit is to fix the failing tests. I am of two minds about the change.

On the one hand the behavior of `DefaultPartitionService` is very similar to the original behavior in the sense that both an empty list of partition groups and a partition group which is `null` is essentially a NOP. On the other hand, in productive code I expect this partition group to never be null. So in order to move the code forward, we could also require it to be not null.

Then we would have to provide a partition group in all the tests that were failing. Here again, on the one hand, I am reluctant to do that because we want to make the tests smaller and reduce test dependencies. But on the other hand the failing tests are precisely integration tests, where I think it is prudent to provide a full configuration.

In the end, I went back and forth on this, and decided to implement the small change set in `DefaultPartitionService` for now. I still want to look at the tests and how to improve them as I get deeper into the topic. 

Still, interested in your thoughts on the matter.

LEARN HTML
Fashion Blog
Your friend Isa is a budding fashion blogger, and she’s asked you to build her a new website, just in time for New York Fashion Week!

“An Insider’s Guide to NYFW”

Below that, add an <h2> that says:

“Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows”

Below that, add an <h2> that says:

“Dressing for the Shows”

5.
Here’s Isa’s first dispatch from Fashion Week! Let’s add a blog post. Between the <h1> and first <h2> tag, add a <p> tag that says:

“NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you’ve never been. Luckily, I’m here to give you an insider’s guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, you’ll have an unforgettable experience!”


Stuck? Get a hint
6.
Between the first and second <h2> tags, add another paragraph to the post using the <p> tag:

“If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!”

7.
After the last <h2> tag, add a final paragraph that says:

“Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.”

8.
Of course, this wouldn’t be a fashion blog without some images. Above each paragraph, add an <img> tag and set its src to be one of the following links:

https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-one.jpeg
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-two.jpeg
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-three.jpeg

Stuck? Get a hint
9.
Your first blog post is complete! Now let’s add an image of Isa, so her readers get to know her. Below the opening body tag, add an <img> tag with the following source:

https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/profile.jpg
10.
Below the <img> tag, add an <h3> that says “by Isabelle Rodriguez | 1 day ago”

11.
Isa wants her readers to know that she’s written a lot more than one post. Let’s make a list of some related blog posts. Beneath the last paragraph, add a <h4> tag that says “Related Content”. Underneath that header tag, create an unordered list.


Stuck? Get a hint
12.
The unordered list should have the following four items:

“How To Style Boyfriend Jeans”
“When Print Is Too Much”
“The Overalls Trend”
“Fall’s It Color: Blush”

Stuck? Get a hint
13.
Let’s get Isa’s blog connected to the rest of the web! In the first paragraph, turn ‘NYFW’ into a link and have it go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week.

Make sure to include the target="_blank" attribute so that it opens in a new page.


Stuck? Get a hint
14.
Isa wants to make sure that her friends can get in touch with her. At the bottom of your body, add a new <div> and set its id='contact'. Inside the <div>, create a new <p> tag and put the following contact information inside of it:

email: isa@fashionblog.com | phone: 917-555-1098 | address: 371 284th St, New York, NY, 10001

15.
Inside the contact <div>, put <strong> opening and closing tags around “email”, “phone”, and “address”.

16.
Let’s make the profile picture a link to the contact section of the webpage. Find the profile <img> tag, and surround it by opening and closing <a> tags. In the <a> tag, set href="#contact".

17.
Congrats! You’ve got the beginnings of a solid fashion blog. Feel free to make modifications and practice your HTML by adding more content.

Elocator and spiritual rapier and psionic improvements

Elocator:
-Floats, displacement, two high-damage psionic spiritual rapiers, and psionic magic
-Cancelling makes them much easier.
-As they are humanoids, they are likely to be taken out by mind flayer genocides :(

Spiritual rapier improvements
-Create multiple variants of the AT_type to address what the attacker is doing with their hands.
-Spiritual rapiers convert to regular weapon attacks when the monster is cancelled, using the info introduced above
-Psionic spiritual rapiers pass through mindless targets
-Spiritual rapier damage is also reduced my half spell damage.
-Masked Queen gets a deva version of her starlight rapier, which can one shot most characters and vampires in particular.
--So, you know, don't wake up a statue of her.

Psionic improvements
-Psionic magic in general and psi bolt in particular both fail vs. mindless targets (the PC is never mindless)
-Standard die size increased to d15s (ouch)

Required changes to use depth in retro postprocess

@petchema Here's the third iteration. This one passes down depth information correctly thanks to the information you found earlier. And I also made a mistake when sampling depth buffer in shader, so it really was just a fluke my last effort worked. Here's the summary of changes:
-RetroRenderer is now attached to main Camera object. All it does at the moment is set render targets and OnPostRender blit into a presentation rendertexture. This avoids OnRenderImage so depth information is preserved. Also retro postprocess shader needs to be called from main camera render to get global _CameraDepthTexture from that camera.
-There's now a RetroPresentation camera object that uses OnRenderImage just to blit the presentation rendertexture into viewport. By this stage everything has been rendered and processed into RetroPresentation rendertexture.
-Disabled queue=transparent in billboard batch shader or it doesn't write to depthbuffer. This is great for depth postprocess, not great for self shadowing. Maybe just need to live with self shadowing, it's really not that bad.
-Example DepthProcessShader just to tint sky green and world red.

I think we've basically solved everything at this point other than self-shadowing, and it's not so bad. Particles should all work as normal with this setup.

Let me know your thoughts on this one.
