Removes Tactical Resting (#61552)

About The Pull Request

If you are on combat mode, your bullets will hit people lying down or stunned, otherwise they pass through.
Why It's Good For The Game

The original PR that added it was labeled a fix (#55495) only mentioning it in the changelog once, when it was a balance change, as resting to avoid bullets was intentionally removed after we added crawling and a rest button, for being fucking stupid.
The thing that original pr "fixed" was mobs being bullet sponges, which you can now prevent by switching off combat mode, so it is no longer needed.
Avoiding people shooting at you while also having guns of your own you are perfectly able to shoot is stupid.
It makes mobs like beepsky super annoying, where unless youre in a large area the robot chasing you with one of the only hardstuns left in the game will be really hard to hit.
Changelog

[MIRROR] Icebox Mining Adjustments and Major Fixes (#8301)

* Icebox Mining Adjustments and Major Fixes (#61529)

* Icebox Mining Adjustments

This is a small tweak of Icebox Mining geared towards bringing it in line with mapping standards.

* Fire Extinguisher

I guess I added this while writing the PR

* Kills a duplicate railing I missed

* Adds layer adapter to pipenet

* Airlock Widening

You know, you never really appreciate how XL station miners are until you realize that those swole explorers come back with gigantic crates of ore in tow. You can't blame a mapper for forgetting that doorways for mining need to be extra THICC, that's with 3 C's mind you because 1-wide doorways just don't do. Even if they look better. Looks only dictate so much, and while we need to keep worrying about icebox aesthetics (it's really not an aesthetic station, time hasn't done it well) we can't let aesthetics get in the way of design convention. And when your mapwork causes air alarms to go off left right and center, you know you've done something wrong. I want it to be 1-wide, oh I do, but Miners won't like that the firelocks trap them in their icy igloo. Plus, I remapped all this to PREVENT this exact scenario, and I had so much damn fun with it that I almost put it back in. Thank god for excessive review.

expand the glyphs

The walls for the mines, gehennom, knox, and sokoban had been
changed at the "tile"-level, with no awareness of the core game,
or non-tile interfaces.
- Expand the glyphs to include a set of walls for the main level
as well as each of those mentioned above.

Altars had been adjusted at the map_glyphinfo() level to substitute
some color variations on-the-fly for unaligned, chaotic, neutral,
lawful altars, and shrines. The tile interface had no awareness of
the feature.
- Expand the glyphs to include each of the altar variations that
had been implemented in the display code for tty-only. This required
the addition of four placeholder tiles in other.txt. Someone with
artistic skill will hopefully alter the additional tiles to better
reflect their intended purpose.

Explosions had unique tiles in the tile window port, and the display
code for tty tinkered with the colors, but the game had very little
awareness of the different types of explosions.
- Expand the glyphs to include each of the explosion types: dark,
noxious, muddy, wet, magical, fiery and frosty.

Pile-markers to represent a pile had been introduced at the
display-level, without little to no awareness by the core game.
- Expand the glyphs to include piletops, including objects,
bodys, and statues.

Recently male and female variations of tiles and monsters had been
had been introduced, but the mechanics had been mostly done at the
display-level through a marker flag. The window port interface then
had to increment the tile mapped to the glyph to get the female version
of the tile.
- Expand the glyphs to include the male and female versions of the
monsters, and their corresponding pet versions, ridden, detected
versions and statues of them.

Direct references to GLYPH_BODY_OFF and GLYPH_STATUE_OFF
in object_from_map() in pager.c were getting incomplete results.
- Add macros glyph_to_body_corpsenm(glyph) and
glyph_to_statue_corpsenm(glyph) macros for obtaining the corpsenm
value after passing the glyph_is_body() or glyph_is_statue() test.

Other relevant notes:

- The tile ordering in the win/share/*.txt tile files has been altered,
other.txt in particular.

- tilemap.c has had a lot of alterations to accommodate the expanded
glyphs. Output that is useful for troubleshooting will end up in
tilemappings.lst if OBTAIN_TILEMAP is defined during build.
It lists all of the glyphs and which tile it gets mapped to, and also
lists each tile and some of the references to it by various glyphs.

- An array glyphmap[MAXGLYPH] is now used. It has an entry for each
glyph, ordered by glyph, and once reset_glyphs(glyph) has been run, it
contains the mapped symindex, default color, glyphflags, and tile
index.
If USE_TILES is defined during build, the tile.c produced from the
tilemap utility populates the tileidx field of each array element with
a glyph-to-tile mapping for the glyph. Later on, when reset_glyphmap()
is run, the other fields of each element will get populated.

- The glyph-to-tile mapping is an added field available to a window
port via the glyphinfo struct passed in the documented interface. The
old glyph2tile[] array is gone. The various active window ports that
had been using glyph2tile[] have been updated to use the new interface
mechanism. Disclaimer: There may be some bug fixing or tidying
required in the window port code.

- reset_glyphmap() is called after config file options parsing
has finished, because some config file settings can impact the results
produced by reset_glyphmap().

- Everything that passes the glyph_is_cmap(glyph) test must
return a valid cmap value from glyph_to_cmap(glyph).

- An 'extern glyph_info glyphmap[MAX_GLYPH];' is inserted into the
top of only the files which need awareness of it, not inserted into
display.h. Presently, the only files that actually need to directly
reference the glyphmap[] array are display.c, o_init.c (for shuffling
the tiles), and the generated tile.c (if USE_TILES is defined).

- Added an MG_MALE glyphflag to complement the MG_FEMALE glyphflag.

- Provide an array for wall colorizations. reset_glyphmap() will draw
the colors from this array: int array wallcolors[sokoban_walls + 1];
The indices of the wallcolors array are main_walls (0), mines_walls
(1), gehennom_walls (2), knox_walls (3), and sokoban_walls (4).
In future, a config file option for adjusting the wall colors and/or
an 'O' option menu to do the same could be added. Right now, the
initializaton of the wallcolors[] array entries in display.c leaves the
walls at CLR_GRAY, matching the defsym color.

- Most of the display-level kludges for some of the on-the-fly
interface features have been removed from map_glyphinfo() as they
aren't needed any longer. These glyph expansions adhere more closely to
the original glyph mechanics of the game.

- Because the glyphs are re-ordered and expanded, an update to
editlevel will be required upon merge of these changes.

fix(emails): back in time of tables

* added wonderful (and truly powerful - painful i mean) table-structured layout
* the main copmponents of the mails should work pretty anywhere (tested on gmail and outlook)
  and don't disturb reading / interaction
* elements that will never work everywhere:
  font: <link> tags are disabled on a lot of clients and there is no workaround
  social icons: embed <svg> tags are broken in most of the email clients. They are
    loaded in the emails with a <img> tag, using their base64 form (which has not a
    really good support, but displays a loading error message)
* other elements which will not work for some user
  text-decoration: microsoft does not allow us to disable these ugly lines
  border-radius: the buttons will look less fancy (thank you microsoft)
  overflow: the table will look less fancy at its edges
  border-spacing: microsoft definitely hates emails
  border: microsoft completely breaks the separators and renders squares instead of circles

Implement Nazgul shrieking

This is a feature that originated in SporkHack and made its way to
UnNetHack and EvilHack. Yet like so many other things I've pulled from
those variants, this is a fresh implementation.

I did not really like the system of having it be a new "scream" attack
type that the Nazgul executed as part of attacking the player. Part of
their whole deal in LOTR was crying from a distance and disquieting and
dismaying the heroes, even when they weren't targeting them directly. It
works better if it's not something they only deploy when charging into
battle.

Thus, I implemented it as an m_respond action instead, which allows them
to shriek on their own. They are still more likely to use it when
attacking, but the point is you can now hear the sound from across the
level and go "Oh, there's a Nazgul around." (Also, it's a "shriek" and
not a "scream" because the former fits better in my opinion.)

I also added a Charisma saving throw for the player and the ability for
the shriek to affect monsters. I expect it will make fighting Nazgul a
little more interesting since the shriek could actually be beneficial if
they let it off in a big crowd.

This commit also adds the M1_SEE_INVIS flag to Nazgul, since seeing
unseen things is pretty explicitly one of their abilities in LOTR. (Only
at night, but we're in a dungeon here.)

library: add item origin (as comments) to header files

A lack of documentation seems to be the major obstacle
to releasing this new library. So, in an effort to get
the ball rolling again, this patch adds the origins of
each item as a comment to six of the new header files.

However, before reviewing how such changes may benefit
that documentation objective, it seemed appropriate to
first reflect on newlib's background & current status.

___________________________________________ BACKGROUND
Discussions about and work on a new library began back
in July 2012 but quickly died. After a lull of 2 years
those discussions were resumed in August 2014 but soon
died also (and no code survived the gitorious demise).

With those early discussions, the recommended approach
was to encapsulate all of the libprocps data offerings
in individual functions. When it came to extensibility
it was suggested we should rely on symbols versioning.

Unfortunately that approach would have made for a huge
Application Programming Interface virtually impossible
to master or even document. And, runtime call overhead
would have been substantial for ps and especially top.

So, an alternative design was sought but there were no
new suggestions/contributions via freelists or gitlab.
Thus, in spite of a lack of library design experience,
the procps-ng team (Craig & Jim) set out to develop an
alternative API, more concise and with lower overhead.

https://www.freelists.org/post/procps/Old-library-calls
. 08/12/2014, revival of library design discussion
https://www.freelists.org/post/procps/libprocs-redesign

_____________________________________ DESIGN EVOLUTION
Our newlib branch first appeared on June 14, 2015. And
our current API actually represents the 4th generation
during the past 3 years of evolution. First, there was
a basic 'new', 'get' and 'unref' approach, using enums
to minimize the proliferation of 'get' function calls.

Then, in anticipation of other programs like ps, where
multiple fields times multiple processes would greatly
increase the number of 'get' function calls, a concept
of 'chains' was introduced. This became generation #2.

Such 'chains' proved unnecessarily complex so 'stacks'
replaced them. This was considered the 3rd generation,
but too many implementation details were still exposed
requiring those users to 'alloc', 'read', 'fill', etc.

Finally, a 4th generation emerged representing several
refinements to standardize and minimize those exported
functions, thus hiding all implementation details from
the users. Lastly, handling of 'errno' was normalized.

https://www.freelists.org/post/procps/some-more-master-newlib-stuff

_______________________________________ CURRENT DESIGN
Central to this new design is a simple 'result' struct
reflecting an item plus its value (thanks to a union).
As a user option, these item structures can be grouped
into 'stacks', yielding many results with just 1 call.
Such a 'stack' can be seen as a variable length record
whose content/order is determined solely by the users.

Within that 'result' structure, the union has standard
C language types so there is never a doubt how a value
should be used in a printf statement. Given that linux
requires a least a 32-bit platform the only difference
in capacity surrounds 'long' integers. And, where such
types might be used, the 32-bit maximums are adequate.

The items themselves are simply enumerators defined in
the respective header files. A user can name any items
of interest then the library magically provides result
structure(s). The approach was proven to be extensible
without breaking the ABI (in commit referenced below).

The 6 major APIs each provide for the following calls:
. 'new' ---------> always required as the first call .
. 'ref' -------------------------> strictly optional .
. 'unref' --------> optional, if ill-behaved program .
. 'get' --------------------> retrieve a single item .
. 'select' ----------------> retrieve multiple items .

And the 'get' and 'select' functions provide for delta
results representing the difference between successive
get/select calls (or a 'new' then  'get/select' call).

For the <diskstats>, <pids>, <slabinfo> & <stat> APIs,
where results are unpredictable, a 'reap' function can
return multiple result structures for multiple stacks.

The <pids> API differs from others in that those items
of interest must be provided at 'new' or 'reset' time,
a function unique to this API. And the <pids> 'select'
function requires PIDs or UIDs which are to be fetched
which then operates as a subset of 'reap'. Lastly, the
'get' function is an iterator for successive PIDs/TIDs
returning items previously identified via 'new/reset'.

To provide assistance to users during development, the
special header 'proc/xtra-procps-debug.h' is available
to check type usage against library expectations. That
check is activated by including this header explicitly
or via build using: ./configure '-DXTRA_PROCPS_DEBUG'.

commit 09e1886c9e731f8b8c89a55d11f72f53f030b2de

_________________________ INITIAL DOCUMENTATION EFFORT
The initial attempt, referenced below, dealt primarily
with the <pids> interface. Separate man pages for each
exported function were created. Plus there was another
document describing the items, among other miscellany.

Adopting such an approach encounters several problems:

1. In order to use these man pages, users are required
to already know how to use the library. Or alternately
one could randomly search each of them while trying to
ascertain which function call satisfies their need and
what exactly was the proper compliment/order required.

2. While we can explain what all of those <pids> items
represent, that certainly isn't true for all the APIs.
See the gaps in kernel documentation for <meminfo> and
complete lack of documentation with that <vmstat> API.

3. Our documentation effort should take pains to avoid
unnecessary implementation details. Here's an example:
. "The pointer to info will have memory"
. "allocated and a structure created."

Alternatively, the following conveys user requirements
while not offering any internal implementation detail:
. "You must provide the address of a NULL"
. "info structure pointer."

Reference(s):
. 01/04/2017, initial documentation offering
https://www.freelists.org/post/procps/Using-reap-and-get
commit 2598e9f2ce39c93ebf55f664454d3bea919ed4e0

___________________ RECOMMENDED DOCUMENTATION APPROACH
I recommend that the newlib documentation consist of 3
man pages only. The first would cover the 5 major APIs
and their common functions. The second would deal with
the <pids> API exclusively, explaining how it differs.
Any remaining exported libproc functions which are yet
to be included could be represented in a 3rd document.

For these new documents the following are are assumed:

1. Since we will not be able to document all items, we
shouldn't try to document any items. We should instead
rely on proc(5) or Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt.

2. Program development often involves referencing some
header file(s). So, make that an absolute requirement.

3. With the addition of item origins, represented with
this commit, and considering that 'types' were already
present, the header file might be all some users need.

4. And who knows, when a user of our libproc complains
about gaps in their documentation, it might prompt the
kernel folks to correct those long standing omissions.

To summarize, I suggest that we replace that libproc.3
document with a more general one explaining the basics
of accessing this new library and the common calls for
most of the major interfaces. We can then create a new
document (libproc-pids.3?), which explains differences
in using the <PIDS> application programming interface.
A final document (libproc-misc.3?) covers what's left.
