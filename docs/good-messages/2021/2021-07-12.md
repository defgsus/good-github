And for idiot MH! I don´t copy, i find the streams self with an Samsung TV of a friend and with tools to find subdomains!!!! In your m3u's are ONLY the crappy URL's from amazonaws.com in it, which have constantly dropouts! I have the streams from wurl and amagi, they run clean! Why is:
-TOP FILM DE
-KINO DE
-DEUTSCHES KINO DE
-ROMANCE DE

and some others not in your lists??? Why are they NOT in your lists, you are supposed to be so good! They have been in our m3´s for a longer time! Haha...

2 Examples, Subdomains and the correct stream address (DK and DE):
Subdomain; rakuten-gratis-topfilm-1-eu.rakuten.wurl.tv

Correct stream: rakuten-gratis-topfilm-1-eu.rakuten.wurl.tv/playlist.m3u8
Subdomain: travelxp-travelxp-2-de.samsung.wurl.com

Correct stream:  travelxp-travelxp-2-de.samsung.wurl.com/manifest/playlist.m3u8

and so on. It is similar with Amagi.TV! So... fuck you and don't talk that bullshit about copy your stocking streams from amazonaws.com!

Just stop posting lies about our repo, in the long run you are ONLY hurting yourself! And... Never going to give you up... Haha...

x86/sgx: Add SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_PROVISION

Upstream commit id:
c82c61865024b9981f00358433bebed92ca20c00

The whole point of SGX is to create a hardware protected place to do
“stuff”. But, before someone is willing to hand over the keys to
the castle , an enclave must often prove that it is running on an
SGX-protected processor. Provisioning enclaves play a key role in
providing proof.

There are actually three different enclaves in play in order to make this
happen:

1. The application enclave.  The familiar one we know and love that runs
   the actual code that’s doing real work.  There can be many of these on
   a single system, or even in a single application.
2. The quoting enclave  (QE).  The QE is mentioned in lots of silly
   whitepapers, but, for the purposes of kernel enabling, just pretend they
   do not exist.
3. The provisioning enclave.  There is typically only one of these
   enclaves per system.  Provisioning enclaves have access to a special
   hardware key.

   They can use this key to help to generate certificates which serve as
   proof that enclaves are running on trusted SGX hardware.  These
   certificates can be passed around without revealing the special key.

Any user who can create a provisioning enclave can access the
processor-unique Provisioning Certificate Key which has privacy and
fingerprinting implications. Even if a user is permitted to create
normal application enclaves (via /dev/sgx_enclave), they should not be
able to create provisioning enclaves. That means a separate permissions
scheme is needed to control provisioning enclave privileges.

Implement a separate device file (/dev/sgx_provision) which allows
creating provisioning enclaves. This device will typically have more
strict permissions than the plain enclave device.

The actual device “driver” is an empty stub.  Open file descriptors for
this device will represent a token which allows provisioning enclave duty.
This file descriptor can be passed around and ultimately given as an
argument to the /dev/sgx_enclave driver ioctl().

[skip ci] doned the Don't Stop the gameover song

WOw, it was really short afterall. 2 loops that's it.

also fixed empty Test.ogg voice file. Yeah, I just discovered that it's just empty file the vanilla provides. Now, apparently I must go back to Madbrine's yoink of test.ogg files he got from week7, this time take the voice file. and there you have it.

Seriously Ninja? you've tricked us again.

right what else to do? we need to analyze Breakfast & title classic song.

"10:30am. Let me make a show of appreciation here and plug a story I've been reading recently. It is why I've been going to sleep at 2am for the past few days and getting up late.

https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40150/pith

Most of the GB stories out there are garbage and I should know since it is my hobby to read them. I've enjoyed Magic Smithing and the Hive Queen on Royal Road, but Pith is in a league on its own from characterization to world building. It starts off with an interesting premise - the MC tries stealing a body to transfer her soul into, and keeps being strong throughout.

It is currently on hiatus because the author has developed repetitive strain injuries due to too much writing, but he otherwise is eager to continue it. 5/5.

10:45am. Let me chill for a while, I do not feel like rushing it. There are too few hours in a day for me.

Today's agenda is to get the Python scripts adjusted and run a transformer for the first time.

11:25am. Almost done with chilling. Let me just read a bit more and then I will finally start. Though, maybe I should just have breakfast instead of starting and droping it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/oif5dp/d_adding_guassian_noise_to_discriminator_layers/

Let me also plug this thread. I am shocked that nobody tried this before.

11:30am. I am want the deal to sweeten a bit before I try unsupervised learning. Trying upside down RL, soured me on the prospects of composing different methods.

What I have in mind is not enough. I want something new, some better principles for how to compose disparate tasks and methods.

I could resume Simulacrum tomorrow, but just having the story ideas is not enough for me. I want the algorithmic advancements to inspire me, and deep learning is not enough. The way nature does mind engineering is way beyond anything I could do with backprop. I want to understand it, but it is beyond my capacity to infer. So I'll dig in at my present level and wait for the opportunity to come. I want to look at the algorithms nature uses and take from that the nature of reality. Necromutation might be transcendence, but that view is too low resolution. I need more to motivate me.

Let me do some programming.

Ah, right. The next things are `create_args` modules.

```
inl main () =
    open leduc
    inl vs_self = train.vs_self leduc.game
    inl vs_one = train.vs_one leduc.game
    inl neural = train.neural agent.neural_leduc.extractor agent.neural_leduc.schema()
    inl uniform_player : ra u64 (pl2 card action * leduc_state * u8 * a u64 action) -> a u64 (log_prob * action) * (a u64 r2 -> a u64 r2) =
        agent.uniform.policy
    inl tabular =
        inl create_policy : agent.tabular.agent_dict (list (choice2 card action)) card * bool * bool * f32 -> ra u64 (pl2 card action * leduc_state * u8 * a u64 action) -> a u64 (log_prob * action) * (a u64 r2 -> a u64 r2) =
            agent.tabular.policy agent.neural_leduc.extractor'
        inl create_agent () : agent.tabular.agent_dict (list (choice2 card action)) card = dictm.empty
        inl optimize : agent.tabular.agent_dict (list (choice2 card action)) card -> () = agent.tabular.optimize
        inl average : agent.tabular.agent_dict (list (choice2 card action)) card * agent.tabular.agent_dict (list (choice2 card action)) card -> () = agent.tabular.average
        inl head_multiply_ : agent.tabular.agent_dict (list (choice2 card action)) card * _ -> _ = agent.tabular.head_multiply_
        namedtuple "Tabular" {create_policy create_agent head_multiply_ optimize average}

    record {vs_self vs_one neural uniform_player tabular}
```

Here is the `create_args_leduc`. Now let me do the other one.

```
inl main () =
    open hu_holdem
    inl vs_self x = train.vs_self (game x)
    inl vs_one x = train.vs_one (game x)
    inl uniform_player : ra u64 (pl2 i8 action * ({hand : i8 * i8; id : u8; pot : i16} * {hand : i8 * i8; id : u8; pot : i16} * a i16 i8 * i16 * bool) * u8 * a i16 action) -> a u64 (log_prob * action) * (a u64 r2 -> a u64 r2) = agent.uniform.policy
    inl callbot_player : ra u64 (pl2 i8 action * ({hand : i8 * i8; id : u8; pot : i16} * {hand : i8 * i8; id : u8; pot : i16} * a i16 i8 * i16 * bool) * u8 * a i16 action) -> a u64 (log_prob * action) * (a u64 r2 -> a u64 r2) = agent.holdem_callbot.policy
    inl neural stack_size = train.neural agent.neural_holdem.extractor (agent.neural_holdem.schema stack_size)
    record {ui train = record {vs_self vs_one uniform_player callbot_player neural}}
```

Yes, this is fine. No type errors in the workspace. Let me try compiling it. ...It went through. No type errors during peval.

12pm. Focus me, stop taking peeks at the Pathfinder thread.

Now that I am done with the Spiral side...

12:25pm. I know I should be heading straight into Python scripts, but I am having some inspiration.

It might be possible to get rid of the actor by instead taking the max over the values in the critic. The way to derive a policy would be to pass an noise vector along with the inputs. Varying that noise vector would give an implicit policy.

Why would that might be worth trying out? The reason is that all the variance of importance sampling that CFR does would simply go away if the sampling and the policy distributions were one-hot.

Right now I understand very well that the algorithm is unsuitable for anything but short sequences because of that.

12:35pm. Let me stop here."

kernel: turn off the other load address hackery

We have relocations where it matters, except 6809 which can be fixed easily
enough and a few platforms where relocation is expensive and fairly pointless
like 8080/8085 which always load at 0x100 and seem unlikely to ever need
relocatable binaries. except to run on Z80 systems. 8080 reloc isn't hard to
do anyway if we need it.

Removing this ability makes a ton of ugly bits of asm magic a lot easier

NF: Clarifying Compat's javadoc

In CompatVn I indicate that detailled explanations are given in Compat.java.
It was not clear to me at first that Compat.java not only contained the interface, but described the expected content of
the hierarchy.

I love examples. The trouble is that current Compat example are outdated, which make them hard to understand. I updated
them. Those example may become outdated again in the future. At least we will have had up to date example for a while.

I tried to rephrase Compat's javadoc. I had to re read multiple time to really grasp its meaning. I hope to make it more
clear.
