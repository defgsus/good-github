Fix: Moloch uncursing cursed objects via prayer.

Moloch shouldn't be uncursing anything. As Moloch is the deity that
embodies all that is evil, instead of uncursing cursed objects, Moloch
will curse any blessed objects in open inventory. For the most part,
this is desireable for the Infidel role, but the player will still want
some objects to stay blessed. Not that Moloch cares.

I wasn't smart enough to learn a computer language like Python—until I got smart about how to learn it.
I was smart enough to earn an honors degree in philosophy from Harvard, but an aptitude test told me to avoid computer programming. I'm sure it was right. But then I designed a learning system for myself that quadrupled my aptitude for learning computer languages. It worked so well for me that I've used it to teach coding to grandmothers, cab drivers, musicians, and 50,000 other newbies.

"Mark Myers' method of getting what can be...difficult information into a format that makes it exponentially easier to consume, truly understand, and synthesize into real-world application is beyond anything I've encountered before." —Amazon reviewer Jason A. Ruby reviewing my first book, A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript

Quadruple your learning ability.

Washington University research shows that a key teaching method I use—interactive recall practice—improves learning performance 400 percent.

"I don't feel lost and I don't feel that I am forgetting things as I go along." —Amazon reviewer Leonie M. reviewing my second book, A Smarter Way to Learn HTML and CSS

Understanding is easy. Remembering is hard.

Computer languages are not inherently hard to understand, even for non-techies. Remembering is the problem. If you remember all of Chapter 1 through Chapter 10, you'll understand Chapter 11. But you don't remember. Though you read and read, most of it doesn't stick. You don't have a solid foundation to build on. Halfway through the book, it all collapses. That's when most people give up.

"I've signed up to a few sites like Udemy, Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, Lynda, YouTube videos, even searched on Coursera but nothing seemed to work for me. This book takes only 10 minutes each chapter and after that, you can exercise what you've just learned right away!" —Amazon reviewer Constanza Morales reviewing my first book, A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript

Interactive exercises make it stick.

Research shows that you will remember everything if you're repeatedly asked to recall it. That's the beauty of flash cards. But technology offers an even better way to make information stick. With my book you get almost a thousand interactive exercises—they're free online—that embed the whole book in your memory. Algorithms check your work to make sure you know what you think you know. When you stumble, you do the exercise again. You keep trying until you know the chapter cold.

"Not only do the exercises make learning fun, they reinforce the material right away so it sinks in deeper." —Amazon reviewer Timothy B. Miller reviewing my second book, A Smarter Way to Learn HTML and CSS

You won't get bored or sleepy.

The exercises keep you engaged, give you extra practice where you're shaky, and prepare you for each next step. Every lesson is built on top of a solid foundation that you and I have carefully constructed. Each individual step is small. But all the little steps add up to real knowledge—knowledge that you retain.

I finally feel like I KNOW it and won't need to look up the syntax each time..." —Amazon reviewer J. Caritas reviewing my third book, A Smarter Way to Learn jQuery

Really, it ain't that hard.

Reviewing my books on Amazon, readers who've struggled with programming concepts like functions, loops, and scope write, "I had no idea these things were so simple!"

"...makes it much easier to suddenly realize a concept that seemed abstract and too hard to wrap your head around is suddenly not complicated at all." — Amazon reviewer IMHO reviewing A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript

You don't need to be a computer genius to learn Python. You just need to be smart about how you learn it.

Version 2:
* Updated version and resized origin icon.
* README.md links to Curseforge now.
* Fixed Piglins still looting while a Tarnished Reputation player is nearby.
* Spatial Stride cooldown AND activation length shortened by approximately 30%.
* Changed Planewalk to make the player move 35 blocks instead of 25.
* Planewalk sends you to the position in the other dimension that was at where you activated it, rather than where the Planewalk's distance condition fulfills itself.
* Positional Anchor now has a cooldown of 4 seconds.
* Corrupted Blood now only blocks health-related effects.
* Replaced Malform Soul with the Soulfood power.
Soulfood:
-You can eat but not gain nourishment from food
-You can pickup experience orbs but they give sustenance and not experience
-You can use bottles to exchange some of your hunger bar for Bottles o' Enchanting.
-Mending and anvils work as they use to.

TRAPPED. 

I start to grow sharp edges and I will not let anyone get close to me. That is my problem. Getting my “shit” together requires such an enormous level of honesty and despair that I can not even begin to imagine. I have learned to love and hate myself a thousand times over again. It is like a funeral I have attended time and time again, reminding myself each time of the person I used to be.

v0.6: 4-class emotion prediction via 2D emotional theory

v0.6: 4-class emotion prediction via 2D emotional theory

Simulation results as average testing accuracy:
—— CNN: (-4C) 50.48%; (-4Q) 65.71%
—— CNN+LSTM: (-4C) ???%; (-4Q) ???%

Updated from v0.5 (please read IMPORTANT updates!):

—— IMPRORTANT: Implementation of predicting 4-class emotion via 2D emotional theory (valence and arousal). Relative scripts with such 2D emotion implementation are provided with the name as ‘-4Q’; Otherwise the direct 4-class emotion prediction with the name as ‘-4C’.
	1) The model with such implementation predicts 2D emotion (i.e. [‘valence’, ‘arousal’]). USE Is_2D_to_quardrant_emotion to enable/disable such implementation.
	2) The 4-class emotion is then given by the corresponding quadrant of 2D emotion, which is for BOTH predicted and self-reported (i.e. given) emotions. That is, the self-reported 4-class emotion is NOT used in this case (because in the given self-reports we have 19/108 data of which 4-class emotion and 2D emotion DO NOT MATCH!).
	3) In any case you want to try to use the self-reported 4-class emotion for accuracy, see the commented code in test function and the last cell.
	4) The training-dependent loss is based on 2D emotion, whilst the training-independent accuracy is based on 4-class emotion.
	5) LabelRange with such implementation should be set to [1, 9].

—— IMPRORTANT: Early stopping and best epoch implemented.
	Early stopping here is based on the validation loss. The temporal patience is given as the model hyper-parameter ‘patience’ in args. Best epoch is now printed after training in each fold.

—— IMPRORTANT: All loss and accuracy are now given as from the corresponding best epoch.
	NOTE in the previous version accuracy is given as the maximum over all epochs, which is NOT that reasonable!

—— Best model from the corresponding best epoch in each fold is now deep-copied for storage.

—— Baseline (25%) shown in the accuracy plots as dashed black line.

Potentially expected in the following update:
—— Parameter & model improvement...most crucial (
—— Subject- and game-based generalisation.
—— Simulation results from MLP, LSTM, etc. model for comparison. Please don’t show the result better than CNN+LSTM!
—— Improve CerealTimeKillersDataLoader function to handle data downloaded online (see Pan's code).
—— Show 2D plots of emotional state from 2D emotion?
—— Show feature maps from relevant hidden layers (if feasible)?
—— etc. (whatever you want)

Added RURLPARK to Gan Breeder 

# Ganbreeder RURLPARK
RURLPARK is an eight feature GAN Breeder Genomics Organization
This turn key app is a proof of generative adversarial network concept with genomics AI showing that GAN's can solve any domain specific problem as long as it fits within the theory of Cognitive Architecture governing what the users are thinking while playing with the application.  This approach gamifies user interaction and allows labeling and speciation where species of assets are created.  Note the level or VR sophistication has to keep up with the the persistent AI space which in GANbreeder is the adjusted weight of feature genes that contribute to a transform on the visual 2D world.

RURLPARK:
1) Face - Easiest read out of expression including emotion.
2) Body - Encapsulation of all organs, systems, the mind, and wearables as one body.
3) Home - Both the location, capability, and function to serve as a base for daily living.  Can include any location you would stay at.
4) Landscape - Areas you visit that hold biomes or networks of life between species.
5) Sea, Space, and Spaceships - Frontiers between places.
6) Cities - Interaction of work places, resource structures, homes, and individual bodies representing a biome cluster including neighborhoods.
7) Artifacts - Any object we can find, wear, or trade.
8) UI and Deployment mechanism to allow sharing and interactivity with no code applications and services.

Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers

In the HTML5 and CSS section of freeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let's go back to it. This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework.

Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>
In this case, we've already added it for you to this page behind the scenes. Note that using either > or /> to close the link tag is acceptable.

To get started, we should nest all of our HTML (except the link tag and the style element) in a div element with the class container-fluid.

Answer:
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

Make Images Mobile Responsive

First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats.

It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.

Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page.

Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button

Normally, your button elements with the btn and btn-default classes are only as wide as the text that they contain. For example:

<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
This button would only be as wide as the word Submit.


By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.

<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>
This button would take up 100% of the available width.


Note that these buttons still need the btn class.

Add Bootstrap's btn-block class to your Bootstrap button.

Warn Your Users of a Dangerous Action with btn-danger

Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-danger class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a cat photo.

made it so the all tab only shows project names. solution was to add an && to the conditional. if displayFrom === false && item.from !== all => then show item.from. It's fucking brilliant and I love the solution. i'm on fire

Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side By Side

Bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.

Bootstrap has different column width attributes that it uses depending on how wide the user's screen is. For example, phones have narrow screens, and laptops have wider screens.

Take for example Bootstrap's col-md-* class. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.

In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use col-xs-*, where xs means extra small (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), and * is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be.

Put the Like, Info and Delete buttons side-by-side by nesting all three of them within one <div class="row"> element, then each of them within a <div class="col-xs-4"> element.

The row class is applied to a div, and the buttons themselves can be nested within it.

Ditch Custom CSS for Bootstrap

We can clean up our code and make our Cat Photo App look more conventional by using Bootstrap's built-in styles instead of the custom styles we created earlier.

Don't worry - there will be plenty of time to customize our CSS later.

Delete the .red-text, p, and .smaller-image CSS declarations from your style element so that the only declarations left in your style element are h2 and thick-green-border.

Then delete the p element that contains a dead link. Then remove the red-text class from your h2 element and replace it with the text-primary Bootstrap class.

Finally, remove the smaller-image class from your first img element and replace it with the img-responsive class.

Use a span to Target Inline Elements

You can use spans to create inline elements. Remember when we used the btn-block class to make the button fill the entire row?



That illustrates the difference between an "inline" element and a "block" element.

By using the inline span element, you can put several elements on the same line, and even style different parts of the same line differently.

Using a span element, nest the word love inside the p element that currently has the text Things cats love. Then give the span the class text-danger to make the text red.

Here's how you would do this for the p element that has the text Top 3 things cats hate:

<p>Top 3 things cats <span class="text-danger">hate:</span></p>

Implement wordMap.java

A quick attempt at creating a Map that keeps track of all words that appear in the video description. At present, the logic for identifying words is absolutely awful and should be avoided if at all possible. Better yet, improve it. That's just a note to self.

//main.java:

Deleted excess bullshit, created logic that appends a list with each video scanned so I can go back and access the data of each.

//wordMap.java

Made the entire file/class. Go read the code comments.
