Fixed Persons for ESS

In ESS Persons should, largely, be capturable, with the exception of MZ's ship which should be considered a boss fight. So balanced them towards being OP, but not game breakingly so. 

1: Changed Pester to using a Human ship, now with even more meme potential
2: Fixed MMK so it no longer uses human technology but is still just about as OP
3: Nerfed Tehh's PotP 'murrica meme ship from its "oh my fucking god" status by ensuring its opener is now *not a nuke,* brought its t3.5 superpower status down so that it poses a respectable challenge rather than a punishment for playing the game, removed the stupid amount of damage its final explode did because *why would you punish players for killing this ship in the first place.* It still fights like a troll ship, but now it at least isn't a developer intended malicious troll ship.

##### 2021-05-25 13:06:22 by Kirk McKusick

Fix handling of embedded symbolic links (and history lesson).

The original filesystem release (4.2BSD) had no embedded sysmlinks.
Historically symbolic links were just a different type of file, so
the content of the symbolic link was contained in a single disk block
fragment. We observed that most symbolic links were short enough that
they could fit in the area of the inode that normally holds the block
pointers. So we created embedded symlinks where the content of the
link was held in the inode's pointer area thus avoiding the need to
seek and read a data fragment and reducing the pressure on the block
cache. At the time we had only UFS1 with 32-bit block pointers,
so the test for a fastlink was:

	di_size < (NDADDR + NIADDR) * sizeof(daddr_t)

(where daddr_t would be ufs1_daddr_t today).

When embedded symlinks were added, a spare field in the superblock
with a known zero value became fs_maxsymlinklen. New filesystems
set this field to (NDADDR + NIADDR) * sizeof(daddr_t). Embedded
symlinks were assumed when di_size < fs->fs_maxsymlinklen. Thus
filesystems that preceeded this change always read from blocks
(since fs->fs_maxsymlinklen == 0) and newer ones used embedded
symlinks if they fit. Similarly symlinks created on pre-embedded
symlink filesystems always spill into blocks while newer ones will
embed if they fit.

At the same time that the embedded symbolic links were added, the
on-disk directory structure was changed splitting the former
u_int16_t d_namlen into u_int8_t d_type and u_int8_t d_namlen.
Thus fs_maxsymlinklen <= 0 (as used by the OFSFMT() macro) can
be used to distinguish old directory formats. In retrospect that
should have just been an added flag, but we did not realize we
needed to know about that change until it was already in production.

Code was split into ufs/ffs so that the log structured filesystem could
use ufs functionality while doing its own disk layout. This meant
that no ffs superblock fields could be used in the ufs code. Thus
ffs superblock fields that were needed in ufs code had to be copied
to fields in the mount structure. Since ufs_readlink needed to know
if a link was embedded, fs_maxlinklen gets copied to mnt_maxsymlinklen.

The kernel panic that arose to making this fix was triggered when a
disk error created an inode of type symlink with no allocated data
blocks but a large size. When readlink was called the uiomove was
attempted which segment faulted.

static int
ufs_readlink(ap)
	struct vop_readlink_args /* {
		struct vnode *a_vp;
		struct uio *a_uio;
		struct ucred *a_cred;
	} */ *ap;
{
	struct vnode *vp = ap->a_vp;
	struct inode *ip = VTOI(vp);
	doff_t isize;

	isize = ip->i_size;
	if ((isize < vp->v_mount->mnt_maxsymlinklen) ||
	    DIP(ip, i_blocks) == 0) { /* XXX - for old fastlink support */
		return (uiomove(SHORTLINK(ip), isize, ap->a_uio));
	}
	return (VOP_READ(vp, ap->a_uio, 0, ap->a_cred));
}

The second part of the "if" statement that adds

	DIP(ip, i_blocks) == 0) { /* XXX - for old fastlink support */

is problematic. It never appeared in BSD released by Berkeley because
as noted above mnt_maxsymlinklen is 0 for old format filesystems, so
will always fall through to the VOP_READ as it should. I had to dig
back through `git blame' to find that Rodney Grimes added it as
part of ``The big 4.4BSD Lite to FreeBSD 2.0.0 (Development) patch.''
He must have brought it across from an earlier FreeBSD. Unfortunately
the source-control logs for FreeBSD up to the merger with the
AT&T-blessed 4.4BSD-Lite conversion were destroyed as part of the
agreement to let FreeBSD remain unencumbered, so I cannot pin-point
where that line got added on the FreeBSD side.

The one change needed here is that mnt_maxsymlinklen is declared as
an `int' and should be changed to be `u_int64_t'.

This discovery led us to check out the code that deletes symbolic
links. Specifically

	if (vp->v_type == VLNK &&
	    (ip->i_size < vp->v_mount->mnt_maxsymlinklen ||
	     datablocks == 0)) {
		if (length != 0)
			panic("ffs_truncate: partial truncate of symlink");
		bzero(SHORTLINK(ip), (u_int)ip->i_size);
		ip->i_size = 0;
		DIP_SET(ip, i_size, 0);
		UFS_INODE_SET_FLAG(ip, IN_SIZEMOD | IN_CHANGE | IN_UPDATE);
		if (needextclean)
			goto extclean;
		return (ffs_update(vp, waitforupdate));
	}

Here too our broken symlink inode with no data blocks allocated
and a large size will segment fault as we are incorrectly using the
test that we have no data blocks to decide that it is an embdedded
symbolic link and attempting to bzero past the end of the inode.
The test for datablocks == 0 is unnecessary as the test for
ip->i_size < vp->v_mount->mnt_maxsymlinklen will do the right
thing in all cases.

The test for datablocks == 0 was added by David Greenman in this commit:

Author: David Greenman <dg@FreeBSD.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 2 13:51:05 1994 +0000

    Completed (hopefully) the kernel support for old style "fastlinks".

    Notes:
	svn path=/head/; revision=1821

I am guessing that he likely earlier added the incorrect test in the
ufs_readlink code.

I asked David if he had any recollection of why he made this change.
Amazingly, he still had a recollection of why he had made a one-line
change more than twenty years ago. And unsurpisingly it was because
he had been stuck between a rock and a hard place.

FreeBSD was up to 1.1.5 before the switch to the 4.4BSD-Lite code
base. Prior to that, there were three years of development in all
areas of the kernel, including the filesystem code, from the combined
set of people including Bill Jolitz, Patchkit contributors, and
FreeBSD Project members. The compatibility issue at hand was caused
by the FASTLINKS patches from Curt Mayer. In merging in the 4.4BSD-Lite
changes David had to find a way to provide compatibility with both
the changes that had been made in FreeBSD 1.1.5 and with 4.4BSD-Lite.
He felt that these changes would provide compatibility with both systems.

In his words:
``My recollection is that the 'FASTLINKS' symlinks support in
FreeBSD-1.x, as implemented by Curt Mayer, worked differently than
4.4BSD. He used a spare field in the inode to duplicately store the
length. When the 4.4BSD-Lite merge was done, the optimized symlinks
support for existing filesystems (those that were initialized in
FreeBSD-1.x) were broken due to the FFS on-disk structure of
4.4BSD-Lite differing from FreeBSD-1.x. My commit was needed to
restore the backward compatibility with FreeBSD-1.x filesystems.
I think it was the best that could be done in the somewhat urgent
circumstances of the post Berkeley-USL settlement. Also, regarding
Rod's massive commit with little explanation, some context: John
Dyson and I did the initial re-port of the 4.4BSD-Lite kernel to
the 386 platform in just 10 days. It was by far the most intense
hacking effort of my life. In addition to the porting of tons of
FreeBSD-1 code, I think we wrote more than 30,000 lines of new code
in that time to deal with the missing pieces and architectural
changes of 4.4BSD-Lite. We didn't make many notes along the way.
There was a lot of pressure to get something out to the rest of the
developer community as fast as possible, so detailed discrete commits
didn't happen - it all came as a giant wad, which is why Rod's
commit message was worded the way it was.''

Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a 
relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results 
within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to 
predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. 

## Example 1:

Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.

We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house "sells for more or less than the asking price.
Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.

## Example 2:

**(a) Regression** - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

**(b) Classification** - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign. 

# Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily 
know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

## Example:

**Clustering:** Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related 
by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

**Non-clustering:** The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. 
(i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).

feat(Buttons): ColorModes + Props + Refactor + Refs Oh My! [GM-211] [REACH-856] [GM-192]

* Buttons now use `ButtonBase` to match with `Anchor`.
* Removes extra tagged templates to reduce Emotion Label spam and reduces internal style overhead.
* Button Colors are now serialized as variables inside of the base component depending on which mode they are.
* Buttons will now default to the current ColorMode if they have not been passed a prop.
* Also fixes a prop forwarding bug with CTAButton where inner component was not getting props forwarded.
* Adds all button types to the ColorMode example (small and large).
* Buttons now will use the current mode in context unless specified otherwise. Since all dark mode buttons are specifically configured this way there should be no changes to ANY existing button colors.
* Buttons now come with a few system props to make life easier including spacing layout and positioning. See prop reference here https://gamut.codecademy.com/storybook/?path=/docs/foundations-system-props--layout. Please note that these will cause issues with behavior if used incorrectly. Changes to display and padding may break button styles in some cases.
* All Buttons now accept a ref!

All rights reserved. Sign up for a free, verified PayPal Business Account Enter your PayPal credentials in the Braintree Control Panel Add PayPal as a payment method using our PayPal guide in the developer docs Required steps Sign up for a PayPal Business Account In order to use PayPal with Braintree, you'll need a PayPal Business Account. You can either sign up for a new account on PayPal's website, or upgrade an existing PayPal Premier account by completing the following steps:

Go to the Settings page in your PayPal account Click Upgrade to a Business account Enter your business information and follow the remaining prompts NOTE After setting up your new PayPal Business Account, you will need to verify specific personal information, such as your bank account details. Navigate to your profile in the PayPal console and follow the prompts to complete the verification process. If you are having trouble, contact PayPal support.

Enter your PayPal credentials in the Braintree Control Panel You must enter your PayPal Business Account credentials in the Braintree Control Panel to enable this payment method in production. You can only link one PayPal account to your Braintree gateway. To complete your PayPal setup:

Log into the Control Panel Click on the gear icon in the top right corner Click Processing from the drop-down menu Scroll to the Payment Methods section Next to PayPal, click the toggle to access the Accept PayPal options page Click the Log In with PayPal button Enter your PayPal login credentials and click Log In Enter the URLs to your website's Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions in the fields provided Click the Submit button NOTE If your Braintree account was recently approved, you may not see the option to enter PayPal login credentials in the Control Panel. It can take a few business days for your account to be fully set up and for this option to become available. Contact us for more information.

REST API app Once you have successfully linked your PayPal Business Account to your Braintree Control Panel, you may notice that a REST API app has been created in your PayPal Apps Control Panel. This app allows Braintree to interact with the PayPal API on your behalf; without it, you will be unable to process PayPal transactions through your Braintree account. We recommend that you do not delete the REST API app at any time.

Recommended setup options Managing disputes in the Braintree Control Panel To keep your transaction management in a centralized location, we recommend enabling PayPal disputes in your Braintree Control Panel. Learn more in our PayPal disputes support article.

Settlement Withdrawal To keep funding as simple as possible, we recommend that you enable Settlement Withdrawal on your account by contacting PayPal. Read more about Settlement Withdrawal, funding, and reconciliation.

eCheck payments An eCheck, or electronic check, is a payment sent directly from your customer's bank account. Braintree does not support these transactions at this time. If your PayPal Business Account allows for eCheck payment attempts, attempted eCheck authorizations may be successful, but the associated transactions will be automatically voided.

To provide a better experience for your customers, we recommend blocking eCheck payments before the authorization. You can do so by adjusting your payment receiving preferences within your PayPal account settings.

Foreign currencies To accept PayPal payments in multiple currencies, you must first complete the following steps:

Confirm that you have a Braintree merchant account for each currency you'd like to accept – contact us if you need assistance Set up your PayPal account to allow payments in foreign currencies – learn more in PayPal's developer docs Once you're set up, you will specify a Braintree merchant account when processing PayPal transactions in order to present different currencies to your customers.

IMPORTANT Depending on your account setup, PayPal may assess conversion and cross border fees when processing transaction in foreign currencies.

Avoiding conversion and cross border fees You can adjust your payment receiving preferences to block all payments in foreign currencies. While doing so will allow you to avoid additional fees, it will also prevent you from selling to customers who don't use your account currency.

Contacting PayPal support Many account changes can be made directly in your PayPal console (e.g. your funding bank account), but you may need to call to request certain setup options (e.g. Settlement Withdrawal). For the fastest service via phone, it’s best to log into your PayPal account, click Contact Us, and then click Call us. This will give you a passcode, which you can provide to PayPal to immediately verify your identity when you call. Passcodes expire in 60 minutes.ClickBank on https://platform.streamlabs.com/app-store | Stream labs Business wire To send an email instead, log into your PayPal account, click Contact Us, and then click Email us. https://wlo.link/go-pro Next Page: Processing →

Problem No. 100

Problem Title -> Bird Purchasing 

Statement: A special breed of birds is called as love birds and the specialty of this breed is that, mostly they live in pair with their partner otherwise they will not live happy and some of them will die soon.
A person purchased n pairs of love birds for his garden but seller made a mistake that he gave some birds with different partners. So the person un-cage all the birds and they all sits in a row on a branch of a tree in garden in random order. If they are sitting with their partner, they left the row, fly away and reside happily with their partner in garden.
So all the birds who made the valid pair fly away in first time. Once all valid pair of bird fly away there is a gap in row so all right sided birds of that gap shifted left to fill that gap, using this approach, they filled all the gaps. After filling the gap, they are again searching for valid partner next to them if they found they do the same activity as mentioned above. After n times performing the activity whatever birds remain treat them as a single bird and person should buy that many more birds. Finally print the number of birds that the person has to buy. To implement this we are providing you an array of characters named as birds denoting birds sequence on branch of tree (row).

For example birds=abbccabddc after first cycle array will reduce and look like birds=aabc after second cyclearray will reduce and look like birds=bc now no matching pair is their so person has to buy 2 love birds to make a valid pair.

Input:contains n characters denoting birds sitting in the row.

Output: contains an integer m denoting that many more birds person has to buy.

Constraint: 2=<n<=30

n value always should even.

Example:

abbccabddc

2
