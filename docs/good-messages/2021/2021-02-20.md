Week 4   Choose my own DH Museum Adventure

Choose your own DH Museum Adventure
Miria Munoz

I remember when I was 7 years old, my mother took my brother and I to see ‘The National Museum of Rio de Janeiro’ (Brazil). I remember coming home and being unable to fall asleep at night with all that overload of information in my head. I also remember feeling sorry we went there for just one day! It was simply not enough. I wanted more time to see the objects from close and observe each detail. After that day, every time we would visit my grand-parents in Rio de Janeiro, we would drive my mother nuts, trying to convince her to take us to the museum again. 
Fast forwarding 30 years, one day I started to get a bunch of ‘Whatsapp’ messages from my relatives in Brazil, containing videos of a horrible fire… and the fire… was at my favourite museum ever. I felt a mixture of feelings, from sadness to anger as I just could not accept that we had lost an entire museum due to administrative negligence. Apparently, the fire safety certificate was expired since 2014.
Thus, when I started to ponder upon the possibility of digitalizing museum collections, the first thought that came to my mind was: my favourite museum could have been saved at least from a ‘digital’ perspective. It had a collection of almost 20 million artifacts that had been collected in a period of 200 years. 
Information technology comes as a tool to preserve, at least digitally, so many precious confections from the past. It also facilitates the collection, analysis and visualization of artifacts; and helps in terms of public participation and even training methods.
Moreover, it is valid to remember how technology facilitates the democratization of archaeology as a discipline among communities, where people who would never have had a chance to be exposed to such field, end up being able to do so. Furthermore, digital collections can be an excellent tool for educators, specially now under this post-Covid era where ‘in person field trips’ are becoming extremely challenging to be arranged. 
Therefore, I would like to explore the 3 following readings:

Trofanko, Brenda. 2014.“Reconsidering the Educational Promise of Public History Exhibits” in K. Kee, ed. Pastplay. https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv65swr0.16

The first reading will be addressing how we store collections. The second reading will be dealing with challenges we face when it comes to digitalizing collections. And the third one will be covering the benefits of museum digitalization for the educational arena. Please note, I am opened to suggestions!

Move all editor loop functions to separate file

This moves editorrenderfixed(), editorrender(), editorinput(),
editorlogic(), and their associated functions to a new file named
editorloop.cpp - which is exactly what it says on the tin; it stores all
the functions related to the actual in-game editor loop.

editor.cpp now just contains custom level support, rather than the
actual editor logic. Yeah, it's kind of stupid, the game put both custom
level functions and the in-game editor into one file named editor.cpp -
but, now they're two files, and one is clearly the editor and the other
is clearly just custom level support.

editor.cpp is now no longer massive - it's been reduced from 5000 lines
to 2000 lines, with the 3000 lines going to editorloop.cpp.

By the way, I also pulled some Git magic off to preserve Git-blame
history when moving all the functions to the new file. I created two
different branches - one where I renamed editor.cpp to editortemp.cpp;
one where I deleted editor.cpp and added editorloop.cpp - then created a
third branch and octopus-merged them together (that's when you merge
with more than two branches at once; three branches in this case); then
I renamed editortemp.cpp back to editor.cpp, and removed the editor loop
functions from editor.cpp (which is this commit).

Unfortunately, if you squash everything together, then the magic gets
lost and Git will blame me for the entirety of editorloop.cpp (which is
not what I want).

[script] [attunement] Add "health" option to train empathy

### Background
* Deneri in the empaths lich channel [asked](https://discord.com/channels/745675889622384681/745678251250417674/794988805525471252) if there was a script to do a "health walk" with T2.
* Kiriawen [answered](https://discord.com/channels/745675889622384681/745678251250417674/795021486854242315) that there wasn't, that `crossing-training` script trains empathy via its own code.
* Further discussion insued about tweaking this script to support "health walks" in addition to "power walks".

### Changes
* Add optional `health` argument that will do a "health walk" for Empaths
* Add new setting `perceive_health_rooms` to override the base-towns.yaml rooms for a "health walk" (analogous to existing `attunement_rooms` setting)

### Sample Config
```yaml
# Used by 'attunement' script.
# These override the default rooms where magic users will visit to
# train attunement via 'perceive' command.
# If not defined then the rooms are taken from base-towns.yaml.
# This is ignored for lunar mages and instead they train in their current room.
attunement_rooms:

# Used by 'attunement' script when called with the 'health' option.
# These override the default rooms where Empaths will visit to
# train empathy via 'perceive health' command.
# If not defined then the rooms are taken from base-towns.yaml.
perceive_health_rooms:
- 100
- 200
- 300
```

### Credits
Kiriawen was very helpful in outlining how to add "health walk" to the attunement script and nuances around how to train empathy in this manner.

## Tests

### Health Walk (new feature)
```
> ,attunement health

--- Lich: attunement active.

--- Lich: go2 active.

You're not ready to do that again, yet.
> 
[attunement]>perceive health

You close your eyes, drawing all your thoughts inward, and then slowly reach out to sense the life essences of those around you...

You fail to sense anything, however.
Roundtime: 11 seconds

```

### Power Walk (regression test)
```
> ,attunement

--- Lich: attunement active.

--- Lich: go2 active.

[go2: ETA: 0:00:00 (1 rooms to move through)]

[go2]>s

You limp south.

[go2: travel time: 0:00:03]

--- Lich: go2 has exited.

[attunement]>perceive

You reach out with your senses and see shimmering (9/21) streams of vibrant blue and white Life mana flowing through the area.
You sense the Gift of Life spell upon you, which will last for about thirteen roisaen.
You sense the Manifest Force spell surrounding you, which will last for sixteen roisaen or until it has endured six more blows.
You sense the Refresh spell upon you, which will last for about seventeen roisaen.
Roundtime: 7 sec.

...

--- Lich: attunement has exited.

stats: some more performance graphs

Add an infrastructure for collecting performance-related data, use it in
some places. Add rendering of them to stats.lua.

There were two main goals: minimal impact on the normal code and normal
playback. So all these stats_* function calls either happen only during
initialization, or return immediately if no stats collection is going
on. That's why it does this lazily adding of stats entries etc. (a first
iteration made each stats entry an API thing, instead of just a single
stats_ctx, but I thought that was getting too intrusive in the "normal"
code, even if everything gets worse inside of stats.c).

You could get most of this information from various profilers (including
the extremely primitive --dump-stats thing in mpv), but this makes it
easier to see the most important information at once (at least in
theory), partially because we know best about the context of various
things.

Not very happy with this. It's all pretty primitive and dumb. At this
point I just wanted to get over with it, without necessarily having to
revisit it later, but with having my stupid statistics.

Somehow the code feels terrible. There are a lot of meh decisions in
there that could be better or worse (but mostly could be better), and it
just sucks but it's also trivial and uninteresting and does the job. I
guess I hate programming. It's so tedious and the result is always shit.
Anyway, enjoy.

Week 6 Hist 4916  My reflections

My reflections

It is interesting to see how technology is transforming communication patterns among museums and their visitors; the communication road is no longer one way only.
Anyone can disseminate information over the internet about a museum or a collection. 
Visitors can also talk about their personal experiences when visiting museums. 
We have seen how such institutions exercise their presence over the web and also over social media. The internet allows museums to interact with their audiences in a very dynamic manner.  
So many museums have joined Facebook and have ‘conquered’ millions of ‘friends’ who follow them and leave comments.  
This communication reciprocity allows visitors to affect the way museums address their audiences. 
Now…
How can museums control public comments?
How can they keep their online reputation?
How can they manage negative comments?

Some comments can be really hard to orchestrate.
For instance, if you go to the ‘trip advisor website’, you can find really negative comments/reviews about the Museum of Nature here in Ottawa.
Please see below a complaint from a visitor and the museum’s response.

“Worst experience!
So I brought my 2 adult daughters to see the reptile exhibit (my older one loves reptiles and has one herself) Biggest disappointment. Hardly any reptiles, no one giving information about them, and if you are going to advertise about reptiles, you should have something very unique (most were just snakes) You are better off going to Little Ray's, and I am being honest.

Secondly the volunteer's are VERY rude. My Daughter's sat down to look at the leaf table (no one was there) they were genuinely interested and started to design some leaves on the paper provided. A volunteer named "Christianne" came over and said "this is for children" and gave them the dirtiest look and kept hovering over them rudely. My older Daughter stood up, she grabbed her paper with leaves on it, and crumpled it up in front of her. Some children came to the table finally, they wanted to colour, but she grabbed the leaves from my younger Daughter and told them they were to play with the leaves.

We paid over $65 for admission for 3 people, (plus 12 for parking!) and after that promptly left. Was not worth even close to that.

you would think a Museum would want people to learn and explore, this is not the case here. the volunteer's/staff were neither helpful or polite.

I really hope they read this and take action. your volunteer made my Daughter's feel awful and in turn I felt horrible for even bringing them as no one deserves to be treated like that. We will not be returning and take our complaint higher. If you do not want young adults to learn or participate you should make that clear before you charge us for admission!”

“Thank you for your comments. As a national museum and major attraction in the National Capital Region, we want to ensure the best possible experience for our visitors. Feedback such as yours is very, very important.    We’re sorry that you were disappointed with our current Reptiles exhibition. It is a travelling, educational exhibition from an accredited zoo in the United States and has been received quite well by our visitors. It’s unfortunate that it didn’t meet your expectations.   We deeply apologize for the experience you had at the hands-on botany station. The intention there is to have the plant-mounting activity for adults and a paper leaf craft for children. We’re very sorry that your daughters had a negative experience with a volunteer at that station. We are looking into the situation and will re-examine our current volunteer training. A positive museum experience for visitors of all ages is our utmost priority. Thank you so much for drawing this to our attention.    We hope you will visit us again. On June 21, we are opening our new Arctic Gallery (included in museum admission) which will offer genuine specimens, artifacts, multimedia and unique perspectives on this vast, mysterious and little-understood region.   Again, thank you, and please accept our apologies.”

    <title>Story Time</title>
    <body>
        <h1>True Conservation</h1>
      
<p>To want to be part of something more than ourselves is always on our mind as we walk through our 
day-to-day lives.  We join teams because we want to live for our brothers and sisters beside us. Some 
of us think we can enhance and elevate what we are working for as the collective. Others want to live 
for another.  There are countless examples of brave men and women that have done, and will continue to 
do, acts to protect others. Some they have met and are very fond of, others they may never know and 
will never have the chance of knowing.But, they know one thing for certain the collective is stronger, 
better, and more appealing than what we can ever have ourselveson a singular level.  </p>

<p>It is this natural born sense of wanting to be part of something better, and create something better, 
that makes me want to be a hunter.  The hunter has lived through the ages as the hero. Hunting parties 
would come home and the villages would gather around to greet them, thankful for their bountiful harvests. 
When I think about the hunter, I think of an ancient or even prehistoric being that provided. They saw 
past their current position at the time.  They could never have envisioned they would be the people that 
would set me on the trail towards conservation of sustainable resources.  All they were doing was trying 
to survive.  Did they know that if they over-harvested, or over-utilized a resource that they would not 
have it anymore for future generations? Did the thought even cross their mind? Or were they living in 
the moment? I believe that they learnedthrough trial and error that if they over-utilized a species of 
animal, or over-harvested a type of plant, that they would no longer have it. </p>

<p>There is the school of thought that ancient humans would have never thought about conservation.  If you 
look at the historical evidence, it is plausible that there was no thought about conservation of utilizable 
resources.  Native Americans ran large amounts of buffalo off of cliffs and hundreds would die at a time.  
There are historical accounts of colonial explorers crossing the lands encountering the wretched stench 
of stained air for miles from the carcasses of unused buffalo meat.  We have this iconic idea that everything 
was utilized, unfortunately, this iconic idea doesn’t make any logical sense.  They did what they had to 
do to survive.  They did what they could to cultivate and harvest the most calorie-efficient diet.  Is it 
their fault? How could they possibly have known that they would have driven one of their main resources, 
the buffalo, to a point that they were on a slide to what would eventually be near extinction? Of course, 
they were not the only cause for the drive of the buffalo to their near extinction.  The market hunters 
had no regard or thought that they would not rebound and have a devastating part in the buffalo’s near extinction. 
​We as a people have learned since that time.  We still have a lot to learn, but we as hunters are on the 
right path towards conserving our natural resources. </p>  

<p> Conservationists are not just the ones that sustainably harvest.  Conservationists are all of us in the 
collective that believe that we need our animal, plant, and other national resources.  You do not have to be a 
hunter to want to conserve the beautiful things that this world has to offer, but you do have to be willing to 
acknowledge that we are the only thing that can wreck wildlife’s existence if we do not do something. We need to 
stop arguing over whether the sustainable harvest of a wild animal based on biological and empirical evidence is 
going to send us crashing into a life of suffering with nothing on our planet.  The true conservation that we need 
to take heed to is the conservation of our lands, waterways, and atmosphere. </p>

<p> On an equal but separate note, there is a lot to be said about the clean air and water that we utilize.  When our 
oceans are filled with garbage, our lands are covered in asphalt, and our air is filled with smoke to the extent 
that cancer spreads to a point of seemingly no return, then it is time that we rethink how we are living our lives.  
We as a collective live no better than those Native Americans or market hunters that decimated the buffalo.  In fact, 
it could be said that we are actually worse because of our separated ideals we believe simply because of an idiotic 
longing to be right.  True conservation concentrates on what we are doing to poison the habitat of the animals we 
love and not to mention ourselves.  </p>

<p> As a hunter, I have learned this.  I have learned thatconservation is not as simple as just sustainable utilization 
of an animal.  It is sustainable utilization of all of our resources that we as a collective take in part.  We must 
stop with the dividing lines.  If we are to continue life for future generations then, we,the non-hunters and hunters, 
have to come together in this true metric that is undoubtedly the true meaning of conservation.</p>
