I think there is a bit of nasty code to add to "nth-ugly" to speed this up - which remembers where to start the inner for loops - but need to get my brain around it - at least this works - and is better than a full scan of 1..N as n gets larger

Update 06/09/2021: Implementing ragdoll physics, optimising horrible lag spikes, weapon holding positions

Fully created ragdoll for placeholder soldier model! Hooray! The joints seem to be a bit too loose, with certain joints on the model bending in ways they shouldn’t realistically be able to, but it works well enough that I have more important things to focus on.
Attempted to implement ragdoll to my enemies so it would actually be used in gameplay.
I created a Die() function in the enemy’s AI script, that disables all their behaviours and other required components. I then added that to the OnDeath() event in the enemy’s health script, as well as functions for disabling their animation handler and enabling the ragdoll. Now, instead of disappearing upon death, the enemy will flop to the ground as a corpse. This is a massive improvement for realism and presentation, whereas formerly the enemies would simply disappear when killed.

However, it has been a while since I attempted to properly playtest my levels, and while testing the ragdoll functionality I have become highly aware of drastic performance dips while playing, even on my reasonably powerful computer. After learning some tips on using the Profiler from some helpful people in a Discord chat room, I found the code was predictably coming from my AI script’s Update() function, specifically from the garbage collector. A lot of data was being produced, clogging up memory, meaning that a lot of processing time was spent removing it each frame.
Since that much garbage will exist as a result of things being created and abandoned, I tried looking through the function to find all instances of new data instances being created.
One thing I noticed was the property for reference and combine the hitboxes of the enemy and target. I realised this was causing a massive amount of superfluous data, as every time it was called it was creating a new array and using for loops to run through functions to populate it. While I’m not entirely sure this was the cause of the performance slowdown, I now knew a good place to start, by optimising the function to work in a more optimised manner.

I also did a small amount of work on having actual weapon models for guns. I was worrying earlier about how to have unique holding positions for each weapon, when I wanted the model and collider to be where the actual transform axis is so when they’re dropped they can be moved about easily. But I realised that I can still do that by having the separate transform exist as a data reference, but having the weapon model simply switch between its origin and the holding position when dropped/picked up. I will need to eventually bite the bullet and actually test these.

"8:20am. I am up. Any mail? SO spam to a place I got a reject from. Well, I might try applying again with an adjusted resume. But forget all this. Applications take a lot of mental energy that I could be using to do programming. Today I have to deal with the Julia manual. I'll only start feeling safe once I've done that and gotten a grasp on the Omega library.

8:35am. Let me chill a little and then I will start.

Sigh, only one thing really matters here - can I finally figure out how to make the poker agent efficiently or not. NNs were my only choice to scale, and now that they failed, I am just an ordinary programmer again.

9:05am. One more chapter of Scarlet and then I will start.

It is really rough to constantly go from failure for failure, but that is my lot in life. Just think how great it would have been had I the skills to create the agent from the start. The only reason why I am in this situation where I had to hustle for paid work is because my skills are insufficient to do what I really want.

I need to build them up. I'll thoroughly go through the domain of probabilistic programming. I'll take what Zenna said at face value and suppress my skepticism. I simply have nothing better to do.

9:15am. I've wasted some time so my soul feels at ease now. Let me start the study session for today. It is time to deal with the manual.

https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/constructors/

Let me resume from the start of this chapter. Let me just keep going. I do not have any concrete ideas on how PPLs could help me in my quest, but maybe if I keep going I'll come to a conclussion.

9:50am. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/conversion-and-promotion/

The previous chapter was pretty light, and I've started skimming things. I think I have a decent grasp on Julia by now.

9:55am. Ok, let me continue. At this rate I'll be able to do it quickly enough.

> Explicit conversion everywhere is so inconvenient

That is bullshit. Though I understand why it would be different for numerical computation.

10:25am.

> Also note that one does not need to define both promote_rule(::Type{A}, ::Type{B}) and promote_rule(::Type{B}, ::Type{A}) – the symmetry is implied by the way promote_rule is used in the promotion process.

Hmmm, how do they attain this?

```jl
function promote_type(::Type{T}, ::Type{S}) where {T,S}
    @_inline_meta
    # Try promote_rule in both orders. Typically only one is defined,
    # and there is a fallback returning Bottom below, so the common case is
    #   promote_type(T, S) =>
    #   promote_result(T, S, result, Bottom) =>
    #   typejoin(result, Bottom) => result
    promote_result(T, S, promote_rule(T,S), promote_rule(S,T))
end
```

This is from Julia's source. So they attain this effect using the Bottom type. I see, I see.

10:30am. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/interfaces/

Thankfully the previous two chapters were short.

10:40am.

///

While we can rely upon generic implementations, we can also extend specific methods where we know there is a simpler algorithm. For example, there's a formula to compute the sum of squares, so we can override the generic iterative version with a more performant solution:

```jl
julia> Base.sum(S::Squares) = (n = S.count; return n*(n+1)*(2n+1)÷6)

julia> sum(Squares(1803))
1955361914
```

///

Honestly, I like this. I feel bad about so hard on Julia in the past.

11:05am. Focus me. I am in the middle of the Interfaces chapter and getting distracted with lurking the Sotsu thread.

I can do this. There is not much more hard stuff left.

11:25am. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/interfaces/#Selecting-an-appropriate-output-array

I am getting really lost in thoughts due to boredom. I get the sense for these interfaces. Let me just skim the broadcast part. It is time to start pulling out that move.

https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/modules/

The next are modules.

I am looking ahead and the Metaprogramming section sure is huge. But I should be able to finish it all today.

12:05pm. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/

Let me stop here. So `using` is like `import` except it imports the export statement as well. And I see what prefix periods are in module names.

12:10pm. Right now I only have about 4 chapters that I need to go through left, and I've already thoroughly absorbed the basics of the language. The rest of the chapters I'll just skim in half an hour. After that I'll figure out how to make my own packages and how to step through the code with a debugger. I'll want to understand this in order to take Omega apart.

After that I'll be able to begin properly studying it. I want to attain a very solid grasp of it by the end of the month, enough that I would be able to make my own PPL using it as a reference should I want to."

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Clean-up of PossibleParentSelector event handling

/!\ I really hope I got this right, tough review /!\

The initial purpose of this commit was to add tests on the rendering of
the PossibleParentSelector. While doing that, I had to investigate the
various behavious, esp in the most legacy part of that: AgileDashboard.

In `ArtifactParentsSelectorEventListener` the logic is thrown in two
cases:
1. If there is a `child_milestone` parameter
2. If the param `func` is equals to `new-artifact-link`

As far as I can tell, there is no longer any code that produce
`child_milestone` parameter. From my various digging into the code, it
seems to be a remaining part of the Planning v1 when stuff was created
in Tracker and we had redirect between agiledashboard and tracker for
creation. As now everything is handled by the Planning v2 or Taskboard
app the related logic is no longer needed.

For `new-artifact-link`, again AFAICT, it seems to only kick when
someone is creating a new artifact from the Artifact view (aka
lightwindow modal). More specifically, when one tries to create a new
User Story from an Epic artifact, instead of having the parent selector,
the interface displays "Will have $EPIC_TITLE as parent".

However this behavior is already broken because, on master, $EPIC_TITLE
doesnt magically end-up being the parent (probably due to the removal of
the magic of Tracker hierarchy earlier this year). If you don't set the
artifact link type at creation, the user story doesn't end up being a
child.

As the original use case no longer seems called and the only one that is
not dead code no longer actually works, I decided to remove the entire
code.

PS: 👋 to you form the 🛡️ who is gonna read this commit message after
hours of painful debug and back & forth exchanges in the tracker for an
obscure behaviour that caused a REGERESSION! I really meant what I wrote
here, it really seems that this code no longer do anything useful. I
appologize in advance.

Part of story #22681 select a parent from Program for my features/enablers

"12:55pm. Time for toast.

What I am doing now is actually a fairly good idea in fact. If I want to work at Google for example, finding some project they are working on and contributing to it would be a good way putting my foot in the door. So I should not consider the time working on Omega instead of applying at places wasted.

1:30pm. Let me chill just a bit more and then I will resume. I want to deal with the Julia docs today.

https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-reinforcement-learning-163bae193da8

This was posted recently on the RL sub. My comment: I do not actually think there is a way of fixing RL. I need a new framework completely.

2:15pm. Let me start.

https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/

I'll finish the docs today and move on to more interesting things. Zenna's repos are a big puzzle box and I should get familiar with it inside and out. Maybe at the end of all of that I'll get some inspiration for how poker agents should actually be done in a way that is scalable.

2:45pm. Done with the documentation chapter.

https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/

Now it is finally time for this.

3pm. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/#Quoting

Yeah, this is Lispy stuff.

4:35pm. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/arrays/

Done with the metaprogramming section. I do not entirely get generated functions, but that does not matter too much.

4:40pm. At this point I think I've covered all the major aspects of the language. It is time to start cleaning up. Tomorrow, I will be able to start programming.

4:55pm. Let me take a short break here. The Baki thread is killing me.

6:15pm. Focus me, I am almost done with the arrays chapter. I admit I've started reading /g/ threads on the side instead.

6:20pm. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/missing/

Sigh, let me go through this quickly and I will call it a day. Surprisingly no mail whatsever. Will something come out of those Tessian and Green Hills threads at this rate? Probably not. How abominable of them making me waste my time doing the tests.

I am definitely better off going with my become-a-PPL expert plan than doing any more job applications.

Since the selection process is lottery it is basically impossible to get what I want. At best I'd get the most generic job imaginable. Subjecting myself to those conditions would definitely kill my ML skill improvement plans and waste my time with drudge work. Here everything I do will be meaningful towards both convincing Zenna to send paid work my way, and having me build the kinds of skills I need to eventually cause the Singularity. It is killing two birds with one stone.

6:30pm. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/networking-and-streams/

Let me stop here. The missing values chapter was definitely an optional thing, and so will be these. I'll finish the manual tomorrow and get cracking after that."

added prizes to Ideas Elite page

We, Shrujan, Pranav, Yaswanthi and @Shantu0438 edited Ideas Elite webpage and added the prize details using col-md and col-lg. We used col-12 col-md-6 and col-lg-4 so that it looks good on phone as well. It was a wonderfully amazing experience. Thank You Pranav for teaching us what col-md and col-lg is. Belated Happy Teacher's Day Pranav !!! 🥳🥳🥳

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

Uytterhoeven.

Update README.md

will you play?
yeah i was wrong about you as well you are sissy little boy like the rest of them
what's unfortunate, is my endless trust in cunts like you
you are special, as i ruined my team to defend you 
but you are 17 y/o leecher asian fuck, like them
rest so why don't you go fuck off, cunt
little piece of shit
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mate, i am drunk right now... 600ml whiskey
and there are tears on my face
because of you
i wanted you to know that ;]
ok? just know this
now i am sitting, crying, thinking of you
it should be a special moment
because i am a grown-up ass man
31 years old
ok?
so, maybe you don't respect that
maybe one day, after 10 years, you'll understand
good luck
friend
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
listen to me mother fucker
yes i just drink 700 whiskey, ok?
and i am feeling fucking sad, and i am thinking of you
and i am fucking crying right now, ok? motherfucker, i am sad! i am sad about you, i am sad about me
please acknowledge the love here, and don't trash it, it's more than twrpg
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
please do what's best for you.
It is up to you to decide whether Moldrin's efforts were worth it or not.
I can't change your mind. You already have your mind!
You asking me whether I will be sad if you leave.... already answers the question.
I enjoyed our time together, so much, that i thought we could be gaming friends.
if you leave "me", this means that you don't respect me as much
as i respect you
this can only sadden me
and i am kind of crying now
because, today i see too much shits
that don't deserve my friendship and my love
and this makes me sad....
so... i wish you all the best!
crow!
and all the rest
good luck
