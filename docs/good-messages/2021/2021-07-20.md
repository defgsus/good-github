Some things broke but now fixed and we have decals that work very well.

I do love some decals, paint the map white am i right.

mm: introduce transcendent file cache

Transcendent file cache (tcache) is a simple driver for cleancache,
which stores reclaimed pages in memory unmodified. Its purpose it to
adopt pages evicted from a memory cgroup on local pressure, so that they
can be fetched back later without costly disk accesses. It works
similarly to shadow gangs from PCS6 except pages has to be copied on
eviction.

https://jira.sw.ru/browse/PSBM-31757

* Usage

 - Enable:
   # modprobe tcache # only if compiled as a module
   # echo Y > /sys/module/tcache/parameters/enabled

 - Disable:
   # echo N > /sys/module/tcache/parameters/enabled

 - Get number of pages cached:
   # cat /sys/module/tcache/parameters/nr_pages

* Implementation notes

 - Fetching/adding a page to tcache implies looking up a tcache pool
   (corresponds to a super block), tcache node in the pool (corresponds
   to an inode), and a page in the node. Pages of the same node are
   organized into a radix tree protected by a single spin lock,
   similarly to pages in an address_space. Nodes of the same pool are
   kept in several RB trees, each of which protected by its own spin
   lock. The number of RB trees is proportional to the number of CPUs,
   and nodes are distributed among the trees using a hash function. This
   is to minimize contention on the locks protecting the trees. Pools
   are kept in an IDR and looked up locklessly.

 - All tcache pages are linked in per NUMA node LRU lists and reclaimed
   on global pressure by a slab shrinker. Also, if we fail to allocate a
   new page for tcache, we will attempt to reclaim the oldest one
   immediately.

 - Once the tcache module is loaded, it is impossible to disable tcache
   completely due to cleancache limitations. "Disabling" it via the
   corresponding module parameter only forbids populating the cache with
   new pages. Lookups will proceed to tcache anyway.

 - Tcache pages are accounted as file pages.

* F.A.Q.

 - Does copying pages to and from tcache affect performance?

   Yes, it does. Fetching data from tcache advances roughly two times
   slower than from the page cache, because one has to copy data twice.
   Below are times of reading a 512M file from a memory cgroup:

   a) without limits:
      536870912 bytes (537 MB) copied, 0.481623 s, 1.1 GB/s
   b) with 100M limit and tcache enabled:
      536870912 bytes (537 MB) copied, 0.974815 s, 551 MB/s

   However, tcache exists not to allow containers whose working set does
   not fit in their RAM operate as fast as they would if there were no
   memory limits at all. Tcache exists to avoid costly disk operations
   whenever possible. For example, if there is a container which would
   normally thrash due to the memory limit and there is some unused
   memory on the host, it is better to allow the container to use the
   free memory to avoid thrashing, because otherwise it will generate
   disk pressure sensible by other containers.

 - Is there any memory overhead excluding the space used for storing
   data pages?

   Practically, no. All the information about pages is stored directly
   in struct page, and no additional handles are allocated per page.
   Per inode radix trees do consume some additional kernel memory per
   page, but its amount is negligible.

 - Does tcache generate memory pressure at the global level? If yes,
   does it affect containers?

   Yes, it generates global pressure and currently it does affect
   containers. This is similar to the issue we had had in PCS6 before
   shadow gangs and vmscan scheduling hacks were introduced, when there
   was the only LRU list for evicted pages (init_gang). We are planning
   to fix it by backporting low limits for memory cgroups. If a
   container is below its low limit, its memory will not be scanned on
   global pressure unless all containers are below their low limits
   (this is a kind of memory guarantee). We will set low limits for a
   container to be equal to an estimate of its working set size (this
   will be done by a user space daemon). Since tcache resides in the
   root memory cgroup, which does not have any memory guarantees (low
   limit equals 0), it will not press upon containers provided the
   system is properly configured.

 - Why cannot we use low limits instead of hard limits then?

   Low limits are unsafe by design. There is no guarantee that we will
   always be able to reclaim a cgroup back to its low limit. There are
   anonymous and kernel memory, which are sometimes really hard to
   reclaim. We could introduce a separate limit for them (anon+swap),
   but it will never get upstream (we tried).

 - Why is it better than what we have in PCS6?

   Primarily, because the idea of wiring sophisticated vmscan rules into
   the kernel, as we have done in PCS6 (vmscan scheduler) is dubious
   since it makes changing its behavior really painful. There are other
   points too:

   + The PCS6 memory management patch is really intrusive: it has
     sprouted its slimy tentacles all around the mm subsystem (rmap.c,
     memory.c, mlock.c, vmscan.c). We will hardly ever manage to push it
     upstream, so we will most likely have to carry it for good. This
     means each major rebase will turn into a torment. OTOH tcache code
     is isolated in a module and therefore can be easily ported back and
     forth.

   + Thanks to data copying, we can do funny things with the
     transcendent page cache in future, such as compression and
     deduplication. There were plans to implement compressed file cache
     upstream (zcache), but unfortunately it is still not there, and
     nobody seems to care about it. Nevertheless, sooner or later it
     will be introduced (may be, I'll facilitate this process), and we
     will be able to seamlessly switch to it from tcache. Tcache will be
     still useful for testing though.

 - In PCS6 there are per container shadow lists, while you have only the
   global LRU for all tcache pages. Is there any plans to introduce per
   super block or per memory cgroup LRUs?

   I am still unconvinced that we really need it, because it is not
   clear to me what policy we should apply per container on reclaim. It
   smells like one more heuristic, which I am desperately trying to
   avoid. Current design looks simple and sane: there are guarantees for
   containers provided by their limits, and they are competing fairly
   for the rest of the memory used for caches.

 - What about swap cache?

   There are plans to implement a similar driver for frontswap (tswap)
   or backport and use existing zswap. There may be problems with the
   latter though, because it currently does not support reclaim, and it
   will be tricky from the technical point of view to introduce it.

 - Any plans to push tcache upstream?

   No, because its use case looks too narrow to me to be included into
   the vanilla kernel. I am planning to concentrate on zcache instead.

  Based on: #21462

  Keeping the README in one file so that it's easy to search through. Will add more jumping links later so navigation is easier.

  Current TODOs:
  - [x] Shell installer option: prompt user to re-login for `/etc/profile.d` entry to be picked up
  - [x] Binary tarball option: prompt user to create `/etc/profile.d` entry and re-login
  - [x] Fanquake docker option: complete section
  - [x] Arch Linux AUR option: prompt to start `guix-daemon-latest` unit after finishing "optional setup" section
  - [x] Building from source option: Insert dependency tree diagram that I made
  - [x] Building from source option: redo sectioning, kind of a mess right now
  - [x] Optional setup: make clear which parts are only needed if building from source
  - [x] Workaround 1 for GnuTLS: perhaps mention how to remove Guix build farm's key
  - [x] Overall (after everything): Make the links work.

  Note to self: wherever possible, tell user how to check that something is true rather than branching by installation option.

    ACK fac4814106c796b8786dd90053513cc35142dfe5 - going to go ahead and merge this now. It's a lot of documentation, and could probably be nit-picked / improved further, however, that can continue over the next few weeks. I'm sure more (backportable) improvements / clarifications will be made while we progress through RCs towards a new release.

* Toned down how much side effect buildup Magic Sign: Healing and Arcane Blessing: Wave of Destruction dole out, and made the effect duration scale down with spell level.
* Set terrain-bashing spell effects to scale as damage normally does.
* Reworked Sundering Quake into a damaging spell, with double its original spell rank.
* Was suggested that I give Free Action some timestop effect, did so but also halved its spell rank to give less free moves.
* Rebalanced Surging Force to give out a more interesting effect, and increased its spell rank.

I am at a stage where I feel happy but I understand I have alot more to do. I am really enjoying this projectgit add .  Its great fun to put into practice everything we have learnt and it's a good way to start remembering all the methods etc. I have come to realise that it is very easy to break your code. When I am trying to fix things I seem to break other sections, for example this morning I have been fixing my moving blocks so that they sit on top of everything on the board, but I have managed to add a bug into my eating and removing paint blobs code- as this now no longer works. It's really interesting as I can't see why it is effected but it's good to break it all down and figure it out. I spent a couple of hours yesterday breaking down my paint splash divs into different sections - without a background with the hope that they would overlay nicely but after adding a couple of splashes to the page, eating an ew paint blob - thus adding a paint splash rewrites over the old paint splash background image. Whereas I want them to both stay and overlap. The goals for today is to get this fixed, make a collision from the paintbrush to the artist (I have got it to work the other way round but I need to figure out how to get it to work with the moving blocks as I don't have a set position for these) and the make my blocks bounce off the walls rather than loop back to the beginning. Left to do after that: change my moving blocks to paintbrushes, edit the alert buttons and the css! I feel like I have a fair bit to do but I feel like I am on top of this (if today goes well).

Create Ishaan Loves Chocolates 

As we know, Ishaan has a love for chocolates. He has bought a huge chocolate bar that contains N chocolate squares. Each of the squares has a tastiness level which is denoted by an array A[].
Ishaan can eat the first or the last square of the chocolate at once. Ishaan has a sister who loves chocolates too and she demands the last chocolate square. Now, Ishaan being greedy eats the more tasty square first. 
Determine the tastiness level of the square which his sister gets.

Example 1:

â€‹Input : arr[ ] = {5, 3, 1, 6, 9}
Output : 1
Explanation:
Initially: 5 3 1 6 9
In first step: 5 3 1 6
In Second step: 5 3 1
In Third step: 3 1
â€‹In Fourth step: 1
â€‹â€‹Return 1


â€‹Example 2:

Input : arr[ ] = {5, 9, 2, 6} 
Output :  2

Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function chocolates() that takes an array (arr), sizeOfArray (n) and return the tastiness level of the square which his sister gets. The driver code takes care of the printing.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

 

Constraints : 
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 109

Finally got the shit to work propperly!

Had tons of issues with this project! The program wouldn't go into my for loops, cin and getline was fucking with my, where I needed to use cin.ignore(), to clear the \n input generated from cin before using getline again.

I struggled with the iteration variable as well, where it was'nt clear to me, if i really could use Movie as a data type. Good practice with references and consts! Next I'm being challenged to change the solution to pointers... That'll be a bitch... all though... probably a good idea to try it out...

merge-ort: restart merge with cached renames to reduce process entry cost

The merge algorithm mostly consists of the following three functions:
   collect_merge_info()
   detect_and_process_renames()
   process_entries()
Prior to the trivial directory resolution optimization of the last half
dozen commits, process_entries() was consistently the slowest, followed
by collect_merge_info(), then detect_and_process_renames().  When the
trivial directory resolution applies, it often dramatically decreases
the amount of time spent in the two slower functions.

Looking at the performance results in the previous commit, the trivial
directory resolution optimization helps amazingly well when there are no
relevant renames.  It also helps really well when reapplying a long
series of linear commits (such as in a rebase or cherry-pick), since the
relevant renames may well be cached from the first reapplied commit.
But when there are any relevant renames that are not cached (represented
by the just-one-mega testcase), then the optimization does not help at
all.

Often, I noticed that when the optimization does not apply, it is
because there are a handful of relevant sources -- maybe even only one.
It felt frustrating to need to recurse into potentially hundreds or even
thousands of directories just for a single rename, but it was needed for
correctness.

However, staring at this list of functions and noticing that
process_entries() is the most expensive and knowing I could avoid it if
I had cached renames suggested a simple idea: change
   collect_merge_info()
   detect_and_process_renames()
   process_entries()
into
   collect_merge_info()
   detect_and_process_renames()
   <cache all the renames, and restart>
   collect_merge_info()
   detect_and_process_renames()
   process_entries()

This may seem odd and look like more work.  However, note that although
we run collect_merge_info() twice, the second time we get to employ
trivial directory resolves, which makes it much faster, so the increased
time in collect_merge_info() is small.  While we run
detect_and_process_renames() again, all renames are cached so it's
nearly a no-op (we don't call into diffcore_rename_extended() but we do
have a little bit of data structure checking and fixing up).  And the
big payoff comes from the fact that process_entries(), will be much
faster due to having far fewer entries to process.

This restarting only makes sense if we can save recursing into enough
directories to make it worth our while.  Introduce a simple heuristic to
guide this.  Note that this heuristic uses a "wanted_factor" that I have
virtually no actual real world data for, just some back-of-the-envelope
quasi-scientific calculations that I included in some comments and then
plucked a simple round number out of thin air.  It could be that
tweaking this number to make it either higher or lower improves the
optimization.  (There's slightly more here; when I first introduced this
optimization, I used a factor of 10, because I was completely confident
it was big enough to not cause slowdowns in special cases.  I was
certain it was higher than needed.  Several months later, I added the
rough calculations which make me think the optimal number is close to 2;
but instead of pushing to the limit, I just bumped it to 3 to reduce the
risk that there are special cases where this optimization can result in
slowing down the code a little.  If the ratio of path counts is below 3,
we probably will only see minor performance improvements at best
anyway.)

Also, note that while the diffstat looks kind of long (nearly 100
lines), more than half of it is in two comments explaining how things
work.

For the testcases mentioned in commit 557ac0350d ("merge-ort: begin
performance work; instrument with trace2_region_* calls", 2020-10-28),
this change improves the performance as follows:

                            Before                  After
    no-renames:      205.1  ms ±  3.8  ms   204.2  ms ±  3.0  ms
    mega-renames:      1.564 s ±  0.010 s     1.076 s ±  0.015 s
    just-one-mega:   479.5  ms ±  3.9  ms   364.1  ms ±  7.0  ms

Don't get notified of your own changes, when you're a "notify-ee" (#58)

## Summary:
We already filtered out authors as reviewers (people won't get added as reviewers to their own PRs), but we weren't doing this for notify-ees. That is, if you add yourself as someone to get notified on certain changes, you would get notified if you were the author, and this was very annoying.

See [this PR](https://github.com/Khan/our-lovely-cli/pull/251) where I'm getting notified of my own changes. See [this PR](https://github.com/Khan/our-lovely-cli/pull/253) where I'm not.

(OMG @ the irony that this PR just notified me, but that's because this repo is pointing to the `main` branch of itself.)

Issue: FEI-3717

## Test plan:
Make a PR/push in a repo where you're set up to receive notifications, see that you don't any longer. See that you do for other people's changes.

mplabx is 100% unusable:

10 restarts today trying to get debugging no luck, snap keeps timing out
and dirt napping in general. something has got even WORSE lately and its
not my physical setup, I think it's latest mplab and tool packs. tons of
annoying warnings in console they introduced doesnt introduce confidence
but at any rate nevermind and FUCK using microchip parts because this
ide is unusable shit made by idiots.
