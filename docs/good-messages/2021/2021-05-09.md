happy with all the functionality and the speed

* Several different ways to view all the git commits and of course
  fugitive to run all git commands in the browser
* a nice selection of themes, and they're that I can cycle through when
  I get bored of the same old (but where to keep the fonts???
* my first vim scripts, and the lightswitch for daytime to nighttime
  coding is quite useful for me.  (I love that I don't get blasted by a
  white LCD in the middle of the night by opening a terminal
* I'm onto my second round of plugin selections for tag analysis, and I think
  Vista.vim will be fun to use because it supplements the tags with
  function listings from the langage servers. So that will make learning
  about tags a little easier.
* LSP server and client, I was running CoC, but found my understanding
  of how to manage its keybindings, operations, and use to be a bit
  limited.  Now I've switched over to the internal neovim LS client, and
  I think I'm probably goig to enjoy working on complex configs in lua
  to vim script.  And, that the neovim LS client is a little behind in
  features will help me really learn what the language server is doing
  rather than what the ui is doing
* syntax highlighting for days, and most of it's turned off.  Polyglot
  has handled everything I've thrown at it (and I'm not fery far out
  there... so of course it would.  I'll turn on more stuff when I need
  it.
* another first for me is undo tree.  It looks like it's gonna save my
  ass a few times.  And I like how detailed teh configuration is, I need
  to read through how those feature flags are managed
* a whole lot of text editing tools, spelling, style linting, quick
  persistent scratchpad.....  And I feel way more organized and in
  control of what my text editor is doing thatn I have in a long time.

There are a few things I haven't tested yet ;{

* vim-thematic - I think it will come in handy as my theme collediton
  grows and I become more picky
* Ctags - I think I have a faint understanding of what they are and
  how they are useful.  But I didn't know nearly enough to properly
  operate the code scanners, and, I unininstalled that stuff.

##### 2021-05-09 15:03:03 by John H√∂gberg

re: Document [:ascii:] character class deficiency

The regex library we use can work either in locale-specific mode,
or unicode mode. The locale-specific mode uses a pregenerated
table to tell which characters are printable, numeric, and so on.

For historical reasons, OTP has always used Latin-1 for this table,
so characters like `√∂` are considered to be letters. This is fine,
but the library has two quirks that don't play well with each
other:

* The locale-specific table is always consulted for code points
  below 256 regardless of whether we're in unicode mode or not,
  and the `ucp` option only affects code points that aren't
  defined in this table (zeroed).
* The character class `[:ascii:]` matches characters that are
  defined in the above table.

This is fine when the regex library is built with its default ASCII
table: `[:ascii:]` only matches ASCII characters (by definition)
and the library documentation states that `ucp` is required to
match characters beyond that with `\w` and friends.

Unfortunately, we build the library with the Latin-1 table so
`[:ascii:]` matches Latin-1 characters instead, and we can't change
the table since we've documented that `\w` etc work fine with
Latin-1 characters, only requiring `ucp` for characters beyond
that.

At this point you might be thinking that this is a bug in how the
regex library handles `[:ascii:]`. Well, yes, POSIX says it should
match all code points between 0-127, but that's misleading since
it's only true for strict supersets of ASCII: should `[:ascii:]`
match 0x5C if the table is Shift-JIS? It would be just as wrong as
matching `√∂`. :-(

Why not try to do the right thing and mark ASCII-compatibility for
each code point, since (for instance) 0x41 is `A` both in ASCII and
Shift-JIS? There's no way to ask a locale whether a code point
refers to the same character in ASCII, so the users would need to
manually go through the tables after generating them. Happy fun
times.

I've settled for documenting this mess since we can't fix this
on our end without breaking people's code, and there's not much
point in reporting this upstream since it'll either be misleading
or far too much work for the user, and PCRE-8.x is nearing the
very end of its life.

##### 2021-05-09 15:45:13 by Marcus Harrison

The Great Refactoring

Original design was to have a single resource type,
use a vtable variable with mostly noops except for
initializer, and the initializer would replace the
vtable with implementations on success.

Lots of downsides:
- Lots of boilerplate code for the same thing, over and over
- Changing values around for the vtables in three places -
  initial constructor, initializer and deinitializer
- a validity function that is mostly unused, since we know
  uninitialized values are invalid and initialized values are
  valid

Basically no upsides I can think of.

New design, csalt_resources have on function - csalt_resource_init -
and it returns a new type, csalt_resource_initialized*. Returns a
valid pointer on success, or NULL on failure. Initialized types are
csalt_stores with one more function - deinitialize.

- Much less boilerplate and much simpler code
- Since we know we can't read/write/etc. an uninitialized
  resource, we just remove the possibility
- Since we can't initialize an initialized resource, we
  just remove the possibility
- I seriously can't emphasise enough how much simpler the code
  is and I was getting sick of repeating the same code over and
  over and

Listen, you can whine about technical debt or you can grow
a spine and fucking fix it because YOU'RE THE ONE IN CHARGE HERE

YOU'RE THE MASTER NOW

Sorry, taking out my frustration about previous employers.

##### 2021-05-09 17:39:01 by Marko Grdiniƒá

"2pm. Let me do the chores here.

2:10pm. I did not have to do much today. Okay, let me stop RI for the time being.

I've come to a decision, I am going to give up on input filtering. It seems like a nice optimization at first glance, but it has too many disadvantages when considered across various different contexts. For the GPU, rather than lowering its consumption when there is nothing to do, I really should be focusing on giving it more work instead.

The issues with contracting the input space as the processing goes along is not something I want to deal with.

2:30pm. Ok, enough. Stop taking breaks. Focus me. I can put a few hours into this.

2:50pm. My focus is high, but let me step away from the screen for a bit. I am converging to some conclussions, but need some time to elaborate them.

3:10pm. I took a short nap to think about it.

I've come to a decision - RNNs are out. There is no way to implement RNN agents efficiently on the GPU. It would be different if I had a specialized chip with its own dedicates threads for every outer dimension, but with the GPU, even for 2p games I'd have to waste 50% of the computation on every calculation.

This is because while p1 is acting, p2 will have to wait. With a feedforward net this would not be a problem since it has no state that needs to be carried over, but recurrent nets do. With 6p games I'd need to waste 5/6ths of the computational capacity!

The solution to make this efficient would be to use a data structure to store intermediate states for each player. But a regular matrix cannot be used for this, the data structure would have to be immutable. Or something like an array of arrays...

But either way, fetching these states from such a data structure in order to assemble them into a matrix would be expensive and complicated. And RNNs in particular are harder to train than feedforward nets.

Since transformers are feedforward nets, I should use them instead.

Also, when trained using backprop, RNNs are effectively feedforward anyway.

3:20pm. Forget it, I can safely leave RNNs out of consideration. Who knows if they will become dominant even on future hardware.

It is feedforward nets all the way for me from here. I should consider transformers for full NL holdem.

Hmmm, let me read that MLPmixer paper.

...Agh, let me reset the router.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601
MLP-Mixer - An all-MLP Architecture for Vision

I want to see what conclusions I can draw from this.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07368
Explicit Regularisation in Gaussian Noise Injections

I might as well read this. I had the idea of injecting noise, and this should improve my understanding of what I was suggesting.

3:50pm. Ok, I think I get what MLP mixer is doing. It is interesting that it works so well.

Let me read the noise paper.

3:55pm. Ok, done. Some math stuff, not a big deal. Let me take a look at the MLP mixer again. What regularization is it using? It was not in the pseudocode.

> In particular, we use RandAugment [12], mixup [56], dropout [42], and stochastic depth [19].

Hadn't heard about the first two.

4:15pm. Done with lunch. It was a lot earlier today than I expected.

Mixup trains a net on convex combination of pairs of examples and their labels. Interesting.

4:20pm. Let me still my thoughts, they are too scattered around.

RNNs are out. Transformers, that is feedforward nets that can take in arbitrary length sequences will require some extra consideration for efficiency, but it is not a big deal.

4:30pm. The tabular methods, I'd also put into the feedforward category.

...Input filtering is out, just as I'd said earlier. Let me think through that again.

It is just so hard to start for me. Overcoming my internal inertia is a huge hurdle.

4:35pm. Let me step away from the screen.

6:50pm. Oh, it seems I stepped away for a while.

I was thinking about long term credit assignment and long term memory. Value functions and TD learning are a clue.

Now that I have my new training method, I can see gradient coming into the inputs as viable targets.

When composing networks which have different timescales, backprop would not work as by the time the slow net gets the targets, the fast net's trace would have already decayed.

The answer is to do what TD does - predict the targets. If it were before, that would have been absurd since the gradients could be badly unhinged, but once I rescale them, I'd get what I need.

Once the issue of passing rewards at different timescales becomes an issue, the only choice is to start predicting them. This is the answer, it cannot be anything else.

7pm. There was a period (probably in 2019) where I looked around for ways of making recurrence propagate info beyond the backprop horizon. There were some papers on that, but they were just hacks in the end. Fancy math, some benchmarks, but nothing that clicked.

I think this situation here is the same as with unsupervised learning. First there were autoencoders and they worked on just toys. Then there were GANs which worked on bigger toys, but couldn't possibly be the answer due to instability. Then there was the training scheme in the GMN paper that could make the stable.

Forget about unrolling RNNs for arbitrary number of steps. The only consideration RNNs should have is whether I want weight sharing across timesteps. I already know that LSTMs and regular RNNs cannot propagate info for very long distances regardless.

What can do it even with backprop are tree-like architectures in which the higher levels take info at increasingly longer timescales. Even if some trick exists that could make info propagate for a lot longer in RNNs are now, do I really think it will ever be the case that it will optimize for something like 2 ** 32 timesteps?

A tree NN could do that with 32 layers without trouble.

But even if the training could work in theory, the computer cannot possibly hold that many inputs in memory.

So the answer is the same as in TD learning - predict. When the memory is not big enough, use your own internal state as reference.

7:15pm. I do not know what the right scheme for doing that is, but it does not matter.

What matters is that I believe in it.

I've been agonizing about RNNs and architectures in the past, but that MLP Mixer paper proves that architectures are ultimately a technicality.

7:20pm. I should believe that everything I need is here. It will take a few more innovations to get where I want, but those will just be new spins on an old thing.

When truly long-term memory become necessary, the method to make synthetic gradients work will appear. For all I know maybe what exists today works well, though I doubt it.

7:30pm. Let me close here. My progress is snail-like, but tomorrow I will try to get the training procedure and the uniform agent to work as a sketch.

I am going to get through my inhibitions even if it kills me. Today I might not have done much programming, but I did not spent this time playing games or reading novels. I spent it trying to iron out my beliefs. Eventually the effort today will turn into motivation to do programming tomorrow. I will build the strength to travel the path.

I just had to think about the issue of the sequence length. It is inevitable that trying to decide between feedforward nets and recurrent ones would trigger this debate in me.

Not having a good reply for long term credit assignment is one of my weaknesses, but it is not that there aren't any hints in the present on what will the truth of tomorrow."

  tuple.__repr__ did not consider a reference loop as it is not possible from
  Python code; but it is possible from C.  object.__str__ had the issue of not
  expecting a type to doing something within it's tp_str implementation that
  could trigger an infinite recursion, but it could in C code..  Both found
  thanks to BaseException and how it handles its repr.

  Closes issue #1686386.  Thanks to Thomas Herve for taking an initial stab at
  coming up with a solution.

  Made the various is_* operations return booleans.  This was discussed
  with Cawlishaw by mail, and he basically confirmed that to these is_*
  operations, there's no need to return Decimal(0) and Decimal(1) if
  the language supports the False and True booleans.

  Also added a few tests for the these functions in extra.decTest, since
  they are mostly untested (apart from the doctests).

  Thanks Mark Dickinson

  The constructor from tuple was way too permissive: it allowed bad
  coefficient numbers, floats in the sign, and other details that
  generated directly the wrong number in the best case, or triggered
  misfunctionality in the alorithms.

  Test cases added for these issues. Thanks Mark Dickinson.

Fixes a fuck ton more harddels (#58779)

Redoes how geese handle eating shit, it was fucking stupid and caused harddels, and while this method is technically slower in the best case, it's a fucking goose
Fixes action related harddels, I hate how they work but at least this way they won't hold refs.
Fixes the hierophont causing its beacon to harddel
Removes the M variable from megafauna actions, it was used like a typed owner and caused harddels, so I burned it
Fixes target and targets_from harddels, replaces all setters of target with LoseTarget and GiveTarget, which should help maintain behavior. I'm not sure if this breaks anything, but if it does we should fix the assumptions that code makes instead of reverting this change
Fixes more area_senstive_contents related harddels, we need to allow the mob to move before clearing out its list.
Fixes marked object harddels (I'm coming for you admin team)
Fixes a language based human harddel
Fixes managed overlay related harddels (This was just emissive blockers, but I think this is a good safety net to have. If we clear the overlay list we should clear this one as well)
Fixes bot core harddels, I hate the fact that this exists but it has no reason to know who its owner is
Adds a walk(src, 0) to simple_animal destroy, it's the best bang for the buck in terms of stopping spurious harddels. Walk related harddels aren't that expensive in the first place, since byond does the same thing I'm doing here, but this makes finding mob harddels easier, so let's go with it
I fixed another source of part harddels, I hate fullupgrade so much
Fixes all the sound loop harddels

C (#1)

* Started fresh

Basically gonna do all of this with c

That reminds me I should change those names from cpp to cpp

* Renamed files

* Wrote my thoughts out before I blackout

TODO: Everything

And edit the makefile so it can compile both c and cpp, and without me
thinking about it

Also research if c object files (Why would they call them that if there
is no objects) can be compiled with c files. That way I might just be
able to have a main.cpp or something. Damn I'm tired

* Did a cat program in c.

Not the most impressive thing, but it's still ok.

I like not using objects, but not using namespaces is where I draw the
line. I kinda make my own namespaces with the underscore.

Also can't overload functions which sucks

* Just testing out my buffer. It works, kinda

It only works if you pipe in the file, because it needs that EOF to get
out of the first character loop.

In cpp this wouldn't be a problem because they got things like getline.

I could still try that character by character stack thing, which is
really why I'm pushing this commit.

* Update Language goal.md

Thinking about writing notations in relation to what I'm doing. Probably gonna put this on hold for a week while I hack something up in js to do this.
