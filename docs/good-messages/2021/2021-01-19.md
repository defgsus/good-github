Bug Squashes, Eastern Name Order, Gender Issues, and ItemTagResolver Display Tweaks (#6408)

Moves logic related to the PVP-mode management of the TownHall block to BlockHutTownHall. Cleans up the sendPlayerMessages to insert arguments into TranslationTextComponents properly. Removes the PlayerEvent.BreakSpeed eventhandler, which only had logic related to the TownHall block but was getting called for the vast majority of blocks but not BlockHuts.
Fixes double-counting of enchantment levels on fishing rods.
Changes gendering for initial settlers spawned by the TownHall to spawn men if the town has more women, and to spawn women if the town has more men. Also changes the first colonist to have a random chance of being male or female. Pattern will normally be female-male-male-female or male-female-male-female, but will recover from gender-seeking zombies a little more elegantly.
Removes duplicate placeConstructionTape in addNewBuilding, which was causing it to fire for IRSComponentBlocks like the postbox/stash (and twice for normal buildings).
Changes some model files to handle the 1.15.2+ Chest texture file change. Warehouse, Shepherd, Chicken Farmer. This could also be done for Swineherd and Courier, but they kinda look better as-is, since they're closed and the only effect is a shaded spot on the top of their chests. Did fix the under-latch shadow textures for the Courier.
Sets ItemTagResolvers to give the translated text for items that meet their requirements instead of the long Minecraft name of the tag (#com.minecraft.items.tags.Flowers). Only impacts Beekeeper for now. Not a perfect fix, as the StandardInteraction will show the first eligible item in the request (for vanilla flowers, dandelions), but solves the problem well enough without requiring deep changes.
Adds a configuration option for Eastern Name Order. For now, just switches to surname+lastname without space. There are some Asian cultures that use more complicated structures and a whole mess of complications from social norms, but this'll handle the simple good-enough version.

media: dvb-core: add helper functions for I2C binding

The dvb_attach()/dvb_detach() methods are ugly hacks designed
to keep using the I2C low-level API. The proper way is to
do I2C bus bindings instead.

Several modules were already converted to use it. Yet,
it is painful to use it, as lots of code need to be
duplicated.

Make it easier by providing two new helper functions:
	- dvb_module_probe()
	- dvb_module_release()

New data: 2021-01-18. See data notes for important messages.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

Upcoming changes (specific dates to be announced soon):

- The data structure of time series data will change in response to user feedback. This will only consist of adding additional columns to make the data easier to work with. The core columns will remain the same, for now. More details to follow. Initially, the updated dataset will be provided alongside the new dataset. After a time, the new data format will completely replace the old format.

Recent changes:

- 2021-01-08: The directories cases_extra and mortality_extra have been moved to other/cases_extra and other/mortality_extra.

Revise historical data: cases (BC, MB, ON, NS, SK).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “The data also report 32 new deaths, for a total of 9,087. Among these 32 deaths, 9 have occurred in the last 24 hours and 23 have occurred between January 11 and January 16.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

"11am. http://www.spiral.net/doc/pdf/spiral-tutorial2019.pdf

I got reply that there is some name collision between my Spiral and another. I knew there was a DSL by the same name, but I thought it was a Scala LMS library.

I added a note in the readme. But this is a bit interesting, let me take a look at the tutorial for this.

After that I'll get started on the videos.

11:15am. Let me finish the thread I am lurking and then I'll get started with watching videos.

11:40am. That ended up being longer than I thought. Ah, well I always waste an hour after I get up. Let me start the vids. I'll start with Cornami.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bNzxW90AEI
Cornami: Next Generation Machine Learning Algorithms for Privacy Preserving Neural Networks

https://cornami.com/

Why are they talking about encription? I guess I'll know after I watch the video.

11:50am. https://youtu.be/_bNzxW90AEI?t=518

This is a pretty good technical talk. Ok, by this point I can see these guys are serious. I'll apply at Cornami amongst the others.

https://youtu.be/_bNzxW90AEI?t=722

It is interesting that they are worried about quantum computers.

https://youtu.be/_bNzxW90AEI?t=796
Fully Homomorphic Encryption: A holy grail of cryptography

https://youtu.be/_bNzxW90AEI?t=1155

This is actually pretty interesting.

12:25pm. Reconfigurable cores would definitely be up my alley. If I had one of these chips, making the RL agents that I want would not be a problem. Though I'd expect them to be hard to program. Still, it would be worth mastering this.

There are just so many of these companies. On the surface, my plan is to do a wide sample, but it might turn out to be too difficult to do in a timely manner. This might turn my choices into a coin flip.

In that case, I should just pick something like Cornami - adaptable hardware would adapt to any possible situation. And unlike say spiking nets, I won't be held back by the right algorithms not existing.

Let me move on to the next thing on the list.

The next one is Esperanto. Enflame is the only company which does not have a presence so I'll remove it from consideration.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9NawVqm3qM
RISC-V Tokyo 2020 : Shankar Jayaratnam, Raymond Tang | Esperanto Technologies (USA)

https://www.esperanto.ai/

Let me watch this vid. I'll do it while I have breakfast.

1:10pm. The Esperanto vids are low quality.

I'll say that Cornami is high ranked and Esperanto is mid at best.

In that one video, the japanese CTO started off by displaying his poor grasp of English. Things like this reveal a level of disfunction in the company. The video ended up being about hardware verification too instead of the chip itself. The other video is similar to that.

Forget this. Let me move on to the next thing.

The next is Fathom Computing. [Website](https://www.fathomcomputing.com/).

Damn it, not only can't I not find videos for this, I am having difficulty finding the team.

https://www.wired.com/story/this-computer-uses-lightnot-electricityto-train-ai-algorithms/

Here is an article on it. let me read this.

1:40pm. Fathom is too much in the research phase most likely. Forget it. Let me move on.

The next is Groq.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJbTEXFAsLs
Groq's Tensor Streaming Processor

https://youtu.be/uJbTEXFAsLs?t=73

Uncompromised peak performance for batch size 1 workloads.

I definitely need this.

2:15pm. Groq is high tier. It is not as speculative as Cornami. Adapting hardware might be hard to deal with so I will be taking a risk there that I would not with Groq.

Let me have a break here.

After that I'll watch more of Groq's videos."

audio: fix stream-silence with push AOs (somewhat)

--audio-stream-silence is a shitty feature compensating for awful
consumer garbage, that mutes PCM at first to check whether it's
compressed audio, using formats advocated and owned by malicious patent
troll companies (who spend more money on their lawyers than paying any
technicians), wrapped in a wasteful way to make it constant bitrate
using a standard whose text is not freely available, and only rude users
want it. This feature has been carelessly broken, because it's
complicated and stupid. What would Jesus do? If not getting an aneurysm,
or pushing over tables with expensive A/V receivers on top of them, he'd
probably fix the feature. So let's take inspiration from Jesus Christ
himself, and do something as dumb as wasting some of our limited
lifetime on this incredibly stupid fucking shit.

This is tricky, because state changes like end-of-audio are supposed to
be driven by the AO driver, while playing silence precludes this. But it
seems code paths for "untimed" AOs can be reused.

But there are still problems. For example, underruns will just happen
normally (and stop audio streaming), because we don't have a separate
heuristic to check whether the buffer is "low enough" (as a consequence
of a network stall, but before the audio output itself underruns).

Revised source code, bug fixes and new functionality

I love this custom climate module for the Toon and I decided to personally contribute to this project. Please see the overview of the changes I made to the code below:

Revised the code in “climate.py” to support “auto” (scheduled) and “heat” (manual) work mode.

Also added the support for the “eco” preset. Instead of a normal preset this “eco” preset will allow you to put the Toon in “vacation mode”. The latter means it will change the setpoint in the Toon to what has last been set in the Vacation mode the Toon offers. It will keep this setpoint until you change it to one of the other (standard) setpoints supported by the Toon or change the actual work mode.

Changed the code so it uses the actual config parameters for the min and max temp. The previous version of the code had the parameters but did not change them in the code.

Changed to code to correctly update the work mode status in Home Assistant when the work mode is changed manually on the Toon device. The previous version did not support this and the status of the climate object in Home Assistant got out of sync.

Cleaned up and re-ordered the code a bit and added additional comments in the code to explain a bit more what it does and what the meaning is of some of the settings.

As for some reason home assistant does not like the comment with the triple quotation marks when I added them in different areas of the code I replaced all the previous comments with teh triple quotation marks with inline comments using the pound sign instead. After that Home Assistant seemed to be very happy.

Updated the “README.mb” file the reflect the above.

I have tested the updated code as much as I can on my own "Toon 1" and it seems to works fine hence why I am happy to commit the changes. All changes either in home assistant or on the manually Toon are working well and in sync with the status on the Toon or in Home assistant.

Jaaaammeeeesssss! For those that are new here. James is not in the Discord for the Dibney Cru, he never has been.  We have felt that it would do more harm to him and to us to have him in it. Not because James is a danger or anything, but honestly, he has enough on his plate taking care of Ronda and doing his robotics. 

She keeps screaming about her proof. Lordy. Her proof is spewing and hissing at her screen like the idiot she is. Frankly I love her reactions with Elk. Threat after threat.  As Ruin said  "A threat is something you make when you are not sure you can pull it off." Or its a way to posturing and preening and means nothing. None of us take what she says as serious. 

She is still after Candy. Despite her words of late, we know better. And it will be interesting to see when this is done.

Improve descriptor and viability check for SHM

Summary:
Here I introduce a viability check for SHM, and improve its domain descriptor.

I believe that often those two values are quite related. (Maybe not so much here, but you'll see that in CMA they have a lot in common). Thus the code looks more readable to me if they are calculated together, in the same function. (This is also less error-prone). However, due to the fact that the descriptor must be passed by the context's constructor to the base class's constructor means we cannot call this function in the context's constructor. Instead we'll need a factory method.

This is somewhat annoying but, first of all, it doesn't change the public user interface and, second, it kinda pushes us into a direction we had started to consider anyways, namely the idea of not making a transport's context class public. This is because such a class will never (*) have any custom methods, since it will be immediately down-cast to a generic context pointer. Hence to avoid having to define all these identical context classes we could just have each transport define a static factory function that returns an already-downcast pointer.

Moreover, this new factory method I'm introducing here made me realize that perhaps we might want to change how we handle viability: right now it's an attribute of the transport/channel that is read by the core context, but the user never really becomes aware of it. What if, once we had that factory function I just mentioned, we simply returned a nullptr whenever a viability check failed? This would avoid the attribute and would allow the user to detect and potentially deal with non-viability.

As suggested by @muglug, dropping `@mixin` and importing a trait as `Assert` type inference mechanism

Ref: https://symfony-devs.slack.com/archives/C8SFXTD2M/p1611064766060600

Quoting:

```
ocramius  2:59 PM
can anyone help me tackle down https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4381 ?
Mostly trying to figure out whether the assertions are being read differently for @mixin and concrete instances :neutral_face:

muglug  3:18 PM
mixins are a massive hack, both whenever they're used but also in Psalm
anything that relies on magic methods to work is going to be more flaky, so I'd encourage you to think of a non-mixin approach if at all possible

ocramius  3:19 PM
yeah, I'm thinking of doing that indeed, just unsure about approach yet :neutral_face:
can't they somehow be unified with traits though?
they're the same thing, no?

muglug  3:22 PM
if they were, you'd just use a trait!

ocramius  3:22 PM
ack, gonna actually try that approach for webmozart/assert then :slightly_smiling_face:

muglug  3:24 PM
with mixins the method that's actually being called is either __call or __callStatic, whereas with traits it's still that exact method

ocramius  3:24 PM
yes, I was just wondering if it could import the method as if it was a trait (at type level)
that would squash out *a lot* of code, but it's also true that a mixin does not have a trait definition
I think it makes sense to use the language feature for this :slightly_smiling_face:
```

The `@mixin` support in `vimeo/psalm` is a massive hack, which also requires other tooling to increase complexity
in the static analysis parsing capabilities. In order to reduce that complexity, we instead rely on `Assert`
importing `Mixin` as a trait, which is much simpler and much more stable long-term.

While this indeed leads to `Mixin` being changed from an `interface` to a `trait`, that is not really a BC
break, as `Mixin` was explicitly documented to be used only as a type system aid, and not as an usable
symbol.

PSP importer: text layers are now imported as native PhotoDemon text layers

This means you can still edit the text!  Yay!

This was no small feat, given the way PSP files embed text data.  On text layers (like other PSP vectors), no boundary or offset data is actually stored.  Instead, you have to reverse-engineer text layer position and offset from embedded font data.  (An embedded 3x3 deformation matrix *does* contain some semblance of layer offsets - but its values are calculated against the baseline of the first character in the text, so you need to determine things like font ascent/descent and work those into the layer position uuuuugh.  Don't ask how long it took me to solve that mystery.)  Text layer "size" works similarly, and it's made even worse by the way PSP handles text layer "stretching".

In the end, this was never going to produce 100% identical text layouts (since who knows what PSP uses as their underlying font renderer), but I'm actually surprised at how closely PD now reproduces PSP's results.  On most images, you're unlikely to notice differences unless you really pixel-hunt.

With more detective work I might be able to eke out a few more pixel-level corrections, but the goal here was really just to enable a modicum of interoperability, while learning about embedded vector data and what it might take to make vector import/export a first-class citizen in PD.  Mission accomplished, I'd say.

(And based on my limited testing, PhotoDemon is possibly the first non-PSP software to support import of PSP text and vector layers - so that's neat!)

I *think* I've done enough detective work to implement PSP exporting reasonbly quickly, and that's where I want to focus next.  I'm not sure if it's worth the trouble to export PD's text layers as PSP text layers, given how messy PSP's vector system is.  I'm mostly worried about producing files that PSP can't actually read... so I may start by just exporting all PD layers as raster layers, like we do with e.g. Photoshop images.  I'll see how long that takes me and perhaps reconsider if it goes exceptionally smoothly.

post This passage about the anti-Semitic Dreyfus Affair (from a book I’m reading on the French Third Republic) is coming to mind today: “Long before the end of the Affaire, as the French called it, the question of the guilt of Dreyfus became almost lost in the melee, giving way to a fundamental conflict over the very moral concepts of French society which cast its shadow over the Third Republic from then on to the end. For to the Army leaders and their backers in the Church, and among the conservative classes, the supreme issue became not whether Dreyfus was guilty (though they believed he was) but that even if he was innocent it were better that he suffer the tortures of the damned (as he was literally doing on Devil's Island) than that the prestige and the honor of the French Army, on which the defense of the country depended, be impugned. Of what significance was the life and honor of one individual compared to the life and the honor of la patrie? Of what significance indeed were naked truth and naked justice for the individual and even respect for the human personality regardless of race or religion if adhering to them undermined the confidence of the people in the leaders of the Army and sapped their faith in the constituted authorities and thus weakened the fiber of the nation? Above everything else lay the national interest and throughout history individuals had been sacrificed for it, as had truth and justice.”

Ah, so the reason why gnupg is still stale on the GitHub runner is because it's an old version of Ubuntu = Bionic = 18.04 LTS. That version is, yes, v2.2.4

 * https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/gnupg

It looks like we can, in fact, switch from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04 by changing 'ubuntu-latest' to 'ubuntu-20.04' (no fucking clue how latest isn't actually the latest *facepalm*), but I'm afraid even that would be a mismatch between Debian 10

First whack at windows (target) support for taste-tester (#144)

I can't imagine we have any desire to have TT itself run on Windows,
however, one has to manage their windows system sometime, and that means
being able to test on those systems.

This adds support for the remote system by generating the right
powershell to send over ssh.

That means there are two requirements to using this:

1. You have ssh enabled on your Windows PC
2. You set the default shell to powershell instead of cmd

Both are easily accomplished with this tiny bit of Chef:

```ruby
powershell_package 'ComputerManagementDsc' do
  action :install
end

dsc_resource 'install ssh-client' do
  resource :windowscapability
  module_name 'ComputerManagementDsc'
  property :name, 'OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0'
  property :ensure, 'Present'
end

dsc_resource 'install ssh-server' do
  resource :windowscapability
  module_name 'ComputerManagementDsc'
  property :name, 'OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0'
  property :ensure, 'Present'
end

dsc_resource 'start sshd' do
  resource :service
  property :name, 'sshd'
  property :startuptype, 'Automatic'
  property :state, 'Running'
  property :ensure, 'Present'
end
```

This also requires you to be on a version modern enough that symlinks
actually work - sorry, we're not re-inventing how taste-tester works
for old broken OSes. Getting Windws support here is ugly enough as it
is.

You may be wondering "but Windows has bash support now!"... and you'd be
sorta-right. You can enable WSL and Bash in modern Windows, but you end
up in a embedded linux environment. You can access the Windows
filesystem, but it's not a thing most people are going to want to do on
their windows systems. So, powershell it is.

This fully supports tunnels and non-tunnels. As far as I can tell,
everything works except "bundle mode" and "local transport", but I don't
think those are necessary here.

In order to not repeat the *crazy* trans-shell logic, I factored out
some code that was repeated (but badly, with bugs - now we *always*
specify `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` and friends, not just sometimes)
between ssh.rb and tunnel.rb into ssh_util.rb. I took this approach
because it was the least change, and since that's not directly related
to this PR, I wanted to minimize that. However, the long-term solution
here is to just roll tunnel.rb into ssh.rb. It already has a `tunnel`
option it ignores in the initializer.

Just a quick fix to the night theme. It wasn't really looking like a night theme before that was why in the previous commit, I said "... I don't know if the users will like it."
I don't want to talk about it with anybody that's why I'm saying it here. Anytime someone asks me about the AAD exam, I always feel like crying.
That shit really fucked my mind up. I don't even know how to feel anymore that's why I keep avoiding any conversation about it.
Anyways, still no paging library and SettingsFragment. See you in the next commit.
