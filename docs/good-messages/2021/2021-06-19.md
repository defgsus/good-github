Bump @reduxjs/toolkit from 1.5.1 to 1.6.0 in /web (#596)

Bumps [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) from 1.5.1 to 1.6.0.
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases"><code>@​reduxjs/toolkit</code>'s releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>v1.6.0 : RTK Query!</h2>
<p><strong>This release adds the new RTK Query data fetching APIs to Redux Toolkit</strong>.  It also adds multiple new options to <code>createAsyncThunk</code> for including <code>meta</code> fields and working with results, updates dependencies to Redux 4.1 and Immer 9, and includes a complete rewrite of our build toolchain with additional &quot;modern&quot; build artifacts in the package.</p>
<p>While this is a minor release in terms of semver, this is a huge update in terms of functionality, scope, and effort.  We're excited about how these new APIs will help our users build better applications with less code and better behavior!</p>
<p>Installation:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code>npm i @reduxjs/toolkit@latest
<p>yarn add <code>@​reduxjs/toolkit</code><a href="https://github.com/latest"><code>@​latest</code></a>
</code></pre></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upgrade Note</strong>: During the alphas, we received some reports of <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/1002">users seeing incorrect types after installing the RTK 1.6 previews</a>.  The problems appeared to be caused by multiple versions of the <code>redux</code> package ending up in a project's <code>node_modules</code> folder.  If you see this issue, you may need to uninstall and reinstall <code>react-redux</code> with the latest version, to help ensure no <code>redux</code> duplicates are in the package tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>RTK Query Data Caching API</h3>
<p><strong>RTK Query</strong> is a powerful data fetching and caching tool. It is designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, <strong>eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching &amp; caching logic yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>RTK Query is <strong>an optional addon included in the Redux Toolkit package</strong>, and its functionality is built on top of the other APIs in Redux Toolkit.</p>
<p>See the <strong>RTK Query usage guides and API reference docs</strong> for complete information on how to use RTK Query:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview">https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview</a></strong></p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>Web applications normally need to fetch data from a server in order to display it. They also usually need to make updates to that data, send those updates to the server, and keep the cached data on the client in sync with the data on the server. This is made more complicated by the need to implement other behaviors used in today's applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking loading state in order to show UI spinners</li>
<li>Avoiding duplicate requests for the same data</li>
<li>Optimistic updates to make the UI feel faster</li>
<li>Managing cache lifetimes as the user interacts with the UI</li>
</ul>
<p>The Redux core has always been very minimal - it's up to developers to write all the actual logic. That means that Redux has never included anything built in to help solve these use cases. The Redux docs have taught <a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-7-standard-patterns#async-request-status">some common patterns for dispatching actions around the request lifecycle to track loading state and request results</a>, and <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk">Redux Toolkit's <code>createAsyncThunk</code> API</a> was designed to abstract that typical pattern. However, users still have to write significant amounts of reducer logic to manage the loading state and the cached data.</p>
<p>Over the last couple years, the React community has come to realize that <strong>&quot;data fetching and caching&quot; is really a different set of concerns than &quot;state management&quot;</strong>. While you can use a state management library like Redux to cache data, the use cases are different enough that it's worth using tools that are purpose-built for the data fetching use case.</p>
<p>RTK Query takes inspiration from other tools that have pioneered solutions for data fetching, like Apollo Client, React Query, Urql, and SWR, but adds a unique approach to its API design:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data fetching and caching logic is built on top of Redux Toolkit's <code>createSlice</code> and <code>createAsyncThunk</code> APIs</li>
<li>Because Redux Toolkit is UI-agnostic, RTK Query's functionality can be used with any UI layer</li>
<li>API endpoints are defined ahead of time, including how to generate query parameters from arguments and transform responses for caching</li>
<li>RTK Query can also generate React hooks that encapsulate the entire data fetching process, provide <code>data</code> and <code>isLoading</code> fields to components, and manage the lifetime of cached data as components mount and unmount</li>
<li>RTK Query provides &quot;cache entry lifecycle&quot; options that enable use cases like streaming cache updates via websocket messages after fetching the initial data</li>
<li>We have early working examples of code generation of API slices from OpenAPI and GraphQL schemas</li>
<li>Finally, RTK Query is completely written in TypeScript, and is designed to provide an excellent TS usage experience</li>
</ul>

Because all these conflicting dimensions begin to destroy Brooklyn, Miles must help others stop Fisk and return everyone to their own dimensions. the industry’s biggest impact is on the DVD industry, which effectively met its destruction by mass popularizing online content. The emergence of streaming media has caused the fall of y DVD rental companies such as Blockbuster. In July (2021), an article from the New York Times published an article about Netflix DVD, No ches Frida 2s. It was stated that Netflix was continuing their DVD No. No Frida 2s with 5.3 million customers, which was a significant decrease from the previous year. On the other hand, their streaming, No ches Frida 2s, has 65 million members. In a March (2021) study that assessed “The Impact of movies of Streaming on Traditional DVD Movie Rentals” it was found that respondents did not buy DVD movies nearly as much, if ever, because streaming had taken over the market. So we get more space adventures, more original story material and more about what will make this 21st MCU movie different from the previous 20 MCU films. Watch Final Space Season 2 — Movie 6, viewers don’t consider the quality of movies to differ significantly between DVDs and online streaming. Problems that according to respondents need to be improved by streaming movies including fast forwarding or rewinding functions, and search functions. This article highlights that streaming quality movies as an industry will only increase in time, because advertising revenues continue to soar on an annual basis across industries, providing incentives for the production of quality content. He is someone we don’t see happening. Still, Brie Larson’s resume is impressive. The actress has been playing on TV and film sets since she was 11 years old. One of those confused with Swedish player Alicia Vikander (Tomb Raider) won an Oscar in 2016. She was the first Marvel movie star with a female leader. . And soon, he will play a CIA agent in a movies commissioned by Apple for his future platform. The movies he produced together. Unknown to the general public in 2016, this “neighbor girl” won an Academy Award for best actress for her poignant appearance in the “Room”, the true story of a wo who was exiled with her child by predators. He had overtaken Cate Blanchett and Jennifer Lawrence, both of them had F9 [Fast and Furious 9] (2021) out of statues, but also Charlotte Rampling and Saoirse Ronan.

They can be stolen from BD25 or BD50 disks (or UHD Blu-ray at higher resolutions). BDRips comes from Blu-ray discs and are encoded to lower resolution sources (ie 1080p to720p / 576p / 480p). BRRip is a video that has been encoded at HD resolution (usually 1080p) which is then transcribed to SD resolution. Watch F9 [Fast and Furious 9] (2021) The BD / BRRip Movie in DVDRip resolution looks better, however, because the encoding is from a higher quality source. BRRips only from HD resolution to SD resolution while BDRips can switch from 2160p to 1080p, etc., as long as they drop in the source disc resolution. Watch F9 [Fast and Furious 9] (2021) Movie Full BDRip is not transcode and can move down for encryption, but BRRip can only go down to SD resolution because they are transcribed. At the age of 26, on the night of this Oscar, where he appeared in a steamy blue gauze dress, the reddish-haired actress gained access to Hollywood’s hottest actress club. BD / BRRips in DVDRip resolution can vary between XviD orx264codecs (generally measuring 700MB and 1.5GB and the size of DVD5 or DVD9: 4.5GB or 8.4GB) which is larger, the size fluctuates depending on the length and quality of release, but increasingly the higher the size, the more likely they are to use the x264 codec. With its classic and secret beauty, this Californian from Sacramento has won the Summit. He was seen on “21 Jump Street” with Channing Tatum, and “Crazy Amy” by Judd Apatow. And against more prominent actresses like Jennifer Lawrence, Gal Gadot or Scarlett Johansson, Brie Larson signed a seven-contract deal with Marvel. There is nothing like that with Watch The Curse of La Llorona Free Online, which is signed mainly by women. And it feels. When he’s not in a combination of full-featured superheroes, Carol Danvers F9 [Fast and Furious 9] (2021) Nirvana as F9 [Fast and Furious 9] (2021) anti-erotic as possible and proves to be very independent. This is even the key to his strength: if the super hero is so unique, we are told, it is thanks to his ability since childhood, despite being ridiculed masculine, to stand alone. Too bad it’s not enough to make a film that stands up completely … Errors in scenarios and realization are complicated and impossible to be inspired. There is no sequence of actions that are truly shocking and actress Brie Larson failed to make her character charming. Spending his time displaying scorn and ridicule, his courageous attitude continually weakens empathy and prevents the audience from shuddering at the danger and changes facing the hero. Too bad, because the tape offers very good things to the person including the red cat and young Nick Fury and both eyes (the film took place in the 1990s). In this case, if Samuel Jackson’s rejuvenation by digital technology is impressive, the illusion is only for his face. Once the actor moves or starts the sequence of actions, the stiffness of his movements is clear and reminds of his true age. Details but it shows that digital is fortunately still at a limit. As for Goose, the cat, we will not say more about his role not to “express”. Already the 21st film for stable Marvel Cinema was launched 10 years ago, and while waiting for the sequel to The 100 Season 6 Movie war infinity (The 100 Season 6 Movie, released April 24 home), this new work is a suitable drink but struggles to hold back for the body and to be really refreshing. Let’s hope that following the adventures of the strongest heroes, Marvel aged to increase levels and prove better.

“STREAMING MEDIA”
Streaming Media is a multimedia that is constantly accepted and served to finalize users when delivered by the provider. The drain verb refers to the shipping process or get means in this way. [A clarification is needed] The transmission refers to the means of sending media, instead of the media. The method of distinguishing the media is distributed specifically for telecommunications networks, since most shipping systems are transmitted inherently (eg, radio, television, transmission applications) or inherently non-fluid (for example, book , Audio CD). There are challenges with the transmission content on the Internet. For example, users whose Internet connections do not have enough bandwidth can experience a slow termination, delay or buffer content. And users who lack hardware systems or compatible software may not be able to flow some content. Direct transmission is sending real-time Internet content, such as television transmissions directly in air waves through television signals. The transmission of the Internet directly requires a source media form (for example, video camera, audio interface, screen recovery software), encoder for digitizing content, media editors and content delivery networks to distribute and send content . Direct transmission does not need to be registered at the origin, although often. Streaming is an alternative to downloading files, a process in which the end user gets all content files before viewing or listening to it. Through the transmission, end users can use their multimedia player to start playing digital videos or digital audio content before all files have been sent. The term “transmission means” can be applied to the media other than videos and audio, such as direct direct programs, ticker tape and real-time texts, all of which are considered “transmission text”. Music elevators are one of the best popular muses available as media; At present, Internet, television is a common form of the transmission media. Some popular transmission services include Netflix, Disney +, Hulu, Prime Video, YouTube Video Share Web sites, and other sites that drain movies and television programs; Apple music, YouTube and Spotify Music, which drives music; And the transmission of videogame games immediately contracted.

Added log file showing boot from genesis

# Building up from Genesis
# Whenever the 3rd and 4th column disappears it means the minter stuck for one reason or another
# I was forced to "reboot" using my other machine's db at one point as I was unable to get the minter to react in any way for several days.
# On May 27th the log entry changes, this is due to the minter catching up to the height where I personally joined Qortal and got sponsored (thanks Qortal Rose :), so it starts showing my status (first M for minting, then L1 / L2 for reaching next levels)

# Findings:
# 1) It took from May 17th 19:49 to June 17th 14:25 (local time) to reach the height (this was my second try, pls read below)
# 2) My log is for every five minutes and it can clearly be seen that as the height developed less and less height could be acquired in that 5 minutes
#    I presume this is due to more and more users in Qortal ie more and more to calculate when trying to catch up. Does this also imply that the further the height grows, the more impossible it becomes for someone to start from Genesis?

Create ps4b.py

due to my inability to think recursively in ps4a.py, I've exerted much effort to use list comprehensions and coding ps4b.py without any form of pseudocode or visualization tools (i.e. paper) etc.

While I did not get the entire code working in first attempt but the core functions ie. Message.build_shift_dict(), Message.apply_shift() and majority of CiphertextMessage.decrypt_message() work.

I am not happy with what I've done with CiphertextMessage.decrypt_message() though - ps4b asks that we sorta "brute force" the encrypted message as we do not know what the shift key is, the challenge is to deal with -

the correctness of the decryption
keeping track of the number of valid words for each potential shift key
1 and 2 are related, and complicated because of the possibility that more than one shift can decrypt the encrypted text into a valid word... but potentially not the same word.
I ignore this possibility - I know this sounds irresponsible, but the chances of another shift producing a bunch of words - all valid - but makes no sense seems low.

What requires more attention is the (higher) possibility that users use invalid words in Message.message_text, i.e. "bro", which will end up invalid after encryption as words.txt do not contain this word. IMO the chances of a message containing more than 1 invalid words is higher than more than 1 shifts producing (a mixture of different/same) valid words.

One example which might surface up more often than we think is: user wrote a message of 20 words in a way where when decrypted, might have 10 invalid words. Same message when decrypted with an incorrect shift might produce 20 valid words.

I think this is something that is beyond my control without knowing the shift when decrypting. We can check the message for valid words before encryption and use that as the highest amount of valid words to check against post decryption, but.. hardly seems practical in real-life applications, in fact, for real life applications, maybe we'll need some sort of private key (shift), public key (26 - shift) being shared.

the question of do we keep track of every decrypted text?
This might be the worst/most troublesome, we can kill processes running infinite loops, but if we do not have memory, you're as good as done. Once OOM killer kicks in that's it. I know, ulimit prevents all these issues but still. And I know, infinite loops can potentially consume all memory, but with enough testing, that can be prevented.
I prefer programs to use less memory, and I don't mind running the same code - even though it bothers me a lot - more than once.
As ps4b ask that we return any of the "equally good" shift and only 1 shift in 26 is correct, this program will waste memory storing (uniquely) wrong decrypted outputs 25 times. Now the test is just for a single word; "hello", but imagine a message of 1000 words, that'll be 25000 words worth of wasted memory.

So I did not keep track, and when I have the key with the highest amount of valid words, I will decrypt again and return the tuple.

-=- 

Message.apply_shift() was originally coded to work for single word, but when running through a sentence, the space ' ' character got omitted, creating a long string which doesn't exist in word.txt, this lead to CiphertextMessage.best to be populated with keys and 0 valid words, cascading to CiphertextMessage.best_keys[] to be all 0s, leading to the climax of using the first element, a 0, to be used. 

What a shit show.

I decided to delete the previous ps4b.py and commits and comments and rework Message.apply_shift(), and now able to adequately encrypt/decrypt both single word and sentences.

```
# python3 ./ps4b.py

Fix for Welf Shadow Spellsinger missing scouting skill in vortex

Welf Shadow Spellsinger (that's the magic hero), and only Shadow (Beasts & Life are fine), is missing a place to plonk skill points for Scouting in my Vortex Sisters campaign. Some poking later, the fault is in character_skill_nodes_tables , whereby in the Campaign Key column it's specified main_warhammer , which presumably stops it from working in Vortex. Clearing that cell fixes it

"9:05am. Let me chill for a while and I will start. I am lurking the Yujiro thread at the moment. Seeing others would wanting to bully fictional characters like Elaina and him gives me insight into human nature. As far as I am concerned both are based. Their ego is a treasure to the world.

9:35am. Maybe I should pick up the Elaina novel.

Forget that. Let me finish the new chapter of Genocide Online and then I will start. Hellrage is cursed it seems. Nobody wants to pick it up.

9:40am. Time to start.

9:50am. Let me just gather my thoughts. Let me stop the music.

Yesterday I really needed to figure out that blowup bug. I upgraded PyTorch and then fixed the nans arising from division in the critic head. This is likely one of the causes. But the true reason why I thought there were blowups is because although I was doing averaging, I was accidentally testing it against the regular player. Also, the initial averaging step was in the wrong place and likely impacted training negatively.

The couple of runs 10 days ago that I did were really lucky and made me draw the wrong conclussions.

9:55am. All in all, the day was quite beneficial and I improved the training regime significantly. I also dug out the code to train the tabular agents so anybody going through the project should be able do so easily. Let this be my inheritance.

```
                BoxLayout:
                    Label:
                        text: 'Start in first position:'
                        size_hint_x: 0.4
                    CheckBox:
                        id: is_p1
                        active: True
```

Let me make it so that starting a new game flips this.

```
                    on_press:
                        b = 0 if is_p1.active else 1
                        is_p1.active = is_p1.active == False
                        root.start_game(round(init_stack_size.value),b,root.set_data) # start_game should be monkey patched.
```

Much nicer. I've also set the starting stack size to 50.

10:10am. I'll need to figure out how to make a log slider.

...Ok, how about this?

```
<LogSlider@Slider>:
    pow_value: 2 ** self.value
```

In fact, let me round it right away.

```
value: math.log2(50)
```

Let me start it up like this.

10:20am.

```
<PowTwoSlider@Slider>:
    pow_value: round(2 ** self.value)
```
```
PowTwoSlider:
    id: init_stack_size
    min: math.log2(3)
    max: math.log2(100)
    value: math.log2(50)
```

This should be a lot better as a way of starting it. Yeah, wonderful.

Ok, I did this bit of cleaning up and improving.

10:30am. Let me...take a nap for a bit. I am thinking here. Am I ready to just go forth and lay waste to my adversaries? Is it finally time to start the real deal? Between the mundane and the transcendent, am I finally ready to give up on the former?

10:40am. Let me step away from the screen for a while. I could start work on the extractor right away, but I think I should just decide what I want to do first. Yes, I thought about this, but...

I could have worked on this yesterday while training was being done, but having two different goals is difficult for me. My mind was fully locked into the task at hand yesterday. And given how late I closed for the day, I did not have time to mentally prep myself.

The extractor and the schema for it won't be hard to do at all, but I need some time to tune myself for the task at hand.

10:45am. Right now, apart from missing transformers I am extremely well positioned.

It really is quite simple isn't it? I just need a game, and then I need to train an agent on it. My plan can be put down in a single sentence. The way to gain power is not any more complicated than this.

And after six years of effort, I know how to do it right too.

Every single piece, from the architecture to the optimizer makes sense.

10:55am. I am not going to find anything better than what I have now. Relu followed by LN is the best activation possible. Though it leaves a mystery how brain could be using softsign/tanh equivalents, I'll toe that line when I get to it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/o126vy/d_neumann_series_for_matrix_inversion_and_its/

Let me watch this for a bit.

https://youtu.be/DM6brJrJYbM?t=109

Hmmm, this is interesting. I hadn't known about the connection between this matrix inverse method and the geometric series.

11:20am. https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06860
A Minimalist Approach to Offline Reinforcement Learning

> Offline reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed batch of data. Due to errors in value estimation from out-of-distribution actions, most offline RL algorithms take the approach of constraining or regularizing the policy with the actions contained in the dataset. Built on pre-existing RL algorithms, modifications to make an RL algorithm work offline comes at the cost of additional complexity. Offline RL algorithms introduce new hyperparameters and often leverage secondary components such as generative models, while adjusting the underlying RL algorithm. In this paper we aim to make a deep RL algorithm work while making minimal changes. We find that we can match the performance of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms by simply adding a behavior cloning term to the policy update of an online RL algorithm and normalizing the data. The resulting algorithm is a simple to implement and tune baseline, while more than halving the overall run time by removing the additional computational overheads of previous methods.

Let me read this. I need some downtime.

Thinking Like Transformers

> What is the computational model behind a Transformer? Where recurrent neural networks have direct parallels in finite state machines, allowing clear discussion and thought around architecture variants or trained models, Transformers have no such familiar parallel. In this paper we aim to change that, proposing a computational model for the transformer-encoder in the form of a programming language. We map the basic components of a transformer-encoder -- attention and feed-forward computation -- into simple primitives, around which we form a programming language: the Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language (RASP). We show how RASP can be used to program solutions to tasks that could conceivably be learned by a Transformer, and how a Transformer can be trained to mimic a RASP solution. In particular, we provide RASP programs for histograms, sorting, and Dyck-languages. We further use our model to relate their difficulty in terms of the number of required layers and attention heads: analyzing a RASP program implies a maximum number of heads and layers necessary to encode a task in a transformer. Finally, we see how insights gained from our abstraction might be used to explain phenomena seen in recent works.

This is pretty interesting.

11:30am. I might want to listen to this. The comments in this thread are interesting as well.

1:35pm. It was only 3m long. At any rate, I am done with breakfast. I still haven't stepped away from the screen like I said I would. Instead I am in a state of distraction. Now that it is time to resume let me finally do it.

I have these periods of downtime where I am not really slacking in the sense of playing games and reading, but I am also not working.

Let me take an hour or two, or however much I need. I'll go to bed and grasp the will to take the next step.

It is time to end this long scharade of powerlessness. I need some time to say goodbye to my past.

3pm. Let me play with the softmax for a bit. I have an idea and want to see if it makes sense.

No it would not. Well, it does not matter, it was just a thought.

3:10pm. Let me go back to bed. I want to overcome my inertia.

5:05pm. Wow, it is late.

I still do not feel like doing work, but I've decided to compromise and just do the extractor and the schema. There will be plenty of time to slack when the agent is actually training so let me aim for that.

* Train FF agents.
* Learn transformers.
* Hack the online dens.

If I can do these 3 I can start making money hand over fist.

And just training FF agents will have the benefit of allowing to play against computer agents and allow me to train my poker skills against somebody good. Spending a few hours every day playing against my own agents should be fun and teach me useful skills.

Even if I fail at making money, I'll at least have some fun playing against my own agents.

Now...let me do the extractor for the neural agent.

```
open leduc
nominal leduc_policy_input = {pid : u64; pot : u64; seq : a u64 (card * a u64 action)}
nominal leduc_net = {policy : obj; schema : schema leduc_policy_input card action; value : obj}
let leduc_obs_to_array (l : list (observation card action)) : a u64 (card * a u64 action) =
    let rec action (c,l) = function
        | Cons: (Observation: x), x' => (c,listm.rev l |> listm.toArray) :: action (x,Nil) x'
        | Cons: (Action: x), x' => action (c,x :: l) x'
        | Nil => (c,listm.rev l |> listm.toArray) :: Nil
    match listm.rev l with
    | Cons: (Observation: x), x' => action (x,Nil) x' |> listm.toArray
    | _ => failwith "Expected a card."

inl leduc_schema () =
    inl policy, value =
        open serialization.dense.array
        inl card = alt {king=Unit; queen=Unit; jack=Unit} : pu card
        inl action = alt {fold=Unit; call=Unit; raise=Unit} : pu action
        inl policy = array 2 (card ** array 4 action)
        policy, policy ** card
    inl action =
        open serialization.sparse.int
        alt {fold=Unit; call=Unit; raise=Unit} : pu action
    schema {policy value action}

inl leduc_extractor' (player_state,(leduc_state (p1,p2,_)),pid) =
    pl2_observations player_state pid, if p1.id = pid then p2.card else p1.card

inl leduc_extractor x = inl a,b = leduc_extractor' x in leduc_obs_to_array a,b
```

Let me do the equivalent of this.

```
inl holdem_extractor' (player_state,(p1,p2 : hu_holdem.players),pid) =
    pl2_observations player_state pid, if p1.id = pid then p2.hand else p1.hand
```

First is the extractor. I also need the pot size and the stack size.

```
inl s = p1,p2,(a community_cards, false : a u64 _ * _) // This bool is_showdown.
```

Ah, I forgot about the community cards as well.

5:40pm.

```
inl holdem_extractor' (player_state,(p1,p2,community_card,stack,is_showdown : hu_holdem.player * hu_holdem.player * _),pid) =
    assert (p1.id = pid) "Expected p1.id to match the pid."
    ((stack, p1.pot, p2.pot, p1.hand, community_card),pl2_observations player_state pid), p2.hand
```

I'll remove that assert after I finish trying things out.

Now what is next?

I need to convert the observations to something palatable.

```
let leduc_obs_to_array (l : list (observation card action)) : a u64 (card * a u64 action) =
    let rec action (c,l) = function
        | Cons: (Observation: x), x' => (c,listm.rev l |> listm.toArray) :: action (x,Nil) x'
        | Cons: (Action: x), x' => action (c,x :: l) x'
        | Nil => (c,listm.rev l |> listm.toArray) :: Nil
    match listm.rev l with
    | Cons: (Observation: x), x' => action (x,Nil) x' |> listm.toArray
    | _ => failwith "Expected a card."
```

Let me do something similar to this. For the time being how about I just extract the actions. I'll worry about the transitions later.

6:05pm.

```
open hu_holdem

union oaction = ORoundOver | OFold | OCall | ORaiseTo: i32
inl holdem_obs_to_array (l : list (observation card action)) : a u64 oaction =
    l |> listm.fold (fun (s,is_round_over) => function
        | Observation: x => s, true
        | Action: x =>
            inl x = match x with Fold => OFold | Call => OCall | RaiseTo: x => ORaiseTo: x
            if is_round_over then x :: ORoundOver :: s, false
            else x :: s, false
        ) ([],false)
    |> fst |> listm.toArray

inl suit_rank' x =
    open hand_scorer
    suit x, rank x
inl suit_rank (a,b) = suit_rank' a, suit_rank' b

inl holdem_extractor' (player_state,(p1,p2,community_card,stack,is_showdown : player * player * _),pid) =
    assert (p1.id = pid) "Expected p1.id to match the pid."
    ((stack, p1.pot, p2.pot, suit_rank p1.hand, am.map suit_rank community_card), pl2_observations player_state pid), suit_rank p2.hand

inl holdem_extractor x = inl (a,b),c = holdem_extractor' x in a,holdem_obs_to_array b,c
```

This is a decent bit of work. I should do the schema next.

```
inl leduc_schema () =
    inl policy, value =
        open serialization.dense.array
        inl card = alt {king=Unit; queen=Unit; jack=Unit} : pu card
        inl action = alt {fold=Unit; call=Unit; raise=Unit} : pu action
        inl policy = array 2 (card ** array 4 action)
        policy, policy ** card
    inl action =
        open serialization.sparse.int
        alt {fold=Unit; call=Unit; raise=Unit} : pu action
    schema {policy value action}
```

This is how it was done last time. Thankfully rank and suit are now just integers.

```
((i32 * i32 * i32 * ((i8 * i8) * i8 * i8) * a u64 ((i8 * i8) * i8 * i8)) * list (observation i8 action)) * (i8 * i8) * i8 * i8
```

```
inl int forall t {number;int}. size : pu t =
    pu {size
        pickle = fun x (i,s : state) =>
            if 0 <= x && u64 x < size then set s (i + u64 x) 1
            else failwith "Value out of bounds."
        unpickle = fun (from,s : state) =>
            inl ~(from,nearTo) = from, from+size
            join
                inl case,c =
                    loop.for (from:nearTo:) (fun i (case,c) =>
                        inl x = index s i
                        if x = 0 then case,c
                        elif x = 1 then i,c+1
                        else failwith "Unpickling failure. The int type must either be active or inactive."
                        ) (0,0)
                if 1 < c then failwith "Unpickling failure. Too many active indices in the one-hot vector."
                inl r = case - from
                $"<`t>!r", c
        }
```

I've modified this serializer so it is less annoying.

Am I doing a smart thing by doing this? Would it not be better to not risk bugs and transform that...

```
((i32 * i32 * i32 * ((i8 * i8) * i8 * i8) * a u64 ((i8 * i8) * i8 * i8)) * list (observation i8 action)) * (i8 * i8) * i8 * i8
```

Yeah, let me just map all of these to `u64`. I'll have to do the wrap in schema, but it would be better to do that than risk introducing bugs into the serializer. Even if I am 99.9% sure that nothing will go wrong, there is no need to take risks.

I'll just write a bit extra, sure to be bug free code elsewhere.

For the reverse wrap I'll just throw an exception.

Ah, yes. That's it!

I should have done that in leduc instead of introducing those extractor args. How foolish I am. Let me add a note and then I'll go have lunch.

6:30pm.

```
// Note: Instead of introducing these extractor arguments, I should have just done a partial
// wrap in the schema for the input mapping. For the deserialization which is not done anyway I
// could have just put in an exception.
```

Let me have lunch. I do not feel like finishing it yet.

7:10pm. Done with lunch.

```
inl leduc_schema () =
    inl policy, value =
        open serialization.dense.array
        inl card = alt {king=Unit; queen=Unit; jack=Unit} : pu card
        inl action = alt {fold=Unit; call=Unit; raise=Unit} : pu action
        inl policy = array 2 (card ** array 4 action)
        policy, policy ** card
    inl action =
        open serialization.sparse.int
        alt {fold=Unit; call=Unit; raise=Unit} : pu action
    schema {policy value action}

inl leduc_extractor' (player_state,(leduc_state (p1,p2,_)),pid) =
    pl2_observations player_state pid, if p1.id = pid then p2.card else p1.card

inl leduc_extractor x = inl a,b = leduc_extractor' x in leduc_obs_to_array a,b
```

Let me give refactoring this a try.

7:10pm. No wait. I need the extractor for the tabular player. Nevermind.

7:15pm. It is too annoying to deal with this right now. I'll leave it for tomorrow along with the holdem serializer.

I said I would resume after lunch, but who feels like doing it now. Right now is the time to rest. I'll deal with this tomorrow morning. After that I'll set the agent to train for the first time."

modules: Glslang, you're the reason PEOPLE HATE BUILDSYSTEM.

Confuckinggratulations, you managed to split the project into even more
tiny useless badly named libraries! Yes, it's amazing that such a
generic name like /usr/lib/libMachineIndependent.a is actually glslang,
who would have thought! All the developers who ever got their hands on
glslang and didn't cancel the whole project immediately upon seeing this
horror should get retroactively fired. FFS.
