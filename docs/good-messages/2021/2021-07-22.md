New version! Fixes!! Bug fixes! More bug fixes!! Cleanups!

Most of these were exposed by issue #251 filed by LukasNickel, then further
revealed via his debugger data set, which showed two more bugs. Well, bugs,
changed syntaxes, same difference to end users.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES:

1. Work is ongoing to add btrfs support to -R (similar to softraid or zfs),
basic stubs and debuggers added, but reporting tools are not as robust (and
often require sudo/root for reasons that escape me) as I would have hoped, so
it's slow. One of these days... Normally would not release with working stubs,
but there were enough real issues/bugs to warrant just getting 3.3.06 out the
door, then going on with the btrfs feature for -R. But so far I view the
reporting tools as inadequate, unfortunately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS:

1. As initially discovered in issue #251 there are alternate syntaxes which had
never been seen before for remote mounts, fuse mounts, etc. In this case, it was
fuse.sshfs that was not removed from the Disk total:... used: leading to silly
1000+% used percentage. Note that while technically inxi could try to be clever
about reporting impossible percentages, so far those have led to bugs getting
reported, then fixed, so I think it worth leaving it as is.

2. When --swap/-j is used with no other arguments, failed to show uuid or label.
Discovered this while testing fix 2.

3. Bug which is not a bug but will appear as such to users, nvme temps were
failing in -Dx due to a change in how those values are located in /sys. See fix
3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXES:

1. Going along with Bug 1, and considering that only in 3.3.05 was the nfs4
remote fs failure to identify/exclude, the entire section involving remote/ fuse
etc file systems was refactored, and extended to add many more previously
non-handled remote and fuse type file systems. Significant extension of known
remote filesystem types, distributed file systems, overlay file systems, all to
try to avoid having more distributed/remote/fuse file system issues. Also added
test to support fuse. or fuseblk. type prefixes for any of these. Hopefully
there will be fewer issues related to distributed and remote and overlay type
file systems in the future.

2. Made all label/uuid triggers global, that is, -ol shows unmounted with
labels, -ju shows swap with uuid, and so on. This may require a bit more tweaks
to get exactly right, but in general, this is a purely cosmetic fix, that is,
try not to show label/uuid for partition/mounts that probably can't have those
values.

3. There was a change in the way nvme /sys temperature paths were handled, an
actually understandable, albeit as always annoying, one, because inxi actually
had to do a sort of convoluted hack to get the nvme block devices temperatore
paths before, now that hack is not required for newer kernels (5.12+), though
for kernels that had the old paths (5,8, 5.9 at least, don't know when paths
changed) left in the old method. Now tests are more granular, and inxi should
find temperatures regardless of which method is used for nvme and sd type
drives.

4. Another somewhat irksome random change, again, understandable since the new
syntax is more consistent in output than the previous one, but still breaks all
existing parsers that use the changed field names. Lsblk did NOT change the -o
input field names, but DID change the output field names, which broke the
internal inxi parser, and led to null lsblk data.

Changes were - or : separators in input values are output as _ always. that is,
MAJ:MIN becomes MAJ_MIN. Also corrected the debugger lsblk to use the same
output fields for -P -o as the actual lsblk parser uses internally so these
failures can be spotted more readily, as it was, it was literally only because
someone submitted the debugger dataset, and was running lsblk 2.37, where I
believe this behavior change happened. Solution was to just use regex patterns
instead, [:_-], in the parser. Big fear now is that they will randomly stop
supporting the -o input field names that contain - or : and change that too
without any real warning or deprecation notice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Going with bug and fix 1, added avfs, afs, archivemount, avfs, ceph, gfs,
glusterfs, gmailfs, hdfs, ipfs, kosmos/kfs, lafs, mergerfs, mhddfs, moosefs,
ocfs, openafs, orangefs, overlayfs, pvfs, s3fs, sheepdog, vmfs, and several
others to the exclude list for disk used and show label/uuids for partitions.

2. A smattering of disk vendors added.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES:

1. Going with fix 2, -l and -u no longer will trigger -P by default, now if -l
or -u are used without -j, -o, -p, -P, an  error will explain that you must use
one of those together with -l or -u. This was the only way to get the -l and -u
switches to turn off/on label/uuid reports in swap, unmounted, and partitions
consistently. Triggering -P was really a legacy behavior from when the only
options were -p or -P, and --swap and --unmounted did not exist. I found it
increasingly odd that unmounted would show label/uuid always but partitions only
with -l/-u.

2. This was a pet peeve, sometimes field names just bug me (like 'Topology: did
for CPU, now  corrected to Info:), the Drive: rotation: was one such annoyance.
I had recycled that to indicate SSD, which was a feature request, but that was
always a sloppy solution, and made no sense, since SSD isn't a rotation speed.

Now it reports a much more logical:

ID-1:...... type: HDD rpm: 7200
or
ID-1:...... type: SSD
or
ID-1:...... type: N/A

This also corresponds to the intended meaning much better. The HDD type was
always present internally if rotation speed is detected, but was not used. Now
will also show type: N/A if reliable type detection failed, which will also be
more consistent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION:

1. Brought most of inxi.changelog (this file) into a consistent state, re
whitespaces, readability, consistent use of various header / section names.
Ideally while I don't expect anyone to ever sit down and read this changelog, it
will be now much easier to scan to find whatever interests you. This change goes
along with ongoing changes in docs to in general try to be usually 80 columns
wide.

2. inxi-resources.txt, inxi-data.txt are updated with more raid, partition, file
system values and data to go along with bug, fix, enhancement 1.

3. Man and help updated to indicate -u and -l no longer trigger -P by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE:

1. Ongoing refactors, bringing the codebase to the point that matches current
coding styles. Removed remainder of whitespaces in conditions and for/while
loops, for example:

if ( condition ) {
becomes:
if (condition){
and
if ( ( test set 1 ) && ( test set 2 ) ) {
becomes:
if ((test set 1) && (test set 2)){

and so on. That dropped over 2 KiB of whitespaces. This went along with fixes
that have been ongoing to change to this whitespace use style, but previously it
was only being  done when that situation was hit in a local block, now it's been
completed globally.

This continues the style refactor that has been ongoing for a while now, to
bring inxi into a consistent state, since when it started, it was more pressing
to get the bash/gawk mess translated to Perl than it was to get the Perl itself
to be as good/consistent as possible, so now those issues are being slowly
unravelled, and hopefully will set inxi on course for its next 10 years.

It was starting to get annoying, because some parts of inxi used those spaces,
and all newer ones didn't in general. Now it's one behavior throughout the whole
program file.

2. Refactored the entire fs exclude for disk used data, and integrated those
values into a global tool that is used either to exclude file systems from disk
used totals, or to not show uuid/labels for the excluded
remote/distributed/overlay type file systems, which in general don't have uuid
or labels.

---> i love pain so i found how to work with it;
----> use one folder in a workspace - add to java source path - make sure
that java explorer can see your new project;
----> add another folder in the workspace - add to java source path - make sure
that java explorer can see your new project;
-> to use dependencies specified in .pom file:
--> run from the terminal
-> mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -f "path/to/project.pom";
---> all dependency packages will be placed in the target folder;
---> using java explorer - add dependency - select the needed jar package;
-> with all this stuff we can get complete
syntax highlighting, prompts, intellisense and warnings;
> vscode launch configurations are finally used;
-> just hit f5 and everything should be created by java extensions;
--> there will be "Launch Main" configuration which runs each time;
-> or we can use vscode-run&debug panel and run our own configuration/compound;
-> by some reason they are very long;

Add load average stressor, try to create insane load averages

Load averages are a meaningless metric of CPU loading. This stressor
creates potentially thousands of low priority pthreads that spin
on rescheduling yields and massively increase load average.

As Peter Zijlstra wrote in kernel/sched/loadavg.c

"This file contains the magic bits required to compute the global loadavg
 figure. Its a silly number but people think its important. We go through
 great pains to make it work on big machines and tickless kernels."

RFC: Add Sorbet typechecker to dd-trace-rb

 ## TL;DR

* Minimal bootstrapping for now.
* Type checking is optional. Default is no type checking for files
  without a magic comment. Should have minor impact on people that
  don't want to touch the type checking.
* `bundle exec srb tc` runs the type checking.
* I've enabled type checking during CI runs

 ## What?

While not a replacement for all our tests and other tooling, a type
checker is a nice extra line of defense for catching issues that we
otherwise may have missed, such as #1602.

The Ruby ecosystem around type checking is still rather immature. You
may have heard that Ruby 3 shipped "with type checking" but that's an
oversimplification: it actually only shipped with a "language for
describing types" and a "type analysis tool"
(<https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/>).
You may have noticed that nowhere in the previous sentence the words
"type checker" were included.

So, Ruby 3 itself provides no type checker. In practice, there are two
typecheckers in "wide" use for Ruby:

* [Steep](https://github.com/soutaro/steep), created by a Ruby core team
  member that also worked on manny of the other type-related bits that
  made it to Ruby 3 (but steep itself was not made part of Ruby)
* [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/), a type checker in wide use at Stripe
  and Shopify

This RFC PR does a first pass at onboarding Sorbet to our codebase.
There's a number of limitations on this "first pass", which I document
below.

 ## Why not Steep?

I've tried onboarding our codebase to steep, and gave up due to two big
issues:

1. Steep relies on the Ruby 3 rbs format, but unlike Sorbet, there
doesn't seem to be any way of starting small on a mostly-untyped
codebase without any `.rbs` files, and iterate from there. There are
tools to generate skeleton `.rbs` files (the `rbs` gem has two
different modes for it + the `typeprof` gem), but they had a hard time
with ddtrace.

2. There is currently little documentation for the type checking errors,
once Steep does run. Google gave me ZERO hits on one of them (I guess
it doesn't index the tool repository at least). And they're not all
that easy to understand/fix, so what use is having a tool tell
you "this is wrong", if then you're stuck with little help on something
that may not even be a real issue but more likely a tool limitation?

For these reasons, I gave up on Steep (for this first iteration).

 ## Working with Sorbet

Sorbet can be run with `bundle exec srb tc` (or `bundle exec rake
typecheck`). There's also Language Server Protocol support, if your
editor supports it.

The key thing to know about Sorbet is that allows file-level granularity
for enabling type checks, see
<https://sorbet.org/docs/static#file-level-granularity-strictness-levels>.

In practice, this means that at the top of each `.rb` file, we can
provide a comment that controls the reporting of type checking errors
for that file. The usual ones (described in the above link as well) are:
`# typed: ignore`, `# typed: false`, `# typed: true`, `# typed: strict`,
and `# typed: strong`.

In many cases, **Sorbet can typecheck a file correctly with no extra
type annotations**, so we can start enjoying its checks (such as finding
 #1602) by just enabling it for our files. This can be done with the `#
 typed: true`, `# typed: strict`, `# typed: strong` modes (see the docs
 for details).

The `# typed: false` is the default for files with no comment. Thus,
even newcomers into the codebase will not be forced to immediately deal
with Sorbet for contributions, which given the current limitations of
the tool, and level of maturity, I think is reasonable. (We can
reconfigure this later, if needed). In this mode, Sorbet will only
complain about syntax and missing constant errors.

Our codebase requires quite a few `# typed: ignore` because or
dependencies that are pulled via appraisals and thus not seen/available
to Sorbet (among other things that we do and that Sorbet) doesn't quite
like. These files are completely ignored by Sorbet. (Note that if you
then reference something on one of these files from another file, that
file will not typecheck either, so "ignore" becomes somewhat contagious,
and is best avoided if possible).

I've also added a CI step to run sorbet, which again follows the rules
above so should be able to provide us with valuable insight without
being an annoying source of build failures.

 ## Limitations or "I thought the whole point of this was for us to
   add type declarations to the code"?

Now we get to the more unfortunate part of the news: I think that for
now we don't have great options for doing this.

Sorbet type annotations are supposed to be inline with the code, and
work through the [`sorbet-runtime`]
(https://rubygems.org/gems/sorbet-runtime) gem.

Unfortunately, as described on
<https://sorbet.org/docs/faq#what-platforms-does-sorbet-support>:
> The sorbet-runtime gem is currently only tested on Ruby 2.6 and Ruby
  2.7. It is known to not support Ruby 2.4. Feel free to report runtime
  issues for any current or future Ruby version.

Thus, since we still want to support Ruby 2.1, that doesn't quite work
for us. I thought we could perhaps have an empty replacement of the
sorbet runtime gem, and it turns out that [Shopify already tried and
abandoned it](https://github.com/Shopify/sorbet-runtime-stub). So,
inline annotations seem to be out for us.

For Sorbet, that leaves us with only one other option: `.rbi` files.
These are files that allow Sorbet to get type information for otherwise
untyped code, and are the solution to having type information for many
common libraries.

Unfortunately, using `.rbi` files for our own code is very error-prone,
because Sorbet trusts `.rbi` files, and doesn't check them against the
code. Thus, if we had a class `A` with method `m` declared both on our
code, as well as on an `.rbi` file, and then we renamed `m` to `n` and
forgot to update the `.rbi`, then Sorbet would not complain about it.
Worse, if somewhere there was a call to `A#m` somewhere in the code,
Sorbet would still think it was correct, while in reality it would
break at run-time.

 ## The future?

Because our usage of Sorbet is rather simple, we can at any point
switch to Steep, or any other tool, or just disable it, if it's not
providing value. So we are not locked at all into its usage.

Hopefully in the near future we'll find a way to add type declarations
to our library without impact to our support matrix of older Rubies.

Even better, we could then ship those types to our customers, for them
to check that they are using ddtrace APIs correctly!

Changes & additions with remarks for Yogi, until Object built-in methods

I added a horizontal line to divide this section from Part 1. It is so much information that I think this will help when they have to scroll up and down.

I think it would be useful to tell them why the oops.js file is called like that. They do not know about OOP. If we do not discuss OOP in this project, then maybe change the name of this file to objectScript.js or something like that.

Do they know how to run code with the node command already? I cannot remember ;-). The previous part is run with LiveServer, I think.

The sentence "This is in contrast to objects instantiated from classes, which we'll look at later on." in Object Basics will have to be changed or taken out once we decide where we put classes.

In Dot notation this sentence: "The object name (in this case person) acts as the namespace" is not clear to me and I wonder if the students will understand it.

Last sentence in Dot notation: "Otherwise your methods will no longer work." I have added "Why do you think this is necessary?" because I think it would help them to think about the logic themselves and come up with the reason why it would not work.

Bracket notation: I think we should explain why sometimes you can only use bracket notation. It is added as a Note to Setting object members (last line) but I think it is not just a note, it is important enough to discuss it here because it can lead to a lot of confusion and mistakes.

Setting object members: I may have a dirty mind, but using the name 'Cratchit' must be a joke, no??

The section on "this" can be removed if we move OOP to the other project. We have to check in this entire project if we move OOP, because it comes back in several places.

I have finally been able to figure out my splashes! Yaygit add .  Really happy with my progress today, I feel that I have accomplishd what I wanted and I am happy with where my game is currently at. I have the game completed to the standard that I had planned. I still have some time this evening so my plan is to play around with audio and potentially add audio to the paint splashes. I also do have a couple of bugs- if I run my game on for two long the paintbrushes seem to go funny and have a break in them (this is after say 10 minutes or so of the game running) I also have noticed that sometimes when the window reloads it sometimes can be a bit slow. I have managed to complete the splashes, making my paintbrushes sit on top of everything and also set up a winning page and instructions using a class of no-show. I intend to have a play at editing my alert button when you loose

Lag compensated packet based potion effect tracking

I went through all this damn effort to support horses etc. but yet Mojang's brilliant programming doesn't support sending potion effects for vehicle riding.  Oh well, at least plugins can still send these packets and maybe eventually mojang will learn the art of sending packets to the client.  Likely broken since 1.9 when riding became client sided, which client sided vehicles was such a big mistake.  Now I have to deal with shitty code all around with vehicles.  Vehicles are hacky netcode on top of hacky netcode.  The code is not pretty.  So many desync's on Mojang's end making them practically impossible to ever ban for or check without falses.  Notice when boats randomly fall though the floor?  Yeah, if you did that without a vehicle that's a ban.  But with vehicles, that's just normal.  At least in 1.17 jumping on top of boats is less glitchy than before.  Only took Mojang a few years to fix that.  Go ahead and ride a strider into a lava fall, with the center not touching lava.  There you get animation affecting movement!  Likely, as I can't figure out what the client is doing.  How do we even check that?  We don't get send the vehicle's onGround status, we don't know animation position, but at least we know inputs.  Well, sort of, because if you switch between inventory slots fast enough, even vanilla can't handle the control of the vehicle transitioning from client to server sided repeatedly.  Overall, vehicles suck.  Nice one Mojang.

Looking closer at the problem, it looks like a classic dangling pointer
bug. The 'struct mmc_blk_data' that is used after being freed in
mmc_blk_put() is stashed away in 'md->disk->private_data' via
mmc_blk_alloc_req() but used in mmc_blk_get() because the 'usage' count
isn't properly aligned with the lifetime of the pointer. You'd expect
the 'usage' member to be in sync with the kfree(), and it mostly is,
except that mmc_blk_get() needs to dereference the potentially freed
memory storage for the 'struct mmc_blk_data' stashed away in the
private_data member to look at 'usage' before it actually figures out if
it wants to consider it a valid pointer or not. That's not going to work
if the freed memory has been overwritten by something else after the
free, and KASAN rightly complains here.

To fix the immediate problem, let's set the private_data member to NULL
in mmc_blk_put() so that mmc_blk_get() can consider the object "on the
way out" if the pointer is NULL and not even try to look at 'usage' if
the object isn't going to be around much longer. With that set to NULL
on the last mmc_blk_put(), optimize the get path further and use a kref
underneath the 'open_lock' mutex to only up the reference count if it's
non-zero, i.e.  alive, and otherwise make mmc_blk_get() return NULL,
without actually testing the reference count if we're in the process of
removing the object from the system.

Finally, tighten the locking region on the put side to only be around
the parts that are removing the 'mmc_blk_data' from the system and
publishing that fact to the gendisk and then drop the lock as soon as we
can to avoid holding the lock around code that doesn't need it. This
fixes the KASAN issue.

Blood Troll Flavorization

- Changed female blood troll title from Matriarch to Grand Ma'da.
- Disabled title from male holders since it's a matriarchal society.
