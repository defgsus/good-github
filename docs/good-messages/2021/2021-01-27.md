ML3M Rebalancing

Originally, the ML3M was intended to be a little bit stronger. The healing values for the Brute, Burn, Omni, Toxin, and Antirad cells, have been adjusted according to what was initially planned. 
Base Tier's now heal 10 per shot, for a total of 40 damage healed, up from 20.
Second Tier's now heal 20, instead of 10.
Third Tier's heal 40, instead of 20. 

Omni 1 heals 5's for brute, burn, and toxin, and 30 for oxy, up from half those values. Omni 2, is 10's and 60, and Omni 3 is 20's and 120. 

Antirad Cell had its toxin heal bumped up from 2.5 to 5, and its radiation-heal from 150, to 350. I wasn't originally going to touch this one, but the text said "It's 150 because that's equal to five units of arithrazine", and... it wasn't. So, I bumped it up to actually be equal to 5u of Arithrazine's worth of radiation healing.

Stabilizer Cell, CorpseMend, Resistance, Haste, and the size-changing cells, were not touched.
The reasons for this are as follows:

- The healing laser was simply not strong enough to ever tend to more than one patient. Healing 20-40 damage per cell just isn't enough, even if you had several clips full of cells, it just wasn't viable.
- As a result of this, it was seldom if ever used. Field Medics rarely if ever took it with them. In nearly every round I've played, it was left exactly where it was spawned, collecting dust. 
- I'd like to make it a more proper treatment option. It wouldn't be equal to reagents used in your usual Medbay setting, or surgical repair, but if it's modified to actually fulfill its niche as a rapid, contact-free treatment option, it could be relied on more by Field Medics. There is so much potential for this device as an "in the field" healing tool, and I'd like to see it done well. We have no shortage of people who would like to see non-chemical-based treatment options. We might as well make it useful enough to actually use.

Here are a few issues people brought up in Discord when I floated this idea.
"But, Tempest, you're doubling everything? That's a huge change! Won't this result in the ML3M overshadowing other treatment options?"
Certainly not. Currently, with tier-2 cells that only heal up to 40 damage, this is actually worse than basic first-aid in terms of raw healing ability, as the cutoff for first aid healing is 50 damage on a limb. First aid and reagents will still be the most convenient, most readily available, and overall most-used manner of treatment for injuries that can be treated using those methods. All this change would do is allow the ML3M to also have its uses, and stop being overshadowed by everything else. 

"Okay, but what if it DOES actually become The New Meta and becomes the favored tool for healing?"
I wouldn't see it as an issue if Chemistry gets dethroned, in all honesty. They'd both take quite a bit of prep-work to use. You have to make multiples of every chem if you want a solid stock, and you'd need multiples of every cell if you want proper coverage and healing-ability, since even with these changes you're expending 1-3 cells per patient. And, unless you get multiple ML3M's made, only folks who are gonna have one are the CMO, and whoever nabs the spawned one first. 

"But wouldn't this result in less departmental cooperation between Medical and Science now that Medical will require fewer cells?"
Most likely, no. If anything, I'd think there would be an increase, round-to-round, if this becomes a more viable and wanted tool, more people will ask for cells. Personally, my list of requested cells would stay the same, but I'd be sending that request in more often since I know it'll actually be useful rather than having it just to have it. Tier 2 cells are still going to be desirable, and I'm still probably not going to order Tier 3's because of the cost, but that's just me. It's still going to be incredibly weak at roundstart, and better cells will be that much nicer to obtain.

"But Tempest! If you get the highest tiers of cells, and a lot of them, you could fix anything that doesn't require surgery!"
Well, if Science had the time and mats, then sure, you could gather up a large enough collection of cells, and you probably could indeed do this for one or two badly injured patients... ... ...and I could accomplish the same goal if I'm given 20 seconds in a chem-lab. The ML3M is more costly to use, the cells cost resources, have to be recharged after 4 shots, and you only start with a base tier Burn, Brute, and Stabilizer cell. Each shot from a base level burn/brute cell is the equivalent of 1.25u of bicaridine or kelotane. This change would make it 2.5. Base level cells are still going to be next to useless for anything other than the most minor of injuries. Chemistry will still be the dominating powerhouse it always has been, but at least you can use this tool, provided the PR goes through, instead, more often.

"Tempest, this thing just wasn't intended to be used to fully heal people..."
A couple people have said this, and to be honest, it's silly. In our medical system, there's very little distinction between what can "heal a little bit" and what can "heal fully", because it all comes down to the fact that everything works off of damage values. If Option A heals 5 damage, and Option B heals 50... Both are capable of "healing fully" if you have enough Option A, it's just a question as to whether or not that's practical. Currently, the ML3M's healing values can't really even be used to even partially heal injuries, unless you have a large number of cells. You'd expend all of your charges on one patient and then you've got a paperweight taking up storage space until you can get to a recharger. 

Now, as for issues that I personally see? Biggest one is probably the Toxin cell. If I remlember correctly, the base Toxin cell is the same tech requirement as the Second Tier Brute/Burn cells. This PR doesn't fix that, and I don't really see it as a huge priority since I don't think anyone uses the toxin cells as it is, but yeah. Might need to be fixed at some point if this PR goes through.

And, absolute worst case scenario, let's say that this PR screws everything up, turns the Tether upside down, and now Medbay is dominated by a bunch of blue laser beams flying everywhere like it's the new Star Wars Trilogy (but actually better because those movies kinda set a low bar)... this PR was really easy to do. The only long part about it was typing all of this up. We can just bump the numbers down if this ends up sucking really bad, ezpz.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

test(pho): new big index ((1541))

Discussion: Before the massive disintegration of our big ball of work
into separate patch/steps, we had a full new rewrite of “big index”
that took in to account the hierarchical container type… But some time
between finishing that and a few days ago, we realized that SSGs would
need more from the big index to decide whether they can generate
a markdown from them; and also something important (order) was missing
by merely determining what the documents were in the collection.

During a run in fact, we developed this idea of the “document depth
range”. If we were targeting sphinx, or some big book or something,
we could have documents at different *depths*: “chapters” (say) might
not just all be a flat list of documents: they might be broken up into
sections and subsections and so on. (Also, we probably wouldn’t have
the idea of “documents” so much as sections with automatic pagination, 
but ignore that for now.)

Axiomatically, we say that if you’re holding a node and that node *is*
a document; then it *has* a document depth of zero. (The number acts
sort of like an offset in an array: If i’m *at* the current document,
how much depth do I have to add to get down to a document? In the case
when you’re already *at* a document, the amount is zero.)

So if you were holding a “chapter” node, and that chapter was just a
flat list of documents, the document depth would be *one*.

If the chapter was broken up in to sections (but not subsections); the
document depth would be two, and so on, but we don’t just stop there:
It’s entirely common for some sections to have sub-sections (and maybe
sub-sub sections and so on) but not others. This is where we derive
the idea of a document depth *range*. (We call it a “minmax” in the
code, out of deference to RPG videogames.)

We’re going to dump more documentation sketches her that we decided
not to fold into the main body documentation. But before we do,
we want to mention that we spent a whole day just on writing the
pseudocode for this, this one local maxima of a mountain, then a full
few hours writing the new asset (a second rewrite (the first never to
be committed)), and a full day on tests, and one test in particular
realized a gaping hole in our algorithm (explained in a case) which
we then covered in asset.

As for the data model and the big index narrative:

We *think* what happened was, in the original data model, the only thing
we knew we wanted for sure at first was that notecards had a `prev` and
a `next` (to accord with the rough GUI sketch in the README).

Although internally we could have modeled this as only a singly-linked
list and derived the other relationship from the one (e.g. determine
every "next" by seeing every "previous"), this would have required
either some on-disk derived index or taking a big index of the collection
on every read of one entity; both of which are not KISS-compatible.

As such, every entity has both a `prev` and `next` field.

One the GUI matured, the time came to allow entities to have parent
child relationships. At first, it seems, there was no `children` field,
just `parent`, because somewhere at one point there was this idea
that children did not have a sense of order intrinsic in the model.

But the main point is, children *do* have order in the datastore,
but still we have a `prev`/`next` coexisting with parent/child in
a way we never really understood until this last swath of work:
The short of it is, the two associations are redundant but we take
steps to enforce that you only use one or the other or a particular
combination of both.

In the New Way, big-indexing is still mainly to answer the question
"what are all the documents in this collection?" but it has gotten more
powerful and complicated: documents now get their order and structural
relationship from the notecard relationships just like was always
intended. Documents can be deeply nested within what we call a
"node tree". (We may call it a "document tree" if it has documents in
it.) Probably the only rule here (beyond basic data integrity stuff
around ordered trees, no cycles and so on) IS, you can't put a document
inside another document. Otherwise you have freedom (for now) to
nest documents arbitrarily deeply within “document nodes” and then 
(for now, and/or sort of) you can nest nodes arbitrarily deeply within
documents. (There *is* a hard-coded limit of 6 somewhere for good
reason, but in theory we could go deeper.)

So for example you may group your documents in to chapters but also
break each chapter in to sections and so on. You may decide you want
sub-sections and so on. There are no rules here with how deep your
hierarchy goes, or whether the depth needs to be consistent across
the collection or otherwise.

Finally, it’s the SSG adapter that gets to decide whether they can
handle any given document tree with some given document depth range…

  01-24 09:05  begin think about requirements for new big index
               and what test cases
        11:47  done editing and rewriting and re-housing documentation.
               begin to write one massive god case
        12:06  finished very rough sketch of all our tests in 1 big case
        13:53  we have the old new index working on the big crazy new
               fake graph and it's amazing. now we have to make the new
               new big index
  01-25 21:27  making the big index of the single node tree was so
               satisfying we flung off in to space and went running
        21:45  start big index of whole collection
        23:29  ok wow the big index of the whole collection passed
               rough draft except we aren't exercising built hash
  01-26 22:33  begin assemble commit

Ditch `shlex` in favor of our own shell split

Added `ZeroBot.util.shellish_split`, a shell split tailored to ZeroBot's
needs. `shlex` did too many things that ended up not being a good fit
for ZeroBot commands:
    - It naturally escapes all escaped characters, but some ZeroBot
      commands (like `quote add`) need to be able to interpret these on
      their own.
    - There was no way to escape only *some* sequences; it was all or
      nothing.
    - Single-quotes are treated as substrings as well, but apostrophes
      are very common in chat; having to escape them would result in
      a miserable and frustrating user experience.

It's very likely not the best or fastest implementation, but it will
only be run once per command, so it's not a huge deal.
