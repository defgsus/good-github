[feature] windows: try to collect all the necessary DLLs automagically

This shit is beyond a fucking hack, but windows needs it; so I'm keeping
it.

This serves as a warning for people starting projects in C:
Please use something else (rust's cargo, zig's build.zig... anything
else)

	Set cheat's default endianness to that preferred by the system being emulated when manually adding a cheat that's not
	a cheat device code nor the result of a cheat search.
September 15, 2017:
	SS: Fixed SCU DSP DMA from B-bus; fixes the periodic loud popping in Grandia's FMV.
September 12, 2017:
	SS: Added a hack/kludge to allow bypassing of data cache on reads(such that the timing benefits of partial cache emulation are preserved, without cache
	coherency problems that partial cache emulation sometimes leads to with poorly programmed games), and added an internal database to enable it on select games;
	fixes graphical glitches and/or hangs in "Area 51 (USA and Europe)", "Clockwork Knight 2 (USA)", "DeJig - Lassen Art Collection", "Father Christmas",
	"Golden Axe The Duel", "Sega Saturn Choice Cuts", "Spot Goes to Hollywood (USA and Japan)", "Street Fighter Zero", "Street Fighter Zero 3",
	"Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo", and "Virtual Volleyball".
	SS: Full cache emulation is now enabled for "Whizz"(by using an internal database), to resolve(or at least reduce) quasi-random hanging issues during startup.
September 11, 2017:
	SS: Corrected an inaccuracy with CDB play repeat handling; fixes hang when trying to resume a suspended game in "Tactics Ogre".
	SS: Initialize VDP1 clipping and local coordinate registers only on power-on, and not on reset.
September 7, 2017:
	SS: Fixed side-effect inaccuracies in the CDB Put Sector Data, Copy Sector Data, and Move Sector Data command emulation.

Removes "Singularity and Tesla for Dummies" manual book (#62308)

This PR removes the manual "Singularity and Tesla for Dummies" from the game. It also removes it from the two places it spawns: Engineering in DeltaStation and an Ice Ruin.
Also this is my first PR and I have little experience with DM so please be nice
Why It's Good For The Game

The Singularity and Tesla engines were removed from the game a while ago, so having these books in game is unnessessary
Also, opening the book shows a huge-ass "Tesla and singularity engines have been removed!" message front and center.

day6

spent a bit more time than I needed to in part 2 because I had some
off-by-one errors in my array indexing. also wasted some time in part 1
overcomplicating things and keeping track of the "age" of each fish in a
tuple (thinking that the cycle would go down as the fish agest), but
nope, that wasn't neccessary at all. reading is hard yo.

all that said, my excuse is that I had just been out to dinner with
friends, and may or may not have had a couple of beers, sooo I don't
blame myself too much tonight.

also, those leaderboard times are just obscenely fast, and I suspect I
wouldn't have had a max score regardless lol.

Launcher3: Restart with change only on exit

This change allow the user to change everything they have to inside the
homescreen activity and only restart on exit. Previously this was a pain
in the fucking ass because you had to go in and set each option one by one
with a restart inbetween. At least now is not that big of a pain.

- Restart on destroy (hitting the back button, actionbar arrow)
- Restart when a chance is made and the home button is pressed

** Thanks "Jack" for code to detect home button
https://stackoverflow.com/a/27956263

- Cleaned up restart code

eyosen adapted to 10

Problem Statement:

Solving this problem will help you to gain a basic understanding of the HR industry and also how analytics and data science are applied in practice in this domain.

A brief understanding of the HR industry:

Human resources (HR) is the division of an organization that is responsible for finding, screening, recruiting, and training job applicants, and administering employee-benefit programs.

This management is the strategic approach to the efficient management of people in any organization in a way that can help their business gain a competitive advantage. It is designed to improve employee performance in service of an employer's strategic objectives.

Understanding the Problem Statement:

In this project, you will have to put yourself in the shoes of an HR analytics expert and by leveraging the data provided, you are supposed to identify how salary is varying with respect to other considerable factors.

The dataset should be divided into test and train and you would have to use the training data to build the model and thereby apply it to test data to measure the performance and robustness of the model.

General steps to be followed and tentative timelines:

1. Understand the problem statement: 1 hour
2. Understand the data, make a valid business sense and write about it: 4 hours
3. Data analysis and interpretations: 4 hours
4. Data Cleaning and justification: 5 hours
5. Feature engineering(If needed): 4 hours
6. Model building: 5 hours
7. (Justify why are you choosing a particular technique over others)
8. Cross-validation, performance check, and its explanation: 4 hours
9. Rework on different models, if needed: 4 hours
10. Visual interpretation: 2 hours
11. Results and Recommendations: 2 hours

Steps to be performed for successful completion of capstone project:

1. Understand the data set - Feature description provided below.
2. Check the number of variables that are normally distributed & explain
3. Find out the correlation between variables using spearman rank correlation & explain
4. Examine the relationship between categorical variables and the dependent variable & explain
5. Clean and pre-process the data with other operations required, like, missing values, handling outliers, etc. as and when necessary & explain
6. Apply ML algorithm to the pre-processed columns and find out, which of these algorithms is best suitable for the same & explain
Briefly write your inference for every step, justifying the logic for the same.


Feature Description:

1. Gender - talks of the gender - Male or female
2. Business - if the person has a business or no
3. Age - age of the person
4. Salary - CTC of the employee
5. Dependants - number of people dependant on the person
6. Months - duration of the person employed with the company
7. Calls - if the person has authority to make calls or not
8. Type - salary settlement type
9. Billing - Subscribed to billing plans or no
10. Unit sales - unit sale made by the person
11. Total sales - total sales made by the person
12. Rating - If he has been given a rating by a superior or no
13. Bonus - amount received by a person as a bonus for sales
14. Base pay - Base pay of the employee
15. Unit price - The Unit price of a sale
16. Volume - volume allotted to a person
17. Opening balance - The opening balance of an employee
18. Low - lowest balance allotted to a person.
19. Closing Balance- The closing balance of an employee
20. Education- Educational background of an employee

Grading system:
The final submission should have the following components:

1. All codes (properly documented) - 10%
2. The code explains what and why they did in each step.
- Steps 3 to 5: 30%
- Steps 6 to 7: 30%
- Step 8 to 10: 30%

How are you contributing to the organization?
Based on your inputs the hiring manager would understand how different features considered are affecting the salary component. This analysis can greatly help in making huge structural changes to the financial wing of the HR department

To call ginkgo,gomega indirect would be putting things lightly. A combination of an indirect testing library and long-running tests are a recipe for frustration. I've begun a process to remove ginkgo,gomega with a couple tests
that I had been looking at.

See #127

## Some benefits
* Before, we both had tests using normal testing,testify and also ginkgo,gomega. Now we only have way to write tests: testing,testify.
* testing,testify are more popular and easier to learn than ginkgo,gomega. testing is the standard library described in all golang books.  testify is a simple assertion library 10x more popular than gomega in terms of star count. Neither require learning BDD concepts.
* Before, our running of e2e tests was significantly different than our other non-gingko tests in the same project. It literally required compilation of a platform-specific binary named 'e2e', adding a lot of complexity to CI and local setup.
* Before, individual tests cannot be executed via normal means, such as Goland. Instead, you have to run the suite file. Now, you can execute and more importantly debug individual tests instead of via a suite wrapper.
* Before, writing tests not only required understanding of the subject, but also the ginkgo runtime. Otherwise, statements like `var _ = Describe("getenvoy extension init", func() {` seem pure magic.
* Before, the nature of test execution required a combination of understanding the go platform and also ginkgo
* Before, updating Ginkgo/gomega would skew the dependency tree, due to their dependencies on two protobuf libraries. Now, the test runtime does not interfere with main code.
* Before, the same test took more lines of code to achieve the same table test. Less code is less to maintain.
* Some other notes about migration off are captured in this issue https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/issues/1704

## Notable differences

Gomega had a different way of logging. For example instead of using a logging library, it would use statements like this:
`By("changing to the output directory")` which translate into output `STEP: changing to the output directory`. This is mainly to satisfy BDD idioms and is meant to be interpreted amongst the many lines of normal log output. For cases where the points inside the test should be logged, we should use normal logging instead. However, I don't recommend making log statements unless they are meaningful and clarify progress.

Also, those not used to it will notice use of normal go `defer` commands instead of the before/after test hooks used in tools like gomega. This can take getting used to, but it is also the same as normal go code, so shouldn't be time lost. There are some cases where multiple tear-down steps are needed and those steps are more visible now. That's not necessarily bad because these typically are also the most complex tests and have a lot going on. Seeing the various setup requirements shows problem areas that help knowing when debugging.

Fix ambigious phrasing (#927)

* Fix ambigious phrasing

I may just be idiotic, but I spent like 30 minutes trying to understand why a `.cirrus.yml` file wasn't magically appearing in my repository :smile: 
Make it so that it explcitly says that *you* should add the `.cirrus.yml` file, and not that it should have been created.

* Update docs/guide/quick-start.md

cheatmodified4.db (timestamp: 01/07/2014 6:24 PM)

We would have been travelling in the USA at this time/date, so timestamp must be wrong; I don't remember adding cheat database stuff then. I was obsessively enjoying Wagic: the Homebrew?! on my PSP as we travelled across the USA with friends and family. I spent my 19th birthday July 2014 with family in Tennessee. Hunted the MHP3rd Jhen Mohran while travelling across Salt Flats, Nevada. This commit adds MGS: Portable Ops (USA) cheats; some empty "SLOT 1/2/3/4" cheats with 0x00000000 were originally to be removed, but I have kept them just in case there is some arcane purpose. Revert MHFU USA 10-part HP code removal, and maintain name of "Ride Monster v2 (Hold L after attacking)" instead of my rename "Ride Monster (LT after ATK)"
