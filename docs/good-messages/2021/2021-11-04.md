[MIRROR] Adds two station traits: Ionic Stormfront and Radioactive Stormfront (#1274)

* Adds two station traits: Ionic Stormfront and Radioactive Stormfront (#62366)

This PR adds two station traits. Ionic Stormfront and Radioactive Stormfront.

Ionic Stormfront doubles the weight of the ion storm event.
Radioactive Stormfront slightly increases the weight of the radiation storm event (1.5x) and allows multiple radiation storms to occur during a round (+2 max occurrences).
Both are relatively uncommon traits to roll.
Given a lot of random events are occurrences of "nature", (storms, anomalies, meteor showers, etc), I think it makes sense and has decent flavor that occasionally your station may experience certain events more often.

Maybe the station is located in an anomalous region of space and anomalies are coming outta the walls. Maybe it's located in an asteroid belt and meteors pelt the exterior constantly. Who knows! For now, I went with two existing "weather" phenomenon that hit the station, rad and ion storms. Ion storms are usually funny and add variety to silicon players, and radiation storms are neat for antaggy potential but kinda uncommon.

  ### Guix Introduction

  This PR enables building bitcoin in Guix containers. [Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Features.html) is a transactional package manager much like Nix, but unlike Nix, it has more of a focus on [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html) and [reproducibility](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/tags/reproducible-builds/) which are attractive for security-sensitive projects like bitcoin.

  ### Guix Build Walkthrough

  Please read the `README.md`.

  [Old instructions no. 3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-493827011)

  [Old instructions no. 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-471658439)

  <details>
  <summary>Old instructions no. 1</summary>
  In this PR, we define a Guix [manifest](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-package.html#profile_002dmanifest) in `contrib/guix/manifest.scm`, which declares what packages we want in our environment.

  We can then invoke
  ```
  guix environment --manifest=contrib/guix/manifest.scm --container --pure --no-grafts --no-substitutes
  ```
  To have Guix:
  1. Build an environment containing the packages we defined in our `contrib/guix/manifest.scm` manifest from the Guix bootstrap binaries (see [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html) for more details).
  2. Start a container with that environment that has no network access, and no access to the host's filesystem except to the `pwd` that it was started in.
  3. Drop you into a shell in that container.

  > Note: if you don't want to wait hours for Guix to build the entire world from scratch, you can eliminate the `--no-substitutes` option to have Guix download from available binary sources. Note that this convenience doesn't necessarily compromise your security, as you can check that a package was built correctly after the fact using `guix build --check <packagename>`

  Therefore, we can perform a build of bitcoin much like in Gitian by invoking the following:

  ```
  make -C depends -j"$(nproc)" download && \
      cat contrib/guix/build.sh | guix environment --manifest=contrib/guix/manifest.scm --container --pure --no-grafts --no-substitutes
  ```

  We don't include `make -C depends -j"$(nproc)" download` inside `contrib/guix/build.sh` because `contrib/guix/build.sh` is run inside the container, which has no network access (which is a good thing).
  </details>

  ### Rationale

  I believe that this represents a substantial improvement for the "supply chain security" of bitcoin because:

  1. We no longer have to rely on Ubuntu for our build environment for our releases ([oh the horror](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/72bd4ab867e3be0d8410403d9641c08288d343e3/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml#L10)), because Guix builds everything about the container, we can perform this on almost any Linux distro/system.
  2. It is now much easier to determine what trusted binaries are in our supply chain, and even make a nice visualization! (see [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html)).
  3. There is active effort among Guix folks to minimize the number of trusted binaries even further. OriansJ's [stage0](https://github.com/oriansj/stage0), and janneke's [Mes](https://www.gnu.org/software/mes/) all aim to achieve [reduced binary boostrap](http://joyofsource.com/reduced-binary-seed-bootstrap.html) for Guix. In fact, I believe if OriansJ gets his way, we will end up some day with only a single trusted binary: hex0 (a ~500 byte self-hosting hex assembler).

  ### Steps to Completion

  - [x] Successfully build bitcoin inside the Guix environment
  - [x] Make `check-symbols` pass
  - [x] Do the above but without nasty hacks
  - [x] Solve some of the more innocuous hacks
  - [ ] Make it cross-compile (HELP WANTED HERE)
    - [x] Linux
      - [x] x86_64-linux-gnu
      - [x] i686-linux-gnu
      - [x] aarch64-linux-gnu
      - [x] arm-linux-gnueabihf
      - [x] riscv64-linux-gnu
    - [ ] OS X
      - [ ] x86_64-apple-darwin14
    - [ ] Windows
      - [ ] x86_64-w64-mingw32
  - [ ] Maybe make importer for depends syntax
  - [ ] Document build process for future releases
  - [ ] Extra: Pin the revision of Guix that we build with with Guix [inferiors](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Inferiors.html)

  As of now, the command described above to perform a build of bitcoin a lot like Gitian works, but fails at the `check-symbols` stage. This is because a few dynamic libraries are linked in that shouldn't be.

  Here's what `ldd src/bitcoind` looks like when built in a Guix container:
  ```
  	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcc2d90000)
  	libdl.so.2 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fb7eda09000)
  	librt.so.1 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007fb7ed9ff000)

  	libpthread.so.0 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fb7ed85b000)

  ```

  And here's what it looks in one of our releases:
  ```

  ```

  ~~I suspect it is because my script does not apply the gitian-input patches [described in the release process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md#fetch-and-create-inputs-first-time-or-when-dependency-versions-change) but there is no description as to how these patches are applied.~~ It might also be something else entirely.

  Edit: It is something else. It appears that the gitian inputs are only used by [`gitian-win-signer.yml`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d6e700e40f861ddd6743f4d13f0d6f6bc19093c2/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml#L14)
  </details>

  ### How to Help

  1. Install Guix on your distro either [from source](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) or perform a [binary installation](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html#Binary-Installation)

ahead-behind: do not die when we see no INTERESTING pending object

We currently die if we are fed an ahead/behind with zero
objects (`foo..foo` in the most basic case, but in practice
something like `foo@{upstream}..foo`, when `foo` has just
been merged).  The problem is that we let
`handle_revision_arg` parse it, and then pick the pieces out
of the pending object list. So "^foo" looks no different to
us there than "foo".

This patch hacks around it by picking up the UNINTERESTING
object in that case. However, this isn't great because:

  1. Now we won't notice some types of bogus input.

  2. We end up reporting the name of the UNINTERESTING object.

We probably should pick apart the ".." ourselves, or even
just change it to ":" or whitespace.

"11am. > The parcel is expected to be delivered during the day.

Sweet, I did not expect it would be this soon. I only just now.

I'll start soon.

The order originally said between 3.11 and 5.11. I thought that might have been a lie, but it was not.

11:05am. Nevermind that for now. I am a bit excited, but let me spend my energy on sculpting instead.

11:10am. Did the initial bit. Now let me put up the reference.

11:20am. I've got the front, sides and back set up. Now I can start. Let me hash out the initial shape.

12:20pm. I am reviewing. I got the shape down, but it has a very stocky feel. Not necessarily old housewife stocky, but something like that bug judo girl from Hagure Idol stocky.

https://youtu.be/VzMAh66ofq0?t=27

When you look at Flycat's legs, they feel very lithe.

12:40pm. Let stop here for the morning.

I think the upper half of the lgs is actually passable. It is not as good at Flycat's and feels a tad bulky, but it is fine.

The feeling of stockiness only really hits me once I zoom out and take in what is below the knee.

12:45pm. I am just wasting time. Let me eat and do the chores."

drm/i915: Reject planar formats when doing async flips

Async flips are only capable of changing PLANE_SURF, hence we
they can't easily be used with planar formats.

Older platforms could require updating AUX_DIST as well, which
is not possible. We'd have to make sure AUX_DIST doesn't change
before allowing the async flip through. If we could get async
flips with CCS then that might be interesting, but since the hw
doesn't allow async flips with CCS I don't see much point in
allowing this for planar formats either. No one renders their
game content in YUV anyway.

icl+ could in theory do this I suppose since each color plane
has its own PLANE_SURF register, but I don't know if there is
some magic to guarantee that both the Y and UV plane would
async flip synchronously if you will. Ie. beyond just a clean
tear we'd potentially get some kind of weird tear with some
random mix of luma and chroma from the old and new frames.

So let's just say no to async flips when scanning out planar
formats.

"2:25pm. Done with breakfast and chores.

Let me get back into it. I need to figure this out.

2:30pm. My view was that the legs are too stumpy. On a whim I tried dragging the hell down, and lo and behold, the model went up a point in attractiveness.

2:35pm. Right now I am thinking what to do. No doubt it is much better now, but it is not all the way there yet. The feet are too big.

2:40pm. Hrmmm, I have no idea what is wrong. The feet are obvious, but I get that the basic shape is not all the way there. The feminine curves are right, but it still lacks gracefullness.

3pm. I am messing with the calves and where the leg meets the foot. I shrunk the later a little and it looks less stocky now, but it is still not enough.

Right now, I am confused how to do the foot. I am going to have to watch how he does it because me mental model is too vague.

Let me take a break here first.

3:25pm. Let me resume. Let me see how he does the foot.

3:40pm. https://youtu.be/VzMAh66ofq0?t=457

Here he starts working on the foot. I got distracted by him working on the body.

3:55pm. Let me just say a few words about Bitcoin since its price action has been on my mind. Its price action over the past few months since the big break has been most impressive. This is enough for me to turn bullish on it given that it has gone above 60 and is holding there for over 2 weeks already. If I was trading I'd buy around 1/3rd here, and add another 1/3 every two weeks thereafter if is giving a strong showing. Something like 65 in two weeks and over 70 in another two.

I keep hoping for BTC to collapse so that GPU prices can finally get some relief, but it does not seem to be in the cards.

Well, it could always collapse from here on out, but if that was the case it would have slid off after the big break. BTC will go to zero at some point, but it will take a bit more than than the last break from 60 to 30 to crush it.

Forget that. Let me back to the foot.

4:20pm. https://youtu.be/VzMAh66ofq0?t=478

Fuck. He is using the smooth tool to shrink the toes, while I am trying to move vertices in edit mode like a dumbass.

4:45pm. I think I got the feet done. I am doing this mostly without looking at the reference, though my creative flow.

This is actually really good for my art skill. The only reason why I am as good at programming as I am is because I am able to enter the flow zone. And it seems I have no trouble doing that with Blender. If I dedicated myself to being a 3d artist, I could make it without no trouble.

Do - think - do - think. Art is much the same as programming. There is little difference. You have some high level model, and through the process of doing you refine it.

4:50pm. So far, the tablet still hasn't arrived. I guess it won't get here today. Yeah, the courier works from 9 to 5.

Nevermind, then it is either tomorrow or on Monday. Tomorrow most likely.

4:55pm. Let me think, what do I do next.

4:55pm. What I have now strikes me as being fairly decent. But hmmmmm...it does not trike me as being beautiful.

5pm. I do not understand why. The things are thick and everything else seems to have the right curves, but overall I keep thinking old woman. Well, it is not old at this point, I think if I sketched this as a 2d drawing and showed it to the old me, he would be suitably impressed, but it not enough.

5:10pm. Focus me, let me watch Flycat some more instead of just browsing Twitter.

https://youtu.be/VzMAh66ofq0?t=505

Compared to my foot, this is masterwork. Watching him is making me realize just how poor my own mental model is.

Right, the back of the foot, where the leg meets the foot was too thick. It is things like these why I have the impression of the body being fat. Since I've been doing it from imagination, no doubt there are various other aspects I got wrong throughout as well.

5:25pm. https://youtu.be/VzMAh66ofq0?t=541

The thing where he adjusts the shape here is magical.

Ok, I am sure of it now. My hips are too flat. Flycat's are peachy, while my own sort of sag.

5:35pm. Lunch time.

5:55pm. I have no idea. I want wrong in my comprehension somewhere.

Here the hips are round, but if I try to round out my own model's they start to stick out and the overall figure is ruined.

6:05pm. Ok, I get it. I am missing mass on the sides. But I am not sure if my fix was right. I get the sense that I did not get the waist right.

6:15pm. Forget it. I've been in the zone for way too long to bother doing this anymore. I am not going to get good at this in a day. Tomorrow, I'll watch Flycat's video again. I got the feeling that today I really improved my comprehension of the grab tool.

In order to grasp beauty, what I need is a complete comprehension of the body. Right now I still do not understand it well enough which is why I get confused as to what a foot looks like and why the model feels saggy. I have ways more to go. A few more months working on it frmo every angle and I think I'll grasp it.

Now that I've come this far with the lower half, I think that the next step would be to move to the full body mesh apart from the head.

6:25pm. I am getting more confident in my sculpting skills, but I still have ways to go. I haven't been doing this even for a full month yet. I think at this point I should be 3 weeks into it.

I am having a difficult time believing that what I am doing here is easier than learning to draw though. Once the tablet arrives I will be able to test that view.

There is no need to worry about the time wasted. It is not like the intelligence algos are here yet, I can take my time getting good at art. A few months of practice will completely transform my view of me lacking talent in this domain."

Update index.html

Added some text to help end users. It's a small but significant change to the UI that I think will make a big difference.

I have had CyberChef bookmarked for years and *every single time* I go to it I can't remember how it works. I click on Operations and click on this and click on that and for the life of me can't get it going. Many times I left without getting any results. 

I'm not a luddite, I'm a bit of a power user and even a web developer. IMHO, the small change I've made will help countless users. In fact, if implemented, I suggest you make a note in the website's analytics of the date you added this change; I think you'll see the number of users, and return users, start to go up significantly from that date.

P.S. You will probably also have to update the CSS:

    .title { white-space: nowrap; }
