New data: 2021-02-07: SEE ONTARIO DATA NOTES.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

Revise historical data: cases (AB, MB, ON, QC, SK). Vaccine distribution numbers have been updated retroactively as well.

2021-02-02: ONTARIO DATA REPORTING MAY HAVE UNUSUAL NUMBERS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. SEE BELOW. https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-ontario-is-responding-covid-19

“Toronto Public Health has now migrated all of their data to the provincial data system, CCM. This migration has impacted today’s daily counts. Most notably, TPH’s case count is negative following the identification of duplicate cases as well as data corrections to some fields (e.g., long-term care home residents and health care workers), resulting in an underestimation of today's cases. In addition, case counts for other PHUs may have been affected by system outages related to the migration. As a result, we anticipate fluctuations in case numbers over the next few days.”

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “The data also report 32 new deaths, and the total of deaths amounts to 10,031. Among these 32 deaths, 6 have occurred in the last 24 hours, 23 have occurred between January 31 and February 5, 2 have occurred before January 31 and 1 has occurred at an unknown date.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

Create CatBox95.user.css

i love catbox.moe but i hate everything about its design, down to the "put your link in here onii-chan xD incest is so quirky" shit. this user style is inspired by Windows 95, but more importantly, it minimizes catbox down to just the job its supposed to do.

An assortment of fixes that mostly aren't mine.

- Fixed a typo with Orion history file that was causing Juan Lebedev's son to spawn with no culture and a goofy haircut.
- Most religions were adjusted so that priests/rectors cannot inherit, as it was causing issues with inheritance. Neo-Socialist priests (:^)) retain the ability to inherit due to their structure of government.
- The NPC versions of Rectorates and Civil Governments are now limited to duke-tier and lower vassals. Makes tax/levy rates a bit finicky, but it does make playing a civil/rectorial vassal far less painful, and that's a higher priority than tax codes.
- Corrected the mismatched localisation tags for some hunting events and tooltips.
- Changed the Indo-Aryan culture group name because it was causing odd behaviour with vanilla loc.
- Defines were adjusted to make attrittion less murderous (credit to Orkazo)
- Mobsters can now build pirate harbours (credit to Cactorum)
- Faulty government trigger in lesser pirate republic was corrected (credit to Cactorum)
- Pirate republics may now build military worlds again (credit to Cactorum)
- The Council province conversion job finally, for real this time, works as intended. (credit to Cactorum)
- NPC Civil and Rectorial governments now use Open Elective as default (credit to Cactorum)
- Disabled the levy penalty from low Public Order. This will make sense later.
- I feel like there were other changes that I forgot about
Technically in a separate commit, but I'm putting it here anyway to notify the playerbase that these changes were made
- The two stray systems in the Helix Nebula are now vassals of the Terran Confederation again (credit to MacMonika)
- Vassal set-up in Novyy Edem was revised to strengthen the fleet, and by extension, Novyy Edem as a whole (credit to MacMonika)

- Note: I'll be adjusting my approach to commits going forward. Expect much more frequent, but smaller commits in the following days. We'll see how a different mentality affects output.

8bf plugins: successfully apply them to the active PD image

Holy shit, I think this feature might actually make it into production!  :scream_cat:

I'm just using a test menu for now, but I can successfully pass an image buffer to an arbitrary 8bf plugin, execute the plugin, then retrieve a modified image buffer back.

This is going much better than I expected!

Next up... honestly, I probably need to start work on an actual UI so I can test plugins more efficiently.

signing: major change to use app keys by default

We now use new application-specific keys and certificates for included apps
like Chromium / webview, Microg, and F-Droid, instead of relying on the
device-specific `releasekey`.  This allows us to share these keys between
multiple devices, push the same app updates to multiple devices, and remove an
ugly SELinux workaround for GrapheneOS that robotnix required.

Unfortunately, changing app keys will lose any data associated with those apps.
Fortunately, most data associated with those apps should be easy to re-create.
(Re-login to services in chromium, re-add F-Droid repos, etc.)
I hope to avoid breaking changes like this in the future by getting these
changes done relatively early in the projects' life.

If you've previously generated robotnix keys, you will need to do the
following to update to the new key directory layout: Move all keys and
certificates beginning with `com.android` (if they exist) from the
device subdir (e.g.  `crosshatch`) under your `keyStorePath` to the
parent directory. The files beginning with `releasekey`, `platform`,
`shared`, `media`, `networkstack`, and `avb`/`verity` (if you have it)
are device-specific, and should remain under the device subdirectory.
For example, I ran the following command on my machine:
 ```shell
$ mv /var/secrets/android-keys/crosshatch/com.android.* /var/secrets/android-keys/
 ```
After this, re-run `generateKeysScript` to create new application keys (e.g.
Chromium, F-Droid).

Add support for 'green' theme for PushButtons

Hey man, love your work!

Can I/We add support for a 'green' theme? Would be great for "Confirmation modals". You could also call it 'primary' or 'success'.

Backstory:
I'm primarily using your toast and modal package, and am currently looking to implement confirmation modals in certain places in my app. I want to use my own buttons (as I've already coded them) as much as possible, but for the modals I'm happy to go with the default tailwind button. Still, Indigo is not part of my color theme so I really need the 'green' theme :)

Replace mules with a cargo mech and rollerskates on Meta (#56489)

This PR replaces the two mulebots in the warehouse on Meta with a cargo
variant of the ripley and two pairs of rollerskates. The cargo variant
of the Ripley has only two maximum equipment slots, starts with 50
integrity, and a smaller power cell. A recharging station for the
hauler is available in cargo. (Apparently the station doesn't need a
computer to function).

Mulebots have historically been incredibly poor performing. They're
slow, unresponsive, clunky, and when they do work properly, they only
work in batches of one crate and require you to radio in that something
has been delivered. More often than not, since you aren't dealing with
people, your deliveries are left forgotten under plastic flaps in a
department. Most of the time, people either ignore the Mulebots and
leave them to gather dust in the corner or hack them to use them as
murder machines instead of for their primary purpose.

I've been hearing that people feel cargo techs don't have has much to
do during the shift as people would like, so I thought it would be a
good idea to give them some tools that will help them do their job in a
way that interacts with the crew. The rollerskates are a great way to
get around if you're hauling singular crates (and are kind of funny if
you think of the techies as busboys). The cargo hauler should make it
much easier to make batch deliveries personally and I've attempted to
minimize any abuses people may have with it by limiting its equipment
slots.

If the changes are well received, I think it would be cool to
eventually replace the cargo hauler with a forklift vehicle.

Create TownPreUnclaimCmdEvent, Relocate and extend Town(Pre)UnclaimEvents. (#4537)

* Move `Town(Pre)UnclaimEvent` to the `...events.town` package

- Deprecate at old locations with deprecation messages.
- Add cancellation messages to the TownPreUnclaimEvent
- Add a generic language string.
- Change TownyDatabaseHandler constructor from public to protected. We're in an abstract class, so only other package members can even access this.

In deprecated methods, the [VERSION] will need to be changed post-merge, as I have no idea when that could be.

* Create event to catch unclaim commands for war systems

- Creates WarPreUnclaimEvent
  - Cancellable
  - Default message from previous commit.
  - Event runs where FlagWar used to check if the town was under attack, or was attacked recently.
  - Usable by other war systems wishing to hook into it; it makes the town, resident, and TownyWorld available.
  - Accessible through  the war.common package.
- Creates TownyCommonListener in flagwar.listeners
  - Handles the WarPreUnclaimEvent with the previously mentioned executions.
  - May be refactored post-split, but intended to listen to any events in war.common.event package.
- Register TownyCommonListener within FlagWar (as opposed to Towny)

* Add a breaking return to TownyCommonListener

Prevent second if from overwriting the first's message.

* Re-pkg WarPreUnclaimEvent as TownPreUnclaimCmdEvent in `event.town` pkg.

Makes a bit more sense, when you think about it. It's capable of being called by more than just war plugins, and fragmenting events into separate packages within the same project is insane on it's own.

Added note to class Javadoc about potential confusion with TownyPreUnclaimEvent.

Thanks to @Silverwolfg11 and @LlmDl for discussing this and offering the suggestion.

* Add Javadocs to TownPreUnclaimCmdEvent's methods.

Just filling in documentation.

* Bump remaining language files to 0.93

I guess someone forgot to bump them? Adds relevant keys from this PR and https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/commit/b910e2b9b273d2eaf33ebc9163c57dde1569bc76

* Merge TownyCommonListener into FlagWarCustomListener

* Early return to removeTownBlock on catch. Implement Log4j2 I/O

Adds an early return if the TownBlock has no valid town.
Implements Log4J 2, replacing System.out.

* Annotate Nullable contract for getTown

See [Jetbrains Annotations: Nullable and NotNull](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/nullable-and-notnull-annotations.html#notnull)

* Remove a return in TDH#removeTownBlock(); add Nullable to TUE#getTown()

The town is allowed to be null, the TownPreUnclaimCmdEvent simply cancels itself if it is.

Prevent wand of enslavement from being used under sac love

Before this commit, despite being grayed out, this wand worked just
fine. The implementation, in order not to waste turns, just makes it
completely unevokable with sac love. For the sake of consistency I
applied this change to all evokers that are useless in this case. An
alternative for enslavement might be to prevent it in targeting, which
is how phantom mirror previously worked, but the present approach seemed
cleaner and wastes the players time less. It might also be good to make
a note in the item descriptions that they can't be used so this isn't
indicated only by inventory color.

In general, enslavement still works under other god conducts that
otherwise prevent some but not all summons. This probably could use some
thinking, because as NP7 pointed out in chat, it leads to confusing and
variable behavior e.g. for spellcasters enslaved under Trog. However, to
implement this without taking turns in the general case is a bit tricky.
