Fixes a fuck ton more harddels (#58779)

Redoes how geese handle eating shit, it was fucking stupid and caused harddels, and while this method is technically slower in the best case, it's a fucking goose
Fixes action related harddels, I hate how they work but at least this way they won't hold refs.
Fixes the hierophont causing its beacon to harddel
Removes the M variable from megafauna actions, it was used like a typed owner and caused harddels, so I burned it
Fixes target and targets_from harddels, replaces all setters of target with LoseTarget and GiveTarget, which should help maintain behavior. I'm not sure if this breaks anything, but if it does we should fix the assumptions that code makes instead of reverting this change
Fixes more area_senstive_contents related harddels, we need to allow the mob to move before clearing out its list.
Fixes marked object harddels (I'm coming for you admin team)
Fixes a language based human harddel
Fixes managed overlay related harddels (This was just emissive blockers, but I think this is a good safety net to have. If we clear the overlay list we should clear this one as well)
Fixes bot core harddels, I hate the fact that this exists but it has no reason to know who its owner is
Adds a walk(src, 0) to simple_animal destroy, it's the best bang for the buck in terms of stopping spurious harddels. Walk related harddels aren't that expensive in the first place, since byond does the same thing I'm doing here, but this makes finding mob harddels easier, so let's go with it

add a boxed CPU fallback kernel (#58065)

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/58065

This PR replaces the existing code-generated CPU fallback kernels that XLA uses with a single boxed CPU fallback.

Current state: there are a couple different design ideas that I want to point out, but the logic for the actually kernel is mostly done and passing tests.

### Design

To preface, I'm not 100% tied to the current design and I'm putting the PR up now for opinions and totally open to alternatives, some of which I listed below. Actually after writing this description, I'm leaning toward the following changes:
* Confirm whether or not we can remove all C++ logging info directly in the yaml.

**Current Design**

All of the CPU fallback codegen is deleted. In its place, XLA (and other external backends, later) can choose to opt into a CPU fallback by adding the following code in a C++ file. I have an corresponding [xla-side PR with the xla changes](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/pull/2945/files#diff-1a005c10039f0cb11130a3b740f5de716d2f10acaea121017016025861886798R1).

There's no actual requirement to split up the code into a .h and .cpp file, but that's necessary in the XLA case because they sometimes need to call the fallback directly from their handcrafted kernels.

```
// xla_cpu_fallback.h
#include <ATen/native/CPUFallback.h>
...
void xla_cpu_fallback(const c10::OperatorHandle& op, torch::jit::Stack* stack);
...
```
```
// xla_cpu_fallback.cpp
#include "torch_xla/csrc/aten_cpu_fallback.h"
...
void xla_cpu_fallback(const c10::OperatorHandle& op, torch::jit::Stack* stack) {
  // Do custom logging here
  ...
  // Call the actual boxed CPU fallback.
  at::native::cpu_fallback(op, stack);
}

TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL(_, XLA, m) {
  m.fallback(torch::CppFunction::makeFromBoxedFunction<&xla_cpu_fallback>());
}
```

Now that the fallback is exposed in the backend, they can call it directly. Doing so requires converting from an unboxed to a boxed context, which we provide a utility function before. E.g.:
```
#include <ATen/native/CPUFallback.h>

at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::native::call_fallback_fn<&xla_cpu_fallback, decltype(at::addmm)>::call("aten::addmm", self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```

That `decltype(at::addmm)` logic isn't actually used everywhere in the xla-side PR yet, since you hit issues with overloads. I could use it everywhere once #58092 lands.

**Alternatives: The API for calling the CPU fallback directly is ugly, can we make it nicer?**
We could change the api to use `at::redispatch`, which would make it look something like this:
```
at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::redispatch::addmm(c10::DispatchKeySet(c10::DispatchKey::CPUFallback), self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```
Which definitely feels cleaner, but also requires adding a new DispatchKey just for this use case. Conditionally calling the CPU fallback doesn't sound like a hugely important use case, so I don't know if giving up one of our 64 dispatch key slots is worth the API improvement. Totally open to other opinions though!

Another more mild improvement that would avoid having to pass operator string names (including overloads) around would be to codegen (yet another) namespaced API. Something like this:
```
at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::fallback::addmm<&xla_cpu_fallback>(self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```

Writing that out actually I actually like it more (I think it'll let us get rid of `decltype(...)`). Maybe that is nice enough to warrant a new codegen API - I haven't tried adding that yet, but if people like it I'm happy to try it out.

**More alternatives**
The current design also involves the backend manually writing and registering the boxed fallback themselves, but an alternative would be for us to do it in codegen too: they would just need to pass in all of the C++ logging that they want done in the fallback, directly through the yaml. The main downsides:
* Backend code that wants to call the fallback needs to abide by whatever convention our codegen uses to name the generated boxed fallback.
* Passing custom C++ logging through yaml is just more fragile: right now xla uses an `iostream` to log each tensor arg in the operator, so we'd have to either force other backends into the same convention or figure something else out later.

To be fair, we actually already do that: XLA has custom per-tensor-arg logging for all of the generated `out` wrappers in the codegen, which we do by passing their C++ logging info through the yaml. This seems unnecessary though, since `out` wrappers just call into a functional kernel, which is hand written with its own custom logging. So my take is: try to remove custom C++ logging from the yaml, and if it turns out to be really necessary, then we may as well take advantage of that to codegen the fallback.

### Performance impact

While ops that fall back to CPU aren't exactly hot path, we probably don't want to use a boxed fallback if it turns out to be an absolute perf killer.

I ran my benchmarks using callgrind, benchmarking both `at::add` and `at::add_out` run on XLA. My callgrind benchmark for `at::add` can be found here (the add_out benchmark looks basically the same): https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415418587. I created the benchmark by hacking the existing xla C++ test build scripts and throwing in a reference to callgrind.

I also attached the full callgrind output for each benchmark; the full output is actually pretty noise and hard to parse, but I focused on everything underneath the `at::add()` call in the output, which was much more stable. My guess is that it's due to some heavyweight async startup processing that xla does.

`at::add`:
before: 88,505,130 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415421001
after: 102,185,654 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415421273
delta: ~15.5% increase

`at::add_out`:
before: 63,897,395 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/intern/everpaste/?handle=GBrrKwtAPlix9wUEAOZtrFXpdO5UbsIXAAAz
after: 73,170,346 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415423227
delta: ~14.5% increase

High level takeaway: A framework overhead increase of 10-20% doesn't seem too horrible for the CPU fallback use case.

For structured, functional ops that requires a CPU fallback, we're actually in an unfortunate situation: we're doing even more work than necessary. Our codegen automatically creates a `CompositeExplicitAutograd` kernel which calls into the `out` operator. So the extra work that we end up doing is:
* An extra dispatcher hop: (at::add -> CompositeExplicitAutograd -> CPUFallback -> at::native::add) instead of (at::add -> CPUFallback -> at::native::add)
* An unnecessary tensor allocation (the CompositeExplicitAutograd kernel uses at::empty() to create an output tensor, which is immediately overwritten by the CPU fallback)
* An unnecessary meta() call (the CompositeExplicitAutograd kernel calls it to create the output tensor, but we call it again in the CPU kernel).
* unboxing->boxing->unboxing logic (this is the only strictly required piece)

There are definitely ways to avoid the unnecessary work explained above: one would be to give the boxed fallback higher priority than composite keys (there's [an issue for it here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/55104)), and codegen fallthroughs for all composite ops. It'll require more infra to set up, so I see it as more of a perf knob that we can apply if we need it later.

Unfortunately I couldn't dig much deeper into the differences aside from the aggregate change in instructions, since it looks like callgrind fudged some of the instruction attribution (`at::to_cpu` takes up a ton of instructions, but I don't see any attribution for the `at::native::add` kernel anywhere).

mm/slub.c: fix page->_count corruption (again)

Commit abca7c496584 ("mm: fix slab->page _count corruption when using
slub") notes that we can not _set_ a page->counters directly, except
when using a real double-cmpxchg.  Doing so can lose updates to
->_count.

That is an absolute rule:

        You may not *set* page->counters except via a cmpxchg.

Commit abca7c496584 fixed this for the folks who have the slub
cmpxchg_double code turned off at compile time, but it left the bad case
alone.  It can still be reached, and the same bug triggered in two
cases:

1. Turning on slub debugging at runtime, which is available on
   the distro kernels that I looked at.
2. On 64-bit CPUs with no CMPXCHG16B (some early AMD x86-64
   cpus, evidently)

There are at least 3 ways we could fix this:

1. Take all of the exising calls to cmpxchg_double_slab() and
   __cmpxchg_double_slab() and convert them to take an old, new
   and target 'struct page'.
2. Do (1), but with the newly-introduced 'slub_data'.
3. Do some magic inside the two cmpxchg...slab() functions to
   pull the counters out of new_counters and only set those
   fields in page->{inuse,frozen,objects}.

I've done (2) as well, but it's a bunch more code.  This patch is an
attempt at (3).  This was the most straightforward and foolproof way
that I could think to do this.

This would also technically allow us to get rid of the ugly

#if defined(CONFIG_HAVE_CMPXCHG_DOUBLE) && \
       defined(CONFIG_HAVE_ALIGNED_STRUCT_PAGE)

in 'struct page', but leaving it alone has the added benefit that
'counters' stays 'unsigned' instead of 'unsigned long', so all the
copies that the slub code does stay a bit smaller.

storage_service: Unregister disk error handlers on stop

Storage service install disk error handlers in constructor and these
connections are not unregistered. It's not a problem in real life,
because storage service is not stopped, but in some tests this can
lead to use-after-frees.

The sstables_datafile_test runs some of the testcases in cql_test_env
which starts and (!) stops the storage service. Other testcases are
run in a lightweight sstables_test_env which does not mess with the
storage service at all. Now, if a case of the 2nd kind is run after
the one of the 1st and (for whatever reason) generates a disk error
it will trigger use-after-free -- after the 1st testcase the storage
service disk error registration would remain, but the storage service
itself would already be stopped, thus triggering the disk error will
try to access stopped sharded storage service inside the .isolate().

The fix is to keep the scoped connection on the storage service list
of various listeners. On stop it will go away automagically.

tests: unit(dev), sstables_datafile_test with forced disk error

I went with the simple option - just open the Terminal with the default profile in the selected directory. I'd love to add another entry for "Open Terminal here with Profile...", but that's going to be follow-up work, once we sort out pulling the Terminal Settings into their own dll.

## References

  - We should add another entry to let the user select which profile
  - We should add the icon - I've got to do it in `dllname.dll,1` format, which is annoying.
  - These strings should be localized.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

This adds a COM class that implements `IExplorerCommand`, which is what lets us populate the context menu entry. We expose that type through a new DLL that is simply responsible for the shell extension, so that explorer doesn't need to load the entire Terminal just to populate that entry.

The COM class is tied to the application through some new entries in the manifest. The Clsid values are IMPORTANT - they must match the UUID of the implementation type. However, the `Verb` in the manifest didn't seem important.

Merge #21123: code style: Add EditorConfig file

7a135d57b2ac17477b25d5046a3bec57eac3ab30 Add EditorConfig file. (Kiminuo)

Pull request description:

  ### Motivation

  Developers are supposed to follow [Coding style](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-general). However, [from time to time](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21075#discussion_r570125634) a PR is created and then its author is asked to change tabs to spaces, for example.

  Introducing an `.editorconfig` file can mitigate these formatting issues.

  ### User story

  A contributor wants to create a new PR. She clones Bitcoin Core repo, opens her editor, the editor loads `.editorconfig` rules and writes her patch with correct formatting rules. Less Coding Style issues is then discovered in the PR review process and thus less CI runs are needed.

  ### What is EditorConfig file?

  https://editorconfig.org provides very well and concise explanation:

  > What is EditorConfig?

  > EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

  ### Support

  `.editorconfig` is supported by many IDEs and text editors. Sometimes, the support is out of the box and sometimes a plugin is needed. However, for example, VS Code detects `.editorconfig` presence and automatically offers you to install the missing plugin.

  See https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed for details on support. To name a few:

  * Visual Studio (out of the box)
  * VS Code (plugin)
  * JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, etc.) (out of the box)
  * Sublime Text (plugin)
  * Emacs (plugin)
  * Vim (plugin)

  Not supported (AFAIK):

  * [mcedit](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc)

  ### My editor does not support `.editorconfig`

  Then nothing really changes for you.

  ### `.editorconfig` vs `.clang-format`

  As explained [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clangformat-support-in-visual-studio-2017-15-7-preview-1/):

  > Note that Visual Studio also supports EditorConfig, which works in a similar way. ClangFormat, however, has a [much larger variety of style options](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) than EditorConfig, including some very C++ specific rules that can be set, and it is already used by C++ developers today.

  Having both `.editorconfig` and `.clang-format` in a project, may not always work correctly though, I think. As some editors may have a plugin for `.editorconfig` and a plugin for `clang-formatter` which may not work correctly in unison. In VS Code & Visual Studio EditorConfig [takes precedence over other settings](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/blob/master/docs/ide/cpp-editorconfig-properties.md#c-editorconfig-formatting-conventions).

  ### Possible issues

  Your editor may change formatting for some 3rd party library if you edit the code. A solution for this would be to make EditorConfig rules more specific (include only certain paths). I'm not sure if it is an issue in practice.

  ### Testing

  Add some trailing whitespace to a Python file and save the file. You should see that the trailing whitespace is removed.

  ### Possible future work

  It would be great to define rules for Makefiles. This would be good start:

  ```
  # Makefiles
  [Makefile,*.am]
  indent_style = tab
  trim_trailing_whitespace = true
  ```

  I don't know makefiles in this project good enough to propose something reasonable. If this PR is well received, it would be great to add it in this PR.

  Also, there are actually many different file extensions and so the proposed `.editorconfig` file can be probably improved very much:

  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse | % {$_.Extension.ToLower()} | sort | unique
  ```
