x86/traps: Add #VE support for TDX guest

Virtualization Exceptions (#VE) are delivered to TDX guests due to
specific guest actions which may happen in either user space or the kernel:

 * Specific instructions (WBINVD, for example)
 * Specific MSR accesses
 * Specific CPUID leaf accesses
 * Access to TD-shared memory, which includes MMIO

In the settings that Linux will run in, virtual exceptions are never
generated on accesses to normal, TD-private memory that has been
accepted.

The #VE handler implementation is simplified by the fact that entry
paths do not trigger #VE and that the handler may not be interrupted.
Specifically, the implementation assumes that the entry paths do not
access TD-shared memory, MMIO regions, or use #VE triggering MSRs,
instructions,  or CPUID leaves that might generate #VE. Interrupts,
including NMIs, are blocked by the hardware starting with #VE delivery
until TDGETVEINFO is called. All of this combined  eliminates the
chance of a #VE during the syscall gap, or paranoid entry paths.

After TDGETVEINFO #VE could happen in theory (e.g. through an NMI),
but it is expected not to happen because TDX expects NMIs not to
trigger #VEs. Another case where they could happen is if the #VE
exception panics, but in this case there are no guarantees on anything
anyways.

If a guest kernel action which would normally cause a #VE occurs in the
interrupt-disabled region before TDGETVEINFO, a #DF is delivered to the
guest which will result in an oops (and should eventually be a panic, as
it is expected panic_on_oops is set to 1 for TDX guests).

Add basic infrastructure to handle any #VE which occurs in the kernel or
userspace. Later patches will add handling for specific #VE scenarios.

Convert unhandled #VE's (everything, until later in this series) so that
they appear just like a #GP by calling ve_raise_fault() directly.
ve_raise_fault() is similar to #GP handler and is responsible for
sending SIGSEGV to userspace and CPU die and notifying debuggers and
other die chain users.

Weee so much. So I added database.py, which is just the file where we'll
handle all of the database related stuff. I also added a blueprint to it
and slapped that bad boy right into the app.py place (like I registered
it with the app). It's somewhat intuitive how sqlalchemy works if you
know how sql works. This being said, as it's late and I have an
interview in the morning, I haven't tested this stuff yet, but we can do
that tomorrow. I also have everything in a flaskr file. Aside from that,
idk if it'd make it easier on whoever does the authentication, but
there's a file for that now (but I haven't registered the blueprint with
the app yet). I imagine if there are no bugs in the database stuff (if
there are, I guarantee it's small stuff), should be pretty easy to do
authentication.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Fixes: c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

"11:05am. I am up and the internet is down for some reason. Let me check out the router.

11:10am. Agh, this is so annoying. Let me try restarting.

11:15am. Huh, it says the network cable is unplugged.

12:40pm. Done with breakfast and chores. Let me chill just a bit more and then I will start for the day.

12:55pm. Let me start. Focus me, focus.

I want to work on AI, but not like before. I'll figure out a way that is sustainable from here on out. And to set on that path, I'll need some art skills.

Right now I am looking at various complicated images and thinking - I can do this. It really won't take me long to get good.

1pm. Focus me, stop surfing HN and 4chan. Watch the Ctrl Paint vids.

1:15pm. https://www.ctrlpaint.com/videos/lets-sketch-apples

I used the eraser while sketching out the watering can. He is trying to teach me that very technique in these videos.

https://www.ctrlpaint.com/videos/clean-lines-pt-1

Here he is outright using various aids to get clean linework. I really can trust this guy. Was he called Matt?

1:45pm. https://www.ctrlpaint.com/videos/tackling-complex-shapes

The biggest change to my drawing is the way I approach the process. I feel like I've fully internalized this.

2pm. Had to do some extra chores. Let me rant a bit.

I keep going back and forth whether to use vectors or rasters, but I think rather than use the Illustrator which will get me into trouble with combining shapes, what I should be doing is making my stuff in vector layer and then merging it down on the raster.

I'd prefer to do everything with vectors, but then I'd run into trouble when doing shading. Unless I want to block everything in, and I don't, doing smooth shading would require me...hmmm, well instead of freeform grads, I could use Gaussian blurs for smooth shading in the Illustrator...

3pm. No forget it. Working with vectors and the flattening them down and refining them is the way I want to go. Right now it is a still a question of how much shading I watn to do in my finished works. But if it turns out that the answer is not a lot, then I might just do my work in the Illustrator as laying down lines and curves would be easier.

If I need a painterly look, the flattening the vectors down and shading them is what I should do.

3:05pm. At any rate, I am finally done with section 8. God, listening to another person just talk is so boring. But I need to up my knowledge and see examples of painting in action before I can go forward. Invariable I'll be in this stage for longer than I should, but that is the nature of learning. It is better to stay in school for too long than too little.

3:20pm. Sigh, ever since the latest Windows update, my OneDrive settings got messed up and now it is indexing things it should not. I am going to have to make time to readjust this. I do not need it to store everythign in Documents into storage.

3:25pm. The next is the let's paint section. But let me take a break here. This is pretty tedious. I am thinking of cutting the series short so I can actual get some drawing in. Right now I am just watching these videos without end.

3:40pm. Let me resume. I had enough of just watching videos. I want to draw some stuff on my won.

https://www.ctrlpaint.com/videos/lets-paint-a-spatula

You know what, fuck this. I've seen enough to know how the guy operates. Let me paint my own hand. First I'll sketch it out and then move from there.

If I can do the hand I can do the whole body.

5:15pm. Hmmm, that was fun. I admit it wasn't what I had in mind. I had intended to do a high level outline through a sketch and then dive into details, but instead what happened is that I started shading.

What happened is that out of all the hands I've ever drawn this one is best.

5:20pm. Some of the proportions are a bit off, but nobody would say this is a crappy doodle. Maybe it was wrong that I had no talent at art. It is as I suspected, I simply was not taught properly. Trying to walk with your hands will not get you anywhere. You need to do it with your feet.

I know where I went wrong. Sculpting is what set me on this path and now drawing reinforced the basic lesson.

5:50pm. Done with lunch. Let me post this sketch in the /beg/ thread. I meant to refine it after this, but I do not feel like it right now.

6:20pm. I keep reflecting on my experience. instead of doing that, let me watch some more lessons. I want to go back and see how he drew that lizard. I remember him doing a rough sketch, and then coming in with a thinner pen, but what did he go in the 3rd time for?

https://www.ctrlpaint.com/videos/how-to-improve-your-digital-sketches-pt-2

Let me watch this and then I will close for the day.

6:35pm. Let me close here, I do not feel like doing anything else for the day. I got my bit of positive reinforcement. The plan for tomorrow is to go through section 8, and after that refine the hand sketch. That will give me a leg up in skill. Eventually I'll go through all these vids and transition to working solely on my own things. That is when I will really improve. I will nail down both 2d and 3d art, and move on to the next phase which is music. After that I'll be ready to open shop.

6:40pm. Let me have some fun here. I feel drowsy after having lunch, I really don't feel like either drawing or watching lectures."
