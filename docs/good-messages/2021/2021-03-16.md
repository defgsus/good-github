##### 2021-03-16 01:44:28 by Harald Hope

Huge upgrade!! Bug Fixes!! Refactors!!! BSDs!!! More BSDs!!!
raspberry pi!! New Features!!! Enhanced old features!!! Did I
mention bluetooth?! USB? Audio? No? well, all hugely upgraded!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS:

1. Sadly, 3.3.01 went out with a bug, forgot to remove a debugger,
resulted in hardcoded kernel compiler version always showing.

Note that there is a new inxi-perl/docs/inxi-bugs.txt file to
track such bugs, and matched to specific tagged releases so you
know the line number and items to update to fix it.

2. Typo in manjaro system base match resulted in failing to report
system base as expected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES BUT CAN'T OR WON'T BE FIXED:

1. OpenBSD made fvwm -version output an error along with the
version, and not in the normal format for standard fvwm, this
is just too complicated to work around for now, though it could
be in theory by creating a dedicated fvwm-oBSD item in
program_values. But that kind of granularity gets too hard to track,
and they are likely to change or fix this in the future anyway.
Best is they just restore default -version output to what it is
elsewhere, not nested in error outputs.

2. Discovered an oddity, don't know how widespread this
is, but Intel SSDs take about 200 milliseconds to get the sys
hwmon based drive temps, when it should take under a
millisecond, this may be a similar cause as those drives having
a noticeable SMART report delay, not sure. This is quite
noticeable since 200 ms is about 15% of the total execution
time on my test system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXES:

1. For --recommends, added different rpm SUSE xdpyinfo package name.

2. Distro Data: added double term filter for lsb-release due to sometimes
generating repeated names in distro.

3. Packages: fix for appimage package counts.

4. Desktop: fixed ID for some wm when no xprop installed, fallback to
using @ps_cmd detections, which usually work fine.

5a. When swap used was 0, showed N/A, fixed to correctly show 0 KiB.

5b. If no swap devices found, BSDs were not correctly showing
no swap data found message. Corrected.

6a. Bluetooth: Removed hcidump from debugger, in some cases, that will
just hang endlessly. Also wrapped bluetoothctl and bt-adapter debugger
data collection with @ps_cmd bluetooth running test. Only run if
bluetooth service is running.

6b. Bluetooth: running detections have to be very strict, only
bluetoothd, not bluetooth, the latter can show true when bluetoothd
is not running, and did in my tests.

7. USB: with Code Change 1, found a few places where fallback usb type
detections were creating false matches, which resulted in say,
bluetooth devices showing up as network devices due to the presence
of the word 'wireless' in the device description. These matches are
all updated and revised to be more accurate and less error prone.

8. Battery: an oversight, had forgotten to have percent used of
available capacity, which made Battery data hard to decipher, now
it shows the percent of available total, as well as the condition
percent, so it's easier to understand the data now, and hopefully
more clear.

9a. OpenBSD changed usbdevs output format sometime in the latest
releases, which made the delicate matching patterns fail. Updated
to handle both variants. They also changed pcidump -v formatting
at some point, now inxi will try to handle either. Note that
usbdevs updates also work fine on NetBSD.

9b. FreeBSD also changed their pciconf output in beta 13.0, which
also broke the detections completely, now checks for old and new
formats. Sigh. It should not take this much work to parse tools
whose output should be consistent and reliable. Luckily I ran
the beta prior to this release, or all pci device detections
would simply have failed, without fallback.

9c. Dragonfly BSD also changed an output format, in vmstat, that
made the RAM used report fail. Since it's clearly not predictable
which BSD will change support for which vmstat options, now just
running vmstat without options, and then using processing logic
to determine what to do with the results.

10. It turns out NetBSD is using /proc/meminfo, who would have
thought? for memory data, but they use it in a weird way that
could result in either negative or near 0 ram used. Added in
some filters to not allow such values to print, now it tries
to make an educated guess about how much ram the system is
really using based on some tests.

11. Something you'd only notice if testing a lot, uptime failed
when the uptime was < 1 minute, it had failed to handle the seconds
only option, now it does, seconds, minutes, hours:minutes,
days hours:minutes, all work.

12. Missed linsysfs type to exclude in partitons, that was a partner
to linprocfs type, both are BSD types.

13. Added -ww to ps arguments, that stops the cutting width to terminal
size default behavior in BSDs, an easy fix, wish I'd known about
that a long time ago.

15. gpart seems to show sizes in bytes, not the expected KiB, so
that's now handled internally. Hopefully that odd behavior won't
randomly change in the future, sigh.

16. Fixed slim dm detection, saw instance where it's got slim.pid
like normal dms, not the slim.lock which inxi was looking for, so
now inxi looks for both, and we're all happy!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Added in something that should have been there all along, now inxi
validates the man page download as well as the self, this avoids
corrupted downloads breaking the man.

2. Init: added support for shepherd init system.

3. Distro Data: added support for guix distro ID; added support for
NomadBSD, GhostBSD, HardenedBSD system base. GhostBSD also shows the main
package version for the distro version ID, which isn't quite the
same as the version you download, but it's close. Also added os-release
support for BSDs, using similar tests as for linux distros, that
results in nicer outputs for example for Dragonfly BSD.

4. Package Data: added guix/scratch [venom]/kiss/nix package managers.
Update for slackware 15 package manager data directory relocation,
now handles either legacy current or future one.

5. Repos: added scratch/kiss/nix-channels; Added GhostBSD, HardenedBSD
pkg repos.

6. USB Data: added usbconfig. That's FreeBSD's, and related systems.

7. Device Data: Added pcictl support, that's NetBSD's, I thought
inxi had supported that, but then I remembered last time I tried to
run netBSD in a vm, I couldn't get it figured out. Now debugged and
working reasonably well.

8. Raspberry Pi 3, 4: ethernet nic now detected; wifi device,
which is on a special mmcnr type, now works, that stopped working in
pi 3, due to the change, now it's handled cleanly. Also added support
for pi bluetooth, which lives on a special serial bus, not usb.
For Raspberry Pi OS, added system base detections, which are tricky.
Also matched mmcnr devices to IF data, which was trickyy as well.
Note that as far as I could discover, only pi puts wifi on mmcnr.

9. Bluetooth: due to deprecated nature of the fine hciconfig
utility, added in support for bt-adapter, which also allows matching
of bluetooth data to device data, but is very sparse in info
supplied compared to hciconfig. bluetoothctl does not have enough
data to show the hci device, so it's not used, since inxi can't
match the bluetooth data to the device (no hci[x]). This should help
the distros that are moving away from hciconfig, in particular,
AUR is only way arch users can get hciconfig, which isn't ideal.

10. New tool and feature, ServiceData, this does two things,
as cross platform as practical, show status of bluetooth service,
this should help a lot in support people debugging bluetooth problems,
since you have bluetooth enabled but down, or up, disabled, and you
can also have the device itself down or up, so now it shows all that
data together for when it's down, but when the device is up, it just
shows the device status since the other stuff is redundant then.

In -Sa, it now shows the OS service manager that inxi detected
using a bunch of fallback tests, that's useful to admins who
are on a machine they don't know, then you can see the service
manager to use, like rc-service, systemctl, service, sv, etc.

11. Big update for -A: Sound Servers: had always been really
just only ALSA, now it shows all detected sound servers, and whether
they are running or not. Includes: ALSA, OSS, PipeWire, PulseAudio,
sndio, JACK. Note that OSS version is a guess, might be wrong source
for the version info.

12. Added USB device 'power:' item, that's in mA, not a terrible
thing to have listed, -xxx. This new feature was launched cross
platform, which is nice. Whether the BSD detections will break
in the future of course depends on whether they change the output
formats again or not. Also added in USB more chip IDs, which can
be useful. For BSDs, also added in a synthetic USB rev, taken
from the device/hub speeds. Yes, I know, USB 2 can have low speed,
full speed, or high speed, and 1.1 can have low and full speeds,
so you actually can't tell the USB revision version from the speeds,
but it's close enough.

13. Made all USB/Device data the same syntax and order, more
predictable, bus, chip, class IDs all the same now.

14. Added in support for hammer and null/nullfs file system types,
which trigger 'logical:' type device in partitions, that's also
more correct than the source: Err-102 that used to show, which
was really just a flag to alert me visibly that the partition
type detection had simply failed internally. Now for detected
types, like zfs tank/name or null/nullfs, it knows they are
logical structures.

15. Expanded BSD CPU data, where available, now can show L1/L2/
L3 cache, cpu arch, stepping, family/model ids, etc, which is
kind of nifty, although, again, delicate fragile rules that
will probably break in the future, but easier to fix now.

16. By an old request, added full native BSD doas support.
That's a nice little tool, and it plugged in fairly seamlessly
to existing sudo support. Both the internal doas/sudo stuff
should work the same, and the detection of sudo/doas start
should work the same too.

17a. Shell/Parent Data: Big refactor of the shell start/parent logic,
into ShellData which helped resolve some issues with running-in
showing shell name, not vt terminal or program name. Cause of that
is lots of levels of parents before inxi could reach the actual
program that was running inxi. Solution was to change to a longer
loop, and let it iterate 8 times, until it finds something that is
not a shell or sudo/doas/su type parent, this seems to work quite
well, you can only make it fail now if you actually try to do it on
purpose, which is fine.

This was very old logic, and carried some mistakes and
redundancies that made it very hard to understand, that's cleaned
up now. Also restored the old (login) value, which shows
when you use your normal login account on console, some system
will also now show (sudo,login) if the login user sudos inxi,
but that varies system to system.

17b. BSD running-in: Some of the BSDs now support the -f flag
for ps, which made the parent logic for running-in possible for
BSDs, which was nice. Some still don't support it, like OpenBSD
and NetBSD, but that's fine, inxi tests, and if no support detected,
just shows tty number. Adding in more robust support here cleaned
up some redundant logic internally as well.

17c. Updated terminal and shell ID detections, there's quite a few
new terminals this year, and a new shell or two. Those are needed
for more reliable detections of when the parent is NOT a shell,
which is how we find what it is.

18. Added ctwm wm support, that's the new default for NetBSD,
based on twm, has version numbers.

19. Upgraded BSD support for gpart and glabel data, now should
catch more more often.

20. For things like zfs raid, added component size, that doesn't
always work due to how zfs refers to its components, but it often
does, which is better than never before.

21. To make BSD support smoother, got rid of some OpenBSD only
rules, which in fact often apply to NetBSD as well. That may
lead to some glitches, but overall it's better to totally stay
away from OpenBSD only tests, and all BSD variant tests, and
just do dynamic testing that will work when it applies, and
not when it doesn't. In this case, added ftp downloader support
for netBSD by removing the openBSD only flag for that item.

There's a bit of a risk there in a sense since if different ftp
programs with different options were to be the fallback for something
else, it might get used, but that's fine, it's a corner case, better
to have them all work now than to worry about weird future things.
But limiting it to only BSDs should get rid of most of the problem.

vmstat and optical drive still use net/openbsd specifics because
it is too tricky to figure out it out in any more dynamic way.

22. For -Sxxx, added if systemd, display, virtual terminal number.
Could be useful to debug subtle issues, if the user is for example
not running their desktop in vt 7, the default for most systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES:

1. Moved battery voltage to -Bx output, the voltage is quite
important to know since that is the key indicator of battery state.
If voltage is within .5 volts of specified minimum, shows voltage
for -B since that's a prefail condition, it's getting close to
death.

2. In partitions and raid, when the device was linear raid logical
type layout, it said, no-raid, when it should be 'linear', that's
now cleaner and more correct.

3. When running-in is a tty value, it will now show the entire
tty ID, minus the '/dev/tty', this will be more precise, and also
may resolve cases where tty was fully alpha, no numbers, previously
inxi filtered out everything that was not a number, but that can
in some tty types remove critical tty data, so now it will show:

running-in:
tty 2 [not changed]; tty pts/2 [adds pts/]; tty E2 [adds the E];
tty rx [would have not shown at ll before]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE CHANGES:

NOTE: unlike the previous refactors, a lot of these changes were
done to make inxi more maintainable, which means, slightly less
optimized, which has been my preference in the past, but if the
stuff can't be maintained, it doesn't matter how fast it runs!

These changes have really enhanced the quality of the code and
made it a lot easier to work with. It's also now a lot easier to
add debuggers, force/fake data switches, etc, so it gets done,
unlike before, when it was a pain, so it got skipped, and then
caused bugs because of stray debuggers left in place, and so on.

The bright side is while reading up on this, I learned that using
very large subs is much more efficient than many small ones,
which I've always felt was the case, and it is, so the style
used internally in inxi proves to be the best one for optimizations.

These refactors, ongoing, have now touched at least 1/3, almost
1/2, of the entire inxi codebase, so the stuff is getting more
and more consistent and up to date, but given how old the logic
is in places, there will be more refactors in the future, and
maybe once the code is easier to maintain, some renewed
optimizations!, if we can find anything that makes sense, like
passing array/hash references back to the caller, already the
first half is done, passing references to the sub/method always.

The second part is started, using the Benchmark Perl module,
which really speeds up testing and helps avoid pointless tweaks
that do little re speed improvements.

I could see with some care some areas where working on data
directly via references could really speed things up, but it's
hard to write and read that type of code, but it's already being
done in the recursive data and output logics, and a few other
places.

1. Large refactor of USBData, that was done in part to help make
it work for BSDs better, but also to get it better organized.

This refactor also made all the device items, like -A,-G,-N,-E
use the same methods for creating USB output, previously they
had used a hodgepodge of methods, some super old, it was not
possible to add USB support more extensively for BSDs without
this change.

Also added in some fallback usb type detection tools using
several large online collections of that info to see what possible
matching patterns could catch more devices and correctly match
them to their type, which is the primary way now that usb output
per type is created. This really helps with BSDs, though BSD
usb utilities suffer from less data than lsusb so they don't always
get device name strings in a form where they can be readily ID'ed,
but it's way better than it was before, so that's fine!

Moved all previous methods of detecting if a card/device was USB
into USBData itself so it would all be in one place, and easier
to maintain.

All USB tools now use bus_id_alpha for sorting, and all now
sort as well, that was an oversight, previously the BSD usb
tools were not sorted, but those have been enhanced a lot, so
sorting on alpha synthetic bus ids became possible.

Removed lsusb as a BSD option, it's really unreliable, and the data
is different, and also varies a lot, it didn't really work at all
in Dragonfly, or had strange output, so lsusb is now a linux only
item.

2. Moved various booleans that were global to %force, %loaded, and
some to the already present, but lightly used, %use hashes. It was
getting too hard to add tests etc, which was causing bugs to happen.
Yes, using hashes is slower than hardcoding in the boolean scalars,
but this change was done to improve maintainability, which is starting
to matter more.

3. Moved several sets of subs to new packages, again, to help with
debugging and maintainability. MemoryData, redone in part to
handle the oddities with NetBSD reporting of free, cached, and
buffers, but really just to make it easier to work with overall.
Also moved kernel parameter logic to KernelParameters, gpart logic
to GpartData, glabel logic to GlabelData, ip data IpData, check_tools
to CheckTools, which was also enhanced largely, and simplified,
making it much easier to work with.

4. Wrapped more debugger logic in $fake{data} logic, that makes
it harder to leave a debugger uncommented, now to run it, you have
to trigger it with $fake{item} so the test runs, that way even if
I forget to comment it out, it won't run for regular user.

5. Big update to docs in branch inxi-perl/docs, those are now
much more usable for development. Updated in particular
inxi-values.txt to be primary reference doc for $fake, $dbg,
%force, %use, etc types and values. Also updated inxi-optimization.txt
and inxi-resources.txt to bring them closer to the present.

Created inxi-bugs.txt as well, which will help to know which known
bugs belonged to which frozen pools. These bugs will only refer
to bugs known to exist in tagged releases in frozen pool distros.

6. For sizes, moved most of the sizing to use main::translate_size,
this is more predictable, though as noted, these types of
changes make inxi a bit slower since it moved stuff out of inline
to using quick expensive sub calls, but it's a lot easier to
maintain, and that's getting to be more important to me now.

7. In order to catch live events, added in dmesg to dmesg.boot data
in BSDs, that's the only way I could find to readily detect
usb flash drives that were plugged in after boot. Another hack,
these will all come back to bite me, but that's fine, the base
is easier to work on and debug now, so if I want to spend time
revisiting the next major version BSD releases, it will be easier
to resolve the next sets of failures.

8. A big change, I learned about the non greedy operator for
regex patterns, ?, as in, .*?(next match rule), it will now
go up only to the next match rule. Not knowing this simple
little thing made inxi use some really convoluted regex to
avoid such greedy patterns. Still some gotchas with ?, like
it ignores following rules that are zero or 1, ? type, and
just treats it as zero instances. But that's easy to work with.

9. Not totally done, but now moved more to having set data
tools set their $loaded{item} value in get data, not externally,
that makes it easier to track the stuff. Only where it makes
sense, but there's a lot of those set/get items, they should
probably all become package/classes, with set/get I think.

10. Optimized reader() and grabber() and set_ps_aux_data(), all
switched from using grep/map to using for loops, that means
inxi doesn't have to go through each array 2x anymore, actually
4x in  the case of set_ps_aux_data(). This saved a visible
amount of execution time, I noticed this lag when running
pinxi through NYTProf optimizer, there was a quite visible
time difference between grabber/reader and  the subshell
time, these optimizations almost removed that difference,
meaning only the subshell now really takes any time to run.

Optimized url_cleaner and data_cleaner in RepoData, those
now just work directy on the array references, no returns.

Ran some more optimization tests, but will probably hold off
on some of them, for example, using cleaner() by reference is
about 50% faster than by copy, but redoing that requires
adding in many copies from read only things like $1, so
the change would lead to slightly less clean code, but may
revisit this in the future, we'll see.

But in theory, basically all the core internal tools that
take a value and modify it should do that by reference
purely since it's way faster, up to 10x.

Update strings.xml

Specific questions or remarks:


line 20: I don't know what you mean to say here: "Share your daily or your colorful life online." Why do you say "or"? "Daily life" is a compound noun, so "daily" can't be contrasted with "colorful" as if they are two alternative adjectives you could choose to describe "life." You could have a "colorful life" or a "colorful daily life," but those mean different things: the first means that you've had a lot of interesting and unusual experiences *throughout* your life; the second means that you have a lot of interesting experiences on any given day.

line 181: This explanation is a little unclear: "You can set a future task by changing its start time." I would recommend explaining it slightly differently. For instance, you might say something like, "If you want this task to appear on your daily list before the day it is due, set an earlier start time." However, I did not make this change because I don't understand how the "Auto" start time is computed, and that information would affect how you should describe the custom start time (see my comments for line 606).

line 329: I wasn't sure what you meant by "Most function support using with network except world~\n" so please check that my translation makes sense.

line 352: I think there is something wrong with the variable %2$d because my header card says I've completed 2 out of 3 when I have actually completed 2 out of 4. When I click on the Day section, it shows that I still have 2 remaining.

line 601: I recommend including a link to this github file after you say that help is welcome :)

line 606: "Auto (According to Repeat Frequency)" does not make it clear when the start time will be. It would be helpful to describe somewhere how the start time is determined automatically -- for instance, in the description on line 181. 

line 675: I wasn't sure what you meant by "Only item that is still not used will be put in here," so please double-check my translation. 
   
lines 843-849; 863-869; 897-901: Starter -> Scholar -> Bachelor -> Master is not a natural hierarchy in English (at least not American English). There isn't one specific hierarchy that you have to use, but "Scholar" and "Bachelor" are not terms we would use to identify a person with a certain level of expertise. "Scholar" just means someone with an academic career, and "Bachelor" is really only used to refer to unmarried men. I replaced them with Novice, Journeyman, Expert, Master, but you could also say "Intermediate" instead of Journeyman or "Proficient" instead of Expert; I just don't think those sound good as nouns. 

lines 875-881: I wasn't sure what "mega" or "nia" meant, and I couldn't find anything about them in English sources that could be connected to the traits of intelligence/knowledge and endurance. I thought "scholar" made sense for intelligence and "marathoner" for endurance. I also thought "leader" was too broad for vitality: I think "dynamo" fits better. I wasn't sure what "travel artist" was supposed to mean, but the best thing I could come up with for charm/charisma was "celebrity."

line 1096: I don't know what "It induces vote" means.

lines 1303-1307: I replaced several periods with exclamation points because the periods would have been interpreted by many English speakers as dour, disheartening, or even sarcastic. "Let's get this done." gives the impression that the task is necessary, but will be difficult and unpleasant. "Let's get this done!" would be interpreted as encouraging and enthusiastic, which is something most English speakers want in a productivity app. And many younger Americans in particular would read "Congrats, work timer is over." as insincere, because "congrats"/"congratulations" is almost universally followed by an exclamation point.

line 1353: I don't know where "sell out" is meant to appear, but just in case, I should mention that "sell out" specifically means "sell all available inventory." If I were to "sell out" of tomatoes, I would have no tomatoes left: if I had five, I would sell five; if I had 100, I would sell 100. If you just mean "sell," remove the word "out."

lines 1556-1557: I'm not sure what "Synthesis Cost Item" or "Synthesis Got Item" mean.

line 1576; lines 1688-1689: I'm not sure what context a lot of these phrases are used in, so it's difficult for me to assess whether they are translated properly.

line 1696: I don't know what this means: "Out step count is calculated by the difference of the total step count."

line 1716: I don't know what this means: "Don\'t prompt temporarily"

line 1781: I don't know what you mean by "it\'s using the simple way to implement so that it may be not working well with some actions"

Other:
- It's not clear that "Normal" means that a task will not repeat. For repeat frequency, you should change "Normal" to "No repeat" or "None"
- I can't find an explanation for what "Ebbinghaus" means under the repeat section: does it mean repeats will become less frequent over time? How quickly? When will they stop?
- Keep in mind that the word "weekday" refers to Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. "Day of the week" includes all of the previous as well as Saturday and Sunday. (I know, it's stupid, but the days of the weekend don't count as "weekdays" because they don't occur "during the (work) week.")
- In case I missed any, the button to acknowledge or dismiss a popup/hint should say "OK" instead of "YES"
- I didn't have the time to go through and change every instance of these, but "Attention:" would be better translated as "Warning:"
- You use the word "entrance" several times, but I don't know what this means in the context of software.

proc: oom: drop bogus task_lock and mm check

Series "Handle oom bypass more gracefully", V5

The following 10 patches should put some order to very rare cases of mm
shared between processes and make the paths which bypass the oom killer
oom reapable and therefore much more reliable finally.  Even though mm
shared outside of thread group is rare (either vforked tasks for a short
period, use_mm by kernel threads or exotic thread model of
clone(CLONE_VM) without CLONE_SIGHAND) it is better to cover them.  Not
only it makes the current oom killer logic quite hard to follow and
reason about it can lead to weird corner cases.  E.g.  it is possible to
select an oom victim which shares the mm with unkillable process or
bypass the oom killer even when other processes sharing the mm are still
alive and other weird cases.

Patch 1 drops bogus task_lock and mm check from oom_{score_}adj_write.
This can be considered a bug fix with a low impact as nobody has noticed
for years.

Patch 2 drops sighand lock because it is not needed anymore as pointed
by Oleg.

Patch 3 is a clean up of oom_score_adj handling and a preparatory work
for later patches.

Patch 4 enforces oom_adj_score to be consistent between processes
sharing the mm to behave consistently with the regular thread groups.
This can be considered a user visible behavior change because one thread
group updating oom_score_adj will affect others which share the same mm
via clone(CLONE_VM).  I argue that this should be acceptable because we
already have the same behavior for threads in the same thread group and
sharing the mm without signal struct is just a different model of
threading.  This is probably the most controversial part of the series,
I would like to find some consensus here.  There were some suggestions
to hook some counter/oom_score_adj into the mm_struct but I feel that
this is not necessary right now and we can rely on proc handler +
oom_kill_process to DTRT.  I can be convinced otherwise but I strongly
think that whatever we do the userspace has to have a way to see the
current oom priority as consistently as possible.

Patch 5 makes sure that no vforked task is selected if it is sharing the
mm with oom unkillable task.

Patch 6 ensures that all user tasks sharing the mm are killed which in
turn makes sure that all oom victims are oom reapable.

Patch 7 guarantees that task_will_free_mem will always imply reapable
bypass of the oom killer.

Patch 8 is new in this version and it addresses an issue pointed out by
0-day OOM report where an oom victim was reaped several times.

Patch 9 puts an upper bound on how many times oom_reaper tries to reap a
task and hides it from the oom killer to move on when no progress can be
made.  This will give an upper bound to how long an oom_reapable task
can block the oom killer from selecting another victim if the oom_reaper
is not able to reap the victim.

Patch 10 tries to plug the (hopefully) last hole when we can still lock
up when the oom victim is shared with oom unkillable tasks (kthreads and
global init).  We just try to be best effort in that case and rather
fallback to kill something else than risk a lockup.

This patch (of 10):

Both oom_adj_write and oom_score_adj_write are using task_lock, check for
task->mm and fail if it is NULL.  This is not needed because the
oom_score_adj is per signal struct so we do not need mm at all.  The code
has been introduced by 3d5992d2ac7d ("oom: add per-mm oom disable count")
but we do not do per-mm oom disable since c9f01245b6a7 ("oom: remove
oom_disable_count").

The task->mm check is even not correct because the current thread might
have exited but the thread group might be still alive - e.g.  thread group
leader would lead that echo $VAL > /proc/pid/oom_score_adj would always
fail with EINVAL while /proc/pid/task/$other_tid/oom_score_adj would
succeed.  This is unexpected at best.

Remove the lock along with the check to fix the unexpected behavior and
also because there is not real need for the lock in the first place.

Moth tourist bots -- They ask for your hat (#57563)

Adds a rare, once per restaurant venue, chance for a moth tourist bot to show up. Asks for the hat, gloves, or shoes you have on.

Closes #57541 if this is merged first, somehow. It includes the testing fix (since I needed to multiply all the weights to allow for rare bots anyway).

Wings are randomized.

I thought it was funny, and it's infrequent enough for the gag to hopefully not lose its magic.

Also a good test bench for the code to allow more dynamic customers. A lot of supporting code was added to make more customizable customers without influencing the surface area of the venue code too much.

Atoll: Set SELinux enforced at boot
For some stupid reason this fucking device dies with enforcing from the begining
I writed a lot of sepolicy and this is a fucking nightmare.
Some time ago I had this idea in my head but I had not implemented it now I have seen the missing sepolicy to carry it out so I will sign this commit as with co-authored
I will also add the note from lmi's dataoutpustream

lmi:
Since redefining all the missing sepolicy is madness and seeing that the lack of definition does not allow
the interaction with the vendor data files and persist data files etc at startup, break the rules but with a limit,
we unset at init and set enforcing at the boot stage.The sepolicy required after boot has been defined and is more than necessary,
thus doing all malicious applications that would like to read from nodes on sysfs etc will not be able to do it.

input_text = """Bloomington Normal is almost laughably cliché for a midwestern city. Vast swathes of corn envelop winding roads and the heady smell of BBQ smoke pervades the countryside every summer. Yet, underlying the trite norms of Normal is the prescriptive force of tradition—the expectation to fulfill my role as a female Filipino by playing Debussy in the yearly piano festival and enrolling in multivariable calculus instead of political philosophy.So when I discovered the technical demand of bebop, the triplet groove, and the intricacies of chordal harmony after ten years of grueling classical piano, I was fascinated by the music's novelty. Jazz guitar was not only evocative and creative, but also strangely liberating. I began to explore different pedagogical methods, transcribe solos from the greats, and experiment with various approaches until my own unique sound began to develop. And, although I did not know what would be the 'best' route for me to follow as a musician, the freedom to forge whatever path I felt was right seemed to be exactly what I needed; there were no expectations for me to continue in any particular way—only the way that suited my own desires.While journeying this trail, I found myself at Interlochen Arts Camp the summer before my junior year. Never before had I been immersed in an environment so conducive to musical growth: I was surrounded by people intensely passionate about pursuing all kinds of art with no regard for ideas of what art 'should' be. I knew immediately that this would be a perfect opportunity to cultivate my sound, unbounded by the limits of confining tradition. On the first day of camp, I found that my peer guitarist in big band was another Filipino girl from Illinois. Until that moment, my endeavors in jazz guitar had been a solitary effort; I had no one with whom to collaborate and no one against whom I could compare myself, much less someone from a background mirroring my own. I was eager to play with her, but while I quickly recognized a slew of differences between us—different heights, guitars, and even playing styles—others seemed to have trouble making that distinction during performances. Some even went as far as calling me 'other-Francesca.' Thus, amidst the glittering lakes and musky pine needles of Interlochen, I once again confronted Bloomington's frustrating expectations.After being mistaken for her several times, I could not help but view Francesca as a standard of what the 'female Filipino jazz guitarist' should embody. Her improvisatory language, comping style and even personal qualities loomed above me as something I had to live up to. Nevertheless, as Francesca and I continued to play together, it was not long before we connected through our creative pursuit. In time, I learned to draw inspiration from her instead of feeling pressured to follow whatever precedent I thought she set. I found that I grew because of, rather than in spite of, her presence; I could find solace in our similarities and even a sense of comfort in an unfamiliar environment without being trapped by expectation. Though the pressure to conform was still present—and will likely remain present in my life no matter what genre I'm playing or what pursuits I engage in—I learned to eschew its corrosive influence and enjoy the rewards that it brings. While my encounter with Francesca at first sparked a feeling of pressure to conform in a setting where I never thought I would feel its presence, it also carried the warmth of finding someone with whom I could connect. Like the admittedly trite conditions of my hometown, the resemblances between us provided comfort to me through their familiarity. I ultimately found that I can embrace this warmth while still rejecting the pressure to succumb to expectations, and that, in the careful balance between these elements, I can grow in a way that feels both like discove"""
