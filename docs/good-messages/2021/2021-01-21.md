#### Thursday 2021-01-21 01:55:26 by Jean-Paul R. Soucy

New data: 2021-01-20: See data notes for important messages.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

Upcoming changes (specific dates to be announced soon):

- The data structure of time series data will change in response to user feedback. This will only consist of adding additional columns to make the data easier to work with. The core columns will remain the same, for now. More details to follow. Initially, the updated dataset will be provided alongside the new dataset. After a time, the new data format will completely replace the old format.

Recent changes:

- 2021-01-08: The directories cases_extra and mortality_extra have been moved to other/cases_extra and other/mortality_extra.

Revise historical data: cases (BC, MB, ON, SK); mortality (SK).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “The data also report 66 new deaths, for a total of 9,208. Among these 66 deaths, 10 have occurred in the last 24 hours, 42 have occurred between January 13 and January 18, 11 have occurred before January 13 and 3 have occurred at an unknown date.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

gdb/dwarf: add assertion in maybe_queue_comp_unit

The symptom that leads to this is the crash described in PR 26828:

/home/simark/src/binutils-gdb/gdb/dwarf2/read.c:23478:25: runtime error: member access within null pointer of type 'struct dwarf2_cu'

The line of the crash is the following, in follow_die_offset:

  if (target_cu != cu)
    target_cu->ancestor = cu;  <--- HERE

The line that assign nullptr to `target_cu` is the `per_objfile->get_cu`
call after having called maybe_queue_comp_unit:

      /* If necessary, add it to the queue and load its DIEs.  */
      if (maybe_queue_comp_unit (cu, per_cu, per_objfile, cu->language))
	load_full_comp_unit (per_cu, per_objfile, per_objfile->get_cu (per_cu),
			     false, cu->language);

      target_cu = per_objfile->get_cu (per_cu);  <--- HERE

Some background: there is an invariant, documented in
maybe_queue_comp_unit's doc, that if a CU is queued for expansion
(present in dwarf2_per_bfd::queue), then its DIEs are loaded in memory.
"its DIEs are loaded in memory" is a synonym for saying that a dwarf2_cu
object exists for this CU.  Yet another way to say it is that
`per_objfile->get_cu (per_cu)` returns something not nullptr for that
CU.

The crash documented in PR 26828 triggers some hard-to-reproduce
sequence that ends up violating the invariant:

- dwarf2_fetch_die_type_sect_off gets called for a DIE in CU A
- The DIE in CU A requires some DIE in CU B
- follow_die_offset calls maybe_queue_comp_unit.  maybe_queue_comp_unit
  sees CU B is not queued and its DIEs are not loaded, so it enqueues it
  and returns 1 to its caller - meaning "the DIEs are not loaded, you
  should load them" - prompting follow_die_offset to load the DIEs by
  calling load_full_comp_unit
- Note that CU B is enqueued by maybe_queue_comp_unit even if it has
  already been expanded.  It's a bit useless (and causes trouble, see
  next patch), but that's how it works right now.
- Since we entered the dwarf2/read code through
  dwarf2_fetch_die_type_sect_off, nothing processes the queue, so we
  exit the dwarf2/read code with CU B still lingering in the queue.

- dwarf2_fetch_die_type_sect_off gets called for a DIE in CU A, again
- The DIE in CU A requires some DIE in CU B, again
- This time, maybe_queue_comp_unit sees that CU B is in the queue.
  Because of the invariant that if a CU is in the queue, its DIEs are
  loaded in the memory, it returns 0 to its caller, meaning "you don't
  need to load the DIEs!".
- That happens to be true, so everything is fine for now.

- Time passes, some things call dwarf2_per_objfile::age_comp_units
  enough so that CU B's age becomes past the dwarf_max_cache_age
  threshold.  age_comp_units proceeds to free CU B's DIEs.  Remember
  that CU B is still lingering in the queue (oops, the invariant just
  got violated).

- dwarf2_fetch_die_type_sect_off gets called for a DIE in CU A, again
- The DIE in CU A requires some DIE in CU B, again
- maybe_queue_comp_unit sees that CU B is in the queue, so returns to
  its caller "you don't need to load the DIEs!".  However, we know at
  this point this is false.
- follow_die_offset doesn't load the DIEs and tries to obtain the DIEs for
  CU B:

    target_cu = per_objfile->get_cu (per_cu);

  But since they are not loaded, target_cu is nullptr, and we get the
  crash mentioned above a few lines after that.

This patch adds an assertions in maybe_queue_comp_unit to verify the
invariant, to make sure it doesn't return a falsehood to its caller.

The current patch doesn't fix the issue (the next patch does), but it
makes it so we catch the problem earlier and get this assertion failure
instead of a segmentation fault:

    /home/simark/src/binutils-gdb/gdb/dwarf2/read.c:9100: internal-error:
        int maybe_queue_comp_unit(dwarf2_cu*, dwarf2_per_cu_data*, dwarf2_per_objfile*, language):
        Assertion `per_objfile->get_cu (per_cu) != nullptr' failed.

gdb/ChangeLog:

	PR gdb/26828
	* dwarf2/read.c (maybe_queue_comp_unit): Add assertion.

Removal of Azure AD UserAuthenticationMethod 16457 logic

❌ 1⃣️6⃣️4⃣️5⃣️7⃣️
Having investigated this threat actor activity for quite some time, we have certainly found investigative utility in surfacing anomalous AAD authentications¹.
However, in our experience, only a subset of confirmed threat actor activity was associated with UserAuthenticationMethod 16457 - and even in those environments, other threat actor authentication methods were observed. The value, 16457, is driven by flags set providing context that isn't intended to have global meaning.

**Most importantly**, this 16457 value is *very common* globally and is unlikely to result in meaningful discovery of threat actor activity is isolation (without comparing it with the realm config or otherwise baselining an environment). Put simply, its value as an indicator is limited and tenant-specific - and **its inclusion is likely generating false positives & questions for Sparrow users.**

After thoroughly exploring its meaning & its global prevalence with internal teams in December, we removed the 16457 value from remaining internal hunting logic (and didn't release it in public Azure Sentinel logic). I recommend you consider removing it from this tool and from the text of Alert [AA21-008A](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a) as well.

Note: I see that @DeemOnSecurity acknowledged this value was [originally intended](https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow/issues/20#issuecomment-754842442) as a potentially anomalous event in Issue #20 - but that nuance appears to have been lost on the broad user base. If replacement logic is desired, I expect our organizations can work together on alternate solutions!

Thanks in advance; and as an ex-CISA employee myself, I appreciate the development & release of actionable tools. Awesome stuff!

xmodmap changes for ergodox changes

The ErgoDox is now programmed to send a "Super" keycode instead of "Alt"
because Qt has an unconfigurable behavior of stealing input focus when Alt is
pressed (it assumes you want to access the menu), which then proceeds to steal
shortcuts from terminal programs like tmux.

QMK has no option to send an actual Meta--and I'm not sure if Meta is
even defined by the HID standard--so I've configured the keycap to send
Super because it can then be reassigned to Meta in X where it can
be added to mod1 and interpreted as Alt! This means xev(1) shows the
keysym as "Meta," but applications continue to interpret it as "Alt"
(via mod1)... yet Qt is smart enough to recognize that it's *not really*
Alt, and alas it is no longer stealing my fucking input focus or bindings.

(The input focus behavior is really a bad one, IMO: After you've pressed
 Alt and focus is now on the menu bar instead of the inner window, it's
 not visually obvious and your subsequent keystrokes to your editor, shell,
 Slack, or whatever are effectively lost as you wonder where the hell
 focus went.)

While KWin has continued to interpret the new key as Alt (KWin refers to
Super as "Meta," FWIW, as does the rest of the modern Internet apparently),
it triggered one of those hacky bugs internally that broke Alt-Tab; after
nearly endless trial and error trying to resolve the situation, I have
relented and rebound the app switcher to Ctrl-Esc instead (which is more
comfortable on my layout anyhow).

Hmph.  Qt.

serial: core: Allow processing sysrq at port unlock time

[ Upstream commit d6e1935819db0c91ce4a5af82466f3ab50d17346 ]

Right now serial drivers process sysrq keys deep in their character
receiving code.  This means that they've already grabbed their
port->lock spinlock.  This can end up getting in the way if we've go
to do serial stuff (especially kgdb) in response to the sysrq.

Serial drivers have various hacks in them to handle this.  Looking at
'8250_port.c' you can see that the console_write() skips locking if
we're in the sysrq handler.  Looking at 'msm_serial.c' you can see
that the port lock is dropped around uart_handle_sysrq_char().

It turns out that these hacks aren't exactly perfect.  If you have
lockdep turned on and use something like the 8250_port hack you'll get
a splat that looks like:

  WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
  [...] is trying to acquire lock:
  ... (console_owner){-.-.}, at: console_unlock+0x2e0/0x5e4

  but task is already holding lock:
  ... (&port_lock_key){-.-.}, at: serial8250_handle_irq+0x30/0xe4

  which lock already depends on the new lock.

  the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:

         serial8250_interrupt+0x50/0xe8
         ...

  other info that might help us debug this:

   Possible unsafe locking scenario:

         CPU0                    CPU1
         ----                    ----
    lock(&port_lock_key);
                                 lock(console_owner);
                                 lock(&port_lock_key);
    lock(console_owner);

   *** DEADLOCK ***

The hack used in 'msm_serial.c' doesn't cause the above splats but it
seems a bit ugly to unlock / lock our spinlock deep in our irq
handler.

It seems like we could defer processing the sysrq until the end of the
interrupt handler right after we've unlocked the port.  With this
scheme if a whole batch of sysrq characters comes in one irq then we
won't handle them all, but that seems like it should be a fine
compromise.

"11:15am. Yesterday exhausted me mentally, but now I am up again. I'll slowly get into it, though I really need to figure out what exactly I want to do apart from doing the docs. Docs are just one small thing. I need something to occupy me for the next few weeks while I wait for the replies from my potential sponsors. So far I haven't gotten any replies from anybody. Letting this sit for a week before making the next move is fine.

TODO: Enable parsing of numbers without decimals in their string as floats.
TODO: Make literal suffices (such as `i64`) be highlighted differently from the rest of the number.
TODO: Fix the package removal error. Probably the package errors are not being cleared and linger despite the file being erased.
TODO: Adjust the codegen so that the proxies aren't needed. Move the cases down.
TODO: Guard against stack overflows in the partial evaluator. Try running it on a separate thread.
TODO: Show the key order of unions on hover.

This is my current list of TODOs. Some of them I am not sure I want to do. The key order on hover was just an idea I had while doing the last serializer, but I ended up with a better design that did not need it.

TODO: Highlight unused vars.

This is something I wanted to do but did not have the time for it.

TODO: Make a VS Code theme for Spiral.

Right now I am doing crazy things like using type for unary operators. I do not have enough different cases to cover all of my needs. Spiral really needs a theme so I can stop binding Spiral specific tags to arbitrary things just to get them colored right.

11:35am. Unless the responses turn out to be particularly positive and immediate, I am going to have time to go through all of this. A few weeks should be more than enough to do the needed cleaning.

None of these items will affect the language's function, which is why I've been putting them off, but dealing with them will make things nicer.

TODO: Document the core library.

This will be today's focus.

11:40am. I am still thinking about it. What I said above is right, but this is still not enough of a backlog for me. It won't take long to deal with.

What should I do after I finish the above? Hmmm, it will take me a few weeks, surely I will have at least one bite to keep me busy after that time.

So I am really asking myself what should I do if I have no bites after that time? I am not sure.

I want to say that I am going to resume work on RL agents, but that would be a dead end in terms of development.

> .NET nanoFramework is a free and open-source platform that enables the writing of managed code applications for constrained embedded devices. It is suitable for many types of projects including IoT sensors, wearables, academic proof of concept, robotics, hobbyist/makers creations or even complex industrial equipment. It makes the development for such platforms easier, faster and less costly by giving embedded developers access to modern technologies and tools used by desktop application developers.

My plan B is to show Spiral to embedded devs. I could look into sponsors for this. In the HN thread, a lot of people were asking about F#, and Spiral could fill that niche much better than it.

12:15pm. If that fails, I am not sure what I should do. Somewhat ironically, I feel that because I have Spiral, I should not get a job. Instead I need to look for sponsors for it. That is the only way I can get it to pay for itself.

Forget about ML for the time being. 2021 the year I will put a serious effort into making Spiral known.

I am considering pessimistic scenarios, but it all comes down to price. I mean, imagine if I offered to work for free. Surely, people would want to hire me then even in the worst case?

Surely I won't get ghosted by everybody. I am not playing at that hard of a difficulty. I just have to push Spiral in at a single company and then make my way from there.

Once I demonstrate its value at one place, I can move to another. Obviously I'd like to get paid while I am doing it, but I'll take whatever I can get.

12:20pm. Sigh, I went without reward for long enough as it is. I can tough it out for a while longer.

Now let me move forward with the plan. I won't consider the scenario where I get ghosted by everybody, unless it actually happens. I will assume I'll get interest from at least one party and prepare for that.

locking/rwsem: Fix down_write_killable()

The new signal_pending exit path in __rwsem_down_write_failed_common()
was fingered as breaking his kernel by Tetsuo Handa.

Upon inspection it was found that there are two things wrong with it;

 - it forgets to remove WAITING_BIAS if it leaves the list empty, or
 - it forgets to wake further waiters that were blocked on the now
   removed waiter.

Especially the first issue causes new lock attempts to block and stall
indefinitely, as the code assumes that pending waiters mean there is
an owner that will wake when it releases the lock.

Added "RESOLUTION" parameter

 Discord User jteich did some investigation (Thanks!) and helped me understanding this rather obscure parameter:

Internally, is called "TRIGGER", and is passed into the baseband when configuring the desired spectrum sample rate.

Please forgive me in advance if this explanation is not 100% correct. It's only my interpretation, based on my own observation and jteich's comments over Discord chat.

This trigger parameter apparently determines the amount of data over time used for calculating the signal's power inside each specttrum's bin, before considering it "done".

In short, if you lower this resolution value then the cascade will tend to be rendered a bit faster, while kind of blind to tiny signals.

On the other hand, a bigger value will help rendering and distinguishing different signals on the cascade.

Too big a value can easily clutter up the cascade. But then it may be a "blessing" when inspecting higher freuqencies -where hackrf is more deaf"

The default value of 32 is quite decent. But then, now you can experiment with it. Cheers

Add files via upload

Oh it was fun lastnight!  Not only did we have a few great laughs with Pigeon Kicker Aka the hilarious James, but we also found out that the whole Emily Rose "Scam" was done by you guessed it the Trollorist herself! We got close ups of her email address she was using during that time, with her own words, and the recent email she sent James with that same email, tying the two together.

You can find the whole youtube video right here:

There is also a brand new spanking Update in this repository about the False Scam of Emily Rose Aka Emily Cassidy aka SammanthaPrater@Gmail.com

Update

Let me start by saying, go watch this!

https://youtu.be/CIPydwez1Vs 

This man is hilarious. The Dibney Cru was in full swing and we had a blast talking. But besides that, we found out that the whole Emily Rose Scam the Trollorist was screaming about was done by her own hands. To make this a bit short. She used the SammanthaPrater@gmail.com Email for the Emily Rose Craigslist searches and replies she was doing to get booty calls. She uses that same email to harass Gaea, and anyone else for that matter. I have a few emails from that email address of hers myself. But she emailed James using that Email. Yup you read that right. Don't believe me, or do believe me for that matter, just look at the images here, I promise you won't be disappointed!

Also quick note: This Github has been backed up on 3 other sites, so if Emily is reading this and thinks she can make this disappear, sorry turd, its not going anywhere. It is also backed up on a flash drive, an External, my old pc, and several other sources. And all of them get updated on the regular.

Translator, profiling, gui

- Mutli-Language support, majority of code stolen from my
  ChristmasGameAdventure. translating via macro ND_TRANSLATE()

- Changed GUILayer, (at least a bit). Added Controls and Language
  Settings Window.

- Added trash item slot (just like in terraria)

- Added infinite items (annotated with '#'). previously used "-1" for the
  same purpose

- Attempt to solve problem with wrong lighting at world startup. Added
  fade-in effect instead of solving the issue. Yes. That's right!
  Problem is still visible though...

- Added wonderful integration of chrome profiler. In Telemetrics window
  new button added to begin/end profiling and button to open Chrome with
  already finished profiling session. That means no more annoying
  load button clicking and searching through the goddamn filesystem to
  find that one .json file. (Possibly the best achievement of this whole
  commit). Technically it was done like this: Copied chrome//tracing
  html and js file. Modified html to include another js file called
  currentProfileTemp.js. Modified original tracing.js to load json string
  specified in second js file after document load. This was
  neccessary due to security issues with js being forbidden to read any
  files not specified directly by user in some file dialog. When
  OpenLastProfile button is hit in game, game copies profile json data to
  currentProfileTemp.js and then opens index.html with chrome. script
  in tracing.js reads json file in curProfTemp.js file ... And done.
  Ain't that magnificient.

- !Found bug (not fixed yet) in glMapPointer() (during particle render)
  sometimes this function takes more than 90ms which is truly terrible.
  That was actually the reason why chrome profiler integration was implemented.

- Fixed small bug with ScoperTimer using const char* instead of proper
  std::string (const char* loves to point at addresses that are no
  longer valid :D).

- Fixed bug with FakeWindow not properly offseting mouse cursor when
  another imgui window was positioned above it.

- Attempt to fix player walking animation while in mid-air. To a certain
  degree of success...

- Added FUtil::listFiles() to search through files in directory

devel-docs: Introspected Python libgimp and libgimpui docs generation.

Based on the proposed process proposed by Akkana Peck. Thanks Akk!
For now, it's only in the meson build, which is fairly terrible to use
as soon as we do custom build rules. Here are the list of issues:

- meson does not allow building in subdir (issue 2320 on meson tracker).
  Sure I could make several subdirs with meson in them. But here the
  future goal would be to be able to generate docs for other
  introspected languages, and maybe also other output formats (epub or
  whatnot). For this, since these are basically the same commands which
  are used, the best practice would be to have loops generating one
  target per language/format combination, reusing code rather than ugly
  copy-pasting in subdirectories' meson files).
- custom_target() requires the output parameter to be the complete list
  of generated files. But we have more than a thousand of them. It's not
  practical. Maybe we could try to find a way to generate the list from
  the contents of the .def files which are already exhaustive and exact.
- Install also requires the output list to be complete.
- I temporarily have these docs not generated by default (because the
  gtk-doc option is already crazy slow as it is, making meson near
  unusable for development if it's enabled). If you want to generate the
  docs, the commands are as following (yeah I don't understand what the
  target names are for since meson does not actually create targets with
  these names, so we have to use fake output names instead):

Always print full path to patch files. (Closes: #980247)

Makes the context for tags related to patches more consistent. Patch
files are now always identified via their full path in the source
package.

As the filer noted, showing the full path may ease packaging for less
experienced maintainers. They are also more likely to rely on Lintian
for guidance.

More experienced users may prefer the short path. We are instead
making tag names shorter, and the context longer. For tags related to
patches, it means that paths are getting longer.

Working with tag names often, we believe that shorter tag names are
easier to remember. Accordingly, we try to be precise with tag names
only when needed, for instance when tags distinguish closely related
topics.  Whenever possible, we provide any necessary precision in the
tag context. It makes tags more versatile.

This philosophy applies to many tags. For example, a relatively large
subgroup of names contains the word "debian". (Tags for changelogs or
watch files are good examples.) The word usually indicates that a
source file is located inside the ./debian directory. We perceive such
a tag naming scheme as cumbersome.

Many parts of our packaging infrastructure are named after Debian. The
moniker is generally overloaded, and often ambiguous. It is much
clearer to provide the full path of a file.

As a side note, we also no longer preface tag names with the name of
the check that issues them (although such a scheme still exists with
name-spaced tags; see continuous-integration.)

We sincerely hope that this solution is acceptable even though the
issue was resolved against the filer's stated preference.

Thank you to Alex Beckert for his keen eye, and also for remaining one
of our most active bug reporters!

Update minikube dev tooling (#1906)

Needed to update minikube to Kubernetes 1.17.x and I figured I would
also go through the minikube dev experience and update it.

This includes:

* Switch to default to the Docker driver, since everyone should have
  Docker installed.
* Removing the Windows hacks, because they were awful and I feel bad I
  even wrote them in the first place.
* Migrate tooling to use new minikube functionality
* Update minikube commands to up to date release conformity.
* Updated the documentation

Work on #1824

Update Final Project(1.21.2021)

This might be one of the hardest projects I have done. The progress that is shown is very minimal and it is frustrating. I am determined to finish problem 4. I know I am close. I have the filtering with the for loops and the if statements of digits that are larger than 6. How I need to confirm the numbers are the same that they are backward. Once I finish that I want to add it to a list. One major issue was I was not aware of the spilt function in python. Once I learned about it though I started making real progress.
Time: 7:25-9:30
I spent a lot of time on it. I will take a break to breathe and step back. I know the answer is in front of me, I simply cannot see it.
I still love how all of my work is on the same file though. It take me feel very professional.

Examples: Refactor hackernews stories into table

It's a table. And we don't want it to be responsive and change the number of
columns. It should always be a table with 3 columns. I drank too much of the
web dev coolaid and didn't even consider using a table because tables bad / not
webscale enough. Well... it works. and it's much less fancy. I like it.

This is exactly why I started writing my own framework - to open my eyes to the
edge cases of the rules instilled by the community. Or maybe I'm talking
bullshit and this will break horribly - but now that I think about it I don't
remember reading reasons against tables that would apply in this case - just
blanket statements to never use them.

Also i want the point and comment columns to be smaller on mobile - shortening
he widest cell (header) is the naive way to get there and doesn't pts & cmnts
just scream hackernews? It's understandable and works. :shipit:
