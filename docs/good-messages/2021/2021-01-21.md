xmodmap changes for ergodox changes

The ErgoDox is now programmed to send a "Super" keycode instead of "Alt"
because Qt has an unconfigurable behavior of stealing input focus when Alt is
pressed (it assumes you want to access the menu), which then proceeds to steal
shortcuts from terminal programs like tmux.

QMK has no option to send an actual Meta--and I'm not sure if Meta is
even defined by the HID standard--so I've configured the keycap to send
Super because it can then be reassigned to Meta in X where it can
be added to mod1 and interpreted as Alt! This means xev(1) shows the
keysym as "Meta," but applications continue to interpret it as "Alt"
(via mod1)... yet Qt is smart enough to recognize that it's *not really*
Alt, and alas it is no longer stealing my fucking input focus or bindings.

(The input focus behavior is really a bad one, IMO: After you've pressed
 Alt and focus is now on the menu bar instead of the inner window, it's
 not visually obvious and your subsequent keystrokes to your editor, shell,
 Slack, or whatever are effectively lost as you wonder where the hell
 focus went.)

While KWin has continued to interpret the new key as Alt (KWin refers to
Super as "Meta," FWIW, as does the rest of the modern Internet apparently),
it triggered one of those hacky bugs internally that broke Alt-Tab; after
nearly endless trial and error trying to resolve the situation, I have
relented and rebound the app switcher to Ctrl-Esc instead (which is more
comfortable on my layout anyhow).

Hmph.  Qt.

"11:15am. Yesterday exhausted me mentally, but now I am up again. I'll slowly get into it, though I really need to figure out what exactly I want to do apart from doing the docs. Docs are just one small thing. I need something to occupy me for the next few weeks while I wait for the replies from my potential sponsors. So far I haven't gotten any replies from anybody. Letting this sit for a week before making the next move is fine.

TODO: Enable parsing of numbers without decimals in their string as floats.
TODO: Make literal suffices (such as `i64`) be highlighted differently from the rest of the number.
TODO: Fix the package removal error. Probably the package errors are not being cleared and linger despite the file being erased.
TODO: Adjust the codegen so that the proxies aren't needed. Move the cases down.
TODO: Guard against stack overflows in the partial evaluator. Try running it on a separate thread.
TODO: Show the key order of unions on hover.

This is my current list of TODOs. Some of them I am not sure I want to do. The key order on hover was just an idea I had while doing the last serializer, but I ended up with a better design that did not need it.

TODO: Highlight unused vars.

This is something I wanted to do but did not have the time for it.

TODO: Make a VS Code theme for Spiral.

Right now I am doing crazy things like using type for unary operators. I do not have enough different cases to cover all of my needs. Spiral really needs a theme so I can stop binding Spiral specific tags to arbitrary things just to get them colored right.

11:35am. Unless the responses turn out to be particularly positive and immediate, I am going to have time to go through all of this. A few weeks should be more than enough to do the needed cleaning.

None of these items will affect the language's function, which is why I've been putting them off, but dealing with them will make things nicer.

TODO: Document the core library.

This will be today's focus.

11:40am. I am still thinking about it. What I said above is right, but this is still not enough of a backlog for me. It won't take long to deal with.

What should I do after I finish the above? Hmmm, it will take me a few weeks, surely I will have at least one bite to keep me busy after that time.

So I am really asking myself what should I do if I have no bites after that time? I am not sure.

I want to say that I am going to resume work on RL agents, but that would be a dead end in terms of development.

> .NET nanoFramework is a free and open-source platform that enables the writing of managed code applications for constrained embedded devices. It is suitable for many types of projects including IoT sensors, wearables, academic proof of concept, robotics, hobbyist/makers creations or even complex industrial equipment. It makes the development for such platforms easier, faster and less costly by giving embedded developers access to modern technologies and tools used by desktop application developers.

My plan B is to show Spiral to embedded devs. I could look into sponsors for this. In the HN thread, a lot of people were asking about F#, and Spiral could fill that niche much better than it.

12:15pm. If that fails, I am not sure what I should do. Somewhat ironically, I feel that because I have Spiral, I should not get a job. Instead I need to look for sponsors for it. That is the only way I can get it to pay for itself.

Forget about ML for the time being. 2021 the year I will put a serious effort into making Spiral known.

I am considering pessimistic scenarios, but it all comes down to price. I mean, imagine if I offered to work for free. Surely, people would want to hire me then even in the worst case?

Surely I won't get ghosted by everybody. I am not playing at that hard of a difficulty. I just have to push Spiral in at a single company and then make my way from there.

Once I demonstrate its value at one place, I can move to another. Obviously I'd like to get paid while I am doing it, but I'll take whatever I can get.

12:20pm. Sigh, I went without reward for long enough as it is. I can tough it out for a while longer.

Now let me move forward with the plan. I won't consider the scenario where I get ghosted by everybody, unless it actually happens. I will assume I'll get interest from at least one party and prepare for that.

Achronix: Massive Edge Computing Opportunity and the Fourth FPGA Wave

Let me watch this while I have breakfast. Then I'll get started on the docs."
