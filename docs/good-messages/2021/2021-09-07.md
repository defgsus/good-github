I lay down for a cat-nap and in this dream you and I, Montag, got into a furious debate on books. You towered with rage, yelled quotes at me. I calmly parried every thrust. Power, I said, And you, quoting Dr. Johnson, said `Knowledge is more than equivalent to force!' And I said, `Well, Dr. Johnson also said, dear boy, that \u{22}He is no wise man that will quit a certainty for an uncertainty.'\u{22} Stick with the fireman, Montag. All else is dreary chaos!\u{22} \u{22}Don't listen,\u{22} whispered Faber. \u{22}He's trying to confuse. He's slippery. Watch out!\u{22} Beatty chuckled. \u{22}And you said, quoting, `Truth will come to light, murder will not be hid long!' And I cried in good humour, 'Oh God, he speaks only of his horse!' And `The Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.' And you yelled, 'This age thinks better of a gilded fool, than of a threadbare saint in wisdom's school!' And I whispered gently, 'The dignity of truth is lost with much protesting.' And you screamed, 'Carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer!' And I said, patting your hand, 'What, do I give you trench mouth?' And you shrieked, 'Knowledge is power!' and 'A dwarf on a giant's shoulders of the furthest of the two!' and I summed my side up with rare serenity in, 'The folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself as an oracle, is inborn in us, Mr. Valery once said.'\u{22} I think you may like to know something of his person and character. He had an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well set, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was skilled a little in music, and had a clear, pleasing voice, so that when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over, it was extremely agreeable to hear. He had a mechanical genius too, and, on occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs. In the latter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had to educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to his trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading people, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of the church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons about their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently chosen an arbitrator between contending parties. At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children. By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so that I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so unobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenience to me in traveling, where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate, because better instructed, tastes and appetites."

Add dead bodies

Last night (the night of December 4th, 2020), I was laying in bed with
Coral on a Discord voice call and she was thinking about how checkpoints
worked. (Like, an in-lore explanation, not how it works in the actual
game.) Then she suggested at one point, what if there was a mod for
VVVVVV where you left behind a dead body every time you died.

So behold, this is that mod. What happens every time you die is the game
keeps track of where exactly you died, along with your sprite at the
time of death, and shoves it into an array. Then the game simply draws
that array on the screen, using color 1 (which is the color of death).
In the main game, it's drawn above all other non-humanoids, but in
custom levels it's drawn before every other entity.

Supercrewmates (the Intermission 1 companion) also create dead bodies.

Dying as VVVVVV-Man doesn't show a VVVVVV-Man-sized body, but the
playtesting ghosts feature doesn't account for VVVVVV-Man either, so.
Possibly playtesting ghosts and dead bodies should just use the same
entity-drawing function as normal entities do, but that's a bit
complicated. Or at the very least, some code should be refactored and
de-duplicated there to easily enable that without having to copy-paste
code.

Dead bodies are cleared every time you quit to the menu, or exit
playtesting (so, every time scriptclass::hardreset() gets called).

Whenever a dead body is added, there's also a check so the game doesn't
add a duplicate dead body if there's already a dead body that exists
with the same exact position and drawframe.

Use what is apparently a working match

Prior to this commit, for which I apologise took so long, this script
actually didn't work. After my live stream on YouTube, people reported
that I was still being shown as `Live`, which sucks.

Thanks to 'sanet' on Discord for sharing a script he/she wrote, which
was itself inspired by this one. Using sanet's pattern, maybe we'll
have some luck! YouTube is a pain...

If this works out, I think the next step will be to allow you to select
the channel based on a flag, and with that, have another flag which
shows all, perhaps based on a configuration file in '~/.config'. Ideas,
ideas, ideas...

"7:40am. I actually woke up earlier than this, but lounged in bed. Let me chill a bit. Any mail? No.

8:35am. Let me start. Since I grasped the basics of the language yesterday, right now I have some leeway in chosing my next step.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32rAwtTAGdU
From Optimization to Probabilistic Programming

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSII21Tm1zE
[POPL 2021] Paradoxes of probabilistic programming (full)

I watched the second vid yesterday, let me go for the first one today. It is 1:45h, so I'll watch it for 30m maybe and then go back to the docs. Once I finish the docs I will be very free.

9:20am. https://youtu.be/32rAwtTAGdU?t=1819

Let me stop here at the half hour mark. I need to study the Julia documentation. Let me get that out of the way today.

9:35am. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/parallel-computing/

Where Julia is good, it is really good. Let me take a short break here. Without a doubt, I'll finish the manual today.

10am. Let me resume.

I simply have no choice here. Either I figure out how to make agents more efficient, or I resign myself to mediocrity. The reason why companies are basically playing the lottery with their candidates instead of making it a priority to measure their aptitude is because these jobs aren't difficult and can be trained to do by anyone.

But I want to be exceptional. I want exceptional challenges and exceptional accomplishments.

No matter how I good I get at general programming, unless I can get good at AI, I will always be a mediocre programmer. That is also the reality.

I've been programming 6.5 years with the express purpose of that, but my general skill at AI is still at the 2/5 rank. It does not matter that some subsets are at 3/5 because they aren't important. This situation is exactly the same as trading. The one scenario I wanted to avoid the most is happening to me.

But it is not like I am dead yet. I have 30 good years or so left in me to spend at building up AI relevant skills. I couldn't win quickly or elegantly. I've been all effort and no talent in things that I most desired.

But that does not matter.

I either keep going forward, or I stand in place. The choice is that simple.

If I can cause the Singularity, I'll get a extremely large extension to my lifespan and a vast array of superpowers. It all hinges on making the first step.

If I could only make the poker players just a bit more efficient!

10:05am. I know the truth even if I did not want to admit it at first - it makes a lot more sense to start with a decent player and supercharge it using AI chips, than the absolute garbage NNs are offering me now.

I just don't know even a single way to get past the current hurdles. The thing I did towards the end which is adding more features is just a bandaid. To begin with, I did not even want the hindsight info in the value net as that would increase variance. All the ideas from tabular CFR got crushed too and towards the end I was relegated to using regular RL.

It is just loss after loss after loss.

10:10am. Right now I do not know how exactly I am going to use PPLs to improve on what NNs are offering me. I don't.

But the best way to become good at using them is to build them up from the ground. The Omega documentation for example is every incomplete. It is not realistic to be an user without getting familiar with its source. Is there some other language that is complete and could be used to make RL agents. Not that I know.

I haven't actually seen PPLs being used for gameplaying.

I'll have to break new ground here.

Maybe I do not need PPLs, maybe there is a way of composing NNs and making them efficient. I absolutely have no idea how to do that. Differentiability gets broken unless the training is end to end. I do not know how to optimize NNs for some local goals and then compose them together.

10:15am. I was skeptical of NNs to begin with which is I hedged by building general programming skills, but that does not change the fact that I've also falled to the hype in the worst way possible.

Maybe PPLs will bring back programming into AI.

A game like poker which is all about probabilistic modeling should be the most natural setting imaginable for probabilistic methods to shine. If they can't beat NNs here, then they surely are useless.

If it cannot be done, then I can only lament my lack of talent and poor luck, and wait for some genius to open a new path. But I do not think it is likely that Bayesian inference will turn out to be a dud. Zenna was right when he said that Bayes rules are an extension of logic to handle uncertainty.

This has to be integral to intelligence. It won't go away just like that. Rather, the field itself will move from toy examples to actual games. And if that is the future, then me missing such a crucial piece is a good enough explanation for why I can't win. Without such a piece, I am essentially crippled in this domain.

10:20am. Well, the next 6.5 years are bound to be more fruitful than the previous ones.

Let me pursue them.

https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/parallel-computing/

This is what I should be focusing on. I can rant later.

10:35am. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/asynchronous-programming/#Communicating-with-Channels

It is great that Julia has channels. I'll be able to appreciate this.

10:40am. Hmmm, the way this works is more similar to a queue. So far I haven't seem some of the more advanced functionality like alternative one might find in the Hopac library. But then again, I never actually used that in practice. I tried and then I ditched it. Still plain channels were very useful for making Spiral's editor support.

10:55am. Focus me, focus.

https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/

It won't be long until I am done with the docs. This and the next chapter, and I am basically done. The rest are extras. One thing the docs haven't covered through is project management.

11:15am. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/distributed-computing/

This is a big chapter. Just this one, and I am basically done with the docs. The rest are extras. Let me go through it.

11:20am. Ok, I can skim this one a bit since I am not interested in having multiple processes. Theading is one thing, but this is another.

11:35am. I've skimmed it. I am actually going to skip several other chapters in favor of:

https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/code-loading/

What I need to figure out next is how to deal with modules in separate files. Once I do that I can play with that for a bit and start using Omega as if it were my own project. This will allow me to go through it in a debugger. Julia has one, right?

> A package is a source tree with a standard layout providing functionality that can be reused by other Julia projects. A package is loaded by import X or using X statements. These statements also make the module named X—which results from loading the package code—available within the module where the import statement occurs. The meaning of X in import X is context-dependent: which X package is loaded depends on what code the statement occurs in. Thus, handling of import X happens in two stages: first, it determines what package is defined to be X in this context; second, it determines where that particular X package is found.

> These questions are answered by searching through the project environments listed in LOAD_PATH for project files (Project.toml or JuliaProject.toml), manifest files (Manifest.toml or JuliaManifest.toml), or folders of source files.

11:55am. This chapter was so useless as actually explaining how projects work. I'll have to seek out a separate tutorial on that.

https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/toml-files/

I do not get it, am I supposed to insert these UIIDs manually?

12:10pm. https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/

I should go through the docs for this. I do not really get how the imports for separate Julia files work. Do I have to experiment in order to find out or is this written down somewhere?

Let me take a break here. I'll leave figuring that out for later. Same goes for the debugger."

Update README.md

 Extraordinary food is an online restaurant demo. The aim is to create a full-stack codebase that covers the client's ordering section and the admin section that helps take and manage orders. It covers the frontend, backend, database, and API. There are several technologies that I've not worked with but I have learned and did - mostly small projects with. I want to put everything together to build a robust and complex project. I am very excited about this project!

At the end of this project, my intention is to create a Youtube video that will show the steps and challenges I faced creating this complex project.

PAGES
=====
1. HomePage - This is the first page that contains the listing for different menus and allows users to create a simple account.

NB: Most of the pages are created with modals since there are not many details.

2. Single food description - Just like the name, it is a description for a specific menu and related menu categories.
3. User Profile - Contains the details for a user, like personal details, contacts, address, and payments methods.
4. Order Fulfillment Page - It contains the customer's orders and details of the orders.
5. Admin Dashboard - This is the page that the admin will use to manage orders, create a new menu, add new employees that help in fulfilling orders, view sales, and more.

+++These are the ones I have envisioned based on my current requirements, others may come as the project grows+++


TECHNOLOGIES
============
+  React - React has been my favorite framework and it's still my preferred framework till date. It's very easy to build and easily composable with all the flexibility to use with other technologies.
+ TypeScript - I've been programming with JavaScript for a long time and learned TypeScriipt. So far I've only done things done some basic stuff with TypeScript therefore this project allows me to explore different possibilities with the language and learn more.
+ TailwindCSS - This is a very cool CSS framework, and with the combination of Styled-components, it can only get better.!!!
+ Styled-component - I've done CSS stylesheets, Advance CSS, Bootstrap and even tried a few frameworks like SASS. I've never seen such an amazing framework like styled-component. With React being a component-based framework, styled-components just make react so much easily portable. CSS has always been a pain in my as* but with styled-components - I'm just having fun!
+ Nest.js - So far I've mostly used Node.js/Express.js as my backend working with REST API. I just discovered this new guy and I'm so loving it! The power, flexibility, decorators everywhere and how it supports GraphQL, TypeORM, and multiple databases, I just love it.
+ Apollo GraphQL -  Ok, now it's getting more interesting! While REST API has been for a while, GraphQL has just made querying data so much easy and fun working with. There is no longer a need to create new code for new endpoints!
+ TypeORM - This is also an amazing Object Relation Mapper that supports, multiple databases and makes the TypeScript seamless. It adds loads of functionalities and definitely a good choice for me.
+ MySQL - Not much to say here as TypeORM helps do the heavy lifting behind the scene through entities and migration support.
+ Redux! (why not?) - I've not yet made up my mind. I will only use this if it's absolutely necessary. For now, i'm working with ContextAPI and it serves my need.
+ Other (more technologies may still show up along the way.

ENTITIES
=======
Each of these will be created with full CRUD functionalities.
1. Customer
2. Order
3. Order Details
4. Menu
5. User
6. Payment
7. Customize

More details will come later....

“Name!” cried Johan, infinite sadness resonated in his voice – the mournful toll of a requiem. Deafening silence followed with shrieks of pain; with decent resignation, you decide to look towards your friend: Johan. Appalled you notice that your friend lay on the ground; surrounded by a pool of red-velvet blood, stream of it flowed through the large piece of bitten flesh around his neck; thick enough to abate the raging of the sea, however, there was no sign of the zombie that had bitten him. Brooding frantically with direful uniformity, you begin being eminently cautious of your surroundings. Trudging footsteps resonated with the rustling of leaves – slowly and silently. Following the trail of the cacophonous sound, you catch a glimpse of your friend’s body – still as a rock, observing it brings vindictive images to your mind; overwhelmed with evocative memories. 
What do you do?
A.	Runaway
B.	Fight with the pocketknife in your hand
If (a): Wise choice – You tactfully retreated
If (b): You strike the zombie with the pocketknife, but the wound isn’t deep enough – you get bitten. “One must learn to distinguish what should be done in order to avoid the consequences of what is done”. Inevitably, you die.

Tinker around with krator to get a base

This is a combination of 30 commits.

Fixed some shit

refuckulated the carbonator

added security.

this is how we generate our shit.

I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

NOJIRA: No cry

This changes nothing, don't look

Well the book was obviously wrong.

LOTS of changes. period

This branch is so dirty, even your mom can't clean it.

Only Tom Cruise knows why.

should work now.

I'm human

Rename s5app -> s5project

name fits the reality better

Split into binary and lib

Create operator module

Move lib code to dedicated file

Move lib into own folder

Move main into dedicated binary file

Move operator.rs -> operator/mod.rs

More generic naming

Some cosmetics

Keep it simple: just owner & private property

Some cleanup

General commit (no IDs open) - Modifications for bad implementations

One does not simply merge into master

Become a programmer, they said. It'll be fun, they said.

Don't Ask Me, I Have No Idea Why This Works Either

Oh no

Data Description


Introduction
World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression
Data Preparation

Source
The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
Variables
Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.

**Demographic:**
• Sex: male or female(Nominal)

• Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous)

**Behavioral**

• Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker (Nominal)

• Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)

**Medical( history)**
• BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)

• Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)

• Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)

• Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal)

**Medical(current)**

• Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)

• Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)

• Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)

• BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)

• Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)

• Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)

**Predict variable (desired target)**

• TenYearCHD: 10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD (binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”)

Interpreting the results: Odds Ratio, Confidence Intervals and P-values

• This fitted model shows that, holding all other features constant, the odds of getting diagnosed with heart disease for males (sexmale = 1)over that of females (sexmale = 0) is exp(0.5815) = 1.788687. In terms of percent change, we can say that the odds for males are 78.8% higher than the odds for females.

• The coefficient for age says that, holding all others constant, we will see 7% increase in the odds of getting diagnosed with CDH for a one year increase in age since exp(0.0655) = 1.067644.

• Similarly , with every extra cigarette one smokes thers is a 2% increase in the odds of CDH.

• For Total cholesterol level and glucose level there is no significant change.

• There is a 1.7% increase in odds for every unit increase in systolic Blood Pressure.

Model Evaluation - Statistics
From the above statistics it is clear that the model is highly specific than sensitive. The negative values are predicted more accurately than the positives.
Predicted probabilities of 0 (No Coronary Heart Disease) and 1 ( Coronary Heart Disease: Yes) for the test data with a default classification threshold of 0.5
lower the threshold
Since the model is predicting Heart disease too many type II errors is not advisable. A False Negative ( ignoring the probability of disease when there actually is one) is more dangerous than a False Positive in this case. Hence in order to increase the sensitivity, threshold can be lowered.

Conclusions
• All attributes selected after the elimination process show P-values lower than 5% and thereby suggesting significant role in the Heart disease prediction.

• Men seem to be more susceptible to heart disease than women. Increase in age, number of cigarettes smoked per day and systolic Blood Pressure also show increasing odds of having heart disease

• Total cholesterol shows no significant change in the odds of CHD. This could be due to the presence of 'good cholesterol(HDL) in the total cholesterol reading. Glucose too causes a very negligible change in odds (0.2%)

• The model predicted with 0.88 accuracy. The model is more specific than sensitive. Overall model could be improved with more data

#### Tuesday 2021-09-07 16:20:41 by Marko Grdinić

"1:35pm. Done with breakfast. Let me read another chapter or two of Girls Frontline and then I will resume. I'll want to figure out how packages are setup and how the compilation order works in Julia. Then I need to figure out how to step through the programs. That will allow me to investigate the Omega library.

1:50pm. Let me resume. I can't stand this standing still. Let just do this, and I will have full proficiency with Julia. After that it will be time to master probabilistic programming. Maybe my luck is not completely horrible that I found an out in it. If it wasn't for that job post by Zenna who knows what I would be doing now.

I think that my quest for the Singularity would have ended right there. So I am pretty lucky.

It really would have taken a much larger leap of intuition to pick up probabilistic programming on my own. I am not sure I would have been capable of it.

2:15pm. https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/

This is pretty confusing. I managed to create a fresh project using the instruction here, but adding functions and new files is failing for me. Just how does this work?

2:35pm. https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/

This is so convoluted. Even adding a module in the Example file won't let me import it. What the hell?

Let me skim this until I get what I want.

2:40pm. This is so confusing. No `add` is not the right command to add those modules.

2:45pm. No, I do not get it. The documentation is too incomplete. It is really a wonder that they ommitted such a vital step. I'll have to rely on the Internet.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=julia+package

Let me check this out.

https://discourse.julialang.org/t/what-is-the-preferred-way-to-use-multiple-files/30687/13

This is confusing me. Is there no way to have multiple files in a package? But Omega did have that.

Why is this so confusing?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVmU29rCjaA
Developing Julia Packages

Ah what the hell, let me watch this.

https://youtu.be/QVmU29rCjaA?t=535

Ok, here he is doing an `include`? Huh really? Is this how it should work? Raw `include`s?

3:05pm. Ok, that was a mind twister. I guess I know how to deal with packages now. I did find it confusing about there being nothing about the extra files in the toml files for Omega. I think if I look more closely, I will see that all dependencies are through includes.

Though this is ugly, this will ensure that there are no circular dependencies. Like with F# and Spiral, Julia should have a linear compilation order.

Ok, the next thing on my list is the debugger.

But first...

///

Hi Marko,

Thank you for your interest in Tessian and for successfully completing our HackerRank!

We're delighted to invite you to the next steps from our side which will be a call with one of the Team, either Engineering Manager, Ahmed Opeyemi, or Team Lead, Sam Cox . Following the call we expect the next steps to include a codepair challenge then a final stage interview where you will meet some more of the team.

There's nothing specific to prepare for in this call; you'll be discussing your recent experience. Please see below a link to schedule in a time that's suitable for you.

///

There is a link to schedule the call, but at this point I've completely lost interest in these interviews.

I've decided to fully commit to doing work on PPLs.

Now if I could only find the courage to reject this offer that would be swell. One thing I worried about is part time work by Zenna not being sent my way and my computer breaking down. A voice inside of me is telling me to play it safe and not reject the interview outright. I've regretted burning my bridges with Groq.

Sigh, what do I do?

Ok, I'll defer the decision. They made me wait a week, so I can treat them the same way.

I mean, if I get mail from Z that he won't be able to send paid work my way for whatever reason, I'd have to think really hard whether I want to reject this offer. Do I want to spend a few more years going without any funds like I have in the past? It took a fair amount of effort just to get to the second step here.

Though the next time if I try this it should be easier as I'll have pared down my resume and pretended to be a freelancer. I'll also turn my resume into a buzzword soup for the HR drones to chew on.

3:25pm. For that reason I won't reject it outright until I get feedback from the thread I am really interested in.

Of course ideally I'd complete the poker agent and ransack the online gambling dens, but who knows how long that would take me. Years? I've already failed at that for long enough. To do that I'd need to become a PPL expert, build the game in Julia and have trained the agent. That would take too long.

https://julialang.org/blog/2019/03/debuggers/

Let me focus on this. Forget about that email.

3:35pm. Ok, let me ignore the issue of generating a project with a git. For some reason `generate SubExample` did it without. Forget about this.

How do I debug Julia in VS Code?

3:40pm.

```jl
q = 2+2
w = q * 3
r = w + w
using .Example
println(Example.plusone(r))
```

Setting breakpoints here works just fine.

Great. Getting the debugger to work was no trouble at all. Though it has a mean startup.

3:50pm. Looking at function wrappers. I've found it strange that Julia never mentioned having function types like `Int -> Int`. Right now that is an open issue.

Ok, let me take a short break here. I do not feel like diving into Omega right away. Maybe I'll watch more of that talk from the morning.

4:10pm. Let me watch that vid for a bit and then I'll instantiate the Omega library and step through some simple examples.

Instead of making things complicated, I really should just close the Tessian and Green Hills threads and free up my mental space. Ok, I'll do it tomorrow morning for Tessian, and for Green Hills whenever the reply arrives. So what even if I do not make any money for the next few years? In the worst case that my comp breaks down, I'll take a loan from my family and make it a priority to pay it off.

In that case of absolute need I'll get work wherever and temporarily abandon my quest.

But otherwise, poverty is fine. Poverty and hunger cultivate the appetite of the soul. Hasn't my pursuit of the last 6.5 years been a mark of greatness?

Why don't I do more of that and bring this arc to its conclusion? Yeah, this legendary pursuit of mine should be enshrined for all eternity in these Spiral commits.

4:20pm. I've thoroughly mastered regular logic, so I should master its extended version as well.

Onwards. Let me watch some of the talk I left off in the morning. Then I'll step through Omega for the first time.

4:25pm. No, nevermind. Let me just step through Omega. I do not feel like watching the talk. It is time to get this done.

https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/#Using-someone-else's-project

Let me try this.

4:30pm. Ok, I have a sense for what the main structure is. `Omega.jl` in src is made up of includes and exports.

https://github.com/simonster/Reexport.jl

This explains the @reexport macro.

Right now I am waiting for it to finish precompiling various packages.

4:40pm. Precompiling Omega itself is sure taking a while. Hopefully it won't end with an error.

///

Precompiling project...
  76 dependencies successfully precompiled in 644 seconds (11 already precompiled)

///

Wonderful. It would have been hard had I ran into any errors.

```
julia> using Omega
WARNING: using Omega.Omega in module Main conflicts with an existing identifier.
ERROR: importing Omega into Main conflicts with an existing identifier
```

Huh...Maybe it is because I tried running the module itself in VS Code. Let me restart it then.

Oh, it worked.

```jl
using Omega

x = normal(0,1)
rand(x)
```

This works fine. Now let me step into it. I'll put a breakpoint on `x`. I'll gradually move to more complex examples.

```
normal(μ, σ; id::ID = uid()) = Normal(μ, σ, id)
```

Oh it is interesting. It gives it an `uid()`. It did not step into that function, but nevermind.

It turns out Normal is a struct that just holds these 3 params.

```jl
struct Normal{A, B} <: PrimRandVar
  μ::A
  σ::B
  id::ID
  Normal(μ::A, σ::B, id = uid()) where {A, B} = new{A, B}(μ, σ, id)
end
```

```jl
"Single sample form from `x`"
function Base.rand(x::RandVar;
                   alg::SamplingAlgorithm = defalg(x),
                   ΩT = defΩ(alg),
                   kwargs...)
  first(rand(Random.GLOBAL_RNG, x, 1, alg; ΩT = ΩT, kwargs...))
end
```

What is that `ΩT`? It is not the RNG.

```jl
function Base.rand(rng::AbstractRNG,
                   x::RandVar,
                   n::Integer,
                   alg::FailUnsatAlg;
                   ΩT::Type{OT} = defΩ(alg)) where {OT <: Ω}
  pred = Omega.indomain(x)
  ωsamples = rand(rng, ΩT, pred, n, alg)
  map(ω -> apl(x, ω), ωsamples)
end
```

So `ΩT` is a type?

4:55pm. I am getting lost in thoughts. Let me just go through this.

```jl
"`n` samples from `x`"
function Base.rand(rng::AbstractRNG,
                   ΩT::Type{OT},
                   pred::RandVar,
                   n::Integer,
                   alg::FailUnsatAlg) where {OT <: Ω}
  ωsamples = ΩT[]
  ωsamples = Vector{ΩT}(undef, n)
```

I guess he must have forgotten to remove the dual assignment here.

5pm.

```jl
LinearΩ{I, SEG, V}() where {I, SEG, V} = LinearΩ{I, SEG, V}(Dict{I, SEG}(), emp(V))
```

This is what happens when the constructor for `ΩT` gets called. Incidentally, the experience of going through the manual really does make this a lot easier.

```jl
# zt: should Linear Omega be default?
"""
LinearΩ: Stores data in single `AbstractVector{V}`

`lω[i] = lω.ωvec[lω.ids[i]]`

- No overhead for linearization / delinearization
- Good for optimization / inference methods which require linear interface
- If heterogenous elements are used, must convert (which can be slow)
"""
struct LinearΩ{I, SEG, V <: AbstractArray} <: ΩBase{I}
  ids::Dict{I, SEG} # zt: too precise, any associable will do. Map from Ω index I to segment of omvec
  ωvec::V
end
```

5:15pm.

```jl
@generated function apl(rv::RandVar, tω::TaggedΩ{I, Tags{K, V}, ΩT}) where {I, K, V, ΩT <: ΩBase}
  if hastags(tω, :replmap)
    :(Omega.Causal.replaceapl(rv, tω))
  elseif hastags(tω, :cache)
    :(memapl(rv, tω))
  else
    :(ppapl(rv, proj(tω, rv)))
  end
```

Agh, this caused the debugger to crash. Let me try once again.

5:25pm. Hrrmmm...Let me try stepping over it. I guess my first challenge in Omega will be rewriting the above into a regular function.

Oh stepping over it works. Not bad. Let me just keep going.

5:30pm. Done with the first step through. Let me do a bit more I haven't seen what that apply does.

```
ERROR: Method is @generated; try `code_lowered` instead.
```

I keep getting this error. Let me open an issue.

6pm. Ok, done. And it is already 6pm.

It will be a long road to mastery. Even the small fragments that I've seen feel pretty complex.

As a stopgap measure, I'll try rewriting the @generated functions into normal ones tomorrow.

6:10pm. Getting a grip on this will involve refactoring exercises. I'll also have to try to isolate the functionality into my own smallish library to get a sense for it.

I suppose it is a good thing I am trying this now rather than a few years ago. Right now I am just at the right point in my development to even attempt something like this. Imagine if I had no PL or even ML experience. It would be very hard. Right now it should be fairly doable to completely master this.

6:15pm. I'll do this. If I can master Omega, I should be able to push my ML skills into the 3/5 area. That might be enough to inspire me in how to create the poker agent.

Let me have lunch here. I did enough for the day. Tomorrow, I am going to spend the entire day studying Omega."

fixup for Early IMM ASS: use proper TSC

Testing has shown that the Training Sequence Code in pre-chan-ack mode
is inaccurate (only worked with a BSIC that incidentally yielded the
same TSC value as the wrong TSC value sent in the IMM ASS msg).

Move the code setting the correct TSC and TSC-Set to the first stage of
channel activation (lchan_fsm_wait_ts_ready_onenter()) so that it is
available for both pre-chan-ack and pre-ts-ack Early-IA modes.

Have a separate function for setting the preliminary values requested in
Channel Activation (lchan->activate.*) into the accepted operative
places (lchan->*). Call this early for early-IA modes.

Hence the TSC and TSC-Set used in the early IMM ASS message is now the
correct one, and the same as sent during Channel Activation.
There shouldn't be any, but if there are other values besides TSC
suffering from the same problem, they are now also set to the right
values before sending IMM ASS early.

Update #3

Updated:
- init.py (Did the login manager to ensure that users are unable to access homepage
  without logging in)

- auth.py (Did the logic for the user login and logout. Also updated logic to check for
   concurrently existing users in the database using user.query.filter_by(). This will
   ensure that the integrity error doesn't occur)

- views.py (Added the @login_required decorator prerequisite to ensure users MUST
   login before accessing the homepage, which kinda makes sense if you think about
   it)

What did I learn?
- Password hashes are cool

- Always remember to use the correct variable name

- Python Decorators are important, but I am unsure as to how they are used, so I'll
   need to look it up

- request.form.get and user.query.filter_by are important when referencing data
  located in external files

What will I do next?
- Go and familiarise myself with the whole 'flask_login' login_user, login_required,
   logout_user, current_user functions

- Learn how to use python decorators

- Finish up the remainder of the project

[HACK]: base: power: wakeup: create a dummy debugfs entry for trace_marker

ah shit you finally disabled debugfs only to see userspace scream at you for not having trace_marker
this is the only driver which creates a debugfs entry which is essential for battery monitoring (see 1bdb13584fb7b5c6b7b741e4436a4dc4397df26e)
adjust it's init function to create said dummy trace file inside tracing dir
this will suppress the silly userspace errors

dyndbg: add DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CATEGORIES bitmap and callbacks

DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CATEGORIES(fsname, var, bitmap_desc, @bit_descs)
allows users to create a drm.debug style (bitmap) sysfs interface,
mapping each bit to a pr_debug "category".

Unlike drm, dyndbg has no coding of "category", but it can select a
set of pr_debugs with a substr match on their formats.  Since many
pr_debugs use a system of format prefixes, dyndbg can en/disable those
existing groupings as sets/categories.

the new macro's categories are used like so:

    echo format '^$category ' +/-p >control

DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CATEGORIES(debug_gvt, __gvt_debug,
	"i915/gvt bitmap desc",
	/*
	 * map each bit to a category
	 * helper macro adds ^ prefix and ' ' suffix seen above
	 */
	_DD_cat_(0, "gvt:cmd:"),
	_DD_cat_(1, "gvt:core:"),
	_DD_cat_(2, "gvt:dpy:"),
	_DD_cat_(3, "gvt:el:"),
	_DD_cat_(4, "gvt:irq:"),
	_DD_cat_(5, "gvt:mm:"),
	_DD_cat_(6, "gvt:mmio:"),
	_DD_cat_(7, "gvt:render:"),
	_DD_cat_(8, "gvt:sched:"));

 - int param_set_dyndbg()
 - int param_get_dyndbg()
 - struct kernel_param_ops param_ops_dyndbg

Following the model of kernel/params.c STANDARD_PARAM_DEFS, these are
non-static and exported.

get/set use an augmented kernel_param; the arg refs a new struct
dyndbg_bitmap_param containing:

A- the map (array, indexed by bitpos) of "categories" (strings to find
   in prdbg.formats).  These define the set/category of callsites per bit.

B- a pointer to the user's ulong holding the bits/state.
   by sharing state, we coordinate with code that still uses it directly

B allows drm-debug api to be converted incrementally, while still
using __drm_debug & drm_debug_enabled() in other parts.

param_set_dyndbg() compares new vs old bits, and only updates prdbgs
on changes.  This maximally preserves the underlying state, which may
have been customized via later `echo $cmd >control`.  So if a user
really wants to know that all prdbgs are set precisely, they must
pre-clear then set.

dynamic_debug.h:

Add DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CATEGORIES() described above, and a stub
throwing a BUILD_BUG (RFC) when used without DYNAMIC_DEBUG support.

Add structs dyndbg_bitdesc, dyndbg_bitmap_param to support the main
macro, and several helper macros wrapping the given categories with
^prefix and ' ' suffix.  This way the callback can be more broadly
used, by using the right helper macro.

Also externs the struct kernel_param param_ops_dyndbg symbol, as is
done in moduleparams.h for all the STANDARD params.

USAGE NOTES:

Using dyndbg to query on "format ^$prefix" requires that $prefix must be
present in the compiled-in format string.  Searching on "%s" does not
define a useful set of callsites.

Using DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CATEGORIES wo support gets a BUILD_BUG.
ISTM there is already action at a declarative distance, nobody needs
mystery as to why the /sysfs thingy didn't appear.

Dyndbg is completely agnostic wrt the categorization scheme used, in
order to play well with any prefix convention already in use in the
codebase.  Ad-hoc categories and sub-categories are implicitly
allowed, author discipline and review is expected.

In fact, the ^anchor is not required; "format $floating_substr" is the
default meaning.  The _DD_cat_() helper macro adds the ^anchor, and a
trailing space (see below for why).

Here are some examples: (these all need ^anchor to be practical)

"^1","^2","^3"		2 doesn't imply 1.
   			otherwize, sorta like printk levels
"^1:","^2:","^3:"	are better, avoiding [1-9]\d+ ambiguity
"^hi:","^mid:","^low:"	are reasonable, and imply independence
"^todo:","^rfc:"	might be handy
"^A:".."^Z:"		uhm, yeah

Hierarchical classes/categories are natural:

"^drm:<CAT>:"		is used in a later commit
"^drm:<CAT>:<SUB>:"	is a natural extension.
"^drm:atomic:fail:"	has been proposed, sounds directly useful

High density "punctuation" tld classification is possible:
  "^.","^:","^!","^#","^@", etc.

NB: in a real sense we abandon enum strictures here, and lose some
compiler help, on spelling errs for example.  Obviously "drm:" != "DRM:".

Some properties of a hierarchical category deserve explication:

Trailing spaces matter !

With 1..3-space ("drm: ", "drm:atomic: ", "drm:atomic:fail: "), the
":" doesn't terminate the search-space, the trailing space does.  So a
"drm:" search spec will match all DRM categories & subcategories, and
will not be useful in an interface where all categories are already
controlled together.  That said, "drm:atomic:" & "drm:atomic: " are
different, and both are useful in cases.

Ad-Hoc categories & sub-categories:

Ad-hoc categories are those format-prefixes already in use; both
amdgpu and i915 have numerous (120,~1800) pr_debugs, most of these use
a system, a small set (9,13) of prefixes, to categorize the output.
Dyndbg already works on these, this patch just adds a bitmap knob.

ad-hoc sub-categories are slightly trickier.
If drm_dbg_atomic("fail: ...") is a macro:
    pr_debug("drm:atomic:" " " format,...) // cpp-paste in a trailing space

We get "drm:atomic: fail:", with that undesirable embedded space;
obviously not ideal wrt clear and simple prefixes.

a fix: drm_dbg_atomic_("fail: ..."); // trailing _ for ad-hoc subcat

Summarizing:

 - "drm:kms: " & "drm:kms:" are different
 - "drm:kms"		also different - includes drm:kms2:
 - "drm:kms:\t"		also different - could be troublesome
 - "drm:kms:*"		doesn't work, no wildcard on format atm.

Order matters in DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CATEGORIES(... @bit_descs)

Since bits are/will-stay applied 0-N, the later bits can countermand
the earlier ones, but it is tricky - consider;

    DD_CATs(... "drm:atomic:", "drm:atomic:fail:" ) // misleading

The 1st search-term is misleading, because it includes (modifies)
subcategories, but then 2nd overrides it.  So don't do that.

v5:
. rename to DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CATEGORIES from DEFINE_DYNDBG_BITMAP
. in set_dyndbg, replace hardcoded "i915" w kp->mod->name
. static inline the stubs
. const *str in structs, const array. - Emil
. dyndbg: add do-nothing DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CATEGORIES if !DD_CORE
. call MOD_PARM_DESC(name, "$desc") for users
. simplify callback, remove bit-change detection
. config errs reported by <lkp@intel.com>

v6:
. return rc, bitmap->, snprintf, ws - Andy Shevchenko
. s/chgct/matches/ - old varname is misleading
. move code off file bottom to a "better" place
. change ##fsname to ##var for less generic varname (ie: not "debug")
. add KP_MOD_NAME workaround for !CONFIG_MODULES
. move forward decl down to where its needed

v7:
. use kp->arg, dont need kp->data or previous patch-1 - jbaron
. use client's ulong for bits, share state
. throw BUILD_BUG if DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CATEGORIES used wo support

v8:
. drop help field from dyndbg_bitdesc
. move ^ constraint from callback to helper macro: _DD_cat_

Compete in Facebook Hacker Cup '21 Qualification Round

points: 64/100 pts ^_^
rank: 1011/12687 (out of ~34586 contestants)
- 2nd among the 6 friends!
  - Barry had time during the night
  - could have overpassed him
    - had the idea for solutions already
PERCENTILE: >92% (~ >97% overall! :-O)

Analysis
--------
- struggle w/ the new format of input files:
  - 1 validation file
  - password-protected zip file
    - timer starts when the password is retrieved
      -> better for bad connections
         - long download doesn't affect the 6-min timer
- clunky to handle multiple I/O files
  => ADD VALIDATION/ FOLDER INTO TEMPLATE!

A1: AC
- ad-hoc construction
  - try 2 ways:
    - convert all to the best vowel
      - all consonants are 1 edit step away
      - all other vowels are 2 edit steps away
    - similarly, convert all to the best consonant
- hesitations/slowdowns:
  - no need to simulation conversions
    - i.e. block of code below `// all to best{Vow,Cons}`
    <- could have been calculated directly using nVowels, nCons and cnt
  => THINK OF SIMPLEST IMPLEMENTATION ALREADY WHILE CODING/BEFORE TYPING UP!!

TODO
B: S AC AC [0:55:09 +2 :-/]
- TS1 via brute force

TODO
A2: S AC AC [0:55:09 +2 :-/]
- TS1 via brute force

TODO
C1: S AC AC [0:55:09 +2 :-/]
- TS1 via brute force
