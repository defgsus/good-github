[docs] Expand docs for implementing new backends

Using the current documentation, it can be pretty difficult to learn how
to appropriately implement a new backend for perceval.  Many of the
methods that backends are supposed to implement have no documentation
explaining what the methods are supposed to do, or even how their
arguments are formatted.

Although it is possible to reverse engineer this information from other
backends, this process is time consuming, frustrating, and may deter new
developers from being able to use perceval with their application.

This commit expands documentation relating to implementing new backends
in several ways:

- The class-level documentation for backends has been expanded to list
more of the necessary methods and attributes that backends are
responsible for implementing, and additionally lists a brief summary of
each method.
- Several methods which were previously not listed (_init_client), or listed as
optional (metadata_*) have been listed as mandatory.  As far as I can
tell, there is no way to create a working backend without implementing
these methods, or at least stubbing them.
- Information about class attributes in the class-level documentation
has been replaced with a brief summary and a link, with the full text
being moved to the attribute itself, making the class-level
documentation easier to digest.
- Some of the documentation for class attributes that was sparse or
missing altogether has been added
- All* methods and class attributes that are intended to be implemented
by subclasses of `Backend` have detailed documentation describing
exactly what is expected of the implementor, and giving context for some
of the terms or argument names used where necessary.
- Some references to other methods and class attributes in the docs have
been converted to links, to make navigating the docs easier.

Some important notes:

- The documentation for `has_resuming` has been left blank.  Despite my
efforts, I wasn't able to determine what this was meant to indicate, and
could find no examples of it being used in context with which to
reverse engineer its purpose.  If someone is able to fill me in on what
this method does, I would be happy to add documentation in.
- I haven't been working with perceval very long, and most of the
knowledge I am contributing here is based on experimentation, reverse
engineering, my own experiences working on perceval-osf, and
extrapolating from what documentation existed before hand.  It's very
possible that I've made a mistake in describing some of these methods,
so please review carefully to make sure I am correct.  If I've made any
mistakes, I will be happy to be corrected, and revise my mistake quickly
after.

If you have any other advice, or recommended changes, I would be happy
to hear!

EditorControl overhaul

FUCKING PAIN

Create EditorTabControl, my own implementation of TabControls because
they suck. Uses an observable collection, Items, to define what files
exist

Change EditorTabItem to a ListBoxItem

Migrate tons of crap from EditorControl to EditorTabControl

Create Editor, an abstract class that blueprints different types of
editors that can be inserted into an EditorTabControl. Currently only
FileEdtitor exists

Usings refactor

Followup for the NCR loadouts (#468)

Some stuff that did not make it in time for the big one, wich was also big enough as it was.
Logistics (LO-CE-Log RE ) getting final touches for the current style, with CE being the salvage focus combat heavy version with fun gimmick guns/bombs, Rear ech being the poorly equipped semi-civvie tinker OR salvager, and the LO being master of both salvage and gun tinker.

This leaves the NCR with only 1-5 roles with master gunsmith, wich is more than plenty.
BP wise, salvaged PA and Entrenching tool moved to the three Logistics/engineering roles instead of for all, technical stuff SHOULD be their domain, thats their whole. reason for existing.

Rear ech getting some love, with a nice utility vest thats worse armor but got two pockets.
More interesting and makes more sense than them having the frontline infantry armor, looks better too.
Off-duty gets to glide around in a dress jacket with his saved up money and a nine mil but little else, it just looks nice and makes it different from the other loadouts in a fun way.

Cap loses his smoke grenades, both frags and smokes is a bit much and it makes him mirror the Legion setup too much.

While mucking about with pockets, noticed the bootcode, and adjusted so the fullsize police revolver and needler dont fit in a boot now more, but the gunknife does instead. The detective .38 still fits, despite it being silly, because its a kind of fun gimmick and gives it a unique niche.

Adjusts the hobo guns malfunction rate back to 1% for them all.

Fix RLP serialisation of `seq[Transaction]` used in `eth` protocol

1. This generalise the special cases for serialising RLP `seq[Transaction]`
   inside `BlockBody` and `EthBlock`, to do it for all `seq[Transaction]`
   no matter what objects they are part of.  `openArray[Transaction]` is also
   included, as this was found to be necessary to match some of the places that
   are really given a `seq`.

2. There are some bug fixes as well to the original RLP parser for
   `Transaction`.  Specifically:

   a. It always reads the first byte to get the transaction type instead of
      parsing an RLP `int`.  The reason is that wrong/adversarial input gives
      a sensible error (i.e. invalid type code) when it's read as a byte, and
      when it's read as an `int` those inputs give crazy messages ("too large
      to fit in memory" etc) that make it look like we have coding errors
      processing input.

   b. If a typed transaction is detected in `seq[Transaction]`, the old code
      unwraps the RLP (blob) wrapper than passes the contents to
      `read(Transaction)`, which means a blob-wrapped legacy transaction would
      be accepted.  This is incorrect and the new code always passes it to the
      typed transaction decoder, which would reject that.

This has a large effect on `eth/65` syncing with peers.

In `eth/63`, messages `Transactions` passes an `openArray[Transaction]`.
In `eth/65`, so does `PooledTransactions`.

The RLP parsers for both of these message types have been broken since the
introduction of typed transactions (EIP-2718), as used in Berlin/London forks.

There is a special case for `seq[Transaction]` inside `EthBlock` and
`BlockBody`, but not for the list of transactions passed in those messages.

Due to this, whenever a peer sent us a `Transactions` message, we had an RLP
decoding error processing it, and disconnected the peer thinking it was the
peer's error.

These messages are sent often by good peers, so whenever we connected to a
really good peer, we'd end up disconnecting from it within a few tens of
seconds due to this.

This didn't get noticed before updating to `eth/65`, because with old protocols
we tend to only connect to old peers, which may be out of date themselves and
have no transactions anyway.  Also, we didn't really investigate occasional
disconnects before, we assumed they're just part of P2P life.

The root cause is the RLP serialisation of individual `Transaction` objects is
meant to be be subtly different from the RLP serialisation of arrays/sequences
of `Transaction` objects that are sent in network messages.  RFC-2976 covers
this but it's quite subtle:

- Individual transactions are encoded and stored as either `RLP([fields..])`
  for legacy transactions, or `Type || RLP([fields..])`.  Both of these
  encodings are byte sequences.  The part after `Type` doesn't have to be
  RLP in theory, but all types so far use RLP.  EIP-2718 covers this.

- In arrays (sequences), transactions are encoded as either `RLP([fields..])`
  for legacy transactions, or `RLP(Type || RLP([fields..]))` for all typed
  transactions to date.  Spot the extra `RLP(..)` blob encoding, to make it
  valid RLP inside a larger RLP.  EIP-2976 covers this, "Typed Transactions
  over Gossip", although it's not very clear about the blob encoding.

In `eth/65` protocol this is essential for the correct encoding/decoding of
`Transactions`, `NewBlock`, and `PooledTransactions` messages.  We need a type
match on both `openArray[Transaction]` and `seq[Transaction]` to catch all cases.

In practice the extra `RLP(..)` applies to all arrays/sequences of transactions
that are to be RLP-encoded as a list.  In principle, it should even be all
aggregates (objects etc.), but it's enough for us to enable it for all
arrays/sequences, as this is what's used in the protocol and EIP-2976.

printk: Introduce per-console loglevel setting

Not all consoles are created equal: depending on the actual hardware,
the latency of a printk() call can vary dramatically. The worst examples
are serial consoles, where it can spin for tens of milliseconds banging
the UART to emit a message, which can cause application-level problems
when the kernel spews onto the console.

At Facebook we use netconsole to monitor our fleet, but we still have
serial consoles attached on each host for live debugging, and the latter
has caused problems. An obvious solution is to disable the kernel
console output to ttyS0, but this makes live debugging frustrating,
since crashes become silent and opaque to the ttyS0 user. Enabling it on
the fly when needed isn't feasible, since boxes you need to debug via
serial are likely to be borked in ways that make this impossible.

That puts us between a rock and a hard place: we'd love to set
kernel.printk to KERN_INFO and get all the logs. But while netconsole is
fast enough to permit that without perturbing userspace, ttyS0 is not,
and we're forced to limit console logging to KERN_WARNING and higher.

This patch introduces a new per-console loglevel setting, and changes
console_unlock() to use max(global_level, per_console_level) when
deciding whether or not to emit a given log message.

This lets us have our cake and eat it too: instead of being forced to
limit all consoles verbosity based on the speed of the slowest one, we
can "promote" the faster console while still using a conservative system
loglevel setting to avoid disturbing applications.

Compete in SRM 808, Div 2

successful challenges: 0/1 :-/
problems: 2 AC / 3 submissions (3 opened)
failed systests: 1 :-/
- everyone failed 900-pt in the room :-O

rank in the room: 3/8 (8 competing)
- would have been 2/9 w/o the failed challenge
  - by .04 pts! :-/

rank in the division: 17/86 (~221 present)
PERCENTILE: >80% :-O ^_^ (>93% :-O :-O)
rating: 1084 +49 :-O -> 1133 :-D [green] => (new highest) -> in spite of 1 failed systest? Wow! :-O

Analysis
--------

- groggy
- thrilling/stressful round
  - just a hunch in the Div 2 Hard :-/
- too many slowdowns/hesitations/presubmit bugs :-/
- would have been 13/86 w/o the failed challenge :-/ :-/
=> THINK HARDER & MORE CAREFUL DURING THE CHALLENGE!!
   - BE SURE TO CHECK THE WHOLE CODE!!
<- almost got 900-pt right
   - would have been ~4/9 w/o the failed systest! :-O
     - ahead of recuraki?
   - editorial: rectify w/ min the observerCount!!! :-/ :-/ :-(
=> USE ALL DATA/VARIABLES FROM THE INPUT!!!!
   - BEWARE OF FORGETTING TO RECTIFY!!

300-pt:
- complete search until (SZ(result)>=N)
=> USE `AUTO FN=[&](...) -> VOID`!
   - SHORTER SIGNATURE FOR RECURSIVE LAMBDAS
     - INSTEAD OF `FUNCTION<VOID(...)>`
- presubmit bug
  - forgotten return after `result.PB(ans);`
    - happened again
      - earlier today in AtCoder contest :-/
    -> wasted time debugging :-(
=> START IF CLAUSES OF RECURSION/COMPLETE SEARCH/DFS BY TYPING `RETURN;` FIRST!

TODO
- ?th fastest solution in the room

400-pt:
- hesitations:
  - loop over edges?
    - use `fis` abbrev in TopCoder
  - global `comp`?
    - clear between each iteration of the main loop?
- presubmit bug:
  - typo `comp.PB(at);`
    - instead of `comp.PB(neigh);`
=> PAY ATTENTION WHEN COPY-PASTING!!
   - OR DON'T COPY-PASTE, BUT RATHER WRITE EXPLICITLY!!!
     -> THIS MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TYPING
        - VARIABLES ETC.
  - forgotten `vis[at]=1;` before the start of dfs() :-/
=> REMEMBER TO TAG CURRENT VERTEX `AT`, NOT JUST ITS `NEIGH`!

- unsuccesfully challenged green coder raviupreti85's solution
  - mistaken wrongly post-order DFS order
    - but he reverses that at the end -> so it works :-/
  -> -25 pts :-/
=> pay attention to the entire code
   - i.e. should have questioned why there was the reverse at the end
     -> to fix the post-order DFS order

900-pt:
- hesitations:
  - just a hunch whether correct/optimal solution
    - fit intervals as much as possible with positive left-over space
    - fit identically but horizontally flipped
      - hope for non-overleaping intervals (well, not more than 2 intervals) :-/
      - hope for optimality of this approach!
        - works for sample #2, though :-/
  - necessary umax()?
    - shouldn't happen, but better safe than sorry!
=> WHEN UNSURE BUT STILL A HUNCH, JUST TRY IT -> NOTHING TO LOSE IN TC
   - PERHAPS SOME CHALLENGE POINTS FOR OTHERS!
- presubmit bug:
  - missed edge case `if (observationTime==raceTime)`
  - missed edge case `if (observerCount*observationTime==raceTime)`
=> BE MINDFUL OF EDGE CASES DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION!
- should have started w/ challenging gray coder afulldevnull's solution
  - very short code
    - though missing an edge case!
=> BE SUSPICOUS WHEN A LOW-RATED CODER SUBMITS A DIV 2 HARD AS THE FIRST
   -> TARGET SUSPICIOUS SUBMISSIONS FIRST
      - NOT BY DIFFICULTY OF PROBLEMS!
