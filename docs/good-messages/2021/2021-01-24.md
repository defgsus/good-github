schema: working to unify interfaces and dmt.  Intermediate checkpoint commit.

This commit does not pass CI or even fully compile, and while I usually
try to avoid those, A) I need a checkpoint!, and B) I think this one is
interestingly illustrative, and I'll probably want to refer to this
diff and the one that will follow it in the future as part of
architecture design records (or even possibly experience reports about
golang syntax).

In this commit: we have three packages:

- schema: full of interfaces (and only interfaces)
- schema/compiler: creates values matching schema interfaces
- schema/dmt: contains codegen'd types that parse schema documents.

The dmt package feeds data to the compiler package, and the compiler
package emits values matching the schema interface.
This all works very nicely and avoids import cycles.

(Avoiding import cycles has been nontrivial, here, unfortunately.
The schema/schema2 package (which is still present in this commit,
but will be removed shortly -- I've scraped most of it over into
this new 'compiler' package already, just not a bunch of the validation
rules stuff, yet) was a dream of making this all work by just having
thin wrapper types around the dmt types.  This didn't fly...
because codegen'd nodes comply with `schema.TypedNode`, and complying
with `schema.TypedNode` means they have a function which references
`schema.Type`... and that means we really must depend on that
interface and the package it's in.  Ooof.)

The big downer with this state, and why things are currently
non-compiling at this checkpoint I've made here, is that we have to
replicate a *lot* of methods into single-use interfaces in the schema
package for this to work.  This belies the meaning of "interface".
The reason we'd do this -- the reason to split 'compiler' into its own
package -- is most because I wanted to keep all the constructor
mechanisms for schema values out of the direct path of the user's eye,
because most users shouldn't be using the compiler directly at all.

But... I'm shifting to thinking this attempt to segregate the compiler
details isn't worth it.  A whole separate package costs too much.
Most concretely, it would make it impossible to make the `schema.Type`
interface "closed" (e.g. by having an unexported method), and I think
at that point we would be straying quite far from desired semantics.

"10:45am. Email? None.

Tonight was really rough. I went to bed at 10am which was early for me, but now my back hurts and I feel stressed out. It is strange, I did not think particularly stressful thoughts tonight. It must be subconscious.

10:50am. In fact, I went to bed thinking I have this entire situation under my control. Compared to half a week ago when I was lost, my plan is in a pretty good state at the moment. I have a lot of leeway to move around.

I need to make an attempt at conquering Python with the functional style. This is the true path. I thought and I thought, and what was previously an idea became absolutely dominant. So much is pointing in the favor of this. I will raise my profile, rebuild my old library and get access to the main ecosystem. I will even get side benefits like GPU auto memory management, so the library will be better than before. I thought I would need to give up tail call optimization, but it turns out that is not true either.

Sticking to F# against my goals will not be rewarded. Neither will sticking to a particular platform.

But if there is justice in the world, I will be rewarded for staying true to my style and even extending it beyond the point mainstream languages allow.

11am. If this fails, I'll admit that it is a tough world out there and that it is my destiny to stay the underdog. In the worst case, I'll have to do what I wanted in 2018 and make those agents on the GPU. I'll admit that it is unrealistic to expect 30-60k per month income and that my path is just not fit for that sort of thing. The only way I'll get that is through banditry in that case.

But I have hope that this will work and my plan will get me out of the poverty state and to small riches by the end of this year.

11:10am. At the very least Spiral should have a small userbase then.

Let me do this thing. Today I investigate Cython. I'll play around with it for a while.

I want to see what it compiles to.

I have this under control. It is amazing how fast time is passing for me right now. Let me see if I can get into it. Once I get into it hopefully I should destress myself.

https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html
> Windows A popular option is to use the open source MinGW (a Windows distribution of gcc). See the appendix for instructions for setting up MinGW manually. Enthought Canopy and Python(x,y) bundle MinGW, but some of the configuration steps in the appendix might still be necessary. Another option is to use Microsoft’s Visual C. One must then use the same version which the installed Python was compiled with.

Installing C compilers again. I went through this many time before. Right now let me just read the docs.

Cython Tutorial - Bridging between Python and C/C++ for performance gains

Let me watch this tutorial.

11:25am. If the 2021 plan fails I will gather my fury, and sacrifice the 20s to push the agent plan to completion. There is no other way. At that point, in order to keep following my path, I can only exchange my very life essence for it. Even if it takes me a decade, I will push making an agent to completion. A decade is long enough to accomplish any small thing.

And as I said, doing what I have in mind in 2021 will get me my ML library back. I'll get to where I was at 2018 at any rate and will be able to exceed my old high.

Even if I cannot do anything else, I'll hit at least that goal. Because this is 100% in my control. I can't control the reactions of other or my profile, but the work that I do is my own choice.

http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php

Let me grab Mingw while I watch that tutorial.

11:40am. Win-builds is messing with me. Let me get the normal MingW.

11:45am. The download seems to be stuck. Does this have anything to do with the `AppData` nukage? I have no idea. I am getting paranoid about things being broken due to that.

Oh, it is installing, nevermind.

```
install: binutils-2.28-1-mingw32-bin.tar.xz
mingw-get: *** ERROR *** required package file is not available
mingw-get: *** ERROR *** cannot install binutils-2.28-1-mingw32-bin.tar.xz
mingw-get: *** ERROR *** due to previous download failure
```

One of the packages failed.

Let me try installing it again.

12:20pm. I see that I can run cython from the Anaconda terminal.

https://youtu.be/mXuEoqK4bEc?t=1647

This part where it creates a html file is quite interesting. I will be studying this.

Let me finish the last two minutes of this vid and I will have breakfast.

12:40pm. The C/C++ plugin has the UI extension setting window, but where do I access it? Once the editor offered to open it in a popup, but I do not know how to access it besides that.

Forget this. I need to have breakfast here.

I've already verified that cython works from the command line. Next I'll try using the setup.py."

CG: Revise Git documentation

This completely reshapes CG section 3, "Working with source code".

- Remove obsolete and duplicate parts. This includes how to deal with
  git-formatted patches, for example (since our new workflow doesn't
  use them).
- Reorganise the rest entirely. Make it simpler and more straightforward.
  Also remove unnecessary technical details (these belong to external
  documentation).
- Drop the bit of instructions for using git-gui on Windows. A terminal
  was needed anyway. Instead, link to a list of Git GUIs on the official
  Git website. This is more likely to make new contributors happy since
  it seems those GUIs are more complete, elaborate and user-friendly.

The new structure is:
* Setting up
* Git cheat sheet
* Lifecycle of a Merge Request
* Common Git procedures
* Commit acces
* Further Git documentation resources
* Repository directory structure
* Other repositories

Improved Ritual descriptions (et al) (#1761)

* Updated book to match v3.0.4-9.

did a general quality pass, removed extranious $(item) tags where $(l:) tags were already being used, added a page for the explosive charges, added a description of blood transfer to and from the blood altar, added a 2x soulforge template, removed progress bar (for now)

* added changelog

also added links from the changelog to various relevant pages in the book, and added anchors accordingly.

* Update manual to 3.0.6-11

updated changelog, added page for Well of Suffering, rewrote entry on Explosive Charges, slightly tweaked the Anointments to better describe how they wear off, added a $(blood) tag to the manual (same colour as $(fire) so we can talk about Blood more dramatically. This is BLOOD magic after all! (Note, make sure this works - the word 'blood' in the Well of Suffering should be red.

* Improved Ritual Descriptions & Wills

Added links to a few things, formatted some bits to be prettier, elaborated on Fire Fuse, explained that benefits that improve with more Will in the aura don't care about other aspects,

* fixed overlapping URLs

might be a temporary fix until patchouli solves this bug on their end, but the 'NOT YET IMPLEMENTED' link was previously running-over into the clickable area for 'demon will'. Moving it to a new line should solve this.

* Anointments work on Explosives

... unless they don't, that is... Way, be sure to remove the bit for 'looting' working on charges if you can't crack that problem. (I've got faith in you, so i've left it in for now!)

* misc fixes

Cutting Fluid works with the Ritual of the Crusher, and the Self Sacrifice bonus is +150%, not 150%.
