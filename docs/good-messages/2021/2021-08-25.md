Improve betting howto document

Do minor fixes (grammar, typos, whitespace) to the betting howto
document. Of note, since the document uses the diff friendly, horrible
to read, one sentence per line format, we should at least be uniform.

Rant: My major dislike of this format, excluding that it looks bad in a
text editor is that its just way too easy to forget to do it and the
file either becomes non-uniform or you get code churn patches like this
one :)

Fixes cable merging, changes merging code just a little bit (#60997)

Makes stack code support merging two different stacks with the same mats, but different mats_per_unit numbers by implementing averages.

It's in an attempt to support the stupid efficiency shit that protolathes do. It's not great, but it ought to work alright for now. Kinda a bandaid

LUA - AI - AIUtilities Part 2 [Major Perf]

This is fucking magical. What happens in the redone AIGetMarkerLocations is that this runs ONCE at the beginning of the game and it gets all markers ONCE. This literally cuts out countless searches during the game during Jips Profiler this function was called and done 710+ times within the first few minutes of the game. Now, we dont do anything by return the cached version once its been done 1 time. This made during my test platoon response so so much faster all movements and such is done by getting the markerlocation and this function gets slower the bigger the marker table and since we have such dense grids of markers from Uveso's Marker Generator this saves countless amounts of time. You no longer have to search through the entire marker table ANYMORE.
Also I continued to remove tableinserts and such as well as change some ScenarioUtil look ups that we didnt need to do.
Removed another function that wasn't being used at all.
Standardized RetMarkers.

Kept logs for Jip because he'll love this one.

MemoryMakingBao: added audio dialogs

Oh boy oh boy, adding audio dialogs was much more work than I expected. But the result was worth it because it made the memory more immersive. I like the idea of connecting to the characters through their voices. Regardless of how long it took to implement the audio files, it was definitely easier to implement than written dialog.

I added my cousin's voice and mine to the Making Bao memory to see how it goes. I had a blast recording it with her. Also kinda weird hearing her call me "daddy"... uhhhh can't wait until I get someone else to take over the dad voice.

Added real game terrain; added base male (headless) with idle and walking animation; Added weather system; Adjusted audition page and various fixes; Setup camera lanes in quadrant at various angles

This commit packs in the art big time, and it's bringing much needed life. I should have dropped these art assets sooner. It really does change the perceived feelings (and that could even re-adjust priorities?). Anyways, we have a bunch of headless people walking around in a foggy, mystical landscape of four seasons. It somehow feels spiritual to watch headless beings walk in a barren landscape. This commit bears a few problems with the nav agent setup on the navmesh so sometimes the character bots get stuck in place (will fix that next).

zsh: Make config a little bit more universal

Up until this point I had been using macOS for around 2 years
exclusively, while that brought me a little joy in terms of
productivity, it didn't really when it comes to performance.

Anyways, the point is that my dotfiles are a mess right now, with
hardcoded paths that are macOS exclusive, a lot of macOS exclusive stuff
that I haven't even tested if it works in my Linux machine.

The point of this commit is to start moving towards a more universal
dotfiles repo. This includes:

- Properly using .zshenv
- Don't assume BSD/Linux for the ls command while still having colored
  output

In the future, I should be moving the "version manager" stuff out of
.zshrc because is a horrible mess and it's incredibly annoying to have
to keep that up to date.

mm: put_and_wait_on_page_locked() while page is migrated

Waiting on a page migration entry has used wait_on_page_locked() all along
since 2006: but you cannot safely wait_on_page_locked() without holding a
reference to the page, and that extra reference is enough to make
migrate_page_move_mapping() fail with -EAGAIN, when a racing task faults
on the entry before migrate_page_move_mapping() gets there.

And that failure is retried nine times, amplifying the pain when trying to
migrate a popular page.  With a single persistent faulter, migration
sometimes succeeds; with two or three concurrent faulters, success becomes
much less likely (and the more the page was mapped, the worse the overhead
of unmapping and remapping it on each try).

This is especially a problem for memory offlining, where the outer level
retries forever (or until terminated from userspace), because a heavy
refault workload can trigger an endless loop of migration failures.
wait_on_page_locked() is the wrong tool for the job.

David Herrmann (but was he the first?) noticed this issue in 2014:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=140110465608116&w=2

Tim Chen started a thread in August 2017 which appears relevant:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=150275941014915&w=2 where Kan Liang went
on to implicate __migration_entry_wait():
https://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=150300268411980&w=2 and the thread ended
up with the v4.14 commits: 2554db916586 ("sched/wait: Break up long wake
list walk") 11a19c7b099f ("sched/wait: Introduce wakeup boomark in
wake_up_page_bit")

Baoquan He reported "Memory hotplug softlock issue" 14 November 2018:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=154217936431300&w=2

We have all assumed that it is essential to hold a page reference while
waiting on a page lock: partly to guarantee that there is still a struct
page when MEMORY_HOTREMOVE is configured, but also to protect against
reuse of the struct page going to someone who then holds the page locked
indefinitely, when the waiter can reasonably expect timely unlocking.

But in fact, so long as wait_on_page_bit_common() does the put_page(), and
is careful not to rely on struct page contents thereafter, there is no
need to hold a reference to the page while waiting on it.  That does mean
that this case cannot go back through the loop: but that's fine for the
page migration case, and even if used more widely, is limited by the "Stop
walking if it's locked" optimization in wake_page_function().

Add interface put_and_wait_on_page_locked() to do this, using "behavior"
enum in place of "lock" arg to wait_on_page_bit_common() to implement it.
No interruptible or killable variant needed yet, but they might follow: I
have a vague notion that reporting -EINTR should take precedence over
return from wait_on_page_bit_common() without knowing the page state, so
arrange it accordingly - but that may be nothing but pedantic.

__migration_entry_wait() still has to take a brief reference to the page,
prior to calling put_and_wait_on_page_locked(): but now that it is dropped
before waiting, the chance of impeding page migration is very much
reduced.  Should we perhaps disable preemption across this?

shrink_page_list()'s __ClearPageLocked(): that was a surprise!  This
survived a lot of testing before that showed up.  PageWaiters may have
been set by wait_on_page_bit_common(), and the reference dropped, just
before shrink_page_list() succeeds in freezing its last page reference: in
such a case, unlock_page() must be used.  Follow the suggestion from
Michal Hocko, just revert a978d6f52106 ("mm: unlockless reclaim") now:
that optimization predates PageWaiters, and won't buy much these days; but
we can reinstate it for the !PageWaiters case if anyone notices.

It does raise the question: should vmscan.c's is_page_cache_freeable() and
__remove_mapping() now treat a PageWaiters page as if an extra reference
were held?  Perhaps, but I don't think it matters much, since
shrink_page_list() already had to win its trylock_page(), so waiters are
not very common there: I noticed no difference when trying the bigger
change, and it's surely not needed while put_and_wait_on_page_locked() is
only used for page migration.

tdf#137737 i18n search: don't expand start/end with regex ^ or $

If the regex starts with ^, that means that it
matches only at the beginning of the content.
So don't expand the beginning of the content
or else it won't match anymore.
Similarly, $ indicates matching at the end of the content.

For the unit test I just randomly guessed at SearchItem.AlgorithmType,
and it kinda worked. I love black boxes...
I hope I remember what i learned about TransformParameters()
which was parsed in sfx2/source/appl/appuno.cxx,
splitting the "variable" into Item.PropName = PropValue.
That is definite black magic.

ARROW-13202: [MATLAB] Enable GitHub Actions CI for MATLAB Interface on Linux

## Overview

This Pull Request:

1. Enables building of the MATLAB Interface C++ code, running of the C++ tests, and running of the MATLAB tests using GitHub Actions on an `ubuntu-latest` VM.

## Implementation

This implementation uses [`matlab-actions`](https://github.com/matlab-actions) to automatically install MATLAB into a GitHub Actions Linux VM.

We used the other `ci/scripts/<lang>_build.sh` scripts as inspiration for `matlab_build.sh`. Essentially, `matlab_build.sh` just invokes CMake, followed by CTest, to build and run the MATLAB Interface C++ source and tests. It also automatically builds the C++ Arrow libraries (i.e. `libarrow.so`) in the process. Support for automatically building `libarrow.so` as part of the MATLAB CMake build was added in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10614.

We realize that many of the other Arrow language bindings use Docker for their CI workflows on Linux. However, [`matlab-actions/setup-matlab`](https://github.com/matlab-actions/setup-matlab) does not currently support installing MATLAB into Docker containers in GitHub Actions, so we used a "bare" Linux VM-based approach.

## Testing

1. The GitHub Actions workflows pass successfully with no errors.
2. All C++ test results and MATLAB test results can be viewed in the the workflow logs.
3. We made code changes that caused C++ and MATLAB test failures and were able to verify that the GitHub Actions workflow failed as a result.

## Future Directions

1. Enable support for macOS and Windows. [`matlab-actions/setup-matlab`](https://github.com/matlab-actions/setup-matlab) only supports Linux-based VMs in GitHub Actions right now. However, we have a strong desire to support all major platforms for CI in the future. Hopefully, Linux CI support should hold us over until we can add support for other platforms.
2. Enable Docker-based builds for greater control over dependencies and build environment. We also recognize the benefits of developers being able to run CI workflows in local Docker containers for pre-qualification. [`matlab-actions/setup-matlab`](https://github.com/matlab-actions/setup-matlab) does not currently support installing MATLAB into GitHub Actions hosted Docker containers.
3. Reduce overall build time by separating out building of the Arrow C++ libraries from building of the MATLAB interface. This would also enable us to avoid running all of the C++ library tests unnecessarily during the MATLAB build by building GoogleTest separately.

## Notes

This was a Team effort! Several MathWorkers played important roles in getting this working!

1. @sreeharihegden did the **vast majority** of the groundwork to get this working! He's away for a while, so @sgilmore10 and I took over in his absence. Thank you for all of your hard work, Sreehari! **I think @sreeharihegden's commits are not getting properly associated with his GitHub account. I would greatly appreciate it if whoever ends up integrating these changes after review can ensure that his name is properly added as a Co-author for this pull request. Thank you!**

2. @sgilmore10 worked directly with me to get this working! Thank you, Sarah!
3. @lafiona also helped me out a great deal to understand GitHub Actions and nail down the exact source of the build issues we were encountering. Thank you, Fiona!

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Auto merge of #7578 - xFrednet:7172-update-some-docs, r=camsteffen

Small documentation update for the new metadata_collector

Just small documentation updates after the merge of the new metadata collection. I'm also here to deliver on the promised fairy tale:

*Once upon a time, there was a world with many languages. One of the oldest was C a very versatile language that gave great power for the cost of great complexity and manual work. C was so powerful that it was able to create new languages. There is Java a versatile language often used by companies and in formal settings. Python that focused on readability and rapid prototyping capabilities. JavaScript which has some interesting edge cases but was still loved and widely used in the world. Together they build the foundation of our world and continue to shape the interactions between kingdoms worldwide.*

*C ruled as the king of Linux and other operating systems alongside the Queen C++. Together they were powerful leaders, in fact so powerful that they have been ruling this world for over 49 years. They remain happy together and loved by the community. However, with great power comes great responsibility! The two of them have a dark secret. To tell the truth, they sometimes suffer from memory loss and even worse in some instances from race conditions.*

*A mystical creature called Firefox lead to the creation of Mozilla, a global organization fighting for privacy and for their market share in the browser marked. As part of this fight, they started to modify parts of Firefox and eventually created Servo. A completely new creature with a new language called Rust. This new form of communication was focussed on correctness, speed and a new model of memory management.*

*Rust grew up over several years with modification to syntax, content among other things. Finally, in 2015 Rust has reached adulthood which enabled it to take part in the global discourse and shape the future of our world. Some even say that this was the start of a new area withing language design.*

*Rust had already started to build its kingdom and was now the head of a complete organization, with teams being in charge of individual tools used for further development. One team focussing on further improving Rust when it comes to complexity, style and performance was **The Clippy Team**. Its members were a friendly bunch, with mages and wizards among them.*

*With the goal of giving more power to Rust, they identified a Python tool inside Clippy that could be rewritten. This led to the creating of the **Metadata collection monster**. This monster soon replaced the old Python tool and allowed for new creative additions inside Clippy's lint list. With the eradication of the old tool, there came a possibility to update the configuration documentation to span over a lager area. This was done, but some doc comments remained until now in memory of the old tool. This is now the PR that removes these doc comments.*

---

I have to stop now, this already took way longer than the actual changes. It probably also contains some spelling mistakes, but oh well. I hope you get the gist of it :upside_down_face:.

remove RxJS code from the transports code

After doing a proof-of-concept looking at how some parts of the code
looks like without RxJS (#916), this is a first functional proposal
which looks good enough to me to be merged.

It removes all RxJS code from the `transports` code in `src/transports`.

As a reminder, the reasons for doing this are:

  1. Observables are complicated and full of implicit behaviors
     (lazily running, sync or async, unsubscribing automatically after
     the last unsubscription etc.) which is difficult to reason about,
     especially for a newcomer.

     Things like exploiting schedulers through the `deferSubscriptions`
     util to work-around some subtle potential race-conditions, or
     merging Observables in a specific order for similar reasons, are
     ugly hacks that are difficult to explain to someone not familiar
     with that code.

     Even for us with multiple years of experience with it, we sometimes
     struggle with it.

  2. Promises, event listeners - and direct callbacks in general - are
     generally much more explicit and most developpers (at least JS/TS
     devs) are familiar with them.

  3. Call stacks are close to inexploitable when using RxJS.

  4. Promises provide async/await syntax which can improve drastically
     the readability of our async-heavy code, which for the moment
     suffer from callback hells almost everywhere.

However, I'm still not sure if this wish (getting rid of RxJS) is shared
by other maintainers and/or contributors, so it is still only a proposal.

Thoughts?

Add net_http_connect_on_start to WebMock calls

There's a weird problem with WebMock that it looks like we're not alone in running into only in ruby 2.7, although there's no techniccal reason it shouldn't have effected earlier ruby. It's also unclear why it only effects us sometimes seemingly non-determinstically -- not happening in master, but was happening in my blacklight upgrading branch.

Also honestly unclear to me why WebMock isn't doing this config by default since it's such a weird gotcha! Links to more info such as I could find it are included in comments by relevant code.

Anyway, we'll just get it into master now, to avoid future headaches, doesn't seem to hurt anything and fixes things for me in my present in-progress work.

  tuple.__repr__ did not consider a reference loop as it is not possible from
  Python code; but it is possible from C.  object.__str__ had the issue of not
  expecting a type to doing something within it's tp_str implementation that
  could trigger an infinite recursion, but it could in C code..  Both found
  thanks to BaseException and how it handles its repr.

  Closes issue #1686386.  Thanks to Thomas Herve for taking an initial stab at
  coming up with a solution.

  Made the various is_* operations return booleans.  This was discussed
  with Cawlishaw by mail, and he basically confirmed that to these is_*
  operations, there's no need to return Decimal(0) and Decimal(1) if
  the language supports the False and True booleans.

  Also added a few tests for the these functions in extra.decTest, since
  they are mostly untested (apart from the doctests).

  Thanks Mark Dickinson

  Let the O/S supply a port if none of the default ports can be used.
  This should make the tests more robust at the expense of allowing
  tests to be sloppier by not requiring them to cleanup after themselves.
  (It will legitamitely help when running two test suites simultaneously
  or if another process is already using one of the predefined ports.)

  Also simplifies (slightLy) the exception handling elsewhere.
