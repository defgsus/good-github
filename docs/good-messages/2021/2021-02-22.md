Bug fixes and credits update from design session

Apparently I forgot how parenting works in DOTS. That was such a stupid bug! I get that maybe someone would want to separate parenting from positioning, but at the same time, does that really justify needing to add two components to an entity to parent something?

Overall, the design session lead to a better mouse look, a material for the k-wings, a sound effect for the k-wings that is very satisfying (it sounds different from within the cockpit in a realistic way that I wasn't expecting), and more bugfixes.

I'll be slowly updating the designs throughout the week, but for now I need to get some more documentation done while my mind is weekend fresh.

I'm really cutting this close to a February release, and I really wish I had some help, but such is life I guess.

Create proper racial names for player monsters.

True racial player monsters are now realized, but the level of immersion
was ruined a bit by seeing things like 'dwarven barbarian named Steve
the Pillager'... how many dwarves do you know named Steve? So I took
some time to create structs for each player monster race, for both males
and females. The function get_mplname() has been completely redone. All
of the devteam names have been rolled up into the human race names
struct, and all of the racial names have been created from scratch (big
thanks to https://https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/ for making this
a lot easier to do).

Also in this commit - using a stethoscope or a wand of probing on a
monster will show its gender. Initially did this to make it easier to
test monster spawns, but then decided what the hell, keep it in.
FYI, neuters currently show as female.

chore(rds): add PG12.5 and deprecate PG9.5 and PG9.6 (#12998)

Added PostgreSQL 12.5 version.

Also, I got a friendly email from AWS that some versions of PG will be forcefully updated, and I've decided to mark PG9.5 and 9.6 as deprecated. (Feb 2021 and Nov 2021 EOLs respectfully).

> Amazon RDS is starting the end of life process for PostgreSQL major version 9.5. We are doing this because the PostgreSQL community is planning to discontinue support for PostgreSQL 9.5 on February 11, 2021 [1].
> 
> Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 will reach end of life on February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.6 will reach end of life in late 2021. Hence, we strongly encourage you to upgrade your databases running PostgreSQL major version 9.5 to 12 or greater at your convenience before February 16, 2021. PostgreSQL 12 contains major innovations including JSON path queries per SQL/JSON specifications and pluggable table storage interface [2]. PostgreSQL 13 introduced parallel processing of indexes with the VACUUM command and improved duplicate data handling by B-tree indexes [3]. Both versions contain numerous fixes to various software defects in earlier versions of the database.
> 
> If you do not upgrade your databases before February 16, 2021, RDS will upgrade your PostgreSQL 9.5 databases to PostgreSQL 12 during a scheduled maintenance window between Feb 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC and March 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC. On March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC, any PostgreSQL 9.5 databases that remain will be upgraded to version 12 regardless of whether the instances are in a maintenance window or not.
> 
> You can initiate an upgrade of your database instance — either immediately or during your next maintenance window — to a newer major version of PostgreSQL using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface. The upgrade process will shut down the database instance, perform the upgrade, and restart the database instance. The database instance may be restarted multiple times during the upgrade process. While major version upgrades typically complete within the standard maintenance window, the duration of the upgrade depends on the number of objects within the database. To avoid any unplanned unavailability outside your maintenance window, we recommend that you first take a snapshot of your database and test the upgrade to get an estimate of the duration. To learn more about upgrading PostgreSQL major versions in RDS, review the Upgrading Database Versions page [4].
> 
> We want to make you aware of the following additional milestones associated with upgrading these databases that are reaching end of life.
> 
> Now through March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - You can initiate upgrades of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to PostgreSQL 12 or higher at any time.
> February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - After this date and time, you cannot create new RDS instances with PostgreSQL major version 9.5 from either the AWS Console or the CLI. RDS will also automatically upgrade PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 within the earliest scheduled maintenance window that follows. Restoration of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 database snapshots will result in an automatic upgrade of the restored database to a still supported version at the time.
> March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - RDS will automatically upgrade any remaining PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 whether or not they are in a maintenance window.
> Should you have any questions or concerns, the AWS Support Team is available on the community forums and via Premium Support [5].

WIP: Completely re-imagine the project

Okay, this is a doozie.

I kept thinking about the DEFINE-TREE macro and how much I hated it.
Its MASSIVE, the code is ugly, and its awkward to use.  I kept
thinking about how I wanted generic functions with static dispatch.
It would make DEFINE-TREE so much nicer!

Yeah, there are inline generic functions, but they suck.  They're
skin-deep!  Its so easy to find yourself in a situation where the
compiler doesn't have enough information to eliminate the type
dispatch.  E.g. introducing a helper function can easily break the
type information unless you're very careful.  Also, it inverts the
compile order.  The functions provided by DEFINE-TREE would need to be
compiled AFTER all tree types were defined.  Gross.

I really wished I had C++ templates, honestly.  That's not a thought I
ever thought I'd have!  I went down a rabbit hole of learning about
how exactly they work so I could model them in this project, but
ultimately I decided it was WAY overkill for my needs.

At the same time, I was thinking about how annoyed I was that uses of
generic functions were slipping in here and there just because it was
so awkward to do anything else.  For example, the ITERATOR-TOOLS
module had several calls to generic functions.  I wanted my
implementations of the data structures to be GF-free, but keeping it
that way was proving difficult.

I saw a way for these two problems to be solved at the same time.  If
DEFINE-TREE's functions took in something akin to a C++ vtable, then
they wouldn't need to call any GFs but would still be able to find the
right functions for traversing and manipulating the tree.  Neat!

Ah shoot, but that would lose the neat property of DEFINE-TREE where
all the function calls are completely static.  Vtable dispatch is
probably faster than a GF, but its not as nice as the static dispatch.

Okay, but that's where the idea of C++ templates come in.  What if I
could, on demand, create a "specialized" version of the DEFINE-TREE
functions that consulted a *specific* vtable instead of an arbitrary
one.  Then, a little compiler macro magic would be all it takes to
make the calls to vtable functions into static calls.  Neato!

At that point, why would I use GFs anywhere?  I could just pass
interface objects around and specialize the functions consuming them
as I see fit.

So that's what I did.

mnm_assasin_events

Assassins debt amount owed now visible in the tooltip of the modifier
The assassins_debt modifier was renamed to assassins_debt_modifier as sharing a name with variable was interfering with the localisation.
Only paranoid characters will falsly suspect their spouse of cheating while high, as intended
MNM.6812 now picks more appropriate lovers
The Friend or Foe event chain now chooses a target similar in age to you, rather than dissimilar
Outcome of MNM.6906 now affected by if the target is attracted to the sender rather than themself
Now actually kicks to the backup event if your inductor dies mid induction

To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause—there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.
