Add support for pointers and interfaces.

Add support for our setUnknownable and setNullable interfaces, as well
as for the AttributeValue interface and the tftypes.ValueConverter
interface.

This involved some sleight of hand. We want to have an empty version of
the type implementing the interface, but that type may be a pointer, so
an empty version would be nil, which leads to accidental panics. Which
we don't want. Worse, it could, in theory, be a pointer to a pointer to
a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer... you get the idea. So
we needed a new `pointerSafeZeroValue` that would find whatever type
underlies all the pointers, create a zero value of it, and then create a
pointer to that zero value, matching the level of indirection.

We also stopped converting values to interfaces to call the method
directly, letting us avoid nil pointer panics. It's more verbose, but
using reflection lets us have zero values and just not worry about
things that are nil. Much better.

Add support for pointers, dereferencing them and reflecting on the type
they implement, then wrapping that in a pointer on the way back out.
This also involves some sleight of hand to make the pointer settable,
but with some ingenuity and some cursed convoluted code, we manage it.
See comments in the reflectPointer function for more details.

Don't handle interface kinds, because there's no solid type underlying
them, and I don't feel like picking one. People can set real types, it's
ok.

Add tests for setUnknownable, setNullable, and AttributeValue values, as
well as for maps and pointers.

Supporting AttributeValue as targets required AttributeValues to gain a
SetTerraformValue method, updating the contents to match a
tftypes.Value. This required our AttributeValues to become pointers.
Annoying. It also required our composite AttributeValues to have
AttributeTypes as the ElemType, so they could create new AttributeValues
in the AttributeValue.SetTerraformValue method, if needed. This, in
turn, required AttributeType to gain an Equal method, so the
AttributeValue Equal method could compare AttributeTypes. Exhausting.

Also, we're actually testing that complex structs are having their
properties set correctly now, which is novel and neat. (They are.)

fix apparmor dereferencing potentially freed dentry, sanitize __d_path() API

__d_path() API is asking for trouble and in case of apparmor d_namespace_path()
getting just that.  The root cause is that when __d_path() misses the root
it had been told to look for, it stores the location of the most remote ancestor
in *root.  Without grabbing references.  Sure, at the moment of call it had
been pinned down by what we have in *path.  And if we raced with umount -l, we
could have very well stopped at vfsmount/dentry that got freed as soon as
prepend_path() dropped vfsmount_lock.

It is safe to compare these pointers with pre-existing (and known to be still
alive) vfsmount and dentry, as long as all we are asking is "is it the same
address?".  Dereferencing is not safe and apparmor ended up stepping into
that.  d_namespace_path() really wants to examine the place where we stopped,
even if it's not connected to our namespace.  As the result, it looked
at ->d_sb->s_magic of a dentry that might've been already freed by that point.
All other callers had been careful enough to avoid that, but it's really
a bad interface - it invites that kind of trouble.

The fix is fairly straightforward, even though it's bigger than I'd like:
	* prepend_path() root argument becomes const.
	* __d_path() is never called with NULL/NULL root.  It was a kludge
to start with.  Instead, we have an explicit function - d_absolute_root().
Same as __d_path(), except that it doesn't get root passed and stops where
it stops.  apparmor and tomoyo are using it.
	* __d_path() returns NULL on path outside of root.  The main
caller is show_mountinfo() and that's precisely what we pass root for - to
skip those outside chroot jail.  Those who don't want that can (and do)
use d_path().
	* __d_path() root argument becomes const.  Everyone agrees, I hope.
	* apparmor does *NOT* try to use __d_path() or any of its variants
when it sees that path->mnt is an internal vfsmount.  In that case it's
definitely not mounted anywhere and dentry_path() is exactly what we want
there.  Handling of sysctl()-triggered weirdness is moved to that place.
	* if apparmor is asked to do pathname relative to chroot jail
and __d_path() tells it we it's not in that jail, the sucker just calls
d_absolute_path() instead.  That's the other remaining caller of __d_path(),
BTW.
        * seq_path_root() does _NOT_ return -ENAMETOOLONG (it's stupid anyway -
the normal seq_file logics will take care of growing the buffer and redoing
the call of ->show() just fine).  However, if it gets path not reachable
from root, it returns SEQ_SKIP.  The only caller adjusted (i.e. stopped
ignoring the return value as it used to do).

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Iran and East Asia Update

-	Reworked the starting political map and lore for Iran
o	Iran is now divided between the Shaki Khanate, the Shekhbizin Empire, the Kar-Kiya and the Timurtash
	Timurtash Dynasty: The remnants of the last dynasty to unite all of Iran after the splintering of the Timurid Empire. A Persianized Sunni dynasty of Khorasani-Turkmen origin, their long-standing rivalry with the Ottoman Empire over the Caucasus proved to be their undoing. The catastrophic loss of the Caucasian regions in the late 18th Century precipitated its collapse
	Shaki Khanate: A Turkoman polity that came to dominate the Southern Caucasus after the collapse of Ottoman authority in the region
	Shekhbizin Empire: The largest state to emerge from the Timurtash collapse, the Shekhbizin started as a Lurish tribe that came to dominate most of Southern Iran, including the key citites of Isfahan and Shiraz
	Kar-Kiya: A venerable Shia dynasty with its powerbase in Gilan-Mazandaran. Originally a vassal under the Timurtash Empire, following a series of humiliating defeats against the Ottomans they started a rebellion against the Sunni Timurtash
o	Re-worked pops in Iran. More Persian pops have been added to regions with historical Persian influence (Transoxiana and the Caucasus, as well as the Greater Khorasan area). Additionally, regions that were depopulated by OTL wars (i.e. Bam and Kerman, razed by the Qajars IOTL).  Iran is now religiously diverse due to the lack of a Safavid Empire proselytizing Shiism in this timeline.
o	Added Tat, Caspian, Lurish and Nuristani cultures
o	Replaced Tajiks and Hazara with Persian pops
o	Added 11 new provinces to better reflect the political and cultural borders in the region
o	Ported the reworked terrain for the Iranian plateau from HPM 0.44. Basic terrain features such as the Zagros and the Hindu Kush are now much better represented
o	Added the principalities of Imereti and Samstkhe and the Shamkhalate of Tarki as Shaki vassals
o	Added the Khanate of Kalat as a Sindi vassal
o	Added an event for the Khanate of Kalat to break free in the 1840s
o	Added an event for the Ottomans to lose cores on Iran and Iraq if they haven’t retaken Baghdad and beaten the rebellions by 1840
o	Added a decision for the Timurtash to colonise the Kara-Kum and Kyzyl-Su
o	Reworked OOBs for the starting nations
-	Big thanks to Atlas and Varro for their contributions to the new lore. Extra thanks to Atlas for allowing me to use some of his provinces as templates
-	Occitania, should it spawn, not has a valid starting party
-	Fixed the Spanish Commonwealth Friendship Treaty events
-	Gran Colombia dissolution events will now not fire if Granada exists as a vassal (i.e. in the partial peace event chain)
-	Sedentarising as the Crimean Khanate now no longer requires Astrakhan to be owned
-	Added a decision for Astrakhan or Tatarstan to renovate the city of Astrakhan, giving it a population boom and increasing its life rating
-	Simplified the requirements for the Glorious Revolution triggering a Congress event
-	Halved factory needs for dye and silk to ensure better supply
-	New loading screens and menu art
-	East Asia update by Boytoy:
o	Reworked borders between Chinese nations
o	Chinese states have been renamed and redrawn
o	Changed pops in Manchuria and Zhejiang
o	De-pin yined some Provinces aswell as removing European named regions and provinces
o	Changed some inner workings (capitals, cultures, religions) of some of the Chinese nations
-	Bugfixes by PlazmaticulRO:
o	Vryland can now also trigger the scripted peace with Burgundy during the Boer War
o	Vryland can now also get the Trek Boer immigration modifier upon forming South Africa, granted it has researched Medicine, State and Government and Functionalism
o	Arcadia, Ameriga and Yugoslavia can now also be formed by puppeting instead of sphering
o	Forming Germany now sets a population boom in Frankfurt am Main
o	Polynesia’s Embrace the Micronesians decision now requires Taitung to be owned
o	Gran Colombia can now purchase Cuba
o	Gran Colombia can now accept Athesians, Caribeños and Ayitians
o	The Falklands can now also be purchased by the Holy Britannian Empire
o	Forming Russia now gives Chuvash, Komi, Mari, Mordvin and Udmurt as accepted cultures
o	Added more Ruthenian soldier pops in Muscovy
o	Reduced justification time for the Acquire Substate Core CB
o	Enabled the increased/decreased justification time events for a bunch of CBs

-> PERCENTILE >62% (~ >69%) :-/ :-( <- stupid problem D
rank: 3135/8432
-> PERCENTILE >62% :-/ :-(
rating: -20 -> 915 (provisional) [6 KYU] :-( :-(
performance as 806 :-(
- I came on time/in advance!!!
- What could I have done better????! Problem D sucks!

Analysis:
- tested new Vim <F5> shortcut -> yank file content -> clipboard
  -> superfaster!
- first 2 problems in <6 min
- first 3 problems in <25 min
- got stuck on 4th problem -> submitted at 1:34:32 (i.e. ~70min :-()
  -> better total time overall (compared to ABC 201)
- 3/4 ACs, 1/4 WA/TLE :-/ :-(

A:
- hesitations: started implementing with A, B, C variable
  - but changed to vector<ll> and compare via abc[i]
=> DECIDE IN ADVANCE ON A,B,C... VARIABLES VS VEC OF VARS!!
- quite lengthy solution for A :-/
  -> editorial?

B:
- original idea with string manip + stoll
- faster via 100*n+k
=> CONSIDER BUILDING INTEGERS DIRECTLY!
   - before `string manip + stoll`

C:
- simulation w/ skipping intermediate steps
  - directly to end positions (i.e. towns w/ friends)
- presubmit bug -> slowed down :-/
  - forgot to update `curPos=AB.F;`
=> WHILE RE-READING, CHECK EACH VARIABLE/STATE GETS UPDATED!!
  - especially in loops
  - `if (steps<0)` instead of `if (steps>K)`
=> THINK HARD ABOUT IF CONDITIONS / THE LOGIC OF THE ALGO!!!

D:
- sliding window
  - compute median via ordered_set in O(log K^2)
    - policy-based data structure available in gcc
  - but updates take O(K) * O(log K^2)
    - per each of O((N-K)^2) window
    -> amounts to worse than O(N^3) solution :-/ :-(
- likely wrong idea/design
  -> to upsolve!
- but only 775 ACs /3218 submissions (~24%)!
  - genuinely hard/tricky?

### Introduction


A heart attack (also known as a myocardial infarction or MI) occurs when a blood clot blocks a coronary artery, causing heart muscle damage and death. Coronary arteries are blood channels that give blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. A coronary artery blockage deprives the heart muscle of blood and oxygen, resulting in heart muscle damage. Chest pain and a feeling of pressure in the chest are symptoms of a heart muscle injury. If blood supply to the heart muscle is not restored within 20 to 40 minutes, permanent heart muscle death will commence. Muscle continues to die for another six to eight hours after which the heart attack is considered "complete."
