Don't add versions of resource already present in the database

Problem: (copied from the commit with the title:
"Don't add inactive versions of resources as new resources"
(I cannot say the git hash because it's only local here
for now, so it would be incorrect anyway)

---
KisResourceCacheDb, noticing the resource already
exists, checks for timestamp and adds a new version if needed.
However at this point it *shouldn't* be needed, ever, no matter what
timestamps say.

If a filepath is in the database, then it means Krita knows about it
and already has this filepath remembered. Adding a new version with
the same filepath doesn't sound reasonable. If the user replaced one
resource with the same, called the same way, it means we might need
to update the thumbnail and/or the name, but adding anything to the
database - no, because there is no *more* resources, they were
*replaced*.

With proper versioning and the feature "revert to previous version",
it will lead to even more trouble, with the newest-by-timestamp
version replacing the user-selected current version on every restart.
---

This resulted in multiple versions with -1 number and generally
duplication of versions.

Instead, we should just update the timestamp. (Also why would we use
timestamp now, anyway?) Note: this commit doesn't do that yet.

[MIRROR] Removes the gen_turfs from icebox arrivals (#204)

* Removes the gen_turfs from icebox arrivals, they don't god damn do anything because they are literally just placeholders for areas, and they aren't in the right fucking area. Also gets rid of some dumb plating that makes the area looks worse imo (#56107)

New data: 2021-01-12. See data notes for important messages.

NT testing decreased today for an unknown reason.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition betwen data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

Upcoming changes (specific dates to be announced soon):

- The data structure of time series data will change in response to user feedback. This will only consist of adding additional columns to make the data easier to work with. The core columns will remain the same, for now. More details to follow. Initially, the updated dataset will be provided alongside the new dataset. After a time, the new data format will completely replace the old format.

Recent changes:

- 2021-01-08: The directories cases_extra and mortality_extra have been moved to other/cases_extra and other/mortality_extra.

Revise historical data: cases (AB, BC, MB, ON); mortality (MB, ON, QC); testing (NT).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “The data also report 47 new deaths, but the total of deaths amounts to 8,782 due to the withdrawal of 2 deaths that the investigation has shown not to be attributable to COVID-19. Among these 47 deaths, 13 have occurred in the last 24 hours, 27 have occurred between January 5 and January 10, 4 have occurred before January 5 and 3 have occurred at an unknown date.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

test: Fake EOL date of Fedora 28

We write the year 2020. Forgotten by the masses, and shadowed by the
turmoils of the COVID-19 pandemic, a little gray Linux distribution took
its last breath and withered away. The big Lib Virt forgot about its
once loved child, and refused to ever look at it again.

But a small group of intrepid developers put on their red helmets^Whats,
mounted their cockpit, and went out to salvage it. Never shall the world
forget "Fedora 28" again, and it will still stand strong long after
every other penguin in the world ate their last fish.

---

Boring technical epilogue: libvirt only allows installing a distribution
up to a year after its EOL. Make sure that we don't run into that trap
anytime soon again.

Closes #14177

"11am. I went to bed far too late yesterday.

11:05am. Let me read the OPM dump and then I'll do some work on the docs.

11:20am. Let me work on the docs for an hour. I need to get into this for a bit. It is time to start wrapping things up.

///

The previous segment is not all there is to serialization. I could have picked other subjects to demonstrate the language's prowess at abstraction, but serialization is a common task that other languages rarely do without flaw. It will only get more important as time goes on. When I picked F# as main target in the old version of Spiral it was mistake because I had no automatic way to manage GPU memory. Yet, the future hardware will not have unified memory and it won't be necessary to deal with unmanaged pointers like in the past. Instead it will all be about message passing between isolated cores, and being able to succinctly and efficiently serialize data in various formats and having it cross various kinds of boundaries is Spiral's greatest strength.

Back in 2016, I ran into a fairly extreme serialization challenge when trying to pass data to a NN agent. At that time, I had no idea how to do pickler combinators so my situation was that much worse - I fervently wished for some way to map a regular type to a sequence of one-hot vectors.

An one-hot vector is an array whose elements are all 0, apart from a single element which is 1. I needed an efficient way to do this task - I tried doing it by hand in C style, but the problem with doing that quickly becomes aparent. It is extemely unsafe and very hard to do. It is a killer combination that slowly set me on the path of being a language designer.

Imagine you are doing a NN-based poker agent, and the you are trying to pass an input to its model. The is a simple HU poker variant with two cards. Here is how the game state could be modeled.

```
type rank = i32
type suit = i32
type card = rank * suit
type player = {
    stack : i32
    hand : card * card
    }
type pot = i32
type game = player * player * pot
```

We'll assume that the opponent's previous action could be inferred from the size of the pot. But the player should receive his previous action during this betting round. So the actual player input would be something like this.

```
union action =
    | Raise: i32
    | Call
    | NoAction
type player_view = {
    stack_self : i32
    stack_opp : i32
    pot : i32
    hand : card * card
    prev_action : action
    }
```

This `player_view` is what needs to be serialized. Compared to the previous scheme, things are more difficult this time. There are two main challenges.

1) Serializing arbirary ints is far too wasteful. An int converted to a one hot-vector would take 2Gb. Instead one has to account for maximum and minimum stack sizes which might be between 0 to a few 100 chips. Suits are only 4, and the number of different cards is 13. In other words, the problem is that unlike in the previous section, the type no longer corresponds to the representation being used. It would be great if Spiral had dependent types so that bounded ints could be used, but that is not the case here. There is no problem with using ints for stack sizes and such inside the game itself, but they are huge problem to serialize in the one-hot format.

2) Dealing with sizes. As in the previous section, the union types are tricky here because one case is prefixed by the rest.

---

Because of the added difficulties, unlike when it comes to vanilla serialization, the introspective approach is no longer so obviously superior to the introspective one. If all the bounds are known at compile time, an introspective approach would involve using nominals with symbolic bounds which would require hackery like converting symbols to ints to serve as bounds. I previously had the idea of specifying the size using a prototype function, but something like `prototype size a : i32` is not allowed in Spiral because `a` is an unused forall variable.

In the old version of Spiral, I did not use pickler combinators, but I still had to specify a schema even there, so the advantages of the introspective approach is minimal over the combinator one.

///

Let me back this up here. I'll redo this from the start.

11:40am. I see that I got a reply from somebody trying out Spiral on Linux. Forget the docs for the time being.

///

> However, when I try to use it, I see a notification: "Spiral: The server has aborted with an error."

This happens when the VS Code plugin runs the server process, but the process aborts for some reason.

///

12:35pm. Let me have breakfast here. I opened an issue on the Spiral repo and put down my thoughs. For the rest of the day, I'll focus on dealing with the last segment. After that I'll clear up some space on my hard drive and get Linux to install."

Here we go again. More James. Look if you read through this, James's words are in here. He doesn't bring her up unless she out right attacks his home and life. Most cases, we do not hear from him unless she sends the cops at him, or other people. Which she has done, she screams she doesn't but, she has. And no one in the Dibney Cru believes her lies. Because again, it has changed. Her story has changed again. It always does. She is back to screaming James knew her at 9. Lisa nixed that quickly and said no James didn't come into their lives till she was into her later years like 19teen 20 years old. So no one is believing her BS.

Hacked. Lord help us, we know she was not hacked. We have a lot of the proof that WillowtheWay or whatever the Willow name is, was not hacked. Because we found all of it. So again, its a load of BS. She does this, as one of the girls said in the discord, that she screams hacked when she is caught being abusive. Which is every day. 

We all know she is crazy but I want to bring up something I find hysterical. So she keeps bringing up her IQ. She has admitted that she had it done in her late teens and it was a Mensa score of 77... Yeah. At the height of when those tests are often taken, she scored a 77. Which makes her a moron. An idiot. Average is 85 to 95-120 depending on who you take the test through.  So again she is a moron. We are not calling her an Idiot because its an opinion, we are calling her an idiot because it is fact. Comparatively against many of us in the discord we run IQ scores from 95 to 162.  Mine is 132 which to give you an idea this is what that means 

"A score of 116 or more is considered above average. A score of 130 or higher signals a high IQ. Membership in Mensa, the High IQ society, includes people who score in the top 2 percent, which is usually 132 or higher." Jan 28, 2020 

Her score of 77 puts her here "70 to 84: Borderline mental disability." which we know. Also "Borderline intellectual functioning, also called borderline mental retardation (in the ICD-8), is a categorization of intelligence wherein a person has below average cognitive ability (generally an IQ of 70–85), but the deficit is not as severe as intellectual disability (below 70)." So not retarded, but not smart either.

We know for a fact, she googles everything, and often does not comprehend all she reads, twisting it to fit her narrative. We have seen it time and time again. I have seen it when she attacked me before the Dibney Cru was formed.  It is like a synapse is not firing right to allow her to comprehend what she is reading does not always apply to her or can be used by her. Take law for instance.

But I am rattling. Anyways. That is the past 24 hours.

Merge #602

602: +Debug for CoordinateType r=frewsxcv a=michaelkirk

- [x] I agree to follow the project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/georust/geo/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- [TODO] I added an entry to `CHANGES.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users.
---

This is intended to address https://github.com/georust/geo/issues/597

I took a broader approach, and wonder if people are interested in it. The tldr is:

### geo-types
- deprecate `CoordinateType`; (now includes `std::fmt::Debug`)
- Add `trait CoordNum: CoordinateType;` 
- Add `trait CoordFloat: CoordNum + num_traits::Float`

### geo
Add `trait GeoNum: CoordNum + HasKernel`
Add `trait GeoFloat: CoordFloat + HasKernel`

**downstream adoption**

If your crate interops with geo-types, you may need  to make changes like this:

```
pub fn foo<T>(line_string: &geo_types::LineString<T>)
where
-    T: num_traits::Float,
+    T: geo_types::CoordFloat,
{
```

or this (this one is actually only a deprecation, so you could leave it as is for now, but eventually you'll need to make the change):
```
pub fn foo<T>(line_string: &geo_types::LineString<T>)
where
-    T: geo_types::CoordinateType
+    T: geo_types::CoordNum
{
```

**alternative considered**

If I went with the minimal approach to adding Debug trait, changes would instead need to look like this:

This one, for non-floats, could remain untouched:
```
pub fn foo<T>(line_string: &geo_types::LineString<T>)
where
    T: geo_types::CoordinateType
{
```

But anything restricted to floats would need to explicitly include Debug

```
pub fn foo<T>(line_string: &geo_types::LineString<T>)
where
-    T: num_traits::Float,
+    T: num_traits::Float + std::fmt::Debug,
{
```

**motivation:**

I initially completed #597 with the most conservative approach, achieved in the first two commits. The first simply adds Debug to CoordinateType and the second fixes the resulting compiler errors. 

This is a breaking change for anyone constraining generic implementations to just `num_traits::Float`, e.g. like [geojson crate does](https://github.com/georust/geojson/blob/master/src/conversion/to_geo_types.rs#L31) (fix here: https://github.com/georust/geojson/compare/mkirk/geo-types-0.7?expand=1), and polylabel (fix here: https://github.com/urschrei/polylabel-rs/compare/master...michaelkirk:mkirk/geo-types-0.7?expand=1)

Compare this to a crate like [geo-booleanop](https://github.com/21re/rust-geo-booleanop/blob/master/lib/src/boolean/helper.rs#L61), for which things "just work" because they targeted CoordinateType.

This got me thinking that, similar to #577 (yet unreleased), if we want people to write code targeting geo-types in a generic way, it might be helpful to make it clearer and easier how to do so.

So, I've added a CoordFloat and a CoordNum which is basically just a rename of CoordinateType, and applied them liberally within our own code base. I'm hoping this would drive others to reach for these traits rather than specific num_traits when implementing code intended for generic geo-types interop. 

For crates like geo-booleanop, which targeted CoordinateType, things "just work" after the update, but they'll see a deprecation notice like:
```
$ cargo build
warning: use of deprecated trait `geo_types::CoordinateType`: use `CoordFloat` or `CoordNum` instead
 --> lib/src/boolean/helper.rs:2:29
  |
2 | use geo_types::{Coordinate, CoordinateType};
  |                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
  = note: `#[warn(deprecated)]` on by default
```

Which I think is acceptably clear.

It's a large number of lines changed change overall, I know! But it's mostly mechanical, and I thought, since we're breaking geo-types, maybe this is a good time to bite the bullet and avoid some future pain. 

If it's too controversial, as I said, the minimal amount of change we need to enable Debug for CoordinateType is the first three commits (through and including "address fallout of "Add Debug to CoordinateType"). It's still a pretty big change with just that, and note that this will still break the crates I mentioned. I intend to fix the ones I know about, but there's a long tail of crates, which is why I hate breaking geo-types. 

In the few that I've checked it's been quick to adapt to the change, but it might be worth announcing and letting sit open for a while in case downstream geo-types users want to weigh in.

Update chat/matrix-synapse to 1.25

Synapse 1.25.0 (2021-01-13)
===========================

Ending Support for Python 3.5 and Postgres 9.5
----------------------------------------------

With this release, the Synapse team is announcing a formal deprecation policy for our platform dependencies, like Python and PostgreSQL:

All future releases of Synapse will follow the upstream end-of-life schedules.

Which means:

* This is the last release which guarantees support for Python 3.5.
* We will end support for PostgreSQL 9.5 early next month.
* We will end support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 near the end of the year.

Crucially, this means __we will not produce .deb packages for Debian 9 (Stretch) or Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)__ beyond the transition period described below.

The website https://endoflife.date/ has convenient summaries of the support schedules for projects like [Python](https://endoflife.date/python) and [PostgreSQL](https://endoflife.date/postgresql).

If you are unable to upgrade your environment to a supported version of Python or Postgres, we encourage you to consider using the [Synapse Docker images](./INSTALL.md#docker-images-and-ansible-playbooks) instead.

### Transition Period

We will make a good faith attempt to avoid breaking compatibility in all releases through the end of March 2021. However, critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies or other unanticipated circumstances may arise which necessitate breaking compatibility earlier.

We intend to continue producing .deb packages for Debian 9 (Stretch) and Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) through the transition period.

Removal warning
---------------

The old [Purge Room API](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/docs/admin_api/purge_room.md)
and [Shutdown Room API](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/docs/admin_api/shutdown_room.md)
are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. They will be replaced by the
[Delete Room API](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#delete-room-api).

`POST /_synapse/admin/v1/rooms/<room_id>/delete` replaces `POST /_synapse/admin/v1/purge_room` and
`POST /_synapse/admin/v1/shutdown_room/<room_id>`.

Jingle all the way with opera tab completion

It's time to fulfil our quest that was desired to be done from times
of yore (#56). And since Christmas is about giving back and caring
about others, we decided to bring merry to all our users and enable
tab completion for opera CLI arguments.

One can almost get enchanted when looking at a CLI that has a
nice-working tab completion. Shell completion can be hard to
comprehend sometimes because there's many ways to support it.
Since opera uses argparse we had to find a tab completion package
that's compatible with it. The love on first sight would be
argcomplete Python package which was designed for completing argparse
commands and their arguments. However, when we tried it, it didn't turn
out so well. Most of the time we were unable to get it working with our
subparsers and on the other hand we didn't want to activate completion
globally. So we almost gave up with that. But then we remembered that
failure only happens when you give up. Hoper and determination fuel
the true champions. So we found shtab as a possible solution. The
package is still very young and some features will probably be worked
on in the future.

We were able to use shtab in our code to generate a shell completion
script. And we don't even need a separate command to do that since
shtab supports defining a global optional argument that will print
out the completion script for the main parser. We used that and
defined --shell-completion/-s flag which receives a shell type to
generate completion for. Shtab currently supports bash and zsh so those
are the options. So, after running `opera -s bash|zsh` the generated
tab completion script will be printed out. To activate it you must
source the contents which can be done with `eval "$(opera -s bash)"`
or you can save it to a file and then source it. The procedure will
be fully explained in the opera documentation.

First thoughts about tab completion also included a possibility to
pre-install it for the user. For that we would need to do the sourcing
within the installation. There was also a suggestion to have a
separate opera shell-completion command that would have a --install
switch to install tab completion on user's system. We didn't want to
upset the users by installing something into their environment that
they might not want. We also didn't want to modify their ~/.bashrc file
and add our completion as that could bring a lot of problems. At the
end, we  decided to just print out the generated completion script and
then the user can decide how to continue for himself.

The new completion feature will give aid to those opera users who seek
it. Since opera CLI is evolving and growing, new and new commands and
CLI options are being introduced. So it's easy to make a mistake while
you're using the CLI. And that's when tab completion comes in handy.

modpost: file2alias: go back to simple devtable lookup

[ Upstream commit ec91e78d378cc5d4b43805a1227d8e04e5dfa17d ]

Commit e49ce14150c6 ("modpost: use linker section to generate table.")
was not so cool as we had expected first; it ended up with ugly section
hacks when commit dd2a3acaecd7 ("mod/file2alias: make modpost compile
on darwin again") came in.

Given a certain degree of unknowledge about the link stage of host
programs, I really want to see simple, stupid table lookup so that
this works in the same way regardless of the underlying executable
format.

Fix mounts being usable after a disk is ejected

This probably fails "responsible disclosure", but it's not an RCE and
frankly the whole bug is utterly hilarious so here we are...

It's possible to open a file on a disk drive and continue to read/write
to them after the disk has been removed:

    local disk = peripheral.find("drive")
    local input = fs.open(fs.combine(disk.getMountPath(), "stream"), "rb")
    local output = fs.open(fs.combine(disk.getMountPath(), "stream"), "wb")
    disk.ejectDisk()

    -- input/output can still be interacted with.

This is pretty amusing, as now it allows us to move the disk somewhere
else and repeat - we've now got a private tunnel which two computers can
use to communicate.

Fixing this is intuitively quite simple - just close any open files
belonging to this mount. However, this is where things get messy thanks
to the wonderful joy of how CC's streams are handled.

As things stand, the filesystem effectively does the following flow::
 - There is a function `open : String -> Channel' (file modes are
   irrelevant here).

 - Once a file is opened, we transform it into some <T extends
   Closeable>. This is, for instance, a BufferedReader.

 - We generate a "token" (i.e. FileSystemWrapper<T>), which we generate
   a week reference to and map it to a tuple of our Channel and T. If
   this token is ever garbage collected (someone forgot to call close()
   on a file), then we close our T and Channel.

 - This token and T are returned to the calling function, which then
   constructs a Lua object.

The problem here is that if we close the underlying Channel+T before the
Lua object calls .close(), then it won't know the underlying channel is
closed, and you get some pretty ugly errors (e.g. "Stream Closed"). So
we've moved the "is open" state into the FileSystemWrapper<T>.

The whole system is incredibly complex at this point, and I'd really
like to clean it up. Ideally we could treat the HandleGeneric as the
token instead - this way we could potentially also clean up
FileSystemWrapperMount.

BBut something to play with in the future, and not when it's 10:30pm.

All this wall of text, and this isn't the only bug I've found with disks
today :/.
