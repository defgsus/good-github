fixup! Integrate parts of KB/UPDATE-PRISONPC-SOES.py

 1. --copy-dest not --compare-dest.

 2. glob expansion was going EXTREMELY wrong.

    '--copy-dest=test-????' expands to
    'rsync --server --copy-dest test-????' which remote sh expands to
    'rsync --server --copy-dest test-0001 test-0002 test-0003'

    Which remote rsync then interprets as "fuck up test-0002".

 3. We can fix (2) with --protect-args, but
    then there's no globbing at all.

    So we need to enumerate the remote dirs and then construct
    individual --copy-dest=test-0001 args ourselves.

    We could process the output of
    "ssh host printf %s\\n test-????" or
    "rsync -s host:test-????"
    but that is a bit painful.

    As a "good enough" simple alternative, just make a second symlink,
    similar to Debian's /vmlinuz and /vmlinuz.org.
    Then rsync can hard-code a copy-dest of just that.

    If X-current and/or X-penultimate don't exist,
    we ignore it and implicitly fall back to full copy.

 4. The ln -nsf call was slightly silly due to copy-paste-edit derp.

Guessing Game | Make a guess condition

Re-implement `compare` using multiple clause functions. I should've paid attention to the concepts sections in Exercism as it defined how this should've looked. It also took me a second to work out that guess needed to default to `:no_guess` as that hits our existing clause. I hate to say it but I feel like I'm learning more doing this over elixir koans and I fucking love the koans.

Refactor our logging and extend the wslog API

Experience has shown that:

  1. The current logging methods are not very reliable or practical.
A logging bitmask makes little sense as the user-facing interface (who
would want debug but not crtical messages for example?); it's
computer-friendly and user-unfriendly. More importantly the console
log level preference is initialized too late in the startup process
to be used for the logging subsystem and that fact raises a number
of annoying and hard-to-fix usability issues.

  2. Coding around G_MESSAGES_DEBUG to comply with our log level mask
and not clobber the user's settings or not create unexpected log misses
is unworkable and generally follows the principle of most surprise.
The fact that G_MESSAGES_DEBUG="all" can leak to other programs using
GLib is also annoying.

  3. The non-structured GLib logging API is very opinionated and lacks
configurability beyond replacing the log handler.

  4. Windows GUI has some special code to attach to a console,
but it would be nice to abstract away the rest under a single
interface.

  5. Using this logger seems to be noticeably faster.

Deprecate the console log level preference and extend our API to
implement a log handler in wsutil/wslog.h to provide easy-to-use,
flexible and dependable logging during all execution phases.

Log levels have a hierarchy, from most verbose to least verbose
(debug to error). When a given level is set everything above that
is also enabled.

The log level can be set with an environment variable or a command
line option (parsed as soon as possible but still later than the
environment). The default log level is "message".

Dissector logging is not included because it is not clear what log
domain they should use. An explosion to thousands of domains is
not desirable and putting everything in a single domain is probably
too coarse and noisy. For now I think it makes sense to let them do
their own thing using g_log_default_handler() and continue using the
G_MESSAGES_DEBUG mechanism with specific domains for each individual
dissector.

In the future a mechanism may be added to selectively enable these
domains at runtime while trying to avoid the problems introduced
by G_MESSAGES_DEBUG.

# About the PROJECT #

None of us can deny the fact that we, the Gen-Z, got to know DC before Marvel ( A die-hard DC fan talking lol). I mean come on, it was just like a clone of DC for many years until it came out as The Marvel Universe which all of us are crazy about. 

Nobody can deny the fact that how much these superheroes comically give their lives to save Americans, we can never get enough of it!
(Tell me how many tears you shed after endgame and I'll tell mine.)
Blackwidow as the coolest feminine figure, Iron Man and his fatherly love towards Spidy, Captain's abs, not gonna leave Deadpool behind and our handsomest Hulk;
how perfectly these Avengers become our escape from reality that we all need. 

Keeping all that in our dearest minds let's create a clone website similar to Marvel's with your very creative minds using Open Source libraries with the instructions provided. 

Let's go and make Stan Lee proud!!!

Raised sequence timeout to a ridiculously high value

@fabrizioromanelli in theory we had 90 seconds to:
- Get the pics
- Understand something from the shitty pics
- Elaborate a sequence
- Sending the sequence without typos
Now we have more than the estimated battery life.

Some tweaks to a few large themed vaults

Several god-themed vaults in large_themed.des had never been properly
updates for the creation of Depths, having absdepth conditions that
never applied or just didn't make sense. Other aspects of these vaults
needed updating, including more appropriate monster selection and some
generalization to let them place in late Dungeon, where they're also a
good fit. Some content changes for four vaults are described below. All
but evilmike_library_of_no_secrets now additionally place on D:13- as
well as Depths:

evilmike_library_of_no_secrets: Placement is unchanged at D:11- and
Depths, but adjust monster lists in both branches. Use both summoning
direct damage spellcasting monsters, but using only normal and
out-of-depth branch monsters. Add and place an additional monster glyph
for the top-end threats rather than using a set of weights with only two
glyphs.

evilmike_makhleb_hellhole: For Dungeon, use common demons, kobold
demonologists, and a milder selection of tier 2 "greater servant"
demons. Thin out monster placement relative to Depths. For Depths,
remove the now-trivial common demons and kobold demonologist, fully
replacing these with hell knights and deep elf demonologists,
respectively. Use a brimstone fiend as the "boss" guarding the altar
instead of another hell knight. Update the "prisoner" area to not not
reveal itself head of time and to contain actual loot with a more
appropriate set of guards. The prisoner loot as a demon weapon and some
nice potions. Make the prisoner area have a grate instead of a runed
door, so as not to clutter ctrl-o. Compassionate players may elect to
free them with a dig charge if they wish!

evilmike_halls_of_destruction: For Dungeon, use appropriate spellcasters
for the two tiers, with the second including deep elf zephyrmancers as
the top end. Make the unique spellcaster boss alternate between Nikola
and Jorgrun, with a deep elf annihilator backup should the chosen unique
be already generated. For Depths, likewise updates the spellcasters,
going up to liches for the second tier, and alternating between
Frederick and Boris with an ancient lich as backup. Replace the harmless
fire vortexes with salamander tyrants. Scale monster placement by
branch, placing fewer iood statues and tyrants in Dungeon compared to
Depths.

evilmike_negative_zone: Update the monster list to be a more appropriate
set of necromancy-themed monsters. Don't use ancient/dread liches, as
those have no actual necromancy spells. Place different loot types in a
nice arrangement instead of using a heavily random SUBST.

This commit also cleans various aspects of syntax for the above vaults
and a couple other vaults in larged_themed.des.

Remove Okawaru's friend conduct

It had little actual impact on gameplay and little flavour - mostly it
was an occasional surprising annoyance. I think there's room here for
a much more interesting, stronger anti-ally conduct, but I don't know
when we'll get to it, and there's no good reason to leave this around
in the meanwhile.

Created README.md

Today is mom's funeral service, and I am dreading all the people that will be there and not knowing how to behave and afraid of something like what happened in the hospital right before she died when I had been taking a new medication that gave me restless legs so bad and I guess reinforced everyone's idea that I was entirely annoyed with the topic of conversation because of some evil spirit or because of drugs that made me fidgety. It was the drugs that made me fidgety. They just came from a pharmacy instead of dealer.

Implemented custom select controls because apple hates web developers

They'd rather keep pushing their 2007 era strange form control styles
even though they're horribly outdated, ugly and hard to style. The
only way to override is a full nuking of the default styles, which means
we have to then implement the frigging arrow icon using hacks which would
then conflict with all other sensible browsers so we have to nuke their
styles aswell to ensure some stupid backgroud hack is used everywhere.

I bet apple don't even use their shite default control styles and nuke
them also, Lets see. Yup, First thing I see on the top of their homepage
is a locale select dropdown custom built from about 10 HTML elements. FML

working on rewriting the app in c++ qt

for the last week or two i've been learning about c++ and compiling on all platforms, about getting apps on android and ios, and about some other platforms to consider too. I tried out flutter, but pretty quickly realized that its desktop support was very limited and lacking many things that I needed.  I'm ditching pyside since it doesn't support mobile very well, completely lacks support for ios, and it in general isn't very well supported. I'm also gonna try to use some packages rather than trying to code everything myself, that'll make my life a lot easier. And, also, I've decided a directory structure for the app, as well as making formatting rules with uncrustify. I've also been making the design in figma and thinking about features I want to add. Also I decided to make using imagemagick an optional feature, since imagemagick's binaries are huge, providing a lot of features that I probably won't need and drastically increasing the app's size. Also, FreeImage is fully portable and works on all the platforms I want to support (i think) so yeah, pyside is bad, and im switching to c++ and planning a lot of stuff

WebP: animated images can now be imported!

The code is kinda ugly (refactoring forthcoming), but animated WebP files are identified automatically and imported as animations, just like animated GIF or PNG files.  Frame times are automatically pulled and damn, it's very fast, too!

libwebp is kind of a nightmare (seriously, the next time people wonder why open-source codecs aren't more popular, I'm pointing them at libwebp's chaotic design), but I'm very happy with how well PD's built-in animation manager is coping with data from a new format.  Tools like the Image > Animation menu need zero work to support WebP - they just "magically" pick up animation settings from PD's import engine.

This also means that you can e.g. import a WebP file and export it to GIF already, with no new work on my part.

After some much-needed code clean-up, export work is up next.  I may merge this branch before then since this code is very stable and outside testing is very welcome... hmmm I'll think about it

Add `*_unchecked` variants of `Func` APIs for the C API (#3350)

* Add `*_unchecked` variants of `Func` APIs for the C API

This commit is what is hopefully going to be my last installment within
the saga of optimizing function calls in/out of WebAssembly modules in
the C API. This is yet another alternative approach to #3345 (sorry) but
also contains everything necessary to make the C API fast. As in #3345
the general idea is just moving checks out of the call path in the same
style of `TypedFunc`.

This new strategy takes inspiration from previously learned attempts
effectively "just" exposes how we previously passed `*mut u128` through
trampolines for arguments/results. This storage format is formalized
through a new `ValRaw` union that is exposed from the `wasmtime` crate.
By doing this it made it relatively easy to expose two new APIs:

* `Func::new_unchecked`
* `Func::call_unchecked`

These are the same as their checked equivalents except that they're
`unsafe` and they work with `*mut ValRaw` rather than safe slices of
`Val`. Working with these eschews type checks and such and requires
callers/embedders to do the right thing.

These two new functions are then exposed via the C API with new
functions, enabling C to have a fast-path of calling/defining functions.
This fast path is akin to `Func::wrap` in Rust, although that API can't
be built in C due to C not having generics in the same way that Rust
has.

For some benchmarks, the benchmarks here are:

* `nop` - Call a wasm function from the host that does nothing and
  returns nothing.
* `i64` - Call a wasm function from the host, the wasm function calls a
  host function, and the host function returns an `i64` all the way out to
  the original caller.
* `many` - Call a wasm function from the host, the wasm calls
   host function with 5 `i32` parameters, and then an `i64` result is
   returned back to the original host
* `i64` host - just the overhead of the wasm calling the host, so the
  wasm calls the host function in a loop.
* `many` host - same as `i64` host, but calling the `many` host function.

All numbers in this table are in nanoseconds, and this is just one
measurement as well so there's bound to be some variation in the precise
numbers here.

| Name      | Rust | C (before) | C (after) |
|-----------|------|------------|-----------|
| nop       | 19   | 112        | 25        |
| i64       | 22   | 207        | 32        |
| many      | 27   | 189        | 34        |
| i64 host  | 2    | 38         | 5         |
| many host | 7    | 75         | 8         |

The main conclusion here is that the C API is significantly faster than
before when using the `*_unchecked` variants of APIs. The Rust
implementation is still the ceiling (or floor I guess?) for performance
The main reason that C is slower than Rust is that a little bit more has
to travel through memory where on the Rust side of things we can
monomorphize and inline a bit more to get rid of that. Overall though
the costs are way way down from where they were originally and I don't
plan on doing a whole lot more myself at this time. There's various
things we theoretically could do I've considered but implementation-wise
I think they'll be much more weighty.

* Tweak `wasmtime_externref_t` API comments

Smartphones For Everyone! (And Misc. Profession and Hobby Tweaks) (#51734)

* Spelling fix on Meditation

* Smartphones and Other Tweaks

Most professions that started with a cell phone now start with a smartphone. Survivalist types who would prefer the reliability of replaceable batteries, as well as the political prisoner, retain their cell phones. Phones were not added to characters who didn't already have one, though there's a case that could be made for why some of them should.
Removed scissors from Tailor, as a pair are included in the tailor's kit which provides cutting quality
Gave the Special Operator a battery for their radio.
Removed the Crazy Cat Lady/Dude's winter coat and boots since those are far too warm for the default start, gave them sneakers and a messenger bag to make up for the loss of inventory space. I assume this was left unchanged when the starting date was updated to be later in Spring, as the Survivor also used to start with the same coat and boots.
Gave the Day Driver and Kitted Survivor long-sleeved shirts instead of their t-shirts and light jackets to bring them in line with Survivor clothing setup.
Replaced the Burglar's balaclava with a ski mask. There was a note in the file stating that a ski mask would be preferable equipment but that it did not work with Wool Allergy. Now that we have replacement gear for wool allergy starts, listing the ski mask in the burglar's equipment is okay as it will be automatically swapped to the balaclava in the event the player chooses Wool Allergy.
Replaced the Sorority Girl's tank top and leather jacket with a polo shirt to better match the Frat boy's loadout. If there was a specific reason for giving her those clothes, let me know.
Misc. underwear tweaks, giving top underwear to some female professions that were inexplicably missing them, and replacing regular bras with sports bras and briefs with boxer shorts for the more active professions

Removed the reference to the Professional Cyclist being young. The age mechanic is a can of worms when it comes to professions that don't make sense above or below a certain character age, but that's beyond the scope of what I was doing here.
Removed the reference to the Combat Mechanic being a high school dropout. Changed the spelling of "armour" to the American English spelling of "armor".
Expanded the Hobo's description a bit because it seemed too short, drawing on the old description for inspiration.
Tweaked the Motorized Police Officer's description to differentiate it from the Police Officer's, and to justify the lack of a starting motorcycle.
Genericized the Biker's description from the Harley-Davidson brand to just "motorcycle".
Gave the Mail Carrier a more accurate US Postal Service reference in their description.
Removed references to aliens in the Mail Carrier and Meth Cook's descriptions, for consistency with the other professions that universally only reference zombies as the main threat in the world.
Changed "holiday" in the Tourist's description to the American term, "vacation".
Miscellaneous edits to profession descriptions to fix spelling and grammar mistakes, and to bring some of the excessively lengthy ones more in line with the rest.

Corrected the Blackbelt's name to "Black Belt"
Capitalized the "boss" in the Mafia Boss' name for consistency with the other professions.

* gave a purse to the Sorority Girl

removing Sorority Girl's leather jacket prevented her from having any storage for her items. a purse seemed like a reasonable compensation.

Remove Callconv

Summary:
# High Level Direction
Now that references are dead, `Callconv` should only appear in a function call position, e.g. the expression in square brackets below:
```
foobar(
  [inout $foo],
  $bar,
  $baz,
);
```

Instead of having a `Callconv` node, let's indicate that function calls have a calling convention associated with each parameter.

# Interesting Changes

* The core change is in `hphp/hack/src/annotated_ast/aast.ml` and literally everything else is fallout.
* `hphp/hack/src/hhbc/hhbc_by_ref/emit_expression.rs`, specifically `emit_args_inout_setters` is probably the scariest bit, but it's a really elegant transformation. Instead of doing a kind of a weird double match we now have a single match

# Motivation

As this diff revealed, the way we handle `inout` in unexpected positions is ... haphazard at best. Often we'll have the following pattern:
```
match node with
| Call (_, _, args, _) -> check_for_callconv_if_needed args
| Callconv _ -> failwith "Unexpected callconv"
...
```
Overly simplified, but this is the gist of it: we'll check for `callconv` when it's relevant, and assume everything falls through to a catch-all case. This _generally_ works, but it's easy to do something like have the catch-all case do nothing, silently, in `hh` but throw in `hhbc`. I found that this happens, for sure, with `isset` (see: T99723886). While *definitely* more verbose, this forces the function call to non function call edge to be explicit and account for this case by either ignoring callconv (which will be obvious) or incorporate it.

Additionally, I've mentioned in a side chat that if we ever decide to add more calling conventions (e.g.: named parameters) I suspect we'd need to do this work anyways, lest we make `Callconv` handling even more fragile.

# Caveats / Concerns

I've left a TODO where I think I've made, either intentionally or unintentionally, HHVM more permissive to `inout` in unexpected positions. I suspect in practice this won't change anything for end user(s) unless they're in the habit of running Hack scripts that don't typecheck. The pattern here would be that we just ignore `inout` when compiling pseudo functions; this is benign given that it just means that the function effectively didn't assign *back* the variable ... which is what is happening because I don't think we have a pseudo function that is *actually* inout.

If I have cycles, I hope to get back to those TODOs and add something akin to:
```
expect_normal_callconv(pk)?;
```
... or ...
```
if not (Ast_defs.param_kind_equal pk Ast_defs.Pnormal)
  Errors.foobar whatever;
```

I'll need to dig into perf, but there are cases where I do something like:
```
List.map ~f:(fun e -> (Ast_defs.Pnormal, e)) el
```
... or ...
```
(* el: (param_kind * Aast.expr) list *)
List.map ~f:snd el
```
I ... kind of doubt it will be an issue in practice, but it could add up?

I've also, unfortunately, changed how some errors w/ inout are reported: if the error used to cite the position on `Callconv`, it now, instead, cites whatever expression was in the `Callconv` node, e.g. before this change you'd see errors with inout arguments of the wrong type look like::
```
foo(inout $x);
//  ^^^^^^^^ error cited here
```
This will now be:
```
foo(inout $x);
//        ^^ error cited here

````

Wilfred and I agree this is a UX regression, but not worth blocking this diff over.

Spike of Builder for DetectContext

This commit is an implementation of a "consuming builder" for DetectContext https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html.

I'm looking for feedback on the high-level API. i.e., These method names:

```
let context = DetectContextBuilder::new("heroku-20")
    .buildpack_toml_from_string(include_str!("../examples/example-02-ruby-sample/buildpack.toml"))
    .from_temp_dir(&temp_dir)
    .build::<std::io::Error>()
    .unwrap();

detect(context);
```

I'm also interested in ways to improve the following problems:

- The generation of errors and values inside of `build()` is gnarly. It works for now...but it's brute force via match, not very clean.
- Ambiguous multiple value errors ("call ONLY one") don't list the values that are set, just says the developer set multiple values.
- I had to add a method to toml_file.rs to get error handling to work as I wanted. Maybe we can do it without that modification.
- I wrote code this to be in line with the code inside runtime.rs, which uses generics and including generic error. That means Rust needs to be able to resolve the error type even when it's not used (due to `.unwrap()` hence the funky:

```
.build::<std::io::Error>()
```

I talked to Terence about this, and he said since we know all the possible errors coming from this code invocation, there might be another way to split this out, but it would require refactoring how we're doing error handling in the project.

- Build method is huge
- The error handling was very difficult. I ended up "cheating" and adding an "Other" error type to pass in a string. I'm not sure what's a better way to do this.
- app_dir and buildpack_dir don't have any existence checks. The PathBuf is not guaranteed to exist.


Thoughts:

- I don't think it's possible to do this as a non-consuming builder. We would not be allowed to take any values that cannot be cloned. Right now, we're taking Platform and BuildpackToml<BM>. We could maybe re-work to require these to be clonable, but I think that's a considerable change.
- I renamed the interface `buildpack_descriptor` to `buildpack_toml` as I think it's less vague. I didn't touch the DetectContext interface and left it as `buildpack_descriptor`.
- We could get more or less magical as we choose. For instance, we could check to see if a buildpack.toml file exists based in the `buildpack_dir` and use it as a fallback.
