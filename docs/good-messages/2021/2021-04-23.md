Refactor Python and Cython internals for groupby aggregation (#7818)

This PR makes some improvements to the groupby/aggregation code that I identified while working on #7731. The main purpose is to make the code logic easier to follow and reduce some unnecessary complexity; I see minor but measurable performance improvements (2-5% for small datasets) as well, but those are mostly just side effects here. Specifically, it makes the following changes:

1. Inlines the logic for dropping unsupported aggregations. The old function was repetitive and necessitated looping over the aggregations twice, whereas the new approach drops unwanted aggregations on the fly so it only loops once. The new code also makes it so that you only construct a C aggregation object once.
2. Merges the logic from `_AggregationFactory` into `Aggregation`, and removes the constructor for `Aggregation`. The one downside here is that the Cython `Aggregation` object's constructor no longer places it in a valid state; however, in practice the object is always constructed via either the `make_aggregation` function or its various factories, and the object's constructor was only every used in `_drop_unsupported_aggs` anyway. The benefit is we remove the fragmentation between these two classes, making the code much more readable, and the `Aggregation` class actually serves a purpose now beyond just providing a single property `kind` that is only used once: it is now the primary way that other Cython files interact with aggregations. This also means that in most places other Cython modules don't need to work with `unique_ptr[aggregation]` as much anymore (although they do still have to move `Aggregation.c_obj` for performance reasons). `make_aggregation` now returns the Cython class instead of the underlying C++ one.
3. Modified all the "allowed aggregations" sets to use the uppercase names of the aggregations. In addition to simplifying the code a tiny bit, this helps reduce confusion between the aggregation names used in Python for pandas compatibility and the libcudf names (for instance, `idxmin` vs `argmin`, now `ARGMIN`).
4. Explicitly defines all the aggregations on a groupby. I discussed this briefly with @shwina, the change has pros and cons. The benefit is that all of these methods are properly documented now, there's less magic (the binding of methods to a class after its definition can be confusing for less experienced Python developers and has a lot of potential gotchas), and we can use the simpler string-based agg definition wherever possible. The downside is that we now have to define all of these methods. I think the change is definitely an improvement, but I'm happy to change it back if anyone can suggest a better alternative. In the long run we probably need to find a way to share both code and docstrings more effectively between all aggregations (DataFrame, Series, and GroupBy).

##### 2021-04-23 10:49:21 by Marko GrdiniÄ‡

"1:55pm. Done with breakfast. Let me do the chores here.

2:20pm. Done with chores. I've pried myself off the RI novel, every chapter is a cliffhanger so I am tempted to keep reading, but I won't for the rest of the work hours according to my principles.

Nonetheless, even though I should be making that game suitable for consumption in parallel, I really don't feel like programming anymore for the day.

The past few weeks have given me a taste for graph algorithms, and I feel like doing reading today. I keep thinking back to the PGM course and book. I want to revisit it.

But first let me chill a bit more.

3:35pm. Yeah, I won't program today. I am thinking about it. I need to go over the nodes and the algorithms from the top and it is a huge drag to start that after the huge undertakings of the last few weeks, I need a break.

I had the idea for how to compile the game into union types before, but now I am elaborating how to implement the algorithms in terms of that, and things are a bit different.

I can no longer pack everything into a single algorithm, because I cannot just call the continuation. Instead I will have the sample, enumerate and update functions for each of the algorithms.

3:40pm. This will be an undertaking. It won't take me more than a day or two to do, and it will simplify things in the end.

After I put the algorithms in such a form I will be able to evaluate them in parallel which will be important for the GPU.

3:45pm. (book) Probabilistic Graphical Models Principles and Techniques.pdf

I don't know why I am so hungry to dive into this 1240 page book. It is just that I want to understand more. More and more.

4pm. Mixed with my admiration for the CFR algorithm is humiliation over not being able to derive it myself. Imagine if I could have derived it in high school and told myself: 'I could make millions with this.'

Back then, it was the golden age of online poker. Fish everywhere. Now the edges have thinned out, and everybody good is really good or using bots much like I will.

I missed so many opportunities due to my ignorance and lack of skill.

4:05pm. I've been riding high so far. I've relaxed and started enjoying life just for a bit, but now it is time to bring in the dark thoughts once again and get ready for the next part. I went through the apprentice phase of ML. ONce I do the next step, I will become a serious practitioner and graduate from being a hobbyist.

What I am doing now is what a sane person would have done right away in 2015.

It is a pity. It is like only the last two months of my journey have a tangible reality to them. The making of that ML library and Spiral was such a dream.

4:10pm. My desire was there, but my programming skills weren't. It is a pity.

I absolutely have to do this.

Society is not outright murderious at this stage, but it won't help me achieve greatness. I can count on those around me to put their boot on my face if I ever show having signs of inspiration. Everybody wants me to follow their rules rather than my own. I wish it was not so overbearing.

If they actual tried tempting me with benefits rather than treating me like it is my responsibility to follow their whims things would be different. Instead they just see it as my responsibility to enjoy things they enjoy.

The Singularity when it happens will be my transcendence, but for them, it will be a horrific tragedy. When I get my powers, I will make sure that normies end up as NPCs in my Games for the rest of time.

4:15pm. Righteous rules in the end are all a bunch of heuristics. Those who follow justice rarely can trace the path their impulses have taken to reach their current conclusion.

4:20pm. I am lonely after all.

This actually was not the case before 2014. Before that I was on the fence, I was not really sure whether the normie or the nerd side was the right one to be on.

I believed in technology and recognized its greatness, but I also saw a point to the normie perspective. After all games have only ever weakened me, so it might make sense to treat them and technology in general as a poison.

Yeah, they are great and the pinnacle of culture, but they aren't actual power otherwise I would have gotten real world benefits from them instead of being at the bottom of the social ladder. This kind of dissonance cause my interests being great and also making me weak is burden I had to shoulder. It ended up ingraining the goal of wanting to connect to some higher notion of power rather than just the immediate enjoyment provided by games.

I cannot believe in God mostly because religion is too stupid. The normie proves his inferiority by requiring the belief in obvious absurdities for the sake of social cohesion. Religion might be stupid, but it is not like there is anything wrong with the idea of power in its ultimate form - omnipotence. Why not pursue it?

After a decade and a half of thinking how to connect the notion of omnipotence to something tangible in reality, I was greatly surprised to actually succeed. But then afterwards, after I finished writing Simulacrum, I fell into despair.

Previously I pitied the normies for having their lives controlled by meaningless rules and thought of myself better despite my weakness. I had to pretend to be somewhat normal myself to the entent that it was necessary to live. Deep down, I guess that gave rise to hope that others are pretending as well.

But who am I kidding? Nobody can accept the truth of self improvement being iterative suicide. Is there a single human alive, but myself who would put himself through this process?

I am certainly not blessed with friends who would be on the same path as me.

I thought that after I managed to connect with power and alleviate my weakness, that I would feel less alienation from society. Instead the rift became unbridgeable.

It is painful.

I think the only thing I really wanted after I finished writing Simulacrum is people coming out and saying that they would pursue such a path. That would have felt refreshing.

But ultimately the matter of acceptance does not matter one bit.

If others cannot do it and insist on following absurd rules, then they are my enemies. If nobody can do it, then I will create those who can do it and they are the ones who will realize my ideals.

For me, even self improvement is a far off dream. Whereas once I had omnipotence connected it to reality thereby substituting it with self improvement as a goal, right now attaining a mastery of artificial intelligence is the ultimate goal.

4:40pm. After that I will turn to the real world and apply my newfound power to it. I will take out being passive from my behavioral choices. It will be either fight or flight. I will follow my own rules.

In the 10s, deep learning was in a ferocious ascent, but it feels like it has been a while since anything too significant happened. The cease fire won't continue forever. Interesting things will happen before long.

4:50pm. At the back of my mind, I am still rolling things around and trying to gather the motivation to actually do it.

The trouble is that the way things are currently implemented is optimal for the tabular players. The changes I will do are just a bunch of complications from that perspective.

5:20pm. I haven't really been focusing on the book, but I am starting to get into it.

More than making money, breaking to a higher skill level is more attractive to me.

I'll have to mix things up a little. I've been working nonstop so I should do a little bit of reading for a change.

Tomorrow, or the whenever I feel like it, I think I'll forget the practical considerations for the CFR algorithms I am implementing and implement the nodes and the parallel iteration in the abstract. I just don't feel into it and need to icebreak a little first. It will be a new thing and I'll have to wreck the old thing and all my hard work to do it.

6pm. 57/1265. This used to be so arcane to me, but now I can clearly map it to probabilistic programming instead of having is stay here as abstract giberish. This book is definitely made for a mathematician rather than a programmer. As a programmer, I need to put in extra effort in order to map this to concepts familiar to me.

This reading session is not too bad.

Tomorrow, I am definitely going to make more abstract graphs. I won't start with the games or agents. Instead I will go further back and attempt to implement what I need as union types. Then I will make combinator functions to deal with those union types.

7:15pm. 82/1265.

Let me stop here for the day. I am tired at this point. I've done a bit reading and a bit of thinking today. I'll do programming tomorrow. I'll move towards studying when the agents are training and acting in the background. Hopefully once things turn stable, my role will shift toward maintenance. I am tired of producing things constantly.

I think that depending on one's approach making money will either will be very simple or very complex.

Did coming to this point require such large steps? No, in a sane world I could have just picked a functional PL with a good ML library and implementing everything that way in a few months. Even in this world, I could have done it in Python, it would just have taken me a bit extra.

That I took the long road, I have only myself and my own lack of skill to blame.

I'll do it properly from here on out. Tomorrow, I will lay down the first brick. It won't be too long before I've completely mastered NNs + Leduc. After that it won't be too long before I've mastered the much bigger NL Holdem."

"10:20am. I got up 10m ago. Let me chill for a while and then I will start. I feel like reading the PGM book instead of programming. But my determination to do both has gone up.

Compared to 2015 I really understand the book a lot more. Though it is just as droning as I remember it.

10:50am. Let me start for real. I want more knowledge. I want to do a complete tour of ML eventually.

11:05am. 90/1265. This is actually pretty boring. I am tempted to start skimming until I get to the algorithms.

...Yeah, let me do that. I'll never get anywhere with this book if I read it top to bottom. The crystalizations of knowledge are always algorithms. I should start with them and work my way from there.

Nonparametric Bayesian Methods: Models, Algorithms, and Applications I

This is an interesting series. I see that Mike Jordan is a lecturer in part 2. Let me drop the book for now. It is too long and droning. These lectures seem more like what I want. Let me give the first a try.

11:35am. https://youtu.be/I7bgrZjoRhM?t=1173

I'll admit I did not know about how the Beta distribution worked before.

You know, an idea occurs to me. Now that those predictive coding papers showed me how to generate targets, doesn't that open an opportunity for analytic methods. I could use Bayesian methods instead of NNs...

12:35pm. I am getting some inspiration even though I won't quite be able to put it together until much later. It is not on using Bayesian methods. I am thinking about the difference between the prior and the sampling distribution.

Consider regularization, the way it is done is to put in some penalty term, but consider that in the light of my replay buffer ideas. Instead of changing the targets themselves, would it not make more sense for it to reweight the samples instead?

Yeah, that is it. I've always thought that there is something wrong for the weights to outright decay. Bayesian priors can be used as regularization terms to help shape the buffer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfLoxwjCGNY
Nonparametric Bayesian Methods: Models, Algorithms, and Applications II

Mike said this would not be big on algorithms, but it is fine.

There is an itch I want to scratch. It feels like I am on the cusp of a qualitative breakthrough in understanding, but I need more knowledge and more math, and I have the motivation to learn it.

12:40pm. CFR is a great algorithm that seemingly comes out of the blue. Great algorithms always have a reason for their greatness. Given an algorithm I should be able to reason backwards to what the principles involved in its derivation are.

12:45pm. I want to know more of everything that works well, and bring the insights together.

Let me stop here so I can have breakfast."

Update README.md

Hi. I hope this is helpful and not a waste of your time. And I will not at all be offended if these edits are not incorporated into the README. ðŸ˜„ 

I was inspired to make these suggestions after needing to remove and reinstall ocrd_all. What I expected would take me 5-15 minutes of hands-on effort and leaving my computer to run .5 to 2.0 hours at most ended up taking a few hours of hands-on effort and, due to failed attempts along the way, over a dozen hours of leaving my computer to run.

First, I had forgotten that I installed ocrd_all using the User Guide on your website. (I did so natively. And, if it matters, I am on a Windows 10 pc, with WSL installed, utilizing the Ubuntu 18.04 app obtained from the Windows Store.) I initially came here, to the github repo, instead. For a non-IT user (the helpful term from the OCR-D website), this github README is much harder to understand. I suppose I'm somewhat forgetful -- and perhaps too determined at times -- because it took me a while to recall I used the OCR-D website instructions; I was actually nosing around trying to figure this out, came to the setup guide there, then was like "a ha!" and "oh yeah!"

Anyways, first I tried installing using this github README page. By time I ran the "make all" command, it showed me a line of something and just ran. I quit after many hours (maybe overnight) with no other apparent progress.

At some point after that, I went to the OCR-D setup guide and remembered that that was the way I did it the first time. So I deleted anything I saw from the first effort and eagerly went about that. Nonetheless, I had basically the same experience with  `make all`.

Many google searches were strewn in all of this tiny saga.

Anyways, finally I did a very specific search, pasting the 1 line `make all` produced, and the only hits were in the issues section of this repo. I went to [this issue](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd_all/issues/151) and saw how @cneud had removed all the contents of `~/.parallel/semaphores`, resolving his problem. I did the same. And viola! Everything worked! I just confirmed by running:
```
(venv) scott@Yogi:~/src/github/ocrd_all$ ocrd --version
ocrd, version 2.23.3
```

So I decided it would be worth me taking a stab at mentioning something up front, in case others have a similar issue.

Conclusion:  Variability of the menstrual cycle is normal.  There are, however, norms that if exceeded might indicate health problems.  At a minimum, monitoring menstrual cycle length with a simple calendar is recommended.  The addition of a biological marker for estimating the day of ovulation and the beginning of the fertile phase is essential for those seeking to avoid and achieve pregnancy and for assessing menstrual cycle health.  Score for objective I:- To predict next menstrual cycle  RMSE: 1.34 R2Score: 0.862 Adj Rsquared: 0.859 Score for objective II:- To predict estimated day of ovulation  RMSE: 1.66 R2Score: 0.88 Adj Rsquared: 0.879

Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Every month, a womanâ€™s body prepares for pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, the uterus, or womb, sheds its lining. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from inside the uterus. Regular periods are a sign that a womanâ€™s body is working normally. A woman should have regular periods unless she is pregnant, breastfeeding, postmenopausal, hormonal imbalance, or have a medical condition that causes her periods to stop. Irregular, painful, or heavy periods may be signs of a serious health problem. Irregular periods also can make it harder to get pregnant.

Below are four of the most common types of abnormal menstrual periods: -

Menorrhagia & Polymenorrhagia (Prolonged, Heavy Bleeding)
Dysmenorrhea (Excess Pain During Period)
Amenorrhea (Absent Periods)
Hypomenorrhea (Extra Light Periods)
Ovulation â€“ Ovulation refers to the release of an egg during menstruation in females. Part of the ovary called the ovarian follicle discharges an egg. The egg is also known as an ovum, oocyte, or female gamete. It is only released on reaching maturity.

There's a 42% (max) chance of conception on the day before ovulation, the most fertile day of your cycle.
10% of women have PCOS, a condition that is associated with irregular and infrequent ovulation, making natural conception trickier.
Ovulation day can be find using the surge in Luteinizing Hormone (LH): - a. A LH surge means that you will probably ovulate within the next 12 to 24 hours. b. When taken correctly, ovulation tests are approximately 99% accurate in detecting the LH surge that precedes ovulation. However, these tests cannot confirm whether ovulation actually occurs a day or two later.
Problem Statement: Estimate the menstruation cycle at an early stage and be ready before the process begins.

Predict the chances of next menstrual cycle.
Predict the Estimated Ovulation Cycle.

ABSTRACT:

 This analysis details variation in menstrual cycle characteristics that are not widely known yet have significant implications for health and well-being. Clinically, women who wish to plan a pregnancy  need to have intercourse on their fertile days. In order to identify the fertile period, it is important to track different parameters such as cycle length and to keep watch on various hormones like Luteinizing hormones, Estrogen.

```javascript
import { Controller } from "stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
}
```

To grant direct access to the `<button>` element's `HTMLButtonElement`
instance, we'll make our `form` controller aware of it by declaring
`[data-form-target="preview"]` attribute on the on the `<button>`:

```diff
--- a/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
   <div class="actions">
     <%= form.submit %>
-    <%= form.button "Preview Article", formaction: previews_path(render_into: "article_preview") %>
+    <%= form.button "Preview Article", formaction: previews_path(render_into: "article_preview"), data: { form_target: "preview" } %>
   </div>
 <% end %>
```

In our controller, we'll add support for accessing the
`HTMLButtonElement` instance through the `previewTarget`
property by declaring `"preview"` as a [Stimulus Target][]:

```diff
--- b/app/assets/javascripts/controllers/form_controller.js
+++ b/app/assets/javascripts/controllers/form_controller.js
  import { Controller } from "stimulus"

  export default class extends Controller {
+   static get targets() { return [ "preview" ] }
  }
```

Whenever the contents of `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>`
elements' values change, browsers fire an [input][] event. To route
these as [Stimulus Actions][], we'll declare
`[data-action="input->form#preview"]` on the `<form>` element:

```diff
--- a/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
-<%= form_with(model: article) do |form| %>
+<%= form_with(model: article, data: { controller: "form", action: "input->form#preview" }) do |form| %>
   <% if article.errors.any? %>
     <div id="error_explanation">
       <h2><%= pluralize(article.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this article from being saved:</h2>
```

Whenever any `<form>` element descendant fires an [input][] event,
Stimulus will respond by calling the `preview()` method in the `form`
controller (as instructed by the directive declared in the
`form[data-action]` attribute).

The `preview()` action handles the event by finding the `Preview Post`
button, and clicking it on the user's behalf.

```diff
--- b/app/assets/javascripts/controllers/form_controller.js
+++ b/app/assets/javascripts/controllers/form_controller.js
  import { Controller } from "stimulus"

  export default class extends Controller {
    static get targets() { return [ "preview" ] }
+
+   preview() {
+     this.previewTarget.click()
+   }
  }
```

In the spirit of progressive enhancement, we'll always want to render
the `Preview Post` button when JavaScript is unavailable. However, when
JavaScript is available, changes made by the end-user will cause the
`<form>` to submit automatically. This affords us an opportunity to hide
the `<button>` element.

During the [connect()][] phase of our controller's lifecycle, we'll hide
the `<button>` by annotating it with the [hidden][] attribute:

```diff
  import { Controller } from "stimulus"

  export default class extends Controller {
   static get targets() { return [ "preview" ] }
+
+   connect() {
+     this.previewTarget.hidden = true
+   }

    preview() {
      this.previewTarget.click()
    }
  }
```

Improving even further
---

For example, if we might want to guard against flooding our clients and
servers with extraneous requests whenever a swift keyboardist quickly
enters text, it would be worthwhile to [debounce][] preview submissions:

```diff
diff --git a/app/assets/javascripts/controllers/form_controller.js b/app/assets/javascripts/controllers/form_controller.js
index ca07dee..6c831c4 100644

   connect() {
     this.previewTarget.hidden = true

     this.previewTarget.click()

 }
```

Wrapping up
---

We've built an Article drafting experience that provides end-users with
a preview of the final version, live as they type. The experience relies
on Turbo Streams and Stimulus to progressively enhance concepts built
directly into browsers, and will gracefully degrade to HTML and HTTP
when JavaScript is unavailable.

Our implementation is light on JavaScript code, and doesn't include a
single call to [XMLHttpRequest][] or [fetch][], despite relying on the
server as the source of all HTML structure and data.

That's all baked into the value proposition of Hotwire. Turbo,
specifically, helps us realize that `<form>` elements are inert and
declarative HTML alternatives to Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (<abbr
title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr>) invocations, and
are ready to be executed at a moment's notice by end-users.
Applications' `<form>` elements serve as the bedrock for any and all
Hotwire-augmented end-user experiences.

[grub] add yet another frigging patch to GRUB "2.04"

* GRUB 2.0 maintainer think they're doing a fine job, even when there are
  CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES that should warrant an immediate out of bound
  release, and instead consider that waiting MONTHS or YEARS to release
  anything is not a big deal at all.
* Ergo, distros, such as Ubuntu, start to pick whatever security patches
  they see fit, since they can simply not RELY on the upstream project to
  produce security releases in a timely manner. One such patch is:
  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2021-03/msg00012.html
* But since there is no new GRUB release per se, they still call their GRUB
  version, onto which they applied patches that have come into existence
  more than 2 years after the actual 2.04 release, "GRUB 2.04".
* Obviously, since GRUB 2.04 + literally hundreds of cherry picked patches
  does deviate a lot from the last release, THINGS BREAK IN SPECTACULAR
  FASHION, such as the recently released Ubuntu 21.04 failing to boot with
  the error: grub_register_command_lockdown not found.
* Oh, and of course, regardless of all the above, if you ask anyone, they'll
  tell you that there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the GRUB release
  process (even if they should long have released 2.05, 2.05-1 and 2.05-2,
  were their maintainer ready to acknowledge that delaying releases DOES
  CREATES MAJOR ISSUES DOWSTREAM, as many people REPEATEDLY pointed to them
  on the GRUB mailing list) or with the Ubuntu GRUB versioning process (that
  really shouldn't be calling their version of GRUB "grub-2.04" but instead
  something like "grub-2.04_ubuntu"). Oh no siree! Instead, the problem must
  all be with Rufus and its maintainer, who should either spend their lives
  pre-emptively figuring which breaking patch every other distro applied out
  there, or limit media creation to DD mode, like any "sensible" person
  would do, since DD mode is the ultimate panacea (Narrator: "It wasn't").
* So, once again, a massive thanks to all the people who have been involved
  in the current GRUB 2.0 shit show, whose DIRECT result is to make end
  users' lives miserable, while GRUB maintainers are hell bent on continuing
  to pretend that everything's just peachy and are busy patting themselves
  on the back on account that "Fedora recently dropped more than 100 of the
  custom patches they had to apply to their GRUB fork" (sic). Nothing to see
  here, it's just GRUB maintainer's Jedi business as usual. Besides, who the
  hell cares about Windows users trying to transition to Linux in a friendly
  manner anyway. I mean, as long as something doesn't affect existing Linux
  users, it isn't a REAL problem, right?...

cover-letter: Remove vfio_mdev.c, mdev_parent_ops and more

Prologue
========

This is series #3 in part of a larger work that arose from the minor
remark that the mdev_parent_ops indirection shim is useless and
complicates things.

It applies on top of Alex's current tree and requires the prior two
series.

This series effects the removal of vfio_mdev.c. The future patches are all
focused on leveraging the changes made in the prior series to simplify the
API and device operation.

A preview of the future series's is here:
  https://github.com/jgunthorpe/linux/pull/3/commits

========

The mdev bus's core part for managing the lifecycle of devices is mostly
as one would expect for a driver core bus subsystem.

However instead of having a normal 'struct device_driver' and binding the
actual mdev drivers through the standard driver core mechanisms it open
codes this with the struct mdev_parent_ops and provides a single driver
that shims between the VFIO core and the actual device driver.

Make every one of the mdev drivers implement an actual struct mdev_driver
and directly call vfio_register_group_dev() in the probe() function for
the mdev.

Squash what is left of the mdev_parent_ops into the mdev_driver and remap
create(), remove() and mdev_attr_groups to their driver core
equivalents. Arrange to bind the created mdev_device to the mdev_driver
that is provided by the end driver.

The actual execution flow doesn't change much, eg what was
parent_ops->create is now device_driver->probe and it is called at almost
the exact same time - except under the normal control of the driver core.

This allows deleting the entire mdev_drvdata, and tidying some of the
sysfs. Many places in the drivers start using container_of()

This cleanly splits the mdev sysfs GUID lifecycle management stuff from
the vfio_device implementation part, the only VFIO special part of mdev
that remains is the ugly mdev specific iommu intervention.
