Preliminary Blood Magic and Occultism Progression

Reworked ID removals to use ID replacements where valid. This requires an update to KubeJS.

Eidolon will open up the Blood Altar, Alchemy Table, and Low Grade rituals in Occultism, opening up some extra crafting mechanics. Blood Altar Tier 2 and up will require parallel progress in Occultism.

Petal Apothecary can make Sprouted Fungus, making a simpler way to create potions. I'm thinking enchanting should be pretty late game, considering the power level. We have a lot of really fancy potions and a cool new system with Ars Nouveau for making some very powerful brews, but enchants almost entirely invalidate potions. By making them easier and enchanting later, I'd hope to get people to use them a bit more.

Alchemy Table recipe for Nocturnal Powder and Illumination powder added. Nice reagents for other crafting, and very handy when searching for mobs early on.

Cutting Fluid made a bit easier, but more varied. Now requires snake rattles (farmable), apatite dust (goes a long way), charcoal dust, and plant oil. This should hopefully give magic players a decently automatable ore doubling system.

Considering boosting output for ores, considering Create's Milling is also fairly early game.

Otherstone now crafted from Arcane Stone

Leather Stripe now a cutting board recipe

Spirit Attuned gem now made from Shadow Gem

New Recipe for Divination Rod

Impure White chalk moved to Alchemy Table

White Chalk moved to Blood Altar

Occultism Bowl recipes moved to Enchanting Apparatus

oh my fucking god i hate my parents

internet turns off at 9, and i figured out how to do what i wanted to do at 8:55, so uh yeah

also fuck not having a database and using actual files that i have gitignored

42.1. CSS Transition Classes

Right now, the search preview results are hiding and showing correctly... but there are no CSS transitions yet. Why not?
Because... adding the transition is... actually up to us! By defining it in CSS.

Adding the Transition Classes
Go back to assets/styles/app.css and head to the bottom. I'm going to paste in three new CSS rules.
This 2000 milliseconds here is probably too slow... but it will make it easy to see how the feature works.
Before we talk about what's going on... it should already work! Move over and refresh the page. Type and... beautiful! It faded in! When I click off, it fades out! Amazing!

The Class Lifecycle of Showing an Element
But this... deserves some explanation. Back in the controller, we defined six classes that useTransition should use. The option keys come from useTransition, but I totally made up the class names on the right. Though... they make sense! Because we're going to create a "fade" transition, each class starts with fade and then matches the option name it relates to.
Anyways, move back to the CSS file where we define the style for these classes. Here's the magic. When we call this.enter(), useTransition immediately adds the fade-enter-active class. That doesn't cause a transition, but it establishes that, if the opacity changes, we want it to transition over 2000 milliseconds.
One frame later, it adds another class - fade-enter-from - and removes the d-none class. The result is that the element is now "shown"... but with an opacity set to 0. One frame after that, it removes fade-enter-from but adds fade-enter-to. Thanks to this, our browser starts transitioning the opacity from 0 to 1! Awesome!
So... what happens next? useTransition is smart. It detects that a transition is currently happening and will take 2000 milliseconds. So... it waits. Yup! It literally waits for two seconds for the transition to finish. And then it removes both fade-enter-to and fade-enter-active because its work is done. The element faded in and is now fully visible.
Isn't that amazing? stimulus-use didn't invent this idea: you'll see it in other libraries like Vue. But it is so handy.

The Class Lifecycle of Hiding an Element
In our controller, when we call this.leave() to hide the element, a similar process happens. First, fade-leave-active is added to the element, which establishes that we want a 2000 millisecond transition on opacity. Next, it adds fade-leave-from, which makes sure that the opacity is definitely set to 1, which it already was. One frame later, it removes fade-leave-from and replaces it with fade-leave-to. The result is that the element starts a 2 second opacity transition from 1 to 0. Two seconds later, after the transition has finished, useTransition adds the d-none class and removes both fade-leave-to and fade-leave-active. The element is now fully hidden.
How cool is that? Learning how this works is fun. But the result is even better. And in your day-to-day use, it's really simple. Now that we have these three CSS rules defined, we could reuse this exact useTransition in any other controller to add, fade in and fade out functionality to it. Heck, you could even create a re-usable JavaScript module that sets up the behavior and these options automatically for you!
Next: there's one last thing I want to talk about. Stimulus is used by a lot of people, including the Ruby on Rails world. And so, it turns out that there are a bunch of pre-made Stimulus controllers that you can download and use directly in your app! Yay! Let's install one and learn how to register it with our Stimulus application.

46.2. useTransition in a Neat, Reusable Module

The skipHiddenProperty Value
Anyways, back at the browser, type to re-open the suggestions then click off of to close it. That happened instantly! Where was our transition?
Inspect the element. Ah: see that little hidden attribute on the results div? That was added by the stimulus-autocomplete controller as soon as we clicked off. Thanks that, the element became hidden instantly instead of waiting for our transition.
Normally, that's great! It's how stimulus-autocomplete hides the results. But now that we are controlling the hiding and showing with our transition behavior, we do not want this hidden attribute to be added. Fortunately, assuming my PR is merged, we can pass a value to disable that behavior.
In the template, on the autocomplete controller, pass a new value called skipHiddenProperty set to true.
That literally says: please do not set that hidden property: we are handling the hiding and showing ourselves.
Let's try it out again. I'll type... we still get the nice fade in... and when I click off. Yes! It fades out!
And.... we're done! I mean, the whole tutorial is done! I hope you found this journey through Stimulus as refreshing as I did. I love coding with Stimulus.
In the next tutorial in the series - about Turbo - I hope to show prove that we can have an even more dynamic and speedy app while writing even less custom JavaScript.
Let us know what cool stuff your building. And, as always, if you have any questions, we're here for you in the comments section.
Okay, friends, seeya next time!

"11:45am. Ok...I want a break. Right now, for the first time in my life, it feels like I have a complete foundation. Literally everything is there to make the poker agent. With today's test, I've cleared the hardest hurdle when it comes to using neural CFR.

11:55am. I have an answer for quite a lot of things now. For the optimization parts of the monthly review, I reasoned them out from first principles so I am confident about them. I was wrong about noise keying, but I was right in general about ensemble averaging. So I can still consider my intuition being sharp here.

12pm. The duality gap method should be enough stabilize GANs so for the first time ML practictioners a viable path towards unsupervised representation learning in real life circumstances.

Uncertainty estimation and deep exploration can be done via ensembles. Via dropout and keeping the key steady to a lesser extent as well.

What is missing for AGI currently? How to do credit assignment over extremely long distances. Better NN models will be needed for dealing with long term memory. And also reasoning, but GNNs are being researched. This is not something I can jump into just yet.

Also what we are missing is hardware. GPUs are ultimately not scalable and I need better hardware to progress.

What I have now is just enough for poker and not much else.

12:05pm. GANs are just the first step, we also need to direct the unsupervised learning models towards optimizing representations that would be good for dealing with subgoals.

Overall, things could be summed up that we need better hierachical learning.

After six years of effort, I've just broken into the very first realm of skill. But this first level is finally the place where I can do actual magic. Previously I could only dream about doing it.

12:10pm. Now I need to put myself back on track. I need to compile the Leduc game to a representation that NNs can deal with.

12:15pm. Let me slack here a bit and do my reading. I've been under extreme pressure to figure things out for the past two weeks and it feels like my mind has finally calmed down. I've always been determined and persistent, but now I am starting to feel hope and confidence as well.

Let me gather my will for the next part. Slowly and steadily, I should just go forward without stopping until the agent is complete. There is nothing that can stop me from winning."

Perry and Perry's Annoying and Incoherent Student

  Perry is a saint. He is perfect and amazing, unlike his idiot of a student, who can't even formulate a sentence on her own. She didn't type this, and if she did, Perry was probably spell and punctuation checking every millisecond. She is that much of an idiot.

feat(Buttons): ColorModes + Props + Refactor + Refs Oh My! [GM-211] [REACH-856] [GM-192]

* Buttons now use `ButtonBase` to match with `Anchor`.
* Removes extra tagged templates to reduce Emotion Label spam and reduces internal style overhead.
* Button Colors are now serialized as variables inside of the base component depending on which mode they are.
* Buttons will now default to the current ColorMode if they have not been passed a prop.
* Also fixes a prop forwarding bug with CTAButton where inner component was not getting props forwarded.
* Adds all button types to the ColorMode example (small and large).
* Buttons now will use the current mode in context unless specified otherwise. Since all dark mode buttons are specifically configured this way there should be no changes to ANY existing button colors.
* Buttons now come with a few system props to make life easier including spacing layout and positioning. See prop reference here https://gamut.codecademy.com/storybook/?path=/docs/foundations-system-props--layout. Please note that these will cause issues with behavior if used incorrectly. Changes to display and padding may break button styles in some cases.
* All Buttons now accept a ref!
