chore(rds): add PG12.5 and deprecate PG9.5 and PG9.6 (#12998)

Added PostgreSQL 12.5 version.

Also, I got a friendly email from AWS that some versions of PG will be forcefully updated, and I've decided to mark PG9.5 and 9.6 as deprecated. (Feb 2021 and Nov 2021 EOLs respectfully).

> Amazon RDS is starting the end of life process for PostgreSQL major version 9.5. We are doing this because the PostgreSQL community is planning to discontinue support for PostgreSQL 9.5 on February 11, 2021 [1].
> 
> Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 will reach end of life on February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.6 will reach end of life in late 2021. Hence, we strongly encourage you to upgrade your databases running PostgreSQL major version 9.5 to 12 or greater at your convenience before February 16, 2021. PostgreSQL 12 contains major innovations including JSON path queries per SQL/JSON specifications and pluggable table storage interface [2]. PostgreSQL 13 introduced parallel processing of indexes with the VACUUM command and improved duplicate data handling by B-tree indexes [3]. Both versions contain numerous fixes to various software defects in earlier versions of the database.
> 
> If you do not upgrade your databases before February 16, 2021, RDS will upgrade your PostgreSQL 9.5 databases to PostgreSQL 12 during a scheduled maintenance window between Feb 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC and March 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC. On March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC, any PostgreSQL 9.5 databases that remain will be upgraded to version 12 regardless of whether the instances are in a maintenance window or not.
> 
> You can initiate an upgrade of your database instance — either immediately or during your next maintenance window — to a newer major version of PostgreSQL using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface. The upgrade process will shut down the database instance, perform the upgrade, and restart the database instance. The database instance may be restarted multiple times during the upgrade process. While major version upgrades typically complete within the standard maintenance window, the duration of the upgrade depends on the number of objects within the database. To avoid any unplanned unavailability outside your maintenance window, we recommend that you first take a snapshot of your database and test the upgrade to get an estimate of the duration. To learn more about upgrading PostgreSQL major versions in RDS, review the Upgrading Database Versions page [4].
> 
> We want to make you aware of the following additional milestones associated with upgrading these databases that are reaching end of life.
> 
> Now through March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - You can initiate upgrades of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to PostgreSQL 12 or higher at any time.
> February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - After this date and time, you cannot create new RDS instances with PostgreSQL major version 9.5 from either the AWS Console or the CLI. RDS will also automatically upgrade PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 within the earliest scheduled maintenance window that follows. Restoration of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 database snapshots will result in an automatic upgrade of the restored database to a still supported version at the time.
> March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - RDS will automatically upgrade any remaining PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 whether or not they are in a maintenance window.
> Should you have any questions or concerns, the AWS Support Team is available on the community forums and via Premium Support [5].

Added/Changed/Fixed - NAF CV90: 30mm -> 40mm conversion & weaponry

What
=================
Added: New 40mm APFSDS(-T) ammunition from the Badger IFV in non tracer,
Red, Green and Yellow tracer variants.
Added: Other variants of the MP HE rounds that were taken from the BMP a
while ago: Red Tracer, Green Tracer, and No Tracer.
Changed: Rate of fire (RPM) of the main gun to be closer to the real
life CV90 (from previous 200rpm to 340rpm).
Changed: Tracers every 3 instead of whatever it was before (5?).
Renamed: Main gun from Bushmaster to Bofors to reflect the conversion to
40mm (the MP rounds are actually still 30mm but we'll pretend otherwise.
Don't tell anyone!).
Fixed: Status screen in the Gunner's cockpit not showing accurate
ammunition data for the MP and AP rounds separately. Also the names of
some of the ammunition were blank on that screen.

Issue ID: N/A

"11:50am. The weather is just so cold today that I haven't felt like getting out of bed.

12:05pm. Let me do the chores.

12:40pm. Done with chores. There is a cold wave going on and its freezing. It has been the coldest in a long while.

Let me gather my thoughts. Last night after I finished the day, I looked into opening a bank account outside the country.

https://www.monito.com/en/wiki/how-to-open-a-bank-account-in-switzerland

But as far as I can tell, they have large fees, minimum deposits and even require me to go there in person to open it. I don't have the min 5k of whatever currency I'd need to open an account. And no way am I taking a trip outside the country for this even if I did.

So I'll give up on Github Sponsors.

Plan B is Patreon. I am decently sure this should be allowed in Croatia. I'll do some research on this after the day is done. That should take care of that.

Now come my other concerns:

1) I hadn't gotten a reply to that TCO Cython issue yet. My proposal concerns me a little because I am not completely sure whether the decref rules are right. Originally...

```
cdef int loop_tail(s, int i, int nearTo):
    if i < nearTo:
        n = s + i
        Py_DECREF(s)
        return loop_tail(n,i+1,nearTo)
    else: return s
```

I just meant to write something like this. This made sense to me, but then I realized that I needed to decref `s` if its ref count is greater than 1. I think this shuold work, but then again that is how it looked at me for the other thing. Right now it is concerning to me how complex the rules in my mind are.

This decref if greater than 1 rule should only apply to the method args and not the locals. I'd like these exceptions...

12:50pm. At any rate, TCO is not that important. Even if this issue gets dropped and never revisited the Cython backend will still be useful and even good.

Who cares about performance here?

Let me go to the next concern.

2) CFR and the dictionary. This gave me a lot of stress and eventually developed into a full blown depression yesterday. It just goes to show how focused I am on my current goal.

I want to work on neural agents in the most direct way possible. If the dictionary was there, then fine. But since it is not there, I greatly want to avoid spending time and effort implementing it.

This is fine. This just goes with the current them of these entries which is - forget obligations and responsibilities that I can't control and don't give benefits to me.

4) Those interviews. I am supposed to be applying at the ML hardware companies, but I don't really want to.

I am actually perfectly prepared to just wait until most of the go broke and then just buy the chips from the winners. They are not that important to me.

I'll get what I want eventually.

I do not need all these complex plots. I do not need to be thorough.

1pm. All I should do is focus on making those NN based agents and then putting them to use. I am a programmer, but I am not a ML practitioner yet. That can change with some effort.

I need to reach that level at all cost. If I had a source of income from ML itself, getting sponsors and applying at companies would be the furthest thing on my mind.

It would greatly simplify my life.

1pm. I've made my plans, but actually finding real world uses for RL is what I want to do most of all.

So that is what I will pursue, starting today!

1:05pm. Today my goal will be to make a random neural based player. Not PG, but simply drawing a random agent. This is a step beyond an uniform random agent, but not at the point where I'd be optimizing them. I'll also do the UI.

UIs are something I have strong feelings for. I won't drop this requirement.

I want to be able to interact with my own agents. I won't skimp on this.

Even for random agents, they won't be trully random in the sense of picking random actions uniformly, but will instead a wide range of behaviors depending on their make up. I'll run into timid agents, aggressive ones, and ones which raise, but then fold to renewed aggression from my side. That will be fun.

That will really assauge my loneliness.

After that I will optimize them and play against the real deal. I do not have much hope for PG, but I'll dig out improvements from those papers and implement them. I'll make the training go fast on the GPU by organizing the data correctly. I won't try to push online learning like last time. That was stupid of me.

1:10pm. I am going to step on the path of my personal development. Once I am ready, I'll start with inverse UIs. All of this won't take me long at all.

At some point in the future, once the agents are playing in the background, I'll find time to do the dictionaries and other language TODOs. That will be the timing to loosen the pressure on myself. Everything should go in its proper order.

I am not a beginner anymore, and my foundation is deep at this stage. So it won't take me long until I have the agents.

This is what I need to be aggressive about. This is what I can look forward to. The rest are just side quests.

Today I can make a great accomplishment of creating my first neural agent after over a year!

Let me have breakfast here. I am long overdue on it."

31.3. Advancing Between Cart & Checkout

Creating the Checkout Form Component
The last step is to toggle the content on the main part of the page. The shopping cart list is already isolated into its own component. Let's now create another component to hold the checkout form... so we don't have to add all its HTML and logic right into shopping-cart.
Create a new checkout/ directory and then an index.vue file inside. I'll paste in a very simple component that prints some text and exports a name.
Back in shopping-cart.vue, use this. Step one: import it: import CheckoutForm from @/components/checkout... but where is my auto-complete? Ah! Ryan! I accidentally put the new checkout/ directory in assets/. It should live in components/. Now Webpack is happy.
Add CheckoutForm to components and scroll up to the template.
Before we render this, look at <shopping-cart-list. Thanks to the v-if, this only renders once the completeCart data is available. Now we want to render it when the completeCart data is there and if the currentState equals cart.
Below this, render <checkout-form. Oh, but copy the v-if from above, paste, and render it when the currentState is checkout.
By the way, you could make a really good argument that the currentState logic should live in v-show instead of v-if. We'll talk more about that at the end of our discussion about Vue transitions.
Anyways, let's do this! Find your browser and click "Check Out". Beautiful! We can switch back and forth, back and forth.
But... the change is a little.. abrupt. I'd love to have a nice transition between the two pages, like the old one fades out and the new one fades in. Can we do that? Of course! CSS itself supports transitions and with a special feature from Vue, we can leverage those perfectly. Let's learn how next.

Pipeguns: Elitism Edition (#56322)

About The Pull Request

The core of the PR:

The improvised shotgun that was is dead and removed.

Now we have Pipeguns. Pipeguns are bolt action rifles that have a damage multiplier that reduces their damage to 75%, and can be modified to fit the rare 7.62mm bullets. If you want to that is.

The pipegun also slowly increases in misfire probability for every shot at a rate of 5% per shot.

Pipeguns can also be upgraded to Regal Pipeguns. These contain more bullets, don't misfire and don't have a damage multiplier. To acquire one is a maint secret, only available to lucky assistants who come across the diary of a dead assistant. The probability of finding the book is quite, quite low.

Bandoliers now fit individual 7.62mm. Because why not. Currently they're available in stripper clips that fit into most combat belts so this is mostly a style preference at the moment

Other shit

Ammo modification and misfire behaviour is now generalized to all ballistics. You can now make any gun misfire and any internal magazine gun swap ammunition.

Misfires are not a flat chance. Instead, they increment as the gun fires over time.

Ports over this PR Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13#12274 which I felt was pretty neat conceptually for making some weapons weaker.

Makes the icemoon hermit's mosin into a regal pipegun, just to get mosins out of easy access.
Why It's Good For The Game

Improvised shotguns were one of my favourite weapons to horribly abuse while they were utterly broken a nice alternative, but I fully support moving towards curbing gun power curve. Part of that should include looking at improvised weapons like this which are seeing considerable usage with the removal of buckshot and slugs.

Initially I wanted to pair this with a PR of my own to bop Mosins on the skull along with it, but #56319 is already doing that, and while it's a very lenient approach to my own (I was going to remove them entirely from cargo), I respect it.

Changelog

cl
add: Replaces improvised shotguns with Pipeguns (with a special variant for those willing to go through arbitrary bullshit to acquire it and sheer good luck).
add: Now all guns can be set to misfire and swap ammunition.
add: Misfire chance is incremental as you fire the weapon, and not a flat static chance. This can be reset by using a piece of cloth on the gun and 10 seconds of cleaning.
balance: This has been applied to the detective revolver, but it only increments while using .357 bullets.
add: Guns can have damage multipliers attached for the bullets they fire. The pipegun (but not the regal version) is the first example with a 75% damage output.
balance: The Ice Hermit now has a regal pipegun instead of a Mosin Nagant.
balance: The bandolier fits 7.62mm.
balance: You can construct receivers and rifle stocks in the crafting menu.
balance: Detaches the magical rifles from the boltaction subtype, since they are just basically not using any variables attached to that subtype and made from a series of early returns.

42.2. Form Validation

Finishing Checkout Success
Before we talk about client-side validation, I think we should finish onSubmit() by handling the happy case: what happens when the form is valid and a new Purchase was created in the API.
Open src/Controller/CheckoutController.php. I've already created a really simple "order confirmation" page. All we need to do is get the id of the new Purchase that was just created by the API and then redirect to /confirmation/{id} that id.
There's nothing really fancy about this. Back in Vue, inside of the successful side of things - the try - add window.location = and then we can use fancy ticks to say /confirmation/, ${} then response.data.id.
This is not @id, it's actually id. If you look at the API docs, I don't always return an id field on my resource... since every resource already has an @id. But I did in this case because it made my life easier.
Oh, and there's one other function I'm going to call. In cart-services.js, search for clearCart. This makes an AJAX call that tells the API that the cart should now be deleted and reset. That could happen automatically on the server when we create a Purchase, but since it doesn't in our API, we'll do it in Vue. Add await clearCart() and hit tab so PhpStorm adds the import for us.
So: clear the cart and then redirect to the confirmation page.
Let's try it! Go find the check out form, fill in some real data... this is - I kid you not - the real address of one of my friends - then some fake data and... submit!
It worked! The user now sees a very cutting-edge message about how they can mail us a check or money order to receive their products in a short three to six months. Oh, and also, the shopping cart on top shows zero: the cart was reset.
Before we go find our checkbook and a stamp, we're not quite done yet. Next, let's explore how we could also add client-side validation.
