The fun police are bloating too many ROMS with themes etc, and ruining the users
ability to flash whatever damn size g-apps they want. Dark days, does anyone remember

Now its less than Omni on some ROMs

CodingGuidelines: recommend singular they

Technical writing seeks to convey information with minimal friction. One
way that a reader can experience friction is if they encounter a
description of "a user" that is later simplified using a gendered
pronoun. If the reader does not consider that pronoun to apply to them,
then they can experience cognitive dissonance that removes focus from
the information.

If we use singular "they/them" pronouns instead of "he/him" or "she/her"
pronouns, then we can avoid this congitive load on the reader.

Using singular "they" is also incredibly efficient. Choosing a gendered
pronoun is usually arbitrary between "he" or "she". Using constructs
such as "he or she", "s/he", or "(s)he" are more complicated than
singular "they".

When choosing a gendered pronoun, that pronoun no longer applies to
nearly half of possible readers. Even if we alternated between "he/him"
and "she/her" perfectly evenly, we would still expect male and female
readers to experience an incorrect pronoun half the time. However, some
readers will not prescribe to either of these binary genders. Those
readers hence suffer an incorrect pronoun the entire time. Singular
"they" applies to every reader.

I believe these reasons are sufficient for the Git project to decide to
use singular "they", even if there are concerns about official style
guides recommending against it.

To justify singular "they" as an acceptable grammatical concept, I
include the careful research of brian m. carlson who collected their
thoughts on this matter [1] (lightly edited):

  Singular "they" has been used by native English speakers as part of
  the language for over half a millennium and is widely used and
  understood. This usage is specified in Merriam Webster[2]:

    The use of they, their, them, and themselves as pronouns of
    indefinite gender and indefinite number is well established in
    speech and writing, even in literary and formal contexts.

  Wiktionary notes[3] (references omitted):

    Usage of they as a singular pronoun began in the 1300s and has been
    common ever since, despite attempts by some grammarians, beginning
    in 1795, to condemn it as a violation of traditional (Latinate)
    agreement rules. Some other grammarians have countered that criticism
    since at least 1896. Fowler's Modern English Usage (third edition)
    notes that it "is being left unaltered by copy editors" and is "not
    widely felt to lie in a prohibited zone." Some authors compare use of
    singular they to widespread use of singular you instead of thou.

  Linguists fit roughly into two camps: prescriptive and descriptive.
  The former specify rules for people to use, and the latter document
  language as it is actually used without forming a judgment.

  Some prescriptivists think it is acceptable, and some do not. But
  descriptivists will rightly note that it is and has been commonly
  used in English across countries, cultures, and contexts for an
  extended period of time and is therefore generally accepted by most
  English speakers as a normal part of the language.  Since we are
  writing text for an English language audience who are mostly not
  linguists, we should probably consider using the language that most
  people will use in this context.

[2] https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/they
[3] https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/they

If we refer to a specific person, then using a gendered pronoun is
appropriate. Examples within the Git codebase include:

* References to real people (e.g. Linus Torvalds, "the Git maintainer").
  Do not misgender real people. If there is any doubt to the gender of a
  person, then use singular "they".

* References to fictional people with clear genders (e.g. Alice and
  Bob).

* Sample text used in test cases (e.g t3702, t6432).

Other cases within the Git project were cleaned up by the previous
changes.

change SpecialKey to DraculaPink (vim only) (#252)

Related: #192, #210, #248

Also #247 is about `NonText`, which needs investigating.

Issues: `:digraphs`, special keys in `:map` output, and certain parts of
`'listchars'` are "subtle" and hard to read (esp. w/ `cursorline` over
them). Also, vim uses `SpecialKey` for them (instead of `Whitespace` for
`'listchars'` and `SpecialKey` elsewhere, like NeoVim).

Fix: make `SpecialKey` more like special keys (the highlight in vimscript
for, e.g., `map <Space> :echo "hello"<CR>`). This has the side effect of
making digraphs more visible. It also makes certain `'listchars'` pink,
which may be annoying. But there is no way currently to separate the two
in vim.

Rationale: It matches with the special keys in maps. The fact that vim
uses it elsewhere may simply be "wrong" and need changed.

If you don't like it: well, as usual, you can use an autocommand to use
whatever colors you want (`:help dracula-customization`).
