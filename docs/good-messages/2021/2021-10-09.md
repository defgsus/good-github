opengl fucking sucks

after much screaming and gnashing of teeth, i've finally gotten opengl to work more or less in tandem with pygame so i don't have to rewrite the whole damn thing. the real success here, though, is that i was able to get it to build. that took far longer than it ever should have.

## [krobelus/lab](https://github.com/krobelus/lab)@[b0a8faf0e6...](https://github.com/krobelus/lab/commit/b0a8faf0e671c8e8908ccc720d55ab5f2a93a6d2)

mr discussion: allow to comment on specific lines in a diff

GitLab supports to comment on lines (or even ranges of lines) within a
commit diff.  This is standard practise when using the web interface,
and it's arguably friendlier to the MR author.

Add a bunch of --position-* parameters to "lab mr discussion" to implement this [1].
(This interface is awkward, because almost all of them are needed.
Maybe we could fit all of this in one parameter somehow? Then there'd
be less room for user errors.)

Given a commit diff like

	--- a/README.md
	+++ b/README.md
	@@ -3,2 +3,5 @@
	 line 3
	 line 4
	+line 5
	+line 6
	+line 7

this allows to run a command like this to comment on "line 6".

	lab mr discussion origin branch --commit=commit-id --position-file=README.md --position-line-type=+ --position-line-number=6 --position-line-number-old=5

The parameters should be fairly self-explanatory, except maybe the
line numbers. They are the equivalent to the two columns of line
numbers that GitLab/GitHub display to the left of a diff.
We should document in the command line help how they are computed,
but I wasn't sure where to add it.

This feature is designed to work well with [Tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig/),
because Tig readily exposes the correct line number parameters.
Adding this to your ~/.tigrc

	bind diff C !lab mr discussion %(remote) %(branch) --commit=%(commit) --position-file=%(file) --position-line-type=%(text) --position-line-number=%(lineno) --position-line-number-old=%(lineno_old)

will allow you press C on a line inside a diff hunk to comment on that line.
This can be really convenient with Tig. I took the liberty to mention
Tig in the documentation; not sure if this is appropriate.
(Please note that the --position-file-old which I added to the
examples currently requires an unreleased version of Tig, see Tig
commit 5a23214c (Expose %(file_old), the filename before a rename or
deletion, 2021-10-04).)

One annoyance with this binding is that every "lab mr discussion"
touches the network, so can be noticably slow. That's easy to fix
though.

Background:
I have been using a similar workflow with Tig, see
https://github.com/krobelus/gitlab-offline-review
I'd love to eventually switch to lab (or something alike)

I only heard about it in the recent Linux Plumber's Conference.
Also I discovered today that there is yet another similar project
[glab](https://github.com/profclems/glab). however, they don't
have a "mr discussions" command, so I stuck to lab.

(Additionally, there is
[bichon](https://gitlab.com/bichon-project/bichon) but that looks
less flexible than a command line tool).

chore: do Tailwind build at Heroku deploy (#933)

We do a minimized Tailwind build: this strips away CSS classes that we
don't use, and makes the difference between a CSS file of 40kB and 2MB (!).

However, it's annoying during development, because anytime you
experiment with using a new Tailwind class you have to remember to
re-generate the CSS files.

Instead, we'll just commit the full Tailwind source file of 2MB into
development, and do the optimized build automatically during Heroku
deployent. That way, the CSS is still efficient in production but the
developer experience is better.

First part of Update 2.7.0

- Added Building Gadgets, set max build distance to 16, added a lot of blocks to its blacklist that would break or crash the game when moved, set the max energy of all tools to 20M, energy cost per operation to 2500 (Building Gadget) / 5000 (Exchaning & Copy-Paste Gadget) / 10,000 (Destruction Gadget), added custom recipes for all items, added more crushing recipes for Construction Paste, and added 5 quests for the 4 Gadgets and the Template Manager.
- Added the Clumps mod, making it so Experience Orbs clump together, reducing lag when there is a large number of them.
- Void World changes: Tinkers' Slime islands no longer spawn there, J'zahar Portals can no longer lead there,  it can no longer contain Immersive Excavator ores, GalactiCraft Rockets can no longer launch from there.
- Tier 3 Heavy Duty Plates now require the correct amount of inputs in the Ultimate Compressor.
- Imp Summoning now requires Bloodgem Dust instead of Bloodgem.
- Fixed a bug where Thermal Foundation Destabilized Clathrate and AbyssalCraft Redstone Shard could be converted between.
- Moonglow Seeds, Spirit Herb Seeds and Wildewheat Seeds can now be used to make Plant Oil.
- In the Mortum Tower loot, replaced the incorrect Botania Runes with the correct ones and replaced Zinc Ingots with Sodium Ingots (much more useful).
- Lively Nature now correctly requires Oak Spirit instead of Spruce Heart.
- Transparent Conduit Facades now also craft 4 at a time (just like regular ones).
- All Integrated Tunnels items' NBT data can now be cleared by crafting.
- Skyroot Logs can now be transformed into Livingwood.
- The Woodland Mansion Locator Token now actually works in Singleplayer.
- Unhid Yellow Stained Glass.
- Added a Checkbox quest in Chapter 14 notifying the player that Command Blocks need to be enabled on the server on order for custom dungeons to work.
- Changed the recommended automation method for the Hellfire Forge that has 2 identical inputs to use Integrated Dynamics in Chapter 15.
- Corrected the Terrasteel quest in Chapter 18 to require the correct amount (6, not 5) for the Elven Gateway.
- Added "preferred items to smelt" in the Essentia Smeltery quest in Chapter 19 to obtain all Aspects.
- Corrected a typo in Tips: "quater" -> "quarter".

Note: This is not final as we still need to add a blacklist for Building Gadgets on which blocks shuldn't be mined up/moved due to mining level criterias.
