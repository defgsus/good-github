title: History Stats
description: Instructions about how to integrate historical statistics into Home Assistant.
ha_category:
  - Utility
  - Sensor
ha_iot_class: Local Polling
ha_release: 0.39
ha_quality_scale: internal
ha_domain: history_stats
---

The `history_stats` sensor platform provides quick statistics about another integration or platforms, using data from the [`history`](/integrations/history/) integration.

It can track how long the integration has been in a specific state, in a custom time period.

Examples of what you can track:

- How long you were at home this week
- How long the lights were ON yesterday
- How long you watched TV today

## Configuration

To enable the history statistics sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: history_stats
    name: Lamp ON today
    entity_id: light.my_lamp
    state: 'on'
    type: time
    start: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration %}
entity_id:
  description: The entity you want to track.
  required: true
  type: string
state:
  description: The states you want to track.
  required: true
  type: [list, string]
name:
  description: Name displayed on the frontend. Note that it is used by Home Assistant to generate sensor's `object_id` so it is advisable to choose a unique one and change name for frontend using [customization](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/#friendly_name) or via [Lovelace](/lovelace/entities/#name).
  required: false
  default: unnamed statistics
  type: string
type:
  description: "The type of sensor: `time`, `ratio`, or `count`."
  required: false
  default: time
  type: string
start:
  description: When to start the measure (timestamp or datetime).
  required: false
  type: template
end:
  description: When to stop the measure (timestamp or datetime).
  required: false
  type: template
duration:
  description: Duration of the measure.
  required: false
  type: time
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>

  You have to provide **exactly 2** of `start`, `end` and `duration`.
<br/>
  You can use [template extensions](/topics/templating/#home-assistant-template-extensions) such as `now()` or `as_timestamp()` to handle dynamic dates, as shown in the examples below.

</div>

## Sensor type

Depending on the sensor type you choose, the `history_stats` integration can show different values:

- **time**: The default value, which is the tracked time, in hours
- **ratio**: The tracked time divided by the length of your period, as a percentage
- **count**: How many times the integration you track was changed to the state you track

## Time periods

The `history_stats` integration will execute a measure within a precise time period. You should always provide 2 of the following :
- When the period starts (`start` variable)
- When the period ends (`end` variable)
- How long is the period (`duration` variable)

As `start` and `end` variables can be either datetimes or timestamps, you can configure almost any period you want.

### Duration

The duration variable is used when the time period is fixed. Different syntaxes for the duration are supported, as shown below.

```yaml
# 6 hours
duration: 06:00
```

```yaml
# 1 minute, 30 seconds
duration: 00:01:30
```

```yaml
# 2 hours and 30 minutes
duration:
  # supports seconds, minutes, hours, days
  hours: 2
  minutes: 30
```

<div class='note'>

  If the duration exceeds the number of days of history stored by the `recorder` component (`purge_keep_days`), the history statistics sensor will not have all the information it needs to look at the entire duration. For example, if `purge_keep_days` is set to 7, a history statistics sensor with a duration of 30 days will only report a value based on the last 7 days of history.

</div>

### Examples

Here are some examples of periods you could work with, and what to write in your `configuration.yaml`:

**Today**: starts at 00:00 of the current day and ends right now.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

**Yesterday**: ends today at 00:00, lasts 24 hours.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      hours: 24
```

{% endraw %}

**This morning (6AM - 11AM)**: starts today at 6, lasts 5 hours.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ now().replace(hour=6, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      hours: 5
```

{% endraw %}

**Current week**: starts last Monday at 00:00, ends right now.

Here, last Monday is _today_ as a timestamp, minus 86400 times the current weekday (86400 is the number of seconds in one day, the weekday is 0 on Monday, 6 on Sunday).

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ as_timestamp( now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) ) - now().weekday() * 86400 }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

**Next 4pm **: ends today at 00:00, lasts 30 days. Easy one.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      days: 30
```

{% endraw %}

**Last 30 days**: ends today at 00:00, lasts 30 days. Easy one.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      days: 30
```

{% endraw %}


** 4PM always in the future**: ends in the future at 16:00, starts 24 hours before.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ (now().replace(minute=0,second=0) + timedelta(hours=8)).replace(hour=16) }}'
    duration:
      hours: 24
```

{% endraw %}

**All your history** starts at timestamp = 0, and ends right now.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ 0 }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

<div class='note'>

  The `/developer-tools/template` page of your Home Assistant UI can help you check if the values for `start`, `end` or `duration` are correct. If you want to check if your period is right, just click on your component, the `from` and `to` attributes will show the start and end of the period, nicely formatted.

</div>

Jingle all the way with opera tab completion

It's time to fulfil our quest that was desired to be done from times
of yore (#56). And since Christmas is about giving back and caring
about others, we decided to bring merry to all our users and enable
tab completion for opera CLI arguments.

One can almost get enchanted when looking at a CLI that has a
nice-working tab completion. Shell completion can be hard to
comprehend sometimes because there's many ways to support it.
Since opera uses argparse we had to find a tab completion package
that's compatible with it. The love on first sight would be
argcomplete Python package which was designed for completing argparse
commands and their arguments. However, when we tried it, it didn't turn
out so well. Most of the time we were unable to get it working with our
subparsers and on the other hand we didn't want to activate completion
globally. So we almost gave up with that. But then we remembered that
failure only happens when you give up. Hope and determination fuel
the true champions. So we found shtab as a possible solution. The
package is still very young and some features will probably be worked
on in the future.

We were able to use shtab in our code to generate a shell completion
script. And we don't even need a separate command to do that since
shtab supports defining a global optional argument that will print
out the completion script for the main parser. We used that and
defined --shell-completion/-s flag which receives a shell type to
generate completion for. Shtab currently supports bash and zsh so those
are the options. So, after running `opera -s bash|zsh` the generated
tab completion script will be printed out. To activate it you must
source the contents which can be done with `eval "$(opera -s bash)"`
or you can save it to a file and then source it. The procedure will
be fully explained in the opera documentation.

First thoughts about tab completion also included a possibility to
pre-install it for the user. For that we would need to do the sourcing
within the installation. There was also a suggestion to have a
separate opera shell-completion command that would have a --install
switch to install tab completion on user's system. We didn't want to
upset the users by installing something into their environment that
they might not want. We also didn't want to modify their ~/.bashrc file
and add our completion as that could bring a lot of problems. At the
end, we  decided to just print out the generated completion script and
then the user can decide how to continue for himself.

The new completion feature will give aid to those opera users who seek
it. Since opera CLI is evolving and growing, new and new commands and
CLI options are being introduced. So it's easy to make a mistake while
you're using the CLI. And that's when tab completion comes in handy.

Apply transform to constrain RBFKernel lengthscale in LCEMGP (#643)

Summary:
## Motivation

This adds a transform to `UniformPrior` in `LCEMGP` class to convert real values to constrained values in `[0, 2]`. Otherwise, with distribution validation enabled (which will be the default once https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48743 is merged), this throws an error in `Uniform.log_prob` method. We were facing this issue in an internal FB test that uses botorch.

While this fixes the specific issue, my thinking is that this transform should ideally be applied automatically within `gpytorch.priors`. That said, my understanding of the codebase is very limited, so would love to hear others' thoughts on this.

### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?

Yes

Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/pull/643

Test Plan:
Turned `Distribution.set_default_validate_args(True)` and succesffully ran `test_contextual_multioutput.py: ContextualMultiOutputTest.testLCEMGP` with a fixed seed and increased `maxiter` (this test fails without the fix).

Do you have best practices for working with content developers regarding IP ownership? Frequently Asked Questions about working in Second Life What is Second Life and why is it relevant for enterprises and governments? Second Life, the leading 3D virtual world, was launched in 2003 as a technology platform that enables millions of consumers, represented inworld as avatars, to imagine and build immersive environments that are easy and inexpensive to create. Second Life is not only one of the oldest virtual world platforms, but it is also the largest with millions of active users residing in more than 150 countries globally. Second Life has always been used by a wide variety of individuals, businesses, educators, governments and nonprofit organizations as an environment for entertainment, education, social interaction, research, shopping, and more. Over the years, many large multi-national enterprises and government institutions have realized that Second Life is also a powerful collaboration tool for work such as: meetings, training sessions, and simulations and prototypes. What advantages does Second Life offer that are unique among virtual platforms? Second Life owns 90 percent of the virtual world market and is the most flexible, richest, and most advanced virtual work solution that exists today. Here are a few facts to consider: Largest Virtual World: Second Life, the largest virtual world platform, is roughly the size of Houston when all of the individual parcels, known as “regions” or “islands,” owned by various individuals and organizations are taken as a collective. Richest Content and Most Vibrant Digital Goods Economy: Second Life has the richest and largest library of virtual content—avatars, clothing, building elements, etc. — in existence with millions of items already created by inworld residents and more are built every day. This library allows organizations to purchase content easily and cheaply, versus having to pay thousands of dollars in services to build these items in other environments. Most Flexible: As opposed to many other virtual world companies, Second Life allows you to create multiple work solutions within the same environment. For example, you can have a virtual meeting space, a large conference center, a training simulation, and a social gathering space—all on one Region. Cost and Billing What does it cost to register for Second Life, and what can I expect immediately upon registration? Joining Second Life is free. After completing a short registration form and choosing an avatar, you can then explore Help Island —a specialized doorway into Second Life where you can to find other people from hundreds of countries around the world. Today, an organization follows the same registration process that consumers do. How much does a typical Second Life work environment cost? If you decide to become a landowner, then please email business@lindenlab.com and we'll be happy to discuss pricing and walk you through the process. In general, for one private region in Second Life (or what is sometimes called an “island”), the initial one-time set-up fee is $349 USD and then $229 USD a month in maintenance costs, per region. One region is 256 meters on each side, which is bigger than two American football fields lying end to end in the physical world. Once your organization owns virtual land, you can then create buildings, meeting spaces, and social spaces yourself (if your organization has Second Life building skills in-house). How can I buy land? Unless you’re a Second Life pro, the best way for enterprises or educational institutions to purchase land is to email business@lindenlab.com and we can help walk you through the process. What billing options do I have? You can either make your purchase on a credit card or your company can be billed directly. Avatars What is an avatar and how do I create mine? An avatar is a digital, animated representation of yourself in Second Life. When you join Second Life, you have a standard set of avatars to choose from. Once you receive your avatar, then you can go into “appearance mode” and change your hair, skin, shape, and clothing. We encourage you to personalize your inworld representation by purchasing new skin, clothes, and other accessories from thousands of Second Life retailers on the Second Life Marketplace. To view a series of video tutorials about how to create your avatar and other topics, see the official Second Life YouTube channel here. Can my avatar have my real name? Is it possible for my enterprise group to share one surname? Currently within Second Life, there are two naming options for organizations to choose from. Business enterprise group administrators can permit members to select a surname offered upon registration or choose to purchase a customized group surname from Linden Lab that allows you to set up a corporate last name that you can use to create an unlimited number of employee accounts. For example, Joe Morris is an AT&amp;T employee and can choose to use a standard Second Life name, which is a username of Joe's choice with the surname 'Resident'. Or, if AT&amp;T’s administrator purchases the corporate last names option, then Joe Morris have the name of Joe AT&amp;T, to help create a common affiliation and group among AT&amp;T employees. In the last example, everyone who works at AT&amp;T would have the same corporate last name to help employees identify themselves inworld. Regardless of what Second Life name scheme is chosen, all employees can wear inworld “name tags” that clearly display real names. We also offer Display Names which can be customized by any account holder and updated regularly, up to once a week. Are there rules about how avatars can behave inworld? When joining Second Life, every new member must agree to the Second Life Terms of Service, which outline the rules that all avatars must follow. Some businesses choose to adopt the standard Second Life Terms of Service alone and some opt to create additional terms that outline a specific group, or organization’s rules, such as prohibiting access to inappropriate materials or only allowing human avatars. How many employees/avatars can I get into one Second Life working environment? Each region can run optimally with roughly 60 avatars before performance suffers and 100 is the current maximum limit. Factors that can affect performance include how complicated the environment is and the intricacy of avatar clothing. To create an environment that can hold more people, we suggest that conference spaces are built at a four-corners area of four separate regions. Doing this, an event can hold roughly 200-300 avatars. If you require more employees to participate in an inworld event, Second Life can easily be streamed live to the web, which means that thousands of people globally can participate in an inworld event through both video and chat. How do I move around in Second Life? Although operating within the Second Life environment might be challenging at first, it’s easy to get the hang of all of the movements that you’ll be using in a business environment—walking, sitting, teleporting, etc. For more information and tips on how to get around, visit our Knowledge Base. Our new user also covers how to move your avatar and interact with the environment. If you're unsure about what to do, try right-clicking on something you can see; a menu will open, displaying available interaction options -- like sitting on a chair, or paying a vendor to purchase an item. Communication and Collaboration How do avatars communicate in Second Life? Second Life is a rich-immersive environment that enables a wide variety of communication channels, including both text chat, and 3D spatial voice. There are other more interesting and dynamic ways that teams can communicate such as virtual brainstorming tools, document sharing, whiteboarding, 3D mind mapping, and many other business tools that take full advantage of virtual workspaces. What languages does Second Life support? You’ll find members from over 150 countries and you’ll find hundreds of different languages spoken in Second Life. Linden Lab, the makers of Second Life, has customized betas of the Second Life Viewer, or the 3D browser software that allows you to enter Second Life, in the following languages: Danish, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Japanese and Chinese. Once inworld, Second Life supports most languages used typically used within global organizations. Additionally, team members who speak different languages can communicate via several inworld text translation tools, including an optional translation interface built directly into the viewer which uses Bing Translate or Google Translate (at the user's preference). What 3D business applications are available today for use in meetings and training environments in Second Life? Today, there is a wide assortment of business productivity and creativity applications within Second Life. These include widgets for: running Powerpoint presentations, white boarding, brainstorming, dynamic audience polling, and many others. To find business applications, you can search the SL Marketplace. How can Second Life best be used for networking and building relationships? We all know that work is much more than meetings, training, and other more formal activities. It’s also about those “water cooler moments” where you can connect and communicate with colleagues, partners, customers, prospects, industry experts, and friends. Second Life was designed as a social networking platform and all of those capabilities are naturally part of the Second Life experience. For example, IBM held a networking event where IBMers shared virtual beers and went virtual jet skiing and hang gliding. Needless to say, experiences like these are not only memorable, but also great business networking and socializing opportunities. How is collaboration in Second Life different from sharing a conference call, Webex, or video conferencing technologies? Teleconferencing, Webex, and video conferencing technologies are all important collaboration tools that companies use every day for global and mobile teams to work together and stay connected. Second Life provides a sense of presence that many people find more engaging and compelling than many other types of conferencing, as well as providing a 3D space to share information. In addition, informal discussions are easy to have after a meeting, since your Second Life experience doesn’t end when the moderator terminates a call. When compared directly to other technologies, Second Life remains a clearly compelling addition to your overall collaboration portfolio of choices. Teleconferencing is great when Internet access is problematic, but staring at a telephone isn’t a very effective way to have a meeting. Webex is a fantastic technology for a few people to broadcast a presentation to a large audience, but falls short as a true brainstorming, planning, simulation, or visualization medium. It’s helpful to see your colleagues’ faces during a video conference session, but the quality of these meetings is often uneven and you still don’t get a sense of a shared environment—particularly helpful in training, simulation, and prototyping activities. And, none of these technologies is useful for informal “water cooler” time that we all know can be so valuable. Overall, we believe that Second Life is the next best thing to a face–to–face meeting which is usually always preferred, but not always possible due to geographic or budgetary constraints. Security How secure is my data (text chat, voice, login, etc.) in Second Life? Linden Lab does not distribute account information, per our Terms of Service. Regarding login, the Second Life Viewer login uses password-only authentication over an encrypted secure HTTPS connection. We do not have access to your password itself. Viewer 2 gives you a connection to Second Life that does not compromise your computer’s security. Linden Lab takes customer privacy and security extremely seriously, and maintains strict internal standards to protect all information involved with the Second Life service. For more specific information about the technical environment of Second Life, please contact us directly at business@lindenlab.com. One item of note: Linden Lab employees can go anywhere within Second Life, including your region. However, we make every effort to only enter your region upon request. If a Linden is in your area, the avatar name will show up in the attendee list; no one can go “invisible” in Second Life. How can I control who is permitted to enter my region, workspace, or events? Any business, or individual, can buy a Private Region as part of an Estate in the Second Life world. A single Private Region resembles a small island, and can be linked together with other Private Regions to form a larger landmass. These Regions provide a highly manageable environment for conducting private business in the virtual world of Second Life. A Region owner may choose to exercise full control over access to Private Regions in the Estate. The Region’s included administrative tools enable its owner (and designated managers) to create an access list, by individual or group, ensuring that only approved users can enter the Region. A Private Region is secure from eavesdropping. The Region is surrounded by an equivalent void space, represented by water; void space cannot be crossed by walking, running, flying, or by camera. How do I grant estate rights to other avatars so they can collaborate on building and other aspects of sharing space? The estate, land parcel, and group tools in Second Life enables you and colleagues to collaborate on content creation, editing and access to a shared space. By setting objects to group ownership, you can share editing permissions with group members based on roles you assign within that group. Estate-level controls permit region owners to give specific individuals estate manager privileges, allowing even greater control and moderation ability. Additionally, you can also set land permissions to enable or disable content creation. What are “griefers” and how can they be avoided? Second Life is not policed, in the traditional sense. Instead, we rely on the community to self-govern and report abuse when it happens. Griefers are, according to Wikipedia, “players who plays a computer game (in this case Second Life) in order to irritate and harass other players.” Griefing behavior—such as violence, bad language, hate speech, harassment, etc.—is considered a breach of the Second Life Terms of Service and can result in an expulsion from Second Life. Thankfully, organizations with Region or Estate controls can prevent griefers from entering their private space altogether. Region owners, group owners, and their designated managers have access to powerful moderation tools to control their environment. How can my organization best avoid environments and content that is inappropriate for business use? Second Life is a virtual world that successfully supports a myriad of environments, some of which mimic the physical world while others are composed of architecture and content that diverges from the laws of physics. The platform successfully hosts communities of all kinds, from business enterprise and education to those with mature themes. Each region has a rating of General, Moderate, or Adult to allow visitors to better anticipate the nature of content they might find in a region. With private regions, region owners and their designated managers can easily remove or return content that may not fit their preferred theme or concept of appropriate. I want my employees to go directly to my organization’s space in Second Life. How do I do set this up? Once your employees are registered as Second Life users, then you can send them directly to your region with a SLurl—or a Second Life URL that teleports avatars directly to a specific place (based on latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates). It works just like a standard web URL, but instead of clicking and taking you to a web page, it takes you to a destination within Second Life. For a more in-depth and technical explanation of how this works, visit our Map API technical details page. Technology How robust and stable is the Second Life technology platform and how can I find out about scheduled outages? The Second Life technology platform is very stable and has continually made strides towards continuous uptime, with full service outages being extremely rare. We do regularly take regions down for maintenance. If you would like to view a current schedule of planned downtime, and view recent platform performance, please visit the Second Life Grid Status page. What computer hardware, software, and network bandwidth requirements are necessary to run Second Life? Your organization’s computers and network must meet a certain set of minimum requirements to run successfully Second Life. Visit the Systems Requirements page for additional details. How do I know if my organization will permit me to access Second Life within my corporate firewall? Many aspects of Second Life run on a UDP protocol, as opposed to a standard web protocol such as http or https. Sometimes, network administrators within large organizations prevent employees from accessing UDP protocols. Please check with your IT department and ask about accessing Second Life for work through the firewall via UDP ports. Building How easy is it to build objects in Second Life and can I train my team to do this? Building objects in Second Life is easy to do. Highly flexible building tools allow manipulation of geometric primitives in a simple interface. Stretch these “prims” into new shapes, change their texture and physical qualities, link them to other prims. From this easy–to–learn process, you can create objects of all kinds and sizes, from a simple box to a five hundred meter skyscraper. Then, you can overlay textures on top of these prims—such as a wood texture to make a wood box or a brick texture for a brick wall. There are may tutorials and inworld lessons that you can find—both from Lindens and inworld experts—that can help you get started. 3D Mesh content, as frequently seen in many other visual environments, can also be imported into Second Life. For technical information about uploading 3D mesh objects, visit our Knowledge Base. A great deal of excellent mesh-based content is already available, created by existing Second Life users. You can see many interesting examples that may suit your building needs on our Marketplace. Do you have best practices for working with content developers regarding IP ownership? We recommend that you are very clear about what IP (intellectual property) you own and what the developer owns. For example, if a developer builds you a chair, they should grant you IP rights to it. However, tools like voting boxes, presentation screens, or announcers are often used by developers in multiple projects and will only grant you the rights to use the tool, but not IP ownership. When in doubt, ask questions and make sure that you get specific answers, in writing when possible. Back to the Connect Second Life site.

<title>Name to Agent ID API</title>
<link>https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/name-to-agent-id-api-r1566/</link>
<description>One of the challenges created by name changes is that anyone with an external database that uses name lookups must adjust by replacing or reindexing to use agent IDs. The Name to Agent ID API is a publicly available REST endpoint to which a user submits a username/last name combination (Residents with a single username have the last name "Resident" by default), and is returned the agent_id associated with that name if it exists. Documentation for usage of this tool can be found through the APIs and Web Services Portal, or directly: Name to agent ID API documentation</description>

<![CDATA[ 他の言語 ベイク処理テクスチャとはどのようなもので、これがメッシュに必要なのはどうしてですか？ 主な機能 メリット 仕組み ウェアラブルなベイク処理チャンネル ユニバーサルウェアラブル ベイク処理テクスチャを使用するためのメッシュ設定 新しいチャンネルでの作業 Animesh での作業 スクリプトのサポート ステップバイステップの例 テストコンテンツ 既知の問題点 メッシュでのベイク処理 とは、システムアバターのベイク処理テクスチャをメッシュアタッチメントで表示できるようにした機能です。 ベイク処理テクスチャとはどのようなもので、これがメッシュに必要なのはどうしてですか？ 標準のシステムアバターを使用した場合、複数のテクスチャレイヤーでスキンをカスタマイズしたり、タトゥーや衣服のレイヤーを追加したりできます。処理時間を節約し、どのシステムでも全員に同じアピアランスを表示するため、これらのテクスチャは、サーバーにより単一の結合テクスチャに「ベイク処理」されます。以前であれば、カスタムメッシュボディパーツを使用して同種のカスタマイズを行う場合、ボディパーツに独自のテクスチャシステムが必要でした。 さらに、通常は、基本的な標準アバターのボディパーツに「アルファ」ウェアラブルを適用して、メッシュ部分を妨げないように隠す必要がありました。メッシュでベイク処理を行えば、システムスキンやその他のレイヤーをアバターに適用した後（アルファレイヤーは不要または望ましくない）、生成されたベイク処理テクスチャをメッシュのボディパーツに適用するようビューワに指示することができます。基礎となるシステムアバターのパーツは自動的に非表示になるため、アルファウェアラブルは必要ありません。 主な機能 メッシュオブジェクトのどの面にも、サーバーベイク処理テクスチャを使用してテクスチャを作成することができます。 いずれかのアタッチされたメッシュがベイク処理テクスチャを使用していると、システムアバターの対応領域は非表示になります。 新しいテクスチャベイク処理チャンネルの導入で、メッシュのテクスチャリング方法をより細かく制御できるようになりました。 新しい「ユニバーサルウェアラブル」に、新たなテクスチャチャンネルのサポートが追加されました。 メリット アプライヤーが必要でないため、カスタマイズのワークフローが簡単にできます。 オニオンスキンアバターが必要でないため、表示時のメッシュとテクスチャが減らせます。 フルパーマメッシュを販売する必要がありません。ユーザーは、メッシュ自体を変更せず、適切なウェアラブルを準備するだけで、「メッシュでのベイク処理」を使用するよう設定されたすべてのメッシュをカスタマイズできます。 仕組み ウェアラブルなベイク処理チャンネル アバターウェアラブルは、ベイク処理サービスにより伝統に従い、6 種類のテクスチャ（BAKE_HEAD、 BAKE_UPPER、 BAKE_LOWER、 BAKE_EYES、 BAKE_SKIRT、 BAKE_HAIR）にベイク処理されています。これらテクスチャは、アバターのさまざまなウェアラブルアイテムで対応テクスチャを合成することにより得られます。たとえば、1 枚のシャツは「上部」テクスチャを決定し、複数のレイヤーから成るシャツは最終的なテクスチャを BAKE_UPPER 仕上げることになります。 「メッシュでのベイク処理」プロジェクトには、以下の 5 つの新しいベイク処理チャンネルも追加されました。 LEFT_ARM_BAKED、 LEFT_LEG_BAKED、 AUX1_BAKED、 AUX2_BAKED、 AUX3_BAKED。オリジナルテクスチャとは異なり、システムアバターはこれらのテクスチャをいずれも使用しません。これらは、メッシュのアピアランスをより細かく制御できるようにする単なる拡張機能です。 LEFT_ARM_BAKED と LEFT_LEG_BAKED は、左右の手足のテクスチャが異なるメッシュアバターの作成をサポートするためのものです AUX チャンネルは用途が広く、（翼など）システムアバターが所有しない身体領域やその他の目的に使用できます。 全部で、テクスチャに使用するウェアラブルと、ベイク処理サービス向けに 11 チャンネルの利用が可能です。 ユニバーサルウェアラブル 新しいチャンネルは、そうしたチャンネルを使用するアイテムを装着する何らかの方法がない限り、役に立ちません。このニーズを満たすために、「ユニバーサル」と呼ばれる新しいウェアラブルタイプが追加されました。ユニバーサルウェアラブルには、新旧 11 種類のベイク処理チャンネルすべてに対応するスロットがあります。レイヤリングの順としては、ユニバーサルなウェアラブルは、皮膚やタトゥーのウェアラブルより上、その他すべてのタイプの衣服より下に重ねられます。 ベイク処理されたテクスチャを使用するためのメッシュ設定 これらのテクスチャを、以下の要領で、アバターのアタッチメントの拡散テクスチャに適用できるようになりました。 アタッチメントを右クリックして [編集] をクリックし、[面の編集] メニューからテクスチャを選択します。 拡散テクスチャアイコンをクリックして、テクスチャピッカーを開きます。 テクスチャピッカーには、サーバーベイク処理を選択するための「ベイク処理」と呼ばれる追加のラジオボタンモードがついています。「ベイク処理」ラジオボタンモードには、サーバーベイク処理テクスチャを選択できるドロップダウンがあります。 アタッチメントがベイク処理テクスチャを使用していると、システムアバターの対応する基本メッシュ領域は非表示になります。 メッシュ面がベイク処理されたテクスチャを表示するように設定されていても、アバターにアタッチされていなければ、デフォルトのベイク処理テクスチャが表示されます。メッシュでのベイク処理をサポートしていない古いビューワを使用している場合、ベイク処理テクスチャを表示するよう設定された面もデフォルトのベイク処理テクスチャとして表示され、ベースメッシュ領域は非表示に

On the road to Rust-like Fargate Stuff

yeah sure whatever

Fixed up typechecks

blep blep

It should work, but it doesn't.

I think it should work potentially

It fucking succeeded asdfgh

Yes yes it works yes

e2e works

sysmon works

okay time to rip out more garbage

it work
