Merge pull request #1607 from DataDog/sorbet/rfc-add-sorbet

RFC: Add Sorbet typechecker to dd-trace-rb

 ## TL;DR

* Minimal bootstrapping for now.
* Type checking is optional. Default is no type checking for files   without a magic comment. Should have minor impact on  people that don't want to touch the type checking.
* `bundle exec srb tc` runs the type checking.
* I've enabled type checking during CI runs

## Notes for reviewing

* This PR has two commits -- one that has all of the setup and relevant things, and another which is 100% the result of running `bundle exec srb init`. I strongly suggest reviewing them separately, for added sanity. (If you want to quickly glance through the second commit -- your terminal won't choke on the diff like github does ðŸ˜‰ )
* ~~This PR depends on #1605, and CI is failing for unrelated reasons. Thus, I've opened it as a draft until both of them are cleared and the runway is clear. It otherwise is ready for review/discussion.~~ Now updated.

 ## What?

While not a replacement for all our tests and other tooling, a type checker is a nice extra line of defense for catching issues that we otherwise may have missed, such as #1602.

The Ruby ecosystem around type checking is still rather immature. You may have heard that Ruby 3 shipped "with type checking" but that's an oversimplification: it actually only shipped with a "language for describing types" and a "type analysis tool" (<https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/>).
You may have noticed that nowhere in the previous sentence the words "type checker" were included.

So, Ruby 3 itself provides no type checker. In practice, there are two typecheckers in "wide" use for Ruby:

* [Steep](https://github.com/soutaro/steep), created by a Ruby core team member that also worked on manny of the other type-related bits that made it to Ruby 3 (but steep itself was not made part of Ruby)
* [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/), a type checker in wide use at Stripe and Shopify

This RFC PR does a first pass at onboarding Sorbet to our codebase. There's a number of limitations on this "first pass", which I document below.

 ## Why not Steep?

I've tried onboarding our codebase to steep, and gave up due to two big issues:

1. Steep relies on the Ruby 3 rbs format, but unlike Sorbet, there doesn't seem to be any way of starting small on a mostly-untyped codebase without any `.rbs` files, and iterate from there. There are tools to generate skeleton `.rbs` files (the `rbs` gem has two different modes for it + the `typeprof` gem), but they had a hard time with ddtrace.

2. There is currently little documentation for the type checking errors, once Steep does run. Google gave me ZERO hits on one of them (I guess it doesn't index the tool repository at least). And they're not all that easy to understand/fix, so what use is having a tool tell you "this is wrong", if then you're stuck with little help on something that may not even be a real issue but more likely a tool limitation?

For these reasons, I gave up on Steep (for this first iteration).

 ## Working with Sorbet

Sorbet can be run with `bundle exec srb tc` (or `bundle exec rake typecheck`). There's also Language Server Protocol support, if your editor supports it.

The key thing to know about Sorbet is that allows file-level granularity for enabling type checks, see
<https://sorbet.org/docs/static#file-level-granularity-strictness-levels>.

In practice, this means that at the top of each `.rb` file, we can provide a comment that controls the reporting of type checking errors for that file. The usual ones (described in the above link as well) are:
`# typed: ignore`, `# typed: false`, `# typed: true`, `# typed: strict`, and `# typed: strong`.

In many cases, **Sorbet can typecheck a file correctly with no extra type annotations**, so we can start enjoying its checks (such as finding  #1602) by just enabling it for our files. This can be done with the `# typed: true`, `# typed: strict`, `# typed: strong` modes (see the docs  for details).

The `# typed: false` is the default for files with no comment. Thus, even newcomers into the codebase will not be forced to immediately deal with Sorbet for contributions, which given the current limitations of the tool, and level of maturity, I think is reasonable. (We can reconfigure this later, if needed). In this mode, Sorbet will only complain about syntax and missing constant errors.

Our codebase requires quite a few `# typed: ignore` because or dependencies that are pulled via appraisals and thus not seen/available to Sorbet (among other things that we do and that Sorbet) doesn't quite like. These files are completely ignored by Sorbet. (Note that if you then reference something on one of these files from another file, that file will not typecheck either, so "ignore" becomes somewhat contagious, and is best avoided if possible).

I've also added a CI step to run sorbet, which again follows the rules above so should be able to provide us with valuable insight without being an annoying source of build failures.

 ## Limitations or "I thought the whole point of this was for us to add type declarations to the code"?

Now we get to the more unfortunate part of the news: I think that for now we don't have great options for doing this.

Sorbet type annotations are supposed to be inline with the code, and work through the [`sorbet-runtime`](https://rubygems.org/gems/sorbet-runtime) gem.

Unfortunately, as described on <https://sorbet.org/docs/faq#what-platforms-does-sorbet-support>:
> The sorbet-runtime gem is currently only tested on Ruby 2.6 and Ruby 2.7. It is known to not support Ruby 2.4. Feel free to report runtime issues for any current or future Ruby version.

Thus, since we still want to support Ruby 2.1, that doesn't quite work for us. I thought we could perhaps have an empty replacement of the sorbet runtime gem, and it turns out that [Shopify already tried and abandoned it](https://github.com/Shopify/sorbet-runtime-stub). So, inline annotations seem to be out for us.

For Sorbet, that leaves us with only one other option: `.rbi` files.
These are files that allow Sorbet to get type information for otherwise untyped code, and are the solution to having type information for many common libraries.

Unfortunately, using `.rbi` files for our own code is very error-prone, because Sorbet trusts `.rbi` files, and doesn't check them against the code. Thus, if we had a class `A` with method `m` declared both on our code, as well as on an `.rbi` file, and then we renamed `m` to `n` and forgot to update the `.rbi`, then Sorbet would not complain about it.
Worse, if somewhere there was a call to `A#m` somewhere in the code, Sorbet would still think it was correct, while in reality it would break at run-time.

 ## The future?

Because our usage of Sorbet is rather simple, we can at any point switch to Steep, or any other tool, or just disable it, if it's not providing value. So we are not locked at all into its usage.

Hopefully in the near future we'll find a way to add type declarations to our library without impact to our support matrix of older Rubies.

Even better, we could then ship those types to our customers, for them to check that they are using ddtrace APIs correctly!

Update Storyboarder.download.recipe

Amended regex so that the arm64 version is not downloaded by default.. figured this was favourable as the intel version can run on arm under rosetta.. and not vice versa

-> highest rated green coder in the room
   - blue coder below me! (thanks to challenge points)
   - yellow coder below me (2 failed systest, 0 challeng points)
- would have been 5/11 w/ Kanten-4205's challenge
  - by >50 pts! :-/
    - but hard to construct challenging input

rank in the division: 140/420 (~? present)
- mostly higher-rated (historically blue) coders above me!
  - ~20-30 blue coder below me!
  - ~15-20 yellow coders below me!!

- just so-so blue, but still!
  -> historical moment!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  => SH*T, I JUST BECAME BLUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     - I guess competing in Div 1 now
       - must practice Div 2 Hard to stay on track!
         - minimum Div 2 Medium
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Analysis
--------

- well-rested, well-slept
- stressful, annoying rounds
  -> painful 250-pt
     - implementation
     - mismatching compilers w/ TC :-/
- too many presubmit bugs in 250-pt :-/
  - painful

250-pt:
- AC!! yes!
- felt like Div 1 Easy
  - tricky to implement

- presubmit bugs:
  - "RIP c++ users who got compilation errors because of the method signature used the same function name Sort.. I wasted at least 50 points there trying to debug"
    - me too :-(
    - both YCM and g++ complained
    => CHECK FOR CLASH OF NAMES!!
    => WHEN UNSURE ABOUT COMPILATION ERROR, TRY PREPENDING "STD::"!
  - segfault
    - forgotten size intialization
      - i.e. `vector<pair<string,int>> scores;`
        - instead of `vector<pair<string,int>> scores(N);`
      - tricky hidden segfault :-/
    => COMPILE CONTINUALLY/AFTER EVERY LOGICAL BLOCK OF CODE!!!!!
    => BINARY SEARCH VIA MSG("HERE") TO FIND THE CAUSE OF SEGFAULT!!
  - problems w/ debug-printing
    - can't print `vector<pair<string,int>>`
      - clash of <<= and << operators
    => DON'T WASTE TIME FIGURING OUT WHAT CAN BE DEBUG PRINTED OR NOT
  - hesitation w/ `ranking[i]=scores[i].S;`
    - reverse mapping `ranking[scores[i].S]=i;`?
      -> no!
    => THINK CAREFULLY HOW TO STORE RESULTING RANKING!
  - typo: swapped .F and .S for string counting :-/
    => ALWAYS STORE PAIRS AS (INDEX, PAYLOAD)!!
       - MORE NATURAL & KEEP IT SAME ALWAYS!
  - out-of-bound error: `i >= 0` instead of `i-25 >= 0`
    - no compilation error/exception :-(
    => THINK CAREFULLY & AHEAD HOW YOU USE INDICES IN FOR LOOP!!!
       => ONLY THEN TYPE THE CONDITION!!
    => OR LEAVE IT BLANK UNTIL THE BODY IS IMPLEMENTED/CLEAR!
  - misunderstood `cmp` return type
    - should have been int for {-1,0,1}, but returned {true, false}
      - guard against SGN(...)==0
        - then return SGN(...)==1
      - i.e. `int cmp=SGN(count(a.F.begin()+i-25,a.F.begin()+i,'1')
                        - count(b.F.begin()+i-25,b.F.begin()+i,'1'));`
        - instead of `bool cmp=count(a.F.begin()+i-25,a.F.begin()+i,'1')
                             > count(b.F.begin()+i-25,b.F.begin()+i,'1');`
      => REMEBER THAT OPERATOR< RETURNS ONLY {0,1} FOR INTS!!
         => OPERATOR< RETURNS ONLY {-1,0,1} ONLY FOR STRINGS!
  - hesitation w/ reverse sorting the scores
    - re-design
      - sort decreasingly, instead of after-sort reverse
    => PLAN AHEAD CAREFULLY HOW TO SORT!!
       - INCREASING OR DECREASING?
=> coding kata!

600-pt:
- unsolved :-/
- BFS/DFS traversal
  - set to pow(2) or pow(2)-1?
- problems with debug printing unordered_map<> :-/
  - Vimcoder operator<< overload sucks! :-(
=> to upsolve!

- succesfully challenged new coder D3structor's solution
  - suspiciously short
  - used the most tricky solution (i.e. sample 2)
    - one of 2 first challenges in the room
=> always focus on new coders, esp. if they more pts from the solution
than higher rated coders
=> PREPARE CHALLENGE INPUT
   => ESPECIALLY (OR AT LEAST) PICK THE MOST "CHALLENGING" SAMPLE INPUT!

- should have challenged new coder D3structor's 600-pts
  - challenged
  - faster: directly there
    - compare the code w/ higher rated coders' solutions
    - and guess when too short :-/
      - but difficult to construct!

- worked on challenging green coder Kanten-4205's solution
  - failed systests!
  - suspicious handling of "ending" (see the attached screenshot)
    <- accumulates only the last shot of each round?
       -> possible challenge, but tricky to construct and not enough time
=> TRY HARDER TO READ OTHER'S SOLUTION

Implement ImmutableArray

This rebases #31630 with several fixed and modifications.
After #31630, we had originally decided to hold off on said
PR in favor of implementing either more efficient layouts for
tuples or some sort of variable-sized struct type. However, in
the two years since, neither of those have happened (I had a go
at improving tuples and made some progress, but there is much
still to be done there). In the meantime, all across the package
ecosystem, we've seen an increasing creep of pre-allocation and
mutating operations, primarily caused by our lack of sufficiently
powerful immutable array abstractions and array optimizations.

This works fine for the individual packages in question, but it
causes a fair bit of trouble when trying to compose these packages
with transformation passes such as AD or domain specific optimizations,
since many of those passes do not play well with mutation. More
generally, we would like to avoid people needing to pierce
abstractions for performance reasons.

Given these developments, I think it's getting quite important
that we start to seriously look at arrays and try to provide
performant and well-optimized arrays in the language. More
importantly, I think this is somewhat independent from the
actual implementation details. To be sure, it would be nice
to move more of the array implementation into Julia by making
use of one of the abovementioned langugage features, but that
is a bit of an orthogonal concern and not absolutely required.

This PR provides an `ImmutableArray` type that is identical
in functionality and implementation to `Array`, except that
it is immutable. Two new intrinsics `Core.arrayfreeze` and
`Core.arraythaw` are provided which are semantically copies
and turn a mutable array into an immutable array and vice
versa.

In the original PR, I additionally provided generic functions
`freeze` and `thaw` that would simply forward to these
intrinsics. However, said generic functions have been omitted
from this PR in favor of simply using constructors to go
between mutable and immutable arrays at the high level.
Generic `freeze`/`thaw` functions can always be added later,
once we have a more complete picture of how these functions
would work on non-Array datatypes.

Some basic compiler support is provided to elide these copies
when the compiler can prove that the original object is
dead after the copy. For instance, in the following example:
```
function simple()
    a = Vector{Float64}(undef, 5)
    for i = 1:5
        a[i] = i
    end
    ImmutableArray(a)
end
```

the compiler will recognize that the array `a` is dead after
its use in `ImmutableArray` and the optimized implementation
will simply rewrite the type tag in the originally allocated
array to now mark it as immutable. It should be pointed out
however, that *semantically* there is still no mutation of the
original array, this is simply an optimization.

At the moment this compiler transform is rather limited, since
the analysis requires escape information in order to compute
whether or not the copy may be elided. However, more complete
escape analysis is being worked on at the moment, so hopefully
this analysis should become more powerful in the very near future.

I would like to get this cleaned up and merged resonably quickly,
and then crowdsource some improvements to the Array APIs more
generally. There are still a number of APIs that are quite bound
to the notion of mutable `Array`s. StaticArrays and other packages
have been inventing conventions for how to generalize those, but
we should form a view in Base what those APIs should look like and
harmonize them. Having the `ImmutableArray` in Base should help
with that.

*: reduce all "deny" and "forbid" lints to "warn"

Lints at the deny/forbid level can be very frustrating when developing,
because you're forced to comply with the lint even when you're still
prototyping, just to get your code to compile.

This commit downgrades all these lints to "deny", to optimize for the
development experience. In CI, these lints are still enforced at the
"deny" level by our Clippy configuration, which upgrades all warnings to
hard errors.

The one glitch here is that `forbid` used to prevent submodules from
re-enabling the forbidden lint. I propose that we solve this socially,
by making it taboo to add `#![allow(missing_docs)]` unless you've gotten
buy-in from the overall owner of that area of the codebase.

gts2-common: switch gnss from passthrough to hwbinder to avoid marshal_agps_ril_request_setid gnss crash

When using gnss passthrough, we get the following crash message on multiple S2 tab devices including T710,
T810, T815, etc on a daily basis (< 24 hours).

By switching to hwbinder, the same users who were experiencing daily crashes can now go +100 hours with no crashes.

However, in order for gnss hwbinder to work, both passthrough and hwbinder must be specified in device.mk otherwise
tablet will get stuck at boot animation complaining that it cannot find gnss passthrough implementation.  The gnss
hwbinder is specified in the manifest.xml file.

Thus it appears that the proprietary gps.default.so blob does not work correctly in passthrough mode with 17.1
and luckily hwbinder works.

We found out gnss was the culprit because I started a XDA thread at

https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/troubleshooting-random-reboot-problems-on-s2-exynos5433-tablet-only-discussion-for-users-running-any-version-of-android-10.4308203/

and 4 users shared their adb logs and tombstones and most of them pointed to the same gnss crash message below.
Some people also reported that overnight their device would reboot itself and end up in TWRP mode.
We found that through TWRP logs, that Android 8+ rescue party was being activated.

According to

https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/rescue-party

"Rescue Party receives information about boot and crash events and starts if:

The system_server restarts more than 5 times in 5 minutes.
A persistent system app crashes more than 5 times in 30 seconds."

So if gnss crashes 5 times in less than 5 minutes, that's why some people had TWRP loaded overnight and if TWRP
doesn't implement deep sleep then people were also facing dead battery issues in the morning. Unfortunately,
we don't have any logs proving that gnss crashes is what triggered the rescue party. It could be something
else, but we are limited to what users will share with their logs.

Huge thanks to XDA users lpedia, CuckooPenguin and Yogi555
for testing the various gnss patches until we finally figured out the hwbinder solution.

In addition, huge thanks to Anan Jaser for providing hints, code and acting as a sounding board while we figured this out.
