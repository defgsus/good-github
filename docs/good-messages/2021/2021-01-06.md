damn man i just want grill and they took it away, damn them all!!! (#55024)

Whoever the damn bastard is who tried to take our grills. know this: we will not bend over while you take the only thing that still makes us happy. We just want to drink energy drinks and grill some hamburgers in peace. This is your final warning, try doing this again and we will assemble a lawn mower squad outside of your house at the early hours of 6AM to make sure you cannot enjoy your sunday morning in peace.

Newfood compatibility is now included by checking IS_EDIBLE() and removing the shitty foodtype that was there before

Logs pockets, updates some shitty stripping verbage (#55027)

Two things at hand here.
A: Pockets were not logged at all. I hate god.
B: I'm using log_message here because it gives me the freedom to be more grammatically correct. Please attack my spelling and offer suggestions of other mob strip panel things to log in the comments
B.5: I updated stripping to use log_message for the same reasons.

Getting rid of Detekt.

98.7% of the complaints were needless noise.

It told me it thought handleRequestAndRespond was too complex.
Yeah nope.  I understand what I'm doing.

It thought loggingConfigHtml was too long
It is complaining about a template function that generates HTML text dynamically.

It thought readAndDeserializeTimeEntries was too nested and complex.
I could break it up, yeah, but by splitting this essential piece into multiple, it would likely just increase the cognitive load.

It felt that *EVERY SINGLE NUMBER IN THE CODE REQUIRED A NAMED CONSTANT* .... FFS.
like this is wrong, according to Detekt:

    enum class Month(val ord: Int) {
        JAN(1), FEB(2), MAR(3), APR(4), MAY(5), JUN(6),
        JUL(7), AUG(8), SEP(9), OCT(10), NOV(11), DEC(12);

and apparently this is also wrong:

      val beginDate = LocalDate.of(1980, 1, 1).toEpochDay()
      val endDate = LocalDate.of(2200, 1, 1).toEpochDay()

....

Maybe 4 or 5 of the 320 complaints are valid, it's just got way, WAY too many false positives.  Said another style: way too high noise to signal ratio.  This boy is crying wolf in a horrible way.  Sure I could go back and basically do heavy surgery to quiet it the hell up, but I'm not willing at the moment to do that.

They could really take a page from Sonarqube.  The magic of Sonarqube is that they developed a set of rules, the "Sonar way", that is a very valid set.  If one of those rules fires, it's certain to be a legitimate problem.

It's understandable, coming from a nerd, they'd want to highlight every single problem, but it's the same path that other tools like PMD and Findbugs went, and those tools are hateful.

what the

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

stats: some more performance graphs

Add an infrastructure for collecting performance-related data, use it in
some places. Add rendering of them to stats.lua.

There were two main goals: minimal impact on the normal code and normal
playback. So all these stats_* function calls either happen only during
initialization, or return immediately if no stats collection is going
on. That's why it does this lazily adding of stats entries etc. (a first
iteration made each stats entry an API thing, instead of just a single
stats_ctx, but I thought that was getting too intrusive in the "normal"
code, even if everything gets worse inside of stats.c).

You could get most of this information from various profilers (including
the extremely primitive --dump-stats thing in mpv), but this makes it
easier to see the most important information at once (at least in
theory), partially because we know best about the context of various
things.

Not very happy with this. It's all pretty primitive and dumb. At this
point I just wanted to get over with it, without necessarily having to
revisit it later, but with having my stupid statistics.

Somehow the code feels terrible. There are a lot of meh decisions in
there that could be better or worse (but mostly could be better), and it
just sucks but it's also trivial and uninteresting and does the job. I
guess I hate programming. It's so tedious and the result is always shit.
Anyway, enjoy.
