Remove Okawaru's friend conduct

It had little actual impact on gameplay and little flavour - mostly it
was an occasional surprising annoyance. I think there's room here for
a much more interesting, stronger anti-ally conduct, but I don't know
when we'll get to it, and there's no good reason to leave this around
in the meanwhile.

we've added the parallel evaluation structure to Party_t. We still need to add in all the fillings of course. We'll want to make each evaluator for the various types as parallel friendly as possible, so if can eliminate any need for accessing their parent types, all the better. It will be safe to not lock each members sub types though, because our unit is the member itself. We also don't need to access any other member, so that's even better. But from time to time we may need to access parent types like Members_t. For example, if a new outfit needs to be created, we need to lock for that because we need to know what options are set on the Members_t, and we don't want them changing out from under us...oh wait. It should actually be perfectly safe to read such data. I forgot, we're locking the entire plugin, so menu and dialogue cannot change our settings while we eval. So, the only potential trouble spots are when any of the 8 threads need to change a Parent type. We should remove all of that if possible so we don't have to have the oddball chance of needing the extra internal parallel lock.

Build script cleanup (#311)

This commit attempts to clean up the code responsible for compiling Ruby
in the build script, as well as get the crate compiling on Windows.

For Unix, the main change here is that I've removed any attempts at
skipping steps beyond those built into `make`. This should still skip
the most expensive parts of the build, but be much more resilient. It is
possible (or even likely) that this is going to be slightly slower than
what was there before. If this is undesirable, we should move the C
build out to a separate crate as outlined in #310.

On Windows, this goes from the crate not compiling to the crate
compiling. This commit does *not* mean that the build on Windows is
working, yet. On my machine, it builds but immediately segfaults when
run. This is most likely because I have configured Ruby to skip all
extensions except ripper. The most likely candidate is `enc` (which
unfortunately is also the one I was struggling to get building), but I
haven't dug in further.

Even though Windows builds segfault, I don't think that should block
this PR being merged. I've spent several hours banging my head against
this, and need to walk away from it for a while. The fact that it
*compiles* is still a step in the right direction. The fact that this is
strictly an improvement on what was happening before is why I opted to
submit this in this state.

The way Windows build tools are set up is... Funky. MSVC intends you to
pretty much always build through Visual Studio, and if you install just
the build tools you're expected to run through a shortcut it provides
which links MSVC DLLs and sets a ton of env vars for you. This is
definitely suboptimal, and I couldn't get the crate to build at all when
run from the MSVC console.

The CC crate seems to handle most of this for us. I still ran into a few
issues figuring everything out (Ruby builds in 32 bit by default even
when compiled on a 64 bit system for... some reason), and I couldn't
some extensions (enc and bigdecimal, possibly others) on 64-bit. But I
don't think that's because of the build environment.

The other changes were pretty straight forward. There was one instance
where we assumed `long` was 64 bits (which isn't true), and the
jemallocator crate doesn't build on Windows at the moment, so I've
disabled it.

The winapi dependency is basically just to get the appropriate
`rustc-link-libs` that are needed for Ruby. I'm not sure if the
`everything` feature actually slows anything down at runtime or not. It
should probably get pared down at some point, but after realizing it's
at least 6 or 7 dylibs I punted this for now

Fixes #301.
Related to #304.
Related to #310.

Temporal solution and needs to be replaced with something more viable but complex.
This fixes desyncs caused by object id wrong serialization/deserialization for specific tasks when length hack is used.

vendor: notch-city: Add 3 mode display cutout handler [2/3]

[@AgentFabulous - POSP]
- Introduces the HideCutout and StatusBarStock overlay used in the
  3 mode display cutout handler. The HideCutout overlay is necessary
  since we can't register a content observer in the display manager code.
  We only have access to resources during boot. Thus, leave this as an
  overlay and let the config and overlay change methods handle this.
  Though we can probably do statusbar stock height toggling in the
  SystemUI code without overlays, I kinda got lazy by the end, just
  live with it god damn it xD

Restart with change only on exit

This change allow the user to change everything they have to inside the
homescreen activity and only restart on exit. Previously this was a pain
in the fucking ass because you had to go in and set each option one by one
with a restart inbetween. At least now is not that big of a pain.

- Restart on destroy (hitting the back button, actionbar arrow)
- Restart when a chance is made and the home button is pressed

** Thanks "Jack" for code to detect home button
https://stackoverflow.com/a/27956263

- Cleaned up restart code

file updates

I set a monthly schedule to try and update portions of my files and the website since I often find it so frustrating when I come across other researcher's websites that are hopelessly out of date (and so helpful when they aren't!). This is my first attempt at trying to keep up with this schedule, which involves some changes to my CV, EDI, and teaching statements. Big changes are:

- Added in my Chinese name (love you mom!). I'm still not sure about whether I'll keep that long term, but I'm starting to do it for publishing so I figured might as well.
- Cleaned up my EDI statement to be shorter and more to the point. 
- Ditto with the teaching statement.

Also debating about whether I want to also add in text related to my personal background and/or mentoring experience since that should probably go somewhere but never quite feels like the right place for it. We'll see how I feel in the future if I can keep this up.

Propagate puzzle notes to PUZ files in the notepad.

Previously, extra metadata outside the standard PUZ notes field was
stored in a proprietary META section that is unknown to other
applications. This would result in an inconsistent experience, where a
JPZ file with visible notes from a non-standard field would be saved as
a PUZ that would then lose visible notes when viewed in Across Lite.

With this change, we remove support for the extra META section. Instead,
when saving to PUZ, we concatenate all metadata fields which are
considered to be notes (using section headers and separators) and insert
them as plaintext into the PUZ notes field. Of course this is not a
perfect rendering, but in the most common case of having one field for
notes but which might not be the <instructions> field as XWord expects,
this does a reasonable job.

There are two main functional changes (to my knowledge):

- Metadata fields not considered notes-like are now dropped entirely
  when saving as a PUZ, instead of being stored in the custom META
  section. This feels reasonable - when saving a JPZ as a PUZ, the most
  likely reason would be to open the PUZ in another app which won't
  support the META field anyway; if the intent is to save to a file that
  can be viewed in XWord itself, there's little reason to change format.
  But if desired, we could retain the META section as long as we omit
  any notes-like metadata when doing so (to avoid repeatedly
  concatenating it to notes each time we load/save the PUZ).

- Previously, when rendering JPZ notes, the normal "notes" section would
  have a slightly different shade of gray (#eeeeee) than the other
  sections (#dddddd). The difference is subtle and I can't discern a
  major reason for it; removing this allows us to simplify the logic in
  MyFrame::ShowNotes now that we've needed to push IsNotes() down to the
  Puzzle level.

See #140
