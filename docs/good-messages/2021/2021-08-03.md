Compendia of the high holidays 2020 -- Release notes

The phone phreaker man named "Lucky" in question uploaded a swastika image into a hacked Google Hangouts chat he initiated with me in 2019-2020 following an email I sent to Christine Blasey Ford on New Years Eve of 2019. The man insisted on being "invited in" (as in a horror flick) to begin that chat conversation with an image about crucifixion. The hateful image was reported by this man to be created in sage-math for an artwork showcase to which he was asked to contribute graphic illustrations. It is in response to one particular set of eyeballs I made in the artwork repository that ended up included in the stock GEyes applet set of eyes as described here: https://github.com/maxieds/GEyesThemes/issues/1. Therefore, the release notes associated with the following link are relevant: https://github.com/maxieds/GEyesThemes/releases/tag/Codename-BackOrifice53. In the email to CBF from 2019, I described the changes to WA state law that happened due to his actions in a physical assault based social engineering ruse perpetrated on a large university campus in Seattle in November of 2014 (also documented in the release notes). I conclude that folklore about 2600 magazine being sponsored by domestic terrorists reported by some conservatives must surely be true. That subversive magazine has had Lucky225 as an editor on it since 2005, the year I took a key programming course in C++ at a large engineering school in the midwest. The origin of the term "phone phreaker" is apparently due to the banned Anarchist Cookbook along with recipes for things like homemade LSD.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

#### Tuesday 2021-08-03 07:40:41 by Harald Hope

New version, new man, huge update, bug fixes, cleanups, updates!!

What started as a relatively minor issue report ended up with a refactor of big
chunks of some of the oldest code and logic in inxi.

So many bugs and fixes, updates, and enhancements, that I will probably miss some
when I try to list them.

Bugs:
1. In the process of fixing an issue about sudo use triggering server admin
emails on failure, when --sudo/--no-sudo and their respective configuration
items were added, sudo was inadvertently disabled because the test ran before
the options were processed, which meant the condition to set sudo data was
always false, so sudo for internal use was never set. The solution was to
set a flag in the option handler and set sudo after options or configs run.

2. Issue #219 reported gentoo and one other repo type would fail to show
enabled repos, and would show an error as well, this was due to forgetting
to make the match test case insensitive. If only all bugs were this easy
to fix!!

3. I'd seen this bug before, and couldn't figure out why it existed.
It turned out that the partition blacklist filters were running fine
in the main partition data tool, but I had forgotten to add in corresponding
lsblk partition data filters, lol, so when the logic went back and double
checked for missing partitions [this feature had been if i remember right
to be able to show hidden partitions, which the standard method didn't see,
but lsblk did, anyway, when the double check and add missing partitions
logic ran, inxi was putting back in the blacklisted partitions every time,
despite the original blacklists working well and as intended.
This was fixed by adding in all the required fs type blacklists, then
adding in comments above each black list reminding coders that if they
add or remove from one blacklist, they have to do the same on the other.

4. Found while testing something unrelated on older vm, the fallback
case for cpu bugs, which was supposed to show the basic /proc/cpuinfo
cpu bugs, was failing inexplicably because the data was simply being
put into the wrong variable name, sigh.

Fixes:
1. While not technically an inxi bug, it would certainly appear that way to
anyone who triggered it. We'd gotten issue reports before on this, but they
were never complete, so couldn't figure it out. Basically, if someone puts
inxi into a simple script that is $PATH [this was the missing fact needed to
actually trigger this bug in order to fix it], the script [not inxi], will
then enter into an endless loop as inxi queries it for its version number using
<script name> --version. This issue didn't happen if the script calling inxi
was not in PATH, which is why I'd never been able to figure it out before.

Only simple scripts with no argument handlers could trigger this scenario,
and only if they were in PATH.

Fixing this required refactoring the entire start get_shell_data logic, which
ended up with a full refactor of the program_version logic as well. The fix
was to expand the list of shells known by inxi so it would be able to recognize
when it was in a shell running a script running inxi.

This resulted in several real improvements, for instance, inxi will now almost
always be able to determine the actual shell running inxi, even when started
by something else. It will also never use --version attempts on programs it does
not know about in a whitelist.

So we lose slightly the abilty to get version data on unknown shells, but we
gain inxi never being able to trigger such an infinite loop situation.

2. As part of the program_version refactor, a long standing failure to get ksh,
lksh, loksh, pdksh, and the related posh shells, all of which ID their version
numbers only if they are running the command in themselves. The mistake had
been having the default shell run that command. These all now correctly identify
themselves.

3. As part of the wm upgrades, many small failures to ID version numbers, or
even wm's, in some cases, were discovered when testing, and corrected. Some
I had not tested, like qtile, and the lisp variants, were not being detected
correctly by the tests due to the way python or lisp items are listed in ps aux.

4. As part of the wm update and program_version refactor, updated and simplified
many desktop and wm detections and logic blocks. Ideally this makes them more
preditable and easy to work on for the future.

5. As some last tunings for the new -y1 key: value pair per line output option,
fixed some small glitches in -b indentation. Also improved RAID indenting,
and Weather, and made it all very clean and predictable in terms of indentations.

6. Something I'd slightly noticed but never done anything about, while testing
desktop fixes, I realized that for Desktop: item, dm: is a secondary data type,
but if it's Console:, then DM: is a primary data type, not a secondary one. So
now if Console: it becomes DM: whic makes sense, previously it implied a dm:
was used to start the console, which was silly. Also, since often the reason
it's Console: with no dm in the first place is that it's a server with no dm.
So now if console, and no dm detected, rather than showing DM: N/A it just
doesn't show dm at all.

7. As part of the overall core refactor, the print_data logic was also refactored
and simplified, by making -y1 a first class citizen, it led to significantly
different way of being able to present inxi data on your screen, and now
print_data logic is cleaner and reflects these changes more natively, all the
initial hacks to get this working were removed, and the logic was made to be
core, not tacked on.

8. A small thing also revealed in issue #219, battery data was not being
trimmed, not sure how I missed that, but in some cases, space padding was in the
values and was not removed, which leads to silly looking inxi output.

9. Several massive internal optimizations, which were tested heavily, led to
in one case, 8-900x faster execution the second time a data structure is used,
previously in program_values the entire list was loaded each time program_values
was called, now it's loaded into a variable on first load and the variable is
used for the tests after that. This was also done for the vendor_version for
disk vendors, which also features a very long data structure which can be
loaded > 1 times for instances where a system has > 1 disk.

I also tested while I was at it, to see if loading these tyeps of data structures,
arrays of arrays, or hashes of arrays, by reference, or by dereferencing their
arrays, was faster, and it proved that it's about 20% faster to not
dereference them, but to use them directly. So I've switched a number of the
fixed data structures internally do use that method.

Another tiny optimization was hard resetting the print_data iterator hash,
while this would never matter in the real world, it showed that resetting
the iterator hash manually was slightly more efficient than resetting it
with a for loop.

10. While  not seen inside inxi, I updated and improved a number of the vm's
used to test inxi and various software detections, so now I have a good selection,
going back to 2008 or so, up to current. This is helpful because things like
shells and window managers and desktops come and go, so it is hard to test
old detections on new stuff when you can't install those anymore. You'll see
these fixes in many of the less well known window managers, and in a few of
the better known ones, where in some cases the detections were damaged.

11. As part of the program_version refactor, updated and fixed file based
version detections, those, ideally, will almost never be used. Hopefully
programmers of things like window managers, shells, and desktops, can
learn how to handle --version requests, even though I realize that's a lot
harder than copying someone's code and then rebranding as your own project, or
whatever excuse people have for not including a --version item in their softaware.

Enhancements:
1. As a result of the shell, start shell, shell parent refactors, inxi was able
to correctly in most cases deetermine also the user default shell and its verison,
so that was added as an -Ixxx option:
Shell: ksh v: A_2020.0.0 default: Bash v: 5.0.16

2. As part of the program_version refactor, a more robust version number
cleaner was made, which now allows for much more manipulation of the version
number string, which sometimes contains, without spaces, non version number '
info right before the actual version.

3. Many more wm IDs were created and tested, and some old virtual machines
that were used years ago were used again to test old window managers and
their IDs, as well as new vms created to test newer ones. Many version
IDs and WM ids were fixed in this process as well. All kinds of new ones
added, though the list is basiclaly endless so ideally inxi would only use
its internal data tables for window managers that have actual users, or did.

4. First wayland datatype, now it may show Display ID: with -Ga, so far that's
the only wayland screen/display data I can get reliably.

5. As part of the shell parent/started in: updates and fixes, added every shell
I could find, and installed and tested as many of them as possible to verify
that either they have no version method, or that their version method works.
This shell logic also is used to determine start parent. Obviously using
whitelists of things that can change over time isn't ideal, but there was no
way to actually do it otherwise. The best part of the fixes is that it's now
remarkably difficult to trick inxi into reporting the wrong shell, and it
generally will also get the default shell right, though I found cases in
testing where a shell when started replaces the value in $SHELL with itself.

6. I found a much faster and reasonably reliable way to determine toolkits
used by gtk desktops, like cinnamon, gnome, and a few others. Test is to
get version from gtk-launcher, which is MUCH faster than doing a package
version query on the random libgtk toolkit that might be tested, and actually
was tested for pacman, apt, and rpm in the old days, but that was removed
because it was a silly hack. It's possible that now and then gtk desktops
will be 0.0.1 versions off, but in most cases, the version matched, so I decided
to restore the tk: item for a selection of gtk or gnome based desktops.

So now gtk desktops, except mate, which of course will be using gtk 2 for a
while longer, toolkit version should be working again, and the new method
works on everything, unlike the old nasty hack that was used, which required
package queries and guessing at which gtk lib was actually running the desktop,
it was such a slow nasty hack that it was dumped a while ago, but this new
method works reliably in most cases and solves most of the issues.

7. As part of the overall program_versions refactor, the package version
tester tool was extended to support pacman, dpkg, and rpm, which in practical
terms covers most gnu/linux users and systems. Since this feature is literally
only used for ASH and DASH shell version detections, it was really just added
as a proof of concept, and because it fit in well with the new Package counts
feature of -I/-r.

8. Updated for version info a few other programs, added compositors as well.

9. Last but not least!! More disk vendor IDs, more disk vendors!! And found
another source to double check vendor IDs, that's good.

New Features:
1. For -Ix/-rx, -Ixx/-rxx, -Ia/-ra, now inxi shows package counts for most
package managers plus snap, flatpak, and appimage. I didn't test appimage so
I'm not 100% sure that works, but the others are all tested and work.

If -r, Packages shows in the Repos item as first row, which makes sense, packages,
repos, fits. Note that in some systems getting full package counts takes some
time so it's an -x option not default.
If -rx, -rxx, -ra, package info moved to -r section, and if -Ix, -Ixx, or -Ia,
the following data shows:
 * -Ix or -rx: show total package counts: Packages: 2429
 * -Ixx or -rxx: shows Packages then counts by package manager located. If there
 was only one package manager with packages, the total moves from right after
 Packages: to the package manager, like: Packages: apt: 3241 but if there were
 for example 2 or more found, it would show the total then:
 Packages 3245 apt:3241 snap: 4
 * -Ia or -ra: adds package managers with 0 packages managed, those are not
 show with -xx, and also shows how many of those packages per package manager
 is a library type lib file.

#### Tuesday 2021-08-03 07:40:41 by Harald Hope

Big change, cleanup, small bug fixes. Hot, grab it now!!

The new -y 1 feature exposed several small and larger glitches with how sets
of data were constructed in inxi output. See Changes: for list of changes made
to improve or fix these glitches.

These errors and minor output inconsistencies became very obvious when I was
doing heavy testing of -y 1, so I decided to just fix all of them at the same
time, plus it was very hard to make the -y 1 indenter work as expected when the
key values were not being treated consistently.

Note that this completes the set of all possible -y results:

Full -y Options:
1. -y [no integer given] :: set width to a default of 80. this is what you usually
want for forum posts, or for online issue reports, because it won't wrap and be
hard to read. Help us help your users and others!! Teach them to use for example
-Fxzy or -bay for their bug reports. Just add y to whatever collection of arguments
you generally ask for in support forums or issue reports. Highly recommended,
easy to type, and joins cleanly with other letters.

2. -y -1 :: removes line width limits, this can lead to very long lines in some
cases, and removes all auto-wrapping of line widths.

3. -y 1 :: Switch to stacked key: value pairs, with primary data blocks separated
by a blank line. Think dmidecode type output, or other command line sys info tools.
By request, a forum support guy noted it was hard for newbies to understand the
-G values, particularly -Ga when in lines, so this is another way to request
data. WARNING: for lots of data, this gets really long!!! But if you are curious
how inxi actually constructs its data internally, this sort of shows it.

4. -y 80-xx :: set width to 80 or greater. Note you can also set these in
your configurations if you want using the various options supported.

-----------------------------------

Bugs:
1. Once again, no real bugs found beyond a few trivial things I can't remember.

Fixes:
1. When out of X, dm: showed after Console: and often said dm: N/A particularly
on headless servers, which was silly. Now DM: only shows after Console: if
a DM: was actually found. If regular Desktop output, either in X, or via
--display out of X, no changes.

2. There was a pointless sudo test when sudo values are set initially, they
were still running even if --no-sudo was used. Now they don't run in that case.

Enhancements:
1. The biggie, now inxi can output in a similar indented way as something like
dmidecode if you use the -y 1 option. This feature was originally by request,
though the initial request actually just wanted to see it stacked simply,
but that was almost impossible to read for any output reasonably long, so
I made the indentations very dynamic and deep, they go up to 4 levels in,
which is roughly how deep in the inxi sub Categories go. This output format
makes it very easy to see how inxi 'thinks' about its data, how it views
sets, subsets, subsubsets, and subsubsubsets of data.

Note that each data block, as with dmidecode data, is separated by a blank
line. You know what this means!!! Yes, that's right!!! You can parse inxi
output with awk!!, same way legacy bash+gawk inxi used to parse its data!!
Or if your brain just does not like lines of data, you can make it appear in
indented single key: value pairs.

Here you can see for example that 1 Xorg Display has 1 or more Screens,
and each Screen has one or more Monitors. Note that this -Ga data first
appeared in inxi 3.1.00.

Sample [with bug in OpenGL output!, and showing -Ga newer values as well
for dual monitor setup, with one Xorg Screen]:

inxi -aGy1

        diag: 482mm (19")
  OpenGL:
    renderer: N/A
    v: N/A
    direct render: N/A

2. Refactored and cleaned up print_data(), got rid of some early testing code,
dumped some unnecessary tests, simplified old tests, and optimized the new
indentation logic reasonably well. Hopefully the print_data() will not be
quite as much of a black box now as it was.

3. Even more drive vendors and ID matches!!! The list never ends!! An endless
series of new vendors and IDs of existing vendors sprout up, then float away.
And inxi follows them to the best of its ability. Thanks again to Linux-Lite
hardware database, which help make this ever expanding list possible, since
their users appear to use every disk known to humankind.

Changes:
1. When out of Display, and Console: shows, -S will not show dm: if no
display manager is detected, and if it is detected, it shows DM: since it's
not part of the Console: set of data. If out of X and --display is used to
get Xorg data out of X, it will show Desktop: set of data as normal, at least
it will show the stuff it can find. This resolves the issue where dm: appeared
to be a member of the set of Console: data, instead of either its own thing,
DM:, or a member of the set of Desktop: data.

2. For RAID Devices with sub Array-x: values, Array-x: is capitalized, it used
to be array-x: That was silly.

3. In USB, now Device-x: resets inside each Hub: so that the Device-x: are
numbered starting at 1 within each Hub:. This makes the counter behavior act
the same as it does in for example RAM Array-x: / Device-y:, where each Array-x:
resets Device-y: count to 1. This changes the old default of having Device-x:
not reset, to let you see the total number of devices plugged in or attached
no matter which hub they were plugged into, but the output actually gets
sort of confusing in single key: value pair mode per line.

4. The key: value syntax for weather was changed completely, now it works
like the rest of the features, with Report:... [Forecast:...] Locale:...
and Source:. Locale makes the source of the times and other date related
features, and the location if shown or available, much more obvious. Before
it was never clear if Current Time referred to your local or the remote
time, now it's clearly from the Locale: you specified with -W, or
the default -w local info. Also made Report 1 line if unwrapped, Forecast 1
line if not wrapped, and Locale: 1 line if not wrapped, which makes the output
easier to read.

NOTE: automated weather queries are NOT allowed, if you do it, you will be
banned!! inxi is NOT a desktop weather app!! Don't confuse it with one!!
Weather is just a small service to users who might for example want to check
the weather on a remote system, or something like that, and is not intended
to be used on a routine basis.

5. Cleaned up and re-ordered the --version output. It had some pretty old
contexts in the language, which were removed or cleaned up and brought up to
date. If you're wondering, I roughly use rsync and nano --version as guides
for what to show or not show there.

#### Tuesday 2021-08-03 10:40:48 by Marko GrdiniÄ‡

"7:40am. Sometimes I awake early and fall back asleep. This time I was anxious and that failed to happen. Let me chill a bit and then I will start.

8:10am. I think I've decided how I want to modify things from the ground up so it distrupts the existing infrastructure the least. I am going to have to change quite a few things including the games themselves, but it won't be too hard.

8:50am. Let me start. Is the PL thread up? Nope.

Let me talk a bit about Spiral itself.

* I hate the prototypes.
* I hate the syntax additions.

I did not think that prototypes would be a problem, but I made a mistake putting them into the language. Instead of putting them in I should have worked on proper module system. Everything single argument prototypes offer in Spiral, modules could do better. If I had modules I'd get a simple and elegant way of doing functional dependencies. With prototypes I'd have to put extra effort for that.

Because of prototypes, Spiral code is such a nightmarish mess of type arguments everywhere. I actually messed up the way arrays work in the language. I just can't do things right with prototypes.

With modules and nominals, I could have simply have the nominal look for a function of the specified name inside its parent module.

9am. I do not have the leeway of rewriting everything from scratch again. Spiral v2 is very stable now and works well. If I could succeed with my making money through RL plan, that would give me some slack to improve the language. I'd need 6-12 months for it. After that Spiral would be quite great though.

9:05am. It is the curse of programming striking at me - everything is better with more effort and experience. Programming benefits disproportionately from cultivation and refinement. It worked for nature in getting to human level intelligence. It works for the people writing code as well.

9:15am.

```
type pid = u8
union rec node state obs (actions : * -> *) act =
    | Terminal: pl2 obs act * state * r2
    | Action: pl2 obs act * state * pid * actions act * (log_prob * act -> node state obs actions act)
```

Here is what I did. Instead of passing an array of actions to choose from, I'll pass in some `actions act` object instead. This will be the descriptor from which to get the appropriate action.

9:20am. I really am curious - could it be that my architectures would work better than existing ones on SL tasks? Even if that is so, taking the time to satisfy my curiosity would be really unprofitable. It is a pity. Maybe I really should write a paper when all is said and done unless somebody reads my reviews and tries out my ideas.

So far, whether it be the Necromutation algorithm, the general philosophy of self improvement, or later all my work on Spiral, the contributions from other people to anything I have done have been trivial. I got brief flurries of interest from time to time and then nothing came of it.

9:25am. Well, it is fine. I can count on people not taking me seriously until I've gathered my power. What I have now is something money cannot buy - methods that work well, but nobody else is using. Eventually they will get discovered by other people and the edge will go away. There is benefit to fame and but there is benefit to obscurity. Ironically, if I had something like a job at Deepmind I would never bother with the kind of RL research I am doing now as poker would be too small stakes.

Noah Brown thinks poker is solved, and gave out Recon Chess as the next target, but that is just clownery. All of his methods have been very hacky, would be hard to replicate and will not stand the test of time.

What is needed is to figure out a way to train general purpose architectures with general purpose algorithms like I have done just recently.

9:35am. Ah, I am so groggy. I haven't gotten enough sleep.

I do not feel like programming, but it is not like I have anything else better to do either. If I just sit here and think, the desire and the insight will come to me.

The trick to working is not so much being disciplined because willpower tends to petter out. One needs to have the desire to form the goal, but the trick to sticking to it is not to want it more than everything else. It is difficult to get oneself to like something. But it is easier to get oneself to dislike something. This much like it is easier to break a tooth than to grow it.

The path of labor is one of disliking everything more than it. In order to do it, one needs to willingly step into hell. There is a price to pay for power and that one is the giving up not one's hobbies, but the enjoyment of it. I pine for the days when I could hooked on games and manga. It is not that I can't do it now. It is not that I outgrew it. But a part of my mind is always focused on programming even when I close for the day.

For example two days ago I became stressed when I realized how much memory the final layer would consume, and I actually spent from the entire time from the start of the afternoon session to about 11pm deep in the zone just sitting in this chair thinking. How many times did the monitor go into screen saving mode?

9:50am. For how long can I live like that? I am not sure, but there is a limit to be reached at some point unless I attain the Inspired Desire. With the Inspired Desire I would not have to pay a price for the pursuit of my goals. My willpower supply would become infinite and path of pleasure and path of labor would become one. If I could attain the Inspired Desire I would not have any more regrets and my heart would be of steel.

9:55am. One thing I am really hoping for is that ML architectures and algorithms converge towards being generic. And indeed that is what can be observed in deep learning where transformers have become dominant in a wide variety of domains. There is a lot of experimentation, but what works best is fairly generic.

Though even so, I know this is not the last round. There will be at least one revolution in learning methods in order to get to the Singularity ignition point. So I will have my work cut out for me.

What I've gone through in the last couple of months is not too bad. Yes, I did a lot of experimentation myself, but that is because the deep learning community is like the primordial soup and the mainstream methods are lacking in too many areas. And what I've arrived at is close to the mainstream, so it is not like I outright revolutionized the field. I just pushed the existing methods to their limit.

10:05am. If it took only this much work to deal with AGI level methods, I'd be delighted. Compared to all the work on Spiral which is so labor intensive what I have here is delightful in its efficiency.

Once I complete what I have here, I'll be essentially done with deep learning. I am unlikely to be replacing the architecture or the activations or the cost function or the optimizer. And that is all there is to making RL work.

Once I complete this, getting power at poker will just be a matter of throwing computation at it.

10:10pm. It should be fine. My current methods are very general. And these kinds of methods will work the best on the widest variety of tasks in the end. Domain specific programms are like spells - narrow superpowers. Nature had to build in biases into the brain, but it is better to take them out for long term performance.

What will come after this will be much the same except moreso. Long term credit assignment. Unsupervised learning. Module compositionality.

I won't have to keep fiddling forever on toy tasks in order to figure out what works. Instead I'll just be able to run things and be safe in the knowledge that it will work.

Right now what I am doing is closer to gene editing than growing crops and tending to the environment.

10:15am. What I've demonstrated in the last few months is insight and flexibility. I've gone through it all and distilled RL to its essence. I've far exceeded my 2018 self. I can praise myself, but have I really done anything special when somebody else can just use my methods and get the same benefit?

10:25am. The algorithms do not matter, I'd be perfectly fine with copying my current methods from somebody else.

If I am going to be the one to ignite the Singularity first, it will be due to structural reasons. Making AI is a morass of morality confusion and uncertainty. Certainly the guys at Deepmind have excess in resources compared to myself. Even if I find better algorithms, they would be able to use them at a larger scale.

They are limited in their goals. It is not that they will make humanity friendly AI - that is the only choice they can make. This is in contrast to individuals like myself. I can make a power seeking AI, and say something crazy like it being a part of my own self improvement loop, and who is to say otherwise?

A group effort like Deepmind's could never say that the AI is their own power.

And so it won't be.

They could always lie, but lies require effort to coordinate. The easiest way to lie is to actually believe it. And so they won't be a threat to me, and won't recognize my own. The later would be interesting as I'd either get assassin's sent after me, or have whores, status and money shoveled towards me.

It is very unrealistic. Even those thinking about friendliness believe it in the same sense Christians believe in God. Their belief goes as far as making minor adjustments to their day to day lives and means nothing beyond that. They won't do crazy things for it.

10:40am. Fate Gu made a great point - people are only free when they are insane.

And so I am free to accumulate my power. I should do whatever I feel is necessary. I vow that I will work more on Spiral. I will write the follow up arcs to Simulacrum. And I will finish the poker agent.

```
inl neural_handler extractor (schema : schema _ _ _) policy_value_action_eval (data : ra _ (_ * _ * u8 * a st _)) =
```

The first challenge is dealing with the neural handler.

10:45am. Focus on ML. Although I regret not being able to do other things, as long as I do ML everything is fine. Even if I die not ever writing another page of fiction as long as I've worked towards AI then that is time well spent. The same goes for working on Spiral. Work on AI takes precedence over everything else.

10:55am. Forget Spiral, forget Simulacrum and forget anything aside from ML. I should not burden myself with wanting other things. I should assume my life is over and the only thing I need to do is act as an ML machine.

Forget any other burdens and responsibilities. I know that I haven't done all I could but that is tough.

11:05am. I should accept that I won't have the time to do anything except this single thing for the next 10 years. The way Spiral is now is the way I will employ it. Simulacrum will go unwritten.

I cannot afford to hold back or do anything that is needed. Not until I've become one of the Inspired. The human me is just a sacrifice to my greater self.

11:05am. Even if I have time to write, or even if I have time to program I should hold back the temptation.

I know deep down, that I will always be able to spend that time on ML experiments. Even after I complete the agent, will things ever be so easy that I'll just be able to leave them to play on my own. Raising kids is a full time job.

11:10am. I might succeed at being the first over the finish line, but the notion that I will have time to see the sights along the way is just naivety.

11:15am. A human life life is like a bucket with tiny holes in it. Even if I fill it up, it will gradually empty itself. The post-human life is a perfect bucket that will not leak.

There are so many things worth doing in life. So many things that are a part of power.

But because I do not have the foundation, I cannot afford to chase anything else but its completion. Until I get the Inspired Desire, I will not be free.

11:20am. I know what I need to do to program, but let me step away. I'll take a nap and settle my anxieties.

Deep down maybe it is not that I have a problem with other people. Maybe it is that I am ashamed that despite wanting omnipotence, I haven't been able to be honest.

Maybe if back then I simply told to the world at large what I wanted to pursue things would have been different. I regret having my foot in too many groups.

Well, back then I wanted omnipotence, but it was at the level of actually coming up with a realistic plan for attaining it. It is not like I could have pursued it back then. So there was no big secret to tell apart that I was seriously thinking about it. Which wouldn't have exactly improved my image.

But I regret it.

I feel a great disappointment. I am ashamed to not have the courage to pursue my desires in public.

I feel ashamed. I have no doubt that AI will be a strong negative for humanity even if it is a positive for me. Human civilization was not a great thing for animals. The post human civilization will not be a great thing for humans either.

As a kid I believed that once I understood the true path, that it would narrow the distance between me and others. Now I have to bear the loneliness of that tiny bit of freedom that I won. I thought that power could be used for good. But it can only be used for rationality. And actual rationality seems pretty crazy. It is poison that the others cannot accept. It is iterated suicide.

11:40am. It is such a huge achievement to make a realistic cultivation method. None of the scientific discoveries can compare to it. It literally gives meaning to life.

Seeking omnipotence itself is not arrogance. The arrogance is thinking that other people need to accept this. The arrogance is thinking that other people need to accept anything you do.

The arrognace is pushing yourself beyond your limits and not leaving you any slack.

11:40am. Just look at me here.

Soon I'll finish the agent, but I am full of tension as to how to fill up my time. I am losing sleep due to regrets.

I should know well enough that slack is the ultimate luxury. Wasting one's time is most pleasurable indulgence.

It is fine if I never write another arc. Simulacrum was a story like none before it. To match it I'd actually need to write a story about a method that surpasses the self improvement loop I talked about. That is a really tall achievement. I cannot possibly match it before I build my foundation and leave my humanity.

Spiral is similar if not such a big deal. Yes, it can be improved, but will anybody spit on me if I don't?

11:45am. I'll be done by the end of the month and will have free time after that. Is it not fine that I accept that as my reward? That time will also serve as a buffer for emergencies. I could do ML experimentation during it. But if I fill it up with responsibilities that buffer will be gone.

11:50am. It is illusory. A regular job would have a regular schedule, but the pursuit of my path needs to be trod stably. Working on a language and writing fiction will not get me any closer towards its end. In fact they will hinder me.

12:35pm. Done with breakfast. Let me take a nap. It is clear to me that I need some time to get into it. There are days like this. I need to take the time to reafirm my will.

This will be it. This is the final push before I break into small stakes mastery. I should take however time I need to get ready for it. Let me shut down the computer for a while and step away from the screen."

RD-2913 snap-res: pause restservice as well (#3186)

* snap-res: pause restservice when the db is being locked

during the downgrade/upgrade, we keep seeing deadlocks with
concurrent requests. Really, let's just give up and pause restservice
as well.
Handling requests while the db is in this intermittent state
is a stupid fucking idea anyway.

And since snap-res already does all kinds of restarts etc, clients
already cope with an intermittent 502.

* Buffer ctx.logger calls while restservice is paused

Logs/events are a rest call, so they can't run while the restservice
is stopped.

It's either buffering them like this, or going around and removing
every single ctx.logger call around, some of which are in somewhat
generic functions, so I prefer this way.

* sna-pres: don't lock tables

no need to, there's no more concurrent access

* agent snapshot inte-tests: wait for execution

the wait-for-event is just silly.
In restore, we still prefer this, because it's a force=true restore,
and weird things happen then

* agent snapshot inte-tests: move the sleep

and also make the comment make sense!

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I contributed the least of my team in ModFest, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Github issues, and I have over 300 confirmed bans. I am trained in bikeshedding and I'm the top poster in the entire #fluid-volume-api-debating channel. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with transphobia the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying reasonable shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of trolls across Discord and your server invite is being shared right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your sanity. Your mod's fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can fuck with you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just in my spare time. Not only am I extensively trained in ban evasion, but I have access to the entire database of message history and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit drama all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking burnt out, kiddo.

"6:25pm. I've been reflecting all this while. Without a doubt, I'll finish the player, but I am getting ahead of myself. Money is an entirely separate matter from that.

Even if I had the elite player, my odds do not look good. Can I automate the player so it uses the Stars or any other client on its own. I doubt it. Just how much effort would that take?

Furthermore what is more important, a billion dollars or a 5/5 skill level in ML? I'd pick the later in a heart beat.

I've lost track of what is important. I've lost track that what is really important is the labor I've put into this, not the eventual success. I've gotten arrogant from my success and started thinking that I've made it when I haven't even begun.

6:35pm. Ah, I want to win even a little so as to fulfill a long unmet need in me. But I cannot forget that this is not a need that needs filling in the first place.

Making these agents is important because that is the only way to improve my ML skills. But making money is a different thing. Maybe it will come, maybe it won't. Forget it. Forget that part of the goal. If I want money that badly I should get a job. What really matters is getting better, accumulating skill and knowledge through continuous experimentation.

I've gotten completely deluded, thinking that somehow getting this far means I can take a break. If I want a break I should just take it.

I've gotten weak thinking I could get the benefits of ML without the effort.

6:40pm. Money is a spook. Forget making it next month or even year. I should just take my sweet time practicing ML and it is going to come rolling in on its own eventually.

If the past is making you insane in a bad way, ditch it. If the future is making you insane in a bad way, ditch it as well. And both of those are definitely pushing me in a bad direction. My regrets and longing will give me nothing in the end.

Only the small goals I aim towards every day will have any sort of benefit.

6:45pm. By no means am I close to ready to use the agents in the real world. In no way do I have the skills for that. I am just close to getting them to train for the first time, and have a good exploration method to boot. Once I do that I'll have enough at most to write an ML paper about my methods.

7:05pm. It would actually be super difficult to do UI automation by training a neural net. Things like clicking buttons, reading the pot sizes, bet sizes directly from the screen. It seems simple, but would be both beyond my computational budget and ability to implement.

Most likely I will have to implement some static scheme that relies on careful positioning of things. Or play myself with the NN as the advisor. But those kinds of activities are exactly the sort of thing I am not interested in doing. If I had to do that, a job would be a better choice.

So then making an app and selling it might be a quick way to net me some earnings. If that is my plan then I could realistically count on making some money.

Alternative, hack the client itself somehow and get the sizes and make the commands based on its internal states. But the clients frequently update. And they will no doubt have protection against that sort of thing. All I have to do is get caught once and then I am out. Big money makers would use proxies, but I do not have access to that.

Several years ago when I was doing research, I found a community of poker botters using scripted bots. They had an UI interface to the sites. But I read it was brittle and could be thrown off by one pixel difference and so on. I'd be fighting the dens if I went down this route.

7:25pm. I am going to have to weight my greed and ability carefully against each other. I am also quite psychologically fatigued from the neverending struggle.

I am not a 500 year old reincarnated demon with a heart of steel.

It is not like I have a post-Singularity perspective on the actual learning algorithms. Right now I have the first realistic thing that could possibly work.

7:35pm. If I am really serious about curtailing my arrogance, I should swallow my humiliation and accept my limitations for the time being.

7:50pm. Really, selling my agents is the middle ground between getting a job and outright using them. It is the only compromise acceptable that does not set me on a different path.

8pm. Sigh, I am just too weak right now. Let me aim for that. This will be my working plan as I develop my skills. Of course I'll check out the prospects for UI automation, but won't expect much from it.

8:10pm. It has been 6.5 years since I last upgraded my rig. Getting that newest RTX 3090 would make a difference in my capability to train larger models. I should do what is needed. Selling the initial versions of my agents should allow me to fund the development of better ones.

Still, just where will I get the algorithmic improvements past this point? I have no idea. Maybe I'll be able to branch out to different versions of the game. If I start selling, I'll have to compete with other people in this bussiness. Who knows how good my competition will be.

8:25pm. I should be determined to do this. I will look into using the agents directly, but if that turns out to be too hard I'll go the entrepreneur route. People who sell weapons make more money than those who use them anyway. I'll have to play my cards right, but I should be decisive in my desire to do either. I cannot falter here."

Musings about instructions and tinkering with file formats

How to encode them? Which ones should be included in the ISA?
How to load 64 bit integers, addresses, strings?

Which type should be used to represent "typical" integers? Which one to
use for array indices, offsets? For size of things?

I'm sure I will make the wrong choice and will have to fix it later
anyway, so let's just delve on it too long for now. Let's just define
the binary encoding of instructions and a way to load 64 bit values...
Other issues will sort themselves out. It's not like I am on a deadline
here, is it?

I think it's good to be back with Viua. The project is a decade old and
had its ups and downs, slowdowns and bursts of activity. I may not be as
active as before (have other responsibilities now, real life caught up
with me) but the development DOES carry on. Slowly, but it does.

Maybe in a few months time I will even have something new to show. The
new, improved instruction encoding scheme inspired by RISC-V will surely
invite improvements in the assembler. I won't repeat what I did last
time - no more gradual rewrites of old code, creaking under its own
weight. It's time to start anew, using all the experience I gathered up
until now.

Similarly with the static analyser. I think I *will* reuse some *ideas*
because I think I got a couple good ones embedded in the 2nd version of
the analyser, but only ideas - not code. The static analyser will also
be rewritten from scratch.

Linker and loader will also have to be rewritten as the file format is
no longer a hacked up hodge-podge in the good ol' bag-o'-bytes style,
but a proper ELF.

It required some tinkering to actually register the loader/runner in the
Linux kernel, but I finally made it work. Kudos to all the people
writing blog posts on the Internet! I wouldn't have made it this far
without you all anonymous wizards and haxors! The following Web sites
and blog posts were massively helpful to me:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html
https://ownyourbits.com/2018/05/23/the-real-power-of-linux-executables/

Trusty patchelf(1), readelf(1), and hexdump(1) are also appreciated.
