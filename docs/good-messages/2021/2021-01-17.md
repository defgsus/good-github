Create boom.mp4

[Verse 1]
I'm a Creeper, Minecraft's Grim Reaper
Blowing up blocks like Al-Qaeda
I'm not a creature that'll eat ya but I'll leave ya petrified
Peter reminds peeps of Minesweeper
Clicking on a brick then you die in the deep
I'll find your mine, I'm a mind reader
Now the mine is mine, it's finders-keepers
Oh, hi! I'm a Creeper, so nice, nice to meet ya
Is that the time? It's time to leave and tick-tock, tick-tock

[Hook]
Boom, boom, boom
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
It's gonna make my brain go boom, boom, boom
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)

[Verse 2]
I do what I wanna, move aside, mama
Tick-tick, I'm a suicide bomber
I take control then I'm gonna leave a gaping hole, Belladonna
That'll take it's toll when I'm on a quest to invade
Detonate your soul, fizz like a lemonade then blow
So you better stay indoors
Or I'll find your mine when you're mining ore
You'll be dying, lying in gore
Darling, aw! What you crying for?
Did somebody break your diamond sword?
I'm the volatilest sort, what a violent force
That'll frighten Spartans, hark and hear Leonidas talk
When he sees me, "Tonight, we dine indoors"
[Hook]
Boom, boom, boom
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
It's gonna make my brain go boom, boom, boom
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
(Boom, ay)

[Verse 3]
It's official, a ballistic missile couldn't get this result
I blow through stone like a six-foot chisel
So you'd better shiver when you hear that sizzle, fo-shizzle
Take a listen, it's a premonition of my mission
Death by demolition
If I don't come home, there's a sign in my kitchen
To describe why I'm missing, "Gone fission"
White hot raps, I got stacks
Sometimes when I die, I drop tracks
I got a lot, Ocelot, fight off cats
If I'm feeling nice then I might not, blast

[Hook]
Boom, boom, boom
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
It's gonna make my brain go boom, boom, boom
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
(Boom)
[Outro]
My hobbies and interests include going boom, boom, boom
