allows editing expired and removed bans (#59431)

This is needed for the rare case that the situation described in the ban turns out to be inaccurate, so future searches for the user in the ban db don't lead admins to the wrong opinion.

Creating a situation where the admin has to remember to edit the ban reason before unbanning them is kinda lame

I'd love to make it so only the reason is editable, but that is far too much work for too little benefit.

fixes #59424

Ooh, ooh
Across the ocean, across the sea
Startin' to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face
I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road and upside down now
I know it's hard babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Through the sorrow
And the fights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
Anf for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart
Oh I
Oh I
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I'll just stay right here, yeah
I know that you want me to
Baby, we can make it through, anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-a'ight
Be alright, ai-a'ight
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-a'ight
Be alright, ai-a'ight
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, cause everything's gonna be alright

Korean translation to 00-introduction.md

This is the first draft of Korean translation of Sapper's "00-introduction.md" part. Briefly introducing myself, I am junior frontend developer who just started off learning Sapper and felt love in using Svelte these days! I have experience in translating many English development online tutorials into Korean. 

Although there is not yet skyrocketing interest in Svelte, I can see some couple of companies in South Korea are adopting Svelte for their service. As a Svelte lover, I would like to contribute to Korean translation so that I could help Svelte and Sapper could be more beloved by more and more Korean people. 

I wanted to contribute to Svelte at first, but it seems there were no slot for me to leave my work for you to review, and that's why I am starting off with Sapper. If this is not the right way for me to contribute to Korean translation, then please give me comments via apensia914@gmail.com. 

Hope you could see my message.

(Staticman) mike: Hi Stephen! 

I apologise in advance but im doing your least favourite combination - a non-durable queue (a ring buffer to be precise) coupled with a background service inside the HTTP application. Whilst i understand the drawbacks of this ( and will eventually move to a durable queue + external service) i am struggling with the simple question of where to put the service?

My project is asp.net web api, using .net framework4.5.2 and follows a standard controller, model file structure.

Should the background service go in the startup file? or should it be on a controller of some kind ? my question probably sounds confusing because im struggling to word it but i just dont know where to put the background service - if that makes sense

Love your blogs - my goto expert!

Flagged entries that may not be churches

I flagged all the entries that aren't churches, as well as flagged all the international churches I found and made notes on a couple of typos I found in people's entries. I also flagged a Catholic church for fun! (just cuz its there). I think we should drop the non-churches and (in my opinion) the international ones too (although maybe we could make a separate data set with int'l churches for fun?). Later I will fix the typos
