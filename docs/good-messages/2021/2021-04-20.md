Improved pagination UX (#191)

Hello ðŸ‘‹

I noticed that the blog page count has been increasing. Because of that, the pagination is starting to look overwhelming. Not that it looks bad at it's current state, but as the page count increases it will become overpopulated with page number buttons.

_Current_
![current pagination](https://i.imgur.com/SFxj8ci.png)

---

I have found a better solution for pagination. 

I took the inspiration from the following sources:
* https://dribbble.com/shots/2351417-What-s-your-fav-pagination (example number 7)
* https://uxframework.pearson.com/c/pagination (Standard pagination)
* https://codemyui.com/pagination-ux-pure-css/

Here's how it works:

The structure is as follows:
`[Previous page] [First page number] ... (N trailing) [Current page] (N leading) ... [Last page number] [Next page]`

There is a new option in **_config.yml** file called `paginate_trail` and the dafault value is `2`. It is used to generate N (in default case 2) trailing and leading page buttons.

_First page_
![first page](https://i.imgur.com/UposL6o.png)

You can notice that there is no "First page" button, because page 1 button is already visible.

_Second page_
![second page](https://i.imgur.com/4pD7AiU.png)

Second page also does not have the "First page" button, for same reason as for page 1.

_Page N_
![page n](https://i.imgur.com/ll6sS69.png)

When we get to page N, we can see trailing and leading N buttons (default 2), first page button (1), last page (10) and next and previous buttons. This way, user can proceed in reading posts chronologically, but he has an option to go to first and last page, as well as a way for "faster navigation" if a user is searing for some post.

_Last page_
![last page](https://i.imgur.com/jPlGBee.png)

The "Last page" button will not be visible on last page. Simillar logic for the first page.

I hope all of this makes sense. You can clone my fork and try it out locally.

Bejeezes this took waaaay to freaking long to figure out. 
I had it down until the "." that was being passed to my string.find() as an 'any character' which triggered one stupid freaking erroneous match. 
But I freaking got it!!

test: bump NodeJS version to 10.15.1

To match what we are currently using in most liferay-portal branches. I
don't know if this will fix the CI failures:

-   https://travis-ci.org/github/metal/gulp-metal/builds/767729372
-   https://travis-ci.org/github/metal/gulp-metal/builds/767729343

but it makes sense to move onto a newer base before trouble-shooting
further; not that v10 is all that new nowadays...

notes that v10 is reaching End-Of-Life real soon now (2021-04-30).

# The human consequences of technology
## Reaction from the last readings
#### Olatz Sanchez-txabarri

During the last weeks of the course, we have been reading about the consequences technology has on human life. Today, no one can deny the importance technology plays in our daily life, from cars and means of transportation to the ability to be in contact with anyone in the world (and outside of it) with our phones. We all know that the biggest companies in the world work with technology, so we know that they are profitable and that the power that these companies differ from it is underestimated by most of us. However, we, in general, do not know how these technologies became part of our life or how they were used before.

According to Friedrich A. Kittle in chapter 11 of_The Truth of the Technological World_ (2014), most of the technology we have and manage today comes from the millions of dollars spent on researching how to make armies more deadly. When reading chapter 11 of his book, one realizes how disconnected we are from the real effects of technology and the bad uses armies have made of them. When reading about the development of these military technologies to become part of the production and spread of Rock Music, we realize that even if today some technologies are used for the creation of culture, this same culture has a past that we cannot or do not want to see. This history embodies the suffering of many who, as they are not directly connected with our nations or personal circles, we cannot see or understand.

In the same line, Rob Nixon writes on _Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor_ (2011), the main consequences of the modern wars. In chapter 7, _Ecologies of the Aftermath_,he presents the idea that starting with the Gulf War in 1991, the war has consequences further in time and destruction than the actual battle. According to him, war hazards continuously affect the environment and people who already had to deal with the war and its casualties. The use of biochemical weapons creates pollution that lasts millions of years and has devastating consequences on the biological ecosystems we are part of. However, the war powers like the United States, Europe, and Russia, use language and propaganda to justify the use of those polluting weapons. These two texts show our disconnection from technology and the actual consequences: which gives governments the power not only to employ millions of dollars on weapons (when they could be used for better things) but to hide its real consequences and create a polluted world for ordinary people.

This disconnection of technology is also visible in the article written by Geoffrey Winthrop-Young _Hardware, Software, and Netware_ (2010). The author shows the connection between the _ware_ parts of a computer and how they interact to make computers move. This text also connects to the human use of the technologies because it connects the technological aspect of it with technology's human control and use. As everyday users, we can control some technology things, but we cannot control everything. However, and after reading _The Algorithms of Oppression_ (2018) by Safiya Umoha Noble, a group of humans can have greater control over technology. This group of engineers and developers of technology at companies like Google have the power not only over the performance of computers and the search engines but also on how they affect our cultures and societies. As seen from the research and project she presents, racial, gender, and class differences in our countries are justified and further enhanced by the media and the online world, which could be changed by changing the algorithms that manage the information we consume.

All these texts share the idea that power has created technology to maintain its status, whether it is by creating and developing war over eastern countries that crate millions of years of consequences or by keeping the social inequalities via the media and online information. In recent years, this is more obvious than ever as fake news and political and ideological propaganda have entered all aspects of our life; and we all know how devastating its consequences are. What to me is impossible to understand is how, knowing that this could easily be changed (by changing the culture and lack of diversity on big technology companies or by using the millions of dollars of the armies to help the most needed ones), governments prefer to keep destroying the world and the societies for the most immediate profit.

Merge pull request #713 from Psychtoolbox-3/master

PTB Beta update 3.0.17.10 "No Metal to the pedal"

## General

- MeasureLuminancePrecision now works with all photometers supported by PTB, not only with ColorCal2. ColorCal2 is the default choice if no photometer type is specified.
- Octave 6.2 on Windows and macOS is now no longer warned against, as light testing suggests it works.
- Various minor fixes and improvements.
- Help text and documentation improvements.

## Linux

- AMD Vega / DCE-12 low-level support for Linux, so now it is actually finally verified to be working, as tested with a Datapixx3 wrt. identity pixel passthrough and timestamping.
- Fixes to LoadIdentityClut AMD fallback path.
- Fixes to SetMouse in windowed mode (ie. non-fullscreen windows).
- Fixes to GraphicsDisplaySyncAcrossDualHeadsLinux() - added a bug in the last release.
- PsychLinuxConfiguration now also calls AssertOpenGL to allow builtin libdc1394 compatibility fixups for Ubuntu 20.10+ for Screen when installing matlab-psychtoolbox-3 from NeuroDebian.
- Some improvements ot the RaspberryPi build process.

## macOS

- Basic, **highly experimental, highly deficient / unreliable / low performance, and therefore not supported in case of problems** Vulkan (== Metal) display backend support for macOS. This requires at least macOS 10.15.4 and installation of the 3rd party Khronos MoltenVK open-source Vulkan icd driver and Vulkan runtime. MoltenVK implements the Vulkan portability subset on top of the proprietary Apple macOS Metal graphics api. It allows to now also use our Vulkan display backend on macOS for the really desperate and masochistic. Effectively this is a Metal display backend, which was intended to be a replacement for cases where the standard OpenGL backend doesn't work well. As a by-product, it provides basic HDR support on macOS, on machines where this is supported - utilizing Metal EDR functionality to implement Apples peculiar opinion about HDR. The HDR support is **way more limited in performance, reliability, accuracy and flexibility** compared to Windows-10 and even more limited compared to Linux, but may be of some use for people desperately clinging to the iToys. Unfortunately, at least as testing on macOS 10.15.7 with both AMD and Intel graphics on a MacBookPro 2017 went, Apple Metal is even more broken and unreliable wrt. visual stimulus onset timing and timestamping than OpenGL! After spending over 160 hours of work, trying to beat this thing into submission, i conclude this to be mostly a failure, due to bugs in Apples proprietary Metal api, only fixable by Apple, with all workarounds on our side exhausted. But who knows, maybe it will work better on macOS 11? I can't test macOS 11 at the moment due to unrelated showstopper bugs in macOS 11 which would make installing macOS 11 on my test machine too high a risk of bricking the machine. This experimental Vulkan/Metal display backend work was [sponsored by Mathworks](https://www.mathworks.com/solutions/neuroscience.html).

- Fixes for Octave 6 on macOS 10.15, so the octave GUI no longer hangs infinitely at exit if Screen() was used in a session. The workaround we had to invent for severe Apple macOS 10.11 logger bugs, started to work against us at some point, causing problems instead of fixing them. Apparently either macOS was fixed at some point, or Octave got a workaround for Apple macOS bugs.  Anyway, now it seems that Octave 6.2 when launched in ``octave --gui`` mode now works ok, at least as tested under macOS 10.15.7 Catalina final. We keep the workaround active for macOS 10.13 and earlier, as we don't know when it turned from helping into hurting.

- Fixes for GetChar / CharAvail on macOS, when used with Octave or Matlab in command line (non-gui) mode. ListenChar works with Octave in gui mode, and Matlab in gui and commandline mode, but is still a big troublemaker for Octave in commandline mode under macOS, so now running ``octave --gui`` is recommended as the only way for ``ListenChar`` to work.
- Octave mex files on macOS rebuilt against Octave 6.2 from HomeBrew.

## Windows

- Robustness improvements by Diederick to GetGITPath and GetGITInfo for Windows.
