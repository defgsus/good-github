Creates Attacker

I created something horrible. Not the Attacker, that is just
fine, but the tests. Oh my god how I suffered with the tests.
All day and a half just to figure out the best way of testing
this 40 line class, and I'm still not entirely happy with
the results.

"10:05am. I am up. It is time to get today started. I want to start research on neurochip companies right away, but the router is acting up and I am waiting for it to finish reseting.

10:10am. Well, rather than starting this kind of thing right away, let me take it easy here. I've been working on the language non-stop for the past year.

11:10am. Done with my morning reading. That was fun. Let me have breakfast here.

11:25am. https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/neuromorphic_chip

There is not much on this wiki.

Let me do a list of companies in this field.

Intel
IBM
Cerberas
Graphcore

There 4 are off the top of my head.

11:35am. I am thinking of making a post on the ML sub asking about chip startups. But before that let me make a post on the PL sub.

12:10pm. https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kzsc3w/the_spiral_language_v2_alpha/
https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kzsokz/d_list_of_novel_ml_hardware_companies_january_2021/

I posted these two threads. The way I see things going, nothing is going to come from the ML sub thread. Instead I'll have to get my initial contacts through journos and researchers.

Where should I start? Ah, let me read that paper I've been linking every post. Then I'll Google news search.

Focus me, focus. This time reading the news is a part of my job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqT6bC1-DKk
Honkai Impact 3rd - Review (Original Soundtrack)

This is quite good. It seems the manga is the crappy part of the franchise.

> For instance, Eliasmith, who also heads a startup company called Applied Brain Research, develops algorithms and software used to program neuromorphic chips.

[Names](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/8/246356-neuromorphic-chips-take-shape/fulltext):
Samuel Greengard, author
Chris Eliasmith, a professor in the departments of Systems Design Engineering, and Philosophy, of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada
Adam Stieg, associate director of the California NanoSystems Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)
Garrick Orchard, a researcher in Intel's Neuromorphic Computing Lab
G. Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research, an independent market analysis and consulting firm that tracks the semiconductor industry

Here are the names I got from that paper. I'll keep them in mind as potential contacts.

Right now, let me stop here so I can do the chores. After that, I'll scour the news.

1:35pm. Done with chores.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kzsokz/d_list_of_novel_ml_hardware_companies_january_2021/

I guess I was wrong about the ML sub going nowhere. Let me take a look at the replies.

> There are a few of these lists floating about already, which should save you a lot of time. Admittedly some are quite out of date. Also quite a few survey papers with more detail, e.g. Capra et al, An updated survey of efficient hardware architectures for accelerating deep convolutional neural networks, Future Internet, 2020, 12, 113
> See e.g. this list https://www.github.com/basicmi/AI-Chip, last updated 12 days ago
> A year old now, but [here is a big list](https://twitter.com/jwangARK/status/1189560904872058880/photo/1). Karl Freund writes well about this topic too, see [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2019/01/23/2019-a-cambrian-explosion-in-deep-learning-part-1/?sh=44dedb034dc1) and [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2019/01/24/a-cambrian-explosion-in-deep-learning-part-2-the-startups/?sh=73797eb47840). Otherwise check out who are speaking at key conferences, such as past instances of [the AI Hardware Summit](https://aihardwaresummit.com/events/ai-hardware-summit).

Let me read the two forbes articles.

https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders

Actually, let me finish this article on Dijkstra first.

1:50pm. I should take it easy today. It is not like I am doing the usual death battle routine with the computer. I'll spend the next few days just reading articles and familiarizing myself with the landscape. Then I will start applying.

```
s(s – b)(s – c) + s(s – c)(s – a)
= { algebra }
s(s – c)(2s – a – b)
= { definition of s }
s(s – c)c
```

I ran into this kind of notation in Agda. Interesting that Dijstra came up with it.

2:30pm. Done with the Dijsktra article. I'll skip the references for now. Let me read the Forbes articles next.

2:35pm.

> Just wanted to make a suggestion, I had to scroll all the way to the ‘Basics’ heading before I found what I wanted to know. Opening the docs for a language with info about a VSC extension almost made me close the tab right way. Then I had to read about packaging and god knows what all before I finally got to the part about the actual language. Just my take. All the best :)

Wow, tough crowd. But seriously, covering the package files and how to install the language before getting to the meat of it makes sense to me, so I'll ignore this comment.

3:10pm. Let me track down the part 3 of the Forbes article.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2019/01/25/a-cambrian-explosion-in-deep-learning-part-3-nvidia/?sh=5b987b22a25b
> My view is that NVIDIA will not suffer from a long-term disadvantage in training performance. Its issue may be high silicon costs, but for training, customers will pay up. Additionally, when it comes to inference, NVIDIA’s Xavier is a very impressive chip.

This is interesting. I though NVidia would be locked into a GPU mindset, but here he is stating the opposite. I guess I'll keep NVidia in mind.

3:45pm. https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MDQ2MjA3OA==&mid=2247484905&idx=1&sn=8700dee6d513300baebdbb53e85f8fd1&chksm=ead1f8f8dda671ee809277759deaa10c0d8225abce95e5e1315f1e3322d558c5ce3e1ad2c23b&scene=21#wechat_redirect

https://github.com/basicmi/AI-Chip

I am reading the Google translated articles on that blog. Let me do this for a bit. The links given to me really make things a lot easier on me. Instead of having to spend a week on making a list, I can start applying tomorrow.

4:15pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZD1Xwrl4f4
Building the Future of AI Hardware Part 1 | CogX 2019

The list of companies by James Wang will be especially helpful to me as one of the columns highligths those companies whose chips can do training. That will save me a lot of research time.

I apologize. The ML sub post struck gold. It gave me exactly what I need when I most needed it.

Let me watch this video by James Wang.

Focus me. Let me watch this instead of listening to the OST. Tomorrow, I will gather the contact info of all the companies I have in mind and start getting my pitch ready.

Before I do that I'll look at whether talks or videos are online by some of the companies so I can get a sense for what their chips are about. That will help me tune the pitch too.

There is no need to hurry this. I'll consider the kind of thing I am doing now a part of my work rather than leisure.

4:45pm. https://youtu.be/XZD1Xwrl4f4?t=1115

It seems the talk by JW was only 18m. But the next is literally by Graphcore which I will be applying to, so let me watch it.

5:05pm. https://youtu.be/XZD1Xwrl4f4?t=2216

The stuff he is talking about with interconnect scaling is new to me.

5:10pm. Graphcore's chip is of interest to me.

5:30pm. Mythic's is not.

Let me focus on startups for now.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=graphcore

Since I've started with Graphcore, I might as well go further in familiaring myself with it. After that I'll go over the list.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT2H0UhZF0Q
Graphcore AI Research Directions in 2021

Let me watch this. It is only 11m.

I am starting to get tired of watching these vids, but let me persevere. I'll start going quicker through them.

https://youtu.be/cT2H0UhZF0Q?t=367

Random projections are interesting.

https://youtu.be/cT2H0UhZF0Q?t=529

Here he talks about ensembles. Maybe I'll check out the paper as well at some point, but not now.

5:50pm. Ok, Graphcore has a lot of stuff.

Let me take stock of all the startups. I want to see which ones have Youtube vids.

I know Cerberas has stuff.

Cornami? Has a bit.
Enflame? No.
Espernato? Has a [website](https://www.esperanto.ai/).
Fathom Computing? [Website](https://www.fathomcomputing.com/).
Groq? Has a decent number of vids on Youtube.

I think Habana is now with Intel so I'll skip it. No actually I should keep it in mind.

Lightelligence? [Website](https://www.lightelligence.ai/). There is a talk buried in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v14BOnyOYg) that I should look at.
Lightmatter? [Website](https://lightmatter.co/).
LightOn? Has a [bunch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6xfSWQaCk1hqu7pCISK1w). [Website](https://lighton.ai/).
Luminous? Has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpR7qGo1VDk).
Optalysys? Has a bunch.

There are a surprising amount of photonics companies.

Preferred Networks? [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/preferredjp). This one is a Japanese company.
SambaNova? [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuu0tV6DbiI1tYiSsXI_KeA).
Tachyum? A bit.
TensTorrent? A bunch.
ThinkForce? [Website](http://www.think-force.com/en/site/about). This one is Chinese.
Wave Computing? A [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAGHaYKtitM). [Website](https://wavecomp.ai/).
Xanadu? [Website](https://www.xanadu.ai/). Has some vids. Quantum photonics.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eT1jaHmlx8
Jim Keller - Moore's Law in the age of AI Chips

I'll watch this video later.

6:20pm. So every company except Enflame has something out there.

6:30pm. I actually have plentyful options. Looking into these companies will be my mission for the next few days. I'll go over them one by one.

Right now, let me watch the talk by Keller and I will stop for the day. Lunch will be soon anyway."

📋Readme changes

My mad insatiable lust for successful women can no longer be contained!

You would cry happy tears if you knew the importance of this divine sexual mission that I am on. The sheer force of my will is enough to drive back any sense of rational thinking, I am propelled forward by nothing but the turgid veins in my hungry penis.

I am a man on a mission, who will stop at nothing to get what I want. Your feeble dainty woman hands are nothing compared to my big strong man arms. I want your hole, your pulsating meat sheathe under the sheets. Your warm moist cavity of love and fertility.

I want nothing but to drive my Excalibur into your stone of love.

I am a changed man now, what was once my sex drive - comparable to a slate of white marble - had evolved into something akin to a badger in heat.

The honey badger don't care.

I will destroy that vagina like it was the Death Star, and I was Luke Skywalker in a star fighter. In this new Eden that we shall create in this mortal plane from our fucking. I shall be Adam, the indomitable male alpha sexual force, and you will be Eve, my exotic Asian sex queen

If you want to add me feel freeas long as you are friendly. There is lot of mad incels in teams fortress 2 who harass me just for being a girl :NekoDisappointed:. Probably its because in real life girls make fun of them and how small their peenises are lol i hope they are reading this. To everyone else, if you meet me in tf2 and would like to play some time or mvm then add me and we can play :) i can trade but NOT my horns or hair because that is my helltaker set and i am a demon girl.
