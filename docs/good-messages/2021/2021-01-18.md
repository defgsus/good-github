New data: 2021-01-17. See data notes for important messages.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the ‚ÄúCOVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario‚Äù dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial ‚Äúdip‚Äù in numbers on Saturday and ‚Äújump‚Äù on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily ‚ÄúCOVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario‚Äù dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with ‚ÄúCOVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario‚Äù as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

Upcoming changes (specific dates to be announced soon):

- The data structure of time series data will change in response to user feedback. This will only consist of adding additional columns to make the data easier to work with. The core columns will remain the same, for now. More details to follow. Initially, the updated dataset will be provided alongside the new dataset. After a time, the new data format will completely replace the old format.

Recent changes:

- 2021-01-08: The directories cases_extra and mortality_extra have been moved to other/cases_extra and other/mortality_extra.

Revise historical data: cases (MB, ON); mortality (MB).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: ‚ÄúThe data also report 50 new deaths, for a total of 9,055. Among these 50 deaths, 8 have occurred in the last 24 hours, 26 have occurred between January 10 and January 15, 7 have occurred before January 10, and 9 have occurred at an unknown date.‚Äù We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today‚Äôs values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today‚Äôs date when older deaths are removed.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

Fixing Windows not playing nicely with mkdir.

I really don't know why Windows is such a pain sometimes:
 * The `-p` doesn't get handled as a switch, and instead actually creates a directory named "-p"...
 * The forward slash in the path being created causes cmd.exe to be sad instead of interpreting it as a path. Quotes around the path makes it happy.

One day things will be sane on Windows.

Today is not that day. üòÇ

One key mount support added! Also hivemind

You will have to /init to get it.
1 (once) mounts everyone if they are not targeting a corpse. If they are in the maw, it tries to mount on corridor creeper.
ctrl-1 (once) dismounts everyone.
if you had
hivemind
to your toonlist, 1 will make the party lead (only) pop hivemind. After that the rest is up to you.
I have been targeting my face and hitting 1,1,1,1,1 (assist me to target my face) f,f,f,f,f (jump in hive mind)
It's a pain, but it worked and I PVP'd with it just fine all night.

MathgeoLib with FlyLib

Now you can call MathgeoLib which will be the main math library for flylib (it makes not sense that I make my own based on first lack of knowledge and then time)

Deleted my shitty types (int2,3,... and typedefs for sized ints) and using more standard types.

MathGeoLib is compiled and added to the project easily now, I should try to add groups for the sources properly, headers are now part of flylib and can be seen better (although they were public, they were not accessible from within the explorer).

Stopped printf, because it makes a mess on console and I want to not open a console if possible, use the debug options per system, will help with debugging with gdb (will ttry to add gdb support for android).

Now, I should focus on the main cases for filesystem and do the build helper for flylib.

After that, add framebuffers and we should have the first most basic release of flylib:
Build Helper, the base library
This way it is possible to build upon it, use the types and actually do things in plain c++.

Add files via upload

The Weekend of Jan 15th to Monday the 18th

Holy Crazy ass shit! So this weekend has been again Emily screaming about James, pretty normal. But we had a twist in the events on Sunday. She started to attack Elk_Administration on Reddit, Facebook, and anywhere else she could possibly slither her way into. The problem is the Dibney Cru jumped in. And it has been hours of her screaming and blaming everyone for everything she has done.
She also went back after Candy. Which to her dismay we jumped in again and nixed that. Cause Candy is with us, and it took 2 seconds for us to post the images, and alert her Emily was back to her BS about her.

BACKPORT: modpost: file2alias: go back to simple devtable lookup 

Commit e49ce14 ("modpost: use linker section to generate table.")
was not so cool as we had expected first; it ended up with ugly section
hacks when commit dd2a3ac ("mod/file2alias: make modpost compile
on darwin again") came in.

Given a certain degree of unknowledge about the link stage of host
programs, I really want to see simple, stupid table lookup so that
this works in the same way regardless of the underlying executable
format.

"10:05am. I am up. It is time to get today started. I want to start research on neurochip companies right away, but the router is acting up and I am waiting for it to finish reseting.

10:10am. Well, rather than starting this kind of thing right away, let me take it easy here. I've been working on the language non-stop for the past year.

11:10am. Done with my morning reading. That was fun. Let me have breakfast here.

11:25am. https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/neuromorphic_chip

There is not much on this wiki.

Let me do a list of companies in this field.

Intel
IBM
Cerberas
Graphcore

There 4 are off the top of my head.

11:35am. I am thinking of making a post on the ML sub asking about chip startups. But before that let me make a post on the PL sub.

12:10pm. https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kzsc3w/the_spiral_language_v2_alpha/
https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kzsokz/d_list_of_novel_ml_hardware_companies_january_2021/

I posted these two threads. The way I see things going, nothing is going to come from the ML sub thread. Instead I'll have to get my initial contacts through journos and researchers.

Where should I start? Ah, let me read that paper I've been linking every post. Then I'll Google news search.

Focus me, focus. This time reading the news is a part of my job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqT6bC1-DKk
Honkai Impact 3rd - Review (Original Soundtrack)

This is quite good. It seems the manga is the crappy part of the franchise.

> For instance, Eliasmith, who also heads a startup company called Applied Brain Research, develops algorithms and software used to program neuromorphic chips.

[Names](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/8/246356-neuromorphic-chips-take-shape/fulltext):
Samuel Greengard, author
Chris Eliasmith, a professor in the departments of Systems Design Engineering, and Philosophy, of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada
Adam Stieg, associate director of the California NanoSystems Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)
Garrick Orchard, a researcher in Intel's Neuromorphic Computing Lab
G. Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research, an independent market analysis and consulting firm that tracks the semiconductor industry

Here are the names I got from that paper. I'll keep them in mind as potential contacts.

Right now, let me stop here so I can do the chores. After that, I'll scour the news.

1:35pm. Done with chores.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kzsokz/d_list_of_novel_ml_hardware_companies_january_2021/

I guess I was wrong about the ML sub going nowhere. Let me take a look at the replies.

> There are a few of these lists floating about already, which should save you a lot of time. Admittedly some are quite out of date. Also quite a few survey papers with more detail, e.g. Capra et al, An updated survey of efficient hardware architectures for accelerating deep convolutional neural networks, Future Internet, 2020, 12, 113
> See e.g. this list https://www.github.com/basicmi/AI-Chip, last updated 12 days ago
> A year old now, but [here is a big list](https://twitter.com/jwangARK/status/1189560904872058880/photo/1). Karl Freund writes well about this topic too, see [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2019/01/23/2019-a-cambrian-explosion-in-deep-learning-part-1/?sh=44dedb034dc1) and [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2019/01/24/a-cambrian-explosion-in-deep-learning-part-2-the-startups/?sh=73797eb47840). Otherwise check out who are speaking at key conferences, such as past instances of [the AI Hardware Summit](https://aihardwaresummit.com/events/ai-hardware-summit).

Let me read the two forbes articles.

https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders

Actually, let me finish this article on Dijkstra first.

1:50pm. I should take it easy today. It is not like I am doing the usual death battle routine with the computer. I'll spend the next few days just reading articles and familiarizing myself with the landscape. Then I will start applying.

```
s(s ‚Äì b)(s ‚Äì c) + s(s ‚Äì c)(s ‚Äì a)
= { algebra }
s(s ‚Äì c)(2s ‚Äì a ‚Äì b)
= { definition of s }
s(s ‚Äì c)c
```

I ran into this kind of notation in Agda. Interesting that Dijstra came up with it.

2:30pm. Done with the Dijsktra article. I'll skip the references for now. Let me read the Forbes articles next.

2:35pm.

> Just wanted to make a suggestion, I had to scroll all the way to the ‚ÄòBasics‚Äô heading before I found what I wanted to know. Opening the docs for a language with info about a VSC extension almost made me close the tab right way. Then I had to read about packaging and god knows what all before I finally got to the part about the actual language. Just my take. All the best :)

Wow, tough crowd. But seriously, covering the package files and how to install the language before getting to the meat of it makes sense to me, so I'll ignore this comment.

3:10pm. Let me track down the part 3 of the Forbes article.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2019/01/25/a-cambrian-explosion-in-deep-learning-part-3-nvidia/?sh=5b987b22a25b
> My view is that NVIDIA will not suffer from a long-term disadvantage in training performance. Its issue may be high silicon costs, but for training, customers will pay up. Additionally, when it comes to inference, NVIDIA‚Äôs Xavier is a very impressive chip.

This is interesting. I though NVidia would be locked into a GPU mindset, but here he is stating the opposite. I guess I'll keep NVidia in mind.

3:45pm. https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MDQ2MjA3OA==&mid=2247484905&idx=1&sn=8700dee6d513300baebdbb53e85f8fd1&chksm=ead1f8f8dda671ee809277759deaa10c0d8225abce95e5e1315f1e3322d558c5ce3e1ad2c23b&scene=21#wechat_redirect

https://github.com/basicmi/AI-Chip

I am reading the Google translated articles on that blog. Let me do this for a bit. The links given to me really make things a lot easier on me. Instead of having to spend a week on making a list, I can start applying tomorrow.

4:15pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZD1Xwrl4f4
Building the Future of AI Hardware Part 1 | CogX 2019

The list of companies by James Wang will be especially helpful to me as one of the columns highligths those companies whose chips can do training. That will save me a lot of research time.

I apologize. The ML sub post struck gold. It gave me exactly what I need when I most needed it.

Let me watch this video by James Wang.

Focus me. Let me watch this instead of listening to the OST. Tomorrow, I will gather the contact info of all the companies I have in mind and start getting my pitch ready.

Before I do that I'll look at whether talks or videos are online by some of the companies so I can get a sense for what their chips are about. That will help me tune the pitch too.

There is no need to hurry this. I'll consider the kind of thing I am doing now a part of my work rather than leisure.

4:45pm. https://youtu.be/XZD1Xwrl4f4?t=1115

It seems the talk by JW was only 18m. But the next is literally by Graphcore which I will be applying to, so let me watch it.

5:05pm. https://youtu.be/XZD1Xwrl4f4?t=2216

The stuff he is talking about with interconnect scaling is new to me.

5:10pm. Graphcore's chip is of interest to me.

5:30pm. Mythic's is not.

Let me focus on startups for now.

Since I've started with Graphcore, I might as well go further in familiaring myself with it. After that I'll go over the list.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT2H0UhZF0Q
Graphcore AI Research Directions in 2021

Let me watch this. It is only 11m.

I am starting to get tired of watching these vids, but let me persevere. I'll start going quicker through them.

https://youtu.be/cT2H0UhZF0Q?t=367

Random projections are interesting.

https://youtu.be/cT2H0UhZF0Q?t=529

Here he talks about ensembles. Maybe I'll check out the paper as well at some point, but not now.

5:50pm. Ok, Graphcore has a lot of stuff.

Let me take stock of all the startups. I want to see which ones have Youtube vids.

I know Cerberas has stuff.

Cornami? Has a bit.
Enflame? No.
Espernato? Has a [website](https://www.esperanto.ai/).
Fathom Computing? [Website](https://www.fathomcomputing.com/).
Groq? Has a decent number of vids on Youtube.

I think Habana is now with Intel so I'll skip it. No actually I should keep it in mind.

Lightelligence? [Website](https://www.lightelligence.ai/). There is a talk buried in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v14BOnyOYg) that I should look at.
Lightmatter? [Website](https://lightmatter.co/).
LightOn? Has a [bunch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6xfSWQaCk1hqu7pCISK1w). [Website](https://lighton.ai/).
Luminous? Has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpR7qGo1VDk).
Optalysys? Has a bunch.

There are a surprising amount of photonics companies.

Preferred Networks? [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/preferredjp). This one is a Japanese company.
SambaNova? [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuu0tV6DbiI1tYiSsXI_KeA).
Tachyum? A bit.
TensTorrent? A bunch.
ThinkForce? [Website](http://www.think-force.com/en/site/about). This one is Chinese.
Wave Computing? A [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAGHaYKtitM). [Website](https://wavecomp.ai/).
Xanadu? [Website](https://www.xanadu.ai/). Has some vids. Quantum photonics.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eT1jaHmlx8
Jim Keller - Moore's Law in the age of AI Chips

I'll watch this video later.

6:20pm. So every company except Enflame has something out there.

6:30pm. I actually have plentyful options. Looking into these companies will be my mission for the next few days. I'll go over them one by one.

Right now, let me watch the talk by Keller and I will stop for the day. Lunch will be soon anyway."

26.3. "Add to Cart Controls" Component

Finally, for this to work, we need to add that component class to the top level element. Refactor to use :class, set it to an array and surround the existing classes with quotes. Oh, whoops! I forgot to separate d-flex and align-items-center. That won't cause any issues... but make sure to separate them in your app. Add $style.component.

Adding & Organizing the Props
Ok! Now we're ready to get to the interesting stuff. Normally, if you want to make some code reusable in PHP or JavaScript, you isolate it into a function. Then, you usually need to add some arguments so that whoever calls that function can pass information it needs and control its behavior.
The same is true when we create a reusable Vue component, except that instead of adding function arguments, we add component props.
When I look at the template, I can see three props that we need to pass: the product these controls are for and also addToCartLoading and addToCartSuccess... because this component will not be responsible for actually saving the new item to the cart. And so, it needs to be passed these props to know if the cart AJAX call is currently happening or if it just finished successfully.
Scroll down to the component. Add props... and I'm going to paste those 3 props: product is an object, the other two are booleans and all are required.
Back up in the template, PhpStorm is a bit happier thanks to those new props, but we are still referencing a few other undefined things.
One of them is cart. We use this in exactly one spot: to figure out if the button should be disabled because the cart is still loading. So we could add a cart prop... it would be our way of saying:

  Hey! You need to pass the cart to us so we configure out whether or not the the button should be disabled!

But... do we really need the entire cart object? Nope: we just need to know whether or not the user should be allowed to add the item to the cart. So instead of forcing the entire cart object to be passed as a prop, let's add a simpler prop. Copy addToCartLoading, paste and call this one allowAddToCart.
Now, on the button, it should be disabled if not allowAddToCart.
Awesome! Another way to explain why I'm using an allowAddToCart prop instead of a prop for the entire cart is that I want my component to be as dumb as possible. The dumber it is, the more control we have over it. Each time we use this component, we can control whether the button is disabled using whatever logic we need.

Adding Data
Ok: the template is still referencing one more variable: quantity on v-model. In addition to that, the user will also select a color via the color-selector component. When that happens, we're currently calling an updateSelectedColor method, which still lives in the old component. Its job was to set a selectedColorId data.
If you think about it: both the quantity and the selectedColorId will need to be stored as data inside the new, reusable component: we need to keep track of both values so that we have them handy when the "add to cart" button is clicked.
In index.vue, find data, copy those two keys and delete them. Back in the new component, add the data function and return the two keys.
Alright! Our template is still referencing some undefined methods... but I think we should at least get this to render!
Next, let's use this component from index.vue and finish the last pieces: implementing the missing methods as... methods... or by emitting an event.

üìãReadme changes

My mad insatiable lust for successful women can no longer be contained!

You would cry happy tears if you knew the importance of this divine sexual mission that I am on. The sheer force of my will is enough to drive back any sense of rational thinking, I am propelled forward by nothing but the turgid veins in my hungry penis.

I am a man on a mission, who will stop at nothing to get what I want. Your feeble dainty woman hands are nothing compared to my big strong man arms. I want your hole, your pulsating meat sheathe under the sheets. Your warm moist cavity of love and fertility.

I want nothing but to drive my Excalibur into your stone of love.

I am a changed man now, what was once my sex drive - comparable to a slate of white marble - had evolved into something akin to a badger in heat.

The honey badger don't care.

I will destroy that vagina like it was the Death Star, and I was Luke Skywalker in a star fighter. In this new Eden that we shall create in this mortal plane from our fucking. I shall be Adam, the indomitable male alpha sexual force, and you will be Eve, my exotic Asian sex queen

Finish up support for shareable URLs (permalinks). (#722)

This is Part 2 of 2 (hopefully) of the permalinks effort. It adds
logic that loads and then proceeds to submit the input associated
with a shared URL.

To get this working I had to do a fairly major rearchitecture of
things. Here's the most significant bits that changed:

**Selecting a new model now updates the URL.**

When the user selects a new model using the dropdown, it now adds
the model identifier to the URL path. For instance, selecting BiDAF
takes the user to `/reading-comprehension/bidaf`.

I did this for two reasons:

1. It means we have to persist less data, which means there's less
to restore when loading a shareable URL. Trying to set both the
form input and the selected input made things tricky, since the
bits that manage them are at different levels in the application's
hierarchy. It's definitely possible, it just gets messy fast.

2. It's nice for the end user. The shareable URLs now include the
model identifier, so there's more context that'll help them remember
what the link points to.

**I ripped out the complicated bits of the `usePromise()` API.**

I did this because I discovered a series of bugs related to the
mechanics of the `usePromise()` mechanism. It turns out all the work
I did to try and eliminate race-conditions ultimately made the
API a little unruly *and* made room for some nasty bugs to creep
in.

So I ripped out the complicated bits, but still retained the
`usePromise()` hook and `<Promised />` component, as I think they
still have value. They do a lot less now, but they still save a lot
of boilerplate and seem a lot easier to use now. Plus those bugs
that were around now appear to be gone. Or I might just be tired.

Also, for the record, @aimichal called this when he first saw
these APIs. "Beware ye codeviking who enter here..." couldn't
stop me from treading down the perilous path of premature
generalization.

**A note about the browser history:**

As implemented the history doesn't totally work, but I think it's
ok as-is.

The shareable URLs work great, and can be navigated to via the
browser's history.

If a user loads a shared URL and then submits something else, I
added code that pushes a new history entry into the stack without
the shareable URL parameters. If the user navigates back to this
URL nothing happens. If there's form input or output that's
being displayed it'll continue to be.

I tried really hard to find a way to fix this, but every route I
went down ended up with a big ole' mess of spaghetti. That's why
there's a datestamp at the end of this branch name, as I started
to have a hard time tracking attempts.

Anyway I think it's the right compromise. Overall this feels pretty
nice, and it's worth noting that navigating using the browser
history on the existing demo doesn't work at all -- so it's definitely
an improvement.

Removed Threaded immutability shitfest
Volatile and Threaded are now functionally identical.
The performance impact of reading volatiles is now minimized.
Threaded takes a small performance hit to be able to expose the same functionality as Volatile without immutability headaches, but the performance loss is far smaller than that of Volatile.
Now, the big performance hits only come into play when writing Threaded objects as members (since this causes a property sync on next read/write).
However, most of the time this won't happen, meaning that Threaded reads will experience only 1 lock.
