[codegen] split out backend-specific information from NativeFunction in the model (#57361)

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/57361

Data model change in the codegen, which splits backend-specific information out of `NativeFunction`

### Overview
Currently in the codegen, native_functions.yaml has backend-specific information about each operator that is encoded directly into the data model, in the `NativeFunction` object. That's reasonable, since the native_functions.yaml is the source of truth for information about an operator, and the data model encodes that information into types.

Now that external backends can use the codegen though, that information is technically incomplete/inaccurate. In another PR, I tried patching the information on the `NativeFunction` object with the additional external information, by updating the `dispatch` entry to contain the external backend kernel name and dispatch key.

Instead, this PR tries to split out that information. The `NativeFunction` class contains all information about an operator from native_functions.yaml that's backend-independent and is known never to change regardless of what extra information backends provide. We also build up a backend "index", which is basically a mapping from [backend] -> [backend-specific-metadata]. Reading in an external backend yaml just involves updating that index with the new backend.

There were a few places where `NativeFunction` used the dispatch table directly, that I encoded as properties directly on the NativeFunction object (e.g. `is_abstract`). They were mostly around whether or not the operator has a composite kernel, which isn't something that's going to change for any external backends.

This has a few advantages:
- We can more easily re-use the existing logic in `native_function.py` and `register_dispatch_key.py` for both native and external backends, since they both involve a NativeFunction + a particular backend index
- The data in the data model will be the same regardless of how the codegen is run. Running the codegen with a new external backend doesn't change the data inside of NativeFunction or an existing backend index. It just adds a new index for that backend.
- There are several of codegen areas that don't care about backend-specific information: mostly the tracing and autograd codegen. We can reason about the codegen there more easily, knowing that backend-specific info is entirely uninvolved.

An alternative to this split would be to augment the NativeFunction objects with external backend information at the time that we create them. So the external codegen could read both native_functions.yaml and the external backend's yaml at the same time, and construct a NativeObject with a full dispatch table (including the XLA entry), and the correct setting of structured (taking into account both yamls). One disadvantage to this approach is that NativeFunction objects now contain different stuff depending on how you ran the codegen, and you have to make sure that any changes to the codegen can properly handle all the different variants.

### Data Model Changes
Removed 3 classes, which are used by the external codegen:
- ExternalBackendFunction
- ExternalBackendFunctionsGroup
- ExternalBackendMetadata

And added two new ones:
- BackendIndex
- BackendMetadata

`BackendIndex` contains any info that's specific to that backend, plus a mapping from operator names to backend specific metadata about the operator. One example of backend-specific info that's not operator-dependent is the fact that XLA prefers to implement functional kernels instead of out kernels (and so when they eventually mark an op as structured, they're going to mark the functional op and not the out op).

`BackendMetadata` contains info specific to an (operator, backend) pair. Right now, that's just (a) the name of the kernel, and (b) whether or not that operator is structured.

### Questions
I wanted to get this PR up earlier so I could get feedback, but there are a few things I want to call out:

**Dealing with `structured`.**
This PR separates out the notion of `structured` into two bits of information:
- Does [operator] have a meta() function. This is backend-agnostic, and is represented by the `structured` property on `NativeFunction`, same as before. This is used, e.g., to decide what signatures to add to `MetaFunctions.h`.
- Does [operator, backend] have an impl() function. This is backend dependent; even though technically all in-tree backends are forced to write impl() functions for an operator when we port the op to structured in native_functions.yaml, out-of-tree backends can decide to opt in independently. This is represented as a property on `BackendMetadata`. This is used in most other cases, e.g. in `RegisterDispatchKey` when we're deciding whether or not to gen a structured or unstructured wrapper.

I also baked `is_structured_dispatch_key` directly into each BackendIndex. So for operators marked "structured" in native_functions.yaml, their corresponding CPU/CUDA BackendIndex entries will be marked structured, and all others (except for potentially external backends) will not.

I ended up trying to deal with `structured` in this change since it's technically backend dependent (XLA can opt kernels into structured separately from in-tree ops), but that may have been too ambitious: it's technically not relevant until we actually add support for structured external kernels. If it's not clear that this is the right path for dealing with structured and we want to push that off, I'm fine with backing out the bits of this PR that make `structured` backend-dependent. I don't see anything *too* controversial related to structured in the change, but I tried to call out any areas in the comments

**Localizing the fact that external backends follow Dispatcher convention.**
Another thing that's sort of backend specific that I didn't totally address in this PR is the fact the fact that in-tree backends follow the Native API while external backends follow the Dispatcher API. I painted over that in `native_functions.py` by adding a helper, `kernel_signature`, that takes in a native function and gives you the "correct" signature for the specified backend- NativeSignature for in-tree backends, and DispatcherSignature for out-of-tree backends. In order to make that fully useable though, we'll need `NativeSignature` and `DispatcherSignature` to have matching interfaces. I didn't bother with that in this PR, which is why `gen_external_aten_fallbacks.py` still has a bunch of direct references to the dispatcher API. Thinking of adding it in a later PR but wanted to see if anyone has other opinions.

Maybe `is_external()` shouldn't even be a property on the BackendMetadata, and anything the codegen does that requires asking for that information should just be better abstracted away.

**Thoughts on the `BackendIndex` / `BackendMetadata` breakdown.**
One thing that's annoying right now is that to query for various pieces of metadata, you call helper functions like `backend_index.structured(f)`, which queries that particular backend and tells you if that specific NativeFunctionGroup is structured for that backend. It has to return an `Optional[bool]` though, since you have to handle the case where that operator doesn't have a kernel for that backend at all. So users of those helpers end up with a bunch of optionals that they need to unpack, even if they know at some point that the result isn't None. I think it would be easier instead to just store the NativeFunction object as a field directly on the BackendMetadata. Curious if there are any other opinions on a better way to model it though.

CodingGuidelines: recommend singular they

Technical writing seeks to convey information with minimal friction. One
way that a reader can experience friction is if they encounter a
description of "a user" that is later simplified using a gendered
pronoun. If the reader does not consider that pronoun to apply to them,
then they can experience cognitive dissonance that removes focus from
the information.

If we use singular "they/them" pronouns instead of "he/him" or "she/her"
pronouns, then we can avoid this congitive load on the reader.

Using singular "they" is also incredibly efficient. Choosing a gendered
pronoun is usually arbitrary between "he" or "she". Using constructs
such as "he or she", "s/he", or "(s)he" are more complicated than
singular "they".

When choosing a gendered pronoun, that pronoun no longer applies to
nearly half of possible readers. Even if we alternated between "he/him"
and "she/her" perfectly evenly, we would still expect male and female
readers to experience an incorrect pronoun half the time. However, some
readers will not prescribe to either of these binary genders. Those
readers hence suffer an incorrect pronoun the entire time. Singular
"they" applies to every reader.

Perhaps due to similar reasons, official style guides have changed their
stance on singuler "they" in recent years. For example, the APA style
guide changed their official recommendation in 2019 [1]. The MLA
handbook also references helpful ways to use singular "they" [2]. While
not fully endorsing it, the Chicago Manual of Style has removed its
blanket ban on singular "they" [3] (the previous recommendation was to
only use "it" as a singular non-gendered pronoun).

[1] https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they
[2] https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/
[3] https://libraries.indiana.edu/chicago-manual-style-singular-pronoun-they

While not all styleguides are updating their recommendations, we can
make a choice as a project to adopt the concept because of the
efficiencies above, as well as the benefits of increased inclusion.

To futher justify singular "they" as an acceptable grammatical concept,
I include the careful research of brian m. carlson who collected their
thoughts on this matter [2] (lightly edited):

  Singular "they" has been used by native English speakers as part of
  the language for over half a millennium and is widely used and
  understood. This usage is specified in Merriam Webster[3]:

    The use of they, their, them, and themselves as pronouns of
    indefinite gender and indefinite number is well established in
    speech and writing, even in literary and formal contexts.

  Wiktionary notes[4] (references omitted):

    Usage of they as a singular pronoun began in the 1300s and has been
    common ever since, despite attempts by some grammarians, beginning
    in 1795, to condemn it as a violation of traditional (Latinate)
    agreement rules. Some other grammarians have countered that criticism
    since at least 1896. Fowler's Modern English Usage (third edition)
    notes that it "is being left unaltered by copy editors" and is "not
    widely felt to lie in a prohibited zone." Some authors compare use of
    singular they to widespread use of singular you instead of thou.

  Linguists fit roughly into two camps: prescriptive and descriptive.
  The former specify rules for people to use, and the latter document
  language as it is actually used without forming a judgment.

  Some prescriptivists think it is acceptable, and some do not. But
  descriptivists will rightly note that it is and has been commonly
  used in English across countries, cultures, and contexts for an
  extended period of time and is therefore generally accepted by most
  English speakers as a normal part of the language.  Since we are
  writing text for an English language audience who are mostly not
  linguists, we should probably consider using the language that most
  people will use in this context.

[4] https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/they

If we refer to a specific person, then using a gendered pronoun is
appropriate. Examples within the Git codebase include:

* References to real people (e.g. Linus Torvalds, "the Git maintainer").
  Do not misgender real people. If there is any doubt to the gender of a
  person, then use singular "they".

* References to fictional people with clear genders (e.g. Alice and
  Bob).

* Sample text used in test cases (e.g t3702, t6432).

* The official text of the GPL license contains uses of "he or she", but
  modifying the license this way is not within the scope of the Git
  project.

Other cases within the Git project were cleaned up by the previous
changes.

CachedComputedProperties.swift finally works!

That was so much harder than it should be. It tried so many things and fought the type system so hard.
That was like writing Haskell in hell.

I tried using generics and references and blocks and they don't get along.

Getting references to non-object types is basically impossible as far as I understand. You're forced into that copy-on-write value semantics stuff. Which is neat but for this I needed references different.

Not even using raw pointers would work because they become invalid if you store them or sth if I understood correctly.

I managed to circumvent the lacking references by declaring this stuff as a protocol extension so we can always access `self` and then working with keyPaths. That makes the current implemenation incompatible with ObjC though..

Also the keyPaths were a huge pain because you can't use protocols to type them and then use them with types that implement these protocols... Because generics are "not covariant" or whatever.
Man I'm exhausted

I managed to get around the keypath type issues by using a PartialKeyPath though, luckily. I would have been out of witts after that or however you say that.

There were also tons of other issues I ran into where Swift couldn't infer types and gave super cryptic error messages or where I didn't understand what nonescaping blocks were and much more.

My god swift is soooo fckng cumbersome and verbose. Safety is nice but not like this.

I think I shouldn't treat Swift like a functional language and make use of the other "high level" language features more sparingly, too.

It's more like more convenient ObjC with less verbose syntax (for most things at least) and with a little bit of functional syntactic sugar and a whole lot of verhirnte crap on top.

Since singular "they" might be unfamiliar to some, we also list an
option to rephrase writing to use singular "you" or plural "they". We
can use singular "you" to refer to the reader instead of an abstract
user. Plural "they" works if we refer to multiple abstract users instead
of one. The English language does not have gendered versions of these
terms.

If we refer to a specific person, then using a gendered pronoun is
appropriate. There can also be other cases where it is inappropriate for
us to update the existing examples within the Git codebase, such as:

* References to real people (e.g. Linus Torvalds, "the Git maintainer").
  Do not misgender real people. If there is any doubt to the gender of a
  person, then use singular "they".

* The official text of the GPL license contains uses of "he or she", but
  modifying the license this way is not within the scope of the Git
  project.

* Literal email messages in Documentation/howto/ should not be edited
  for grammatical concerns such as this, unless we update the entire
  document to fit the standard documentation format. If such an effort is
  taken on, then the authorship would change and no longer refer to the
  exact mail message.

Other cases within the Git project were cleaned up by the previous
changes.

Not alone anymore

Ok, this update is HUGE! It's not just a system, but three!

Let's start from the beginning, where i was on the happy start from the last 12 hours i passed trying to solve and connect a bunch of features.
Alright, the first thing i did after the last update was to move freely across the proto world of Jarparur as if it was the most happy thing that happened to me, well, it felt pretty empty so i realized i could add some folks. Yea, that's what i did actually.

[+] characterCreator => createNpcs() -> The first HUGE addition: NPC Generator and NPC Manager, two extremely important parts of this thing that i refer as a Game Engine, the NPC Generator do as its name, generates new dudes that spawn at different location according to its race and class, for example, an orc can only spawn at "Deserto dos Ossos" because it's the orcish country in Jarparur's lore, so it makes sense, and so on. The NPC Manager also does as its name (what a surprise, a good name for a good function wow) this piece of the engine here can tell me where a folk is, what is his or her name (oh, i almost forgot to tell, i added a genre attribute, which influences the name of the creature), how is the folk feeling, an so on. This is just the first.

[+] Global Time => Oh yeah, finally the world can spin around its axis. Day an night doesn't really exist yet, this thing that i called global time is just a really REALLY big integer that is interpreted as seconds and is formatted to a readable string, the fact that it's just a huge integer makes possible for me to easily manipulate it, just by adding some seconds to the global time because the player has moved to another place or to add some days because the player has moved to another country, also, it helps with World Events (shhhhh nobody knows about this yet!), that's it. Time.

[+] Special Event Screens => Finally you can drop into Sul or Deserto dos Ossos and see its description and languages, or see the secret description of somebody's house, who knows, also, you can enter at hacker mode if you can find the special command to enter at items console manager (trust me, it isn't 'items'), or enter at the NPC manager to see with mAGiC where somebody is or how is somebody feeling. Don't know, just use it.

[*] characterCreator => solved some save bugs

[*] inventorySystem => loop bugs, solved with boolean magic

[*] prologue => here comes the CREATE A WORLD

[*] worldData => got rid of "day", "month" and "year", now we have "globalTime", much better!

Jokes aside, that was a pretty good experience, this game as it self is starting to feel very special for me, i'm learning a lot, that's what matters. See you (who reads this horrible text for no specific reason) next time.
