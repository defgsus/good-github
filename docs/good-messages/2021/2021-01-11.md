mqueue: don't use kmalloc with KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE

KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is not a good threshold.  It is extremely high and
problematic.  Unfortunately, some silly drivers depend on this and we
can't change it.  But any new code needn't use such extreme ugly high
order allocations.  It brings us awful fragmentation issues and system
slowdown.

# Recovering from Blindness

In the "Oxford Companion to the Mind" in the section "Blindness, recovery from", the empiricist John Locke is said to have wondered in 1690: what would happen to a man who, having been blind his whole life, had his vision repaired? If a blind man had learned to distinguish a cube and a globe by touch, could he, once made to see, identify them just by looking at them? The "Oxford Companion to the Mind" goes on to give this touching account of a boy who actually went through this experience: "These remained interesting speculations, until in 1728 an unusually expert and thoughtful surgeon, William Cheselden, reported such a clinical case. Though generally distinguished as a surgeon his achievements were especially ophthalmic operations for cataract [...]. In a celebrated case Cheselden gave sight to a boy aged thirteen or fourteen who was born with highly opaque cataracts. Cheselden reported that:"

> When [the boy] first saw, he was so far from making any judgment of distances, that he thought all object whatever touched his eyes (as he expressed it) as what he felt did his skin, and thought no object so agreeable as those which are smooth and regular, though he could form no judgment of their shape, or guess what it was in any object that was pleasing to him: he knew not the shape of anything, nor any one thing from another, however different in shape or magnitude; but upon being told what things were, whose form he knew before from feeling, he would carefully observe, that he might know them again; and (as he said) at first learned to know, and again forgot a thousand things in a day. One particular only, though it might appear trifling, I will relate: Having often forgot which was the cat, and which the dog, he was ashamed to ask; but catching the cat, which he knew by feeling, he was observed to look at her steadfastly, and then, setting her down, said, So, puss, I shall know you another time. He was very much surprised, that those things which he had liked best, did not appear most agreeable to his eyes, expecting those persons would appear most beautiful that he loved most, and such things to be most agreeable to his sight, that were so to his taste. We thought he soon knew what pictures represented, which were [shown] too him, but we found afterwards we were mistaken; for about two months after he was couched, he discovered at once they represented solid bodies, when to that time he considered them only as party-coloured planes, or surfaces diversified with variety of paint; but even then he was no less surprised, expecting the pictures would feel like the things they represented, and was amazed when he found those parts, which by their light and shadow appeared now round and uneven, felt only flat like the rest, and asked which was the lying sense, feeling or seeing?
>
> Being [shown] his father's picture in a locket at his mother's watch, and told what it was, he acknowledged the likeness, but was vastly surprised; asking, how it could be, that a large face could be expressed in so little room, saying, it should have seemed as impossible for him, as to put a bushel of anything into a pint. At first he could bear but very little light, and the things he saw, he thought extremely large; but upon seeing things larger, those first seen he conceived less, never being able to imagine any lines beyond the bounds he saw; the room he was in, he said, he knew to be but part of the house, yet he could not conceive that the whole house could look bigger. Before he was couched, he expected little advantage from seeing, worth undergoing an operation for, except reading and writing; for he said, he thought he could have no more pleasure in walking abroad than he had in the garden, which he could do safely and readily. And even blindness, he observed, had this advantage, that he could go anywhere in the dark, much better than those who can see; and after he had seen, he did not soon lose this quality, nor desire a light to go about the house in the night. He said, every new object was a new delight; and the pleasure was so great, that he wanted words to express it; but his gratitude to his operator he could not conceal, never seeing him for some time without tears of joy in his eyes, and other marks of affection. [...]

If knowledge came to us through the senses, the boy would immediately have been able to visually understand and distinguish shapes. Things we take for granted --- depth perception, for example --- are complex and learned concepts. The boy had to first *learn* how to use his newfound vision before he could learn anything else from it. Knowledge of how to use the senses is neither encoded genetically, nor can it possibly come from the senses. So where does it come from? Once he got better at using his vision, he could learn from it by using it as an *error correction* device. That's what senses are: error correction devices. We use them *after* creatively conjecturing solutions to problems, such as when the boy picked up his pet to test whether it was a cat or a dog through touch. If he ever forgot, it would take more error correction, until he got so good at it he knew. Something that seems as simple as learning to see represents a mountain of problems. Solving them is an impressive creative feat. Remarkably, young children do all of this joyfully and, it seems, effortlessly.

# Discussions Revisited

Today's websites "enabling" discussions are mostly awful.

First, conversations are typically modeled as a linear exchange. You say something, I say something. But that's not how real conversations work. Anything we say can be rich in consequences and merits exploring, which may deserve dedicated attention separate from the rest of the thread. Sometimes, we state several ideas at once, and addressing them one by one in a linear fashion is cumbersome, especially when each idea requires further conversation. So in reality, conversations are like trees. There are some platforms like Reddit and Twitter where you can comment on comments, but it isn't always clear which part of a comment you are responding to, unless you take the trouble to manually copy the original text and quote it --- that is, if you know markdown. And Twitter is generally bad for discussions because it enforces a character limit on each tweet, which makes discussing larger ideas cumbersome if not virtually impossible.

Second, current social networks are built around the concept of *approval*. It incentivizes people to make unargued assertions, since those that are going to agree with a statement are going to agree with it without an explanation for why it is true. But to those who do not already agree with the idea, unargued assertions are invitations to disagree. This is why social networks are polarizing: they are not built to learn, but to agree and disagree. We don't learn from either of those. We learn *through constructive criticism*. As the great philosopher Karl Popper said, "I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth."

People worry about fake news and the election coverage for fear of voter manipulation, so they remind us to "check our sources". That does not help, because a false idea does not become true when uttered by someone else, and vice versa. An idea is an *impersonal* thing. It is either true or false, and we can only find out which through conjecture and criticism. But since today's platforms do not provide a good experience and discourage real discussions in favor of agreeing or disagreeing with each other, we have no good place to discuss online.

Learning how to discuss is important because it teaches you *how to think*. When you ponder an idea the same thing happens in your mind as when you discuss it with someone else. Many different ideas come up and collide, and you want to get closer to the truth. Whether this is with yourself or someone else does not really matter.

Medium is a refreshing platform because it encourages people to post longer pieces. And its editing tools are better than what else I've seen online. They still are not really conducive to critical discussions, though.

What are we left with? Believe it or not, it's email. It's the only tool we have that really allows you to do what you want to do. You can quote others, comment precisely on the quotes you want inline, and conversations can carry on in long form in a tree shape. Alas, emails are boring, they are visually nude, they do not provide any tools to make discussions easier, and longer email threads are notoriously hard to maintain and reference. This isn't to mention that oddly enough, commenting is usually done *above* a quote, and unless everyone agrees that this should be avoided because it disrupts the order in which you read naturally, there is no way to enforce this standard.

What is needed is nothing less than a new discussion platform; a new approach which gives you long form posts, great commenting and editing tools, tree shaped conversations, and precise quoting. When you write a piece, people should be able to comment inline on the parts that matter, and you should see which comments you have not addressed yet at a glance. This matters because an idea is true if all its known refutations are false. In other words, the whole thing would roughly mirror how critical discussions work in real life. It could be used to evaluate new ideas. Indeed, way down the road, scientists and philosophers --- or anyone with an idea, really --- can post a conjecture and then ask for criticism. If, at any given time, there is at least one outstanding criticism, the idea is considered refuted, or at least its truth value is "unknown", and it can be marked as such. That way, others know what the current status of an idea is. Over time, such a platform could become a (fallible!) "source" of ideas and their truth status.

I figured it might be fun to work on such a platform. The first snapshot is available here: <https://web.archive.org/web/20191208201736/https://diskussion.herokuapp.com/>

I'll keep working on it for as long as it's fun. Who knows where that will take me. So far, the website only displays a static text; it's only a mockup of what an actual implementation might look like:

![Image for post](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/img/1_1unl8-tycrFKsVPBR0HjoA.png)

You can comment on a passage by highlighting it:

![Image for post](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/img/1_FQdggJ4IjU1glF7z1RBd1w.png)

The button on the left appears, and you can click it to expand a form:

![Image for post](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/img/1_gaASQBjMAF-LeP12e3VRKg.png)

After you submit the comment, the corresponding passage stays highlighted:

![Image for post](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/img/1_cPwo_VNXCqKS1Lab7-k5gQ.png)

The idea of highlighting text to comment on it is inspired by the Medium website. But on Medium, highlights are rather limited. For example, you cannot highlight passages across paragraphs. But why not? I'm guessing this is because getting the selected from many different HTML elements can be a bit tricky. On my site, you can select across any HTML elements within the post. You can even select text *around* the comment form, assuming you already have it open, to correct your selection. It won't quote anything you typed into the comment form and it will place the comment form correctly.

When a second comment is made, its corresponding passage can overlap with another passage that has been commented on:

![Image for post](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/img/1_efjH-BM3FTX269ZagvzuMg.png)

Note how the green is slightly darker in the middle, around the word "button", indicating that this word is perhaps a bit controversial.

The comments below first indicate their *range* --- the index of the first and last letter of the passage relative to the rest of the text. Then the quote is shown, indicated by a blue bar on the left, followed by the comment itself.

Next up, I'd like to make it so that you can link from a passage to its corresponding comments, so you can always quickly see what people are saying about a particular passage, and vice versa, so that if you're scrolling through the comments, you can see what passage they belong to and the quote does not provide enough context.

# What Is the Difference Between a Person and a Recording of That Person?

In "The Beginning of Infinity" (2012, p. 459), David Deutsch asks:

> "What is the difference between a computer simulation of a person (which must **be** a person, because of universality) and a recording of that simulation (which cannot be a person)?"

Deutsch has discovered that people are computer programs. Running on brains, they are humans, and running on computers other than the brain [they are are AGIs](https://soundcloud.com/dchacke). But either way, they are all people, and since people are programs, they can in principle be recorded --- like all other programs. By that I do not mean surveillance, but something like a video tape*. We do not yet know how to write a computer program that is a person, but no magical essence is required since people must follow the same logic all other programs follow: the step by step execution of code. So I will attempt to answer Deutsch's question by giving examples of simpler programs. I will show how one could go about recording the execution of a program, and then use that to show why a recording of a person cannot *be* a person. I also intend for this to show that knowledge about software engineering can help us attempt to solve philosophical problems.

Consider this simple program:

```clojure
(defn three []
  (+ 1 2))
```

This is a *function*. All it does is add 1 plus 2, returning 3. Before we can record this program, we need to run it --- just as before you can videotape something, you need that something to happen: you cannot record a video of a concert without the concert happening in front of you.

We run it like so:

```clojure
(three)
=> 3
```

The double arrow just shows us the function's return value. That's part of what functions do: they optionally take some input (none in the above case), run the steps in the function's body (here `(+ 1 2)`) and then return the result. The body could be much longer and more complicated, but that does not present a problem of principle with recording a program.

A recording of this simple program is just the return value itself. In other words, once we have run the program, we do not need to run it again; we can simply ask "Oh, that function `three`? Yeah it returns the number 3", without having to run it again --- and that's not just because it's named after its return value, but because we have run the function and so we *know* its return value.

The function above is, of course, pretty boring. How about a slightly more interesting example?

```clojure
(defn plus [a b]
  (+ a b))
```

This function is different from the previous one in that the numbers it adds up are not always the same. It does not even know what they are. We have to *pass them in* as `a` and `b` whenever we run the function. These are known as a function's *inputs* or *parameters*. For example, we can calculate 2 + 2 by running

```clojure
(plus 2 2)
=> 4
```

We can then record this result and later retrieve its value without running the function again:

```clojure
(look-up plus 2 2)
=> 4
```

Read: "What was the return value of the `plus` function when we ran it with parameters 2 and 2?"

Note, however, that the function's return value may change whenever its parameters change. So after recording this result, we have only recorded one of the infinitely many different additions we could perform. We do know, however, that 2 + 2 is always equal to 4, and so we can confidently store this recording.

This is known as [*memoization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) (not memo*r*ization). It's when you run a function once for some parameters and, next time you run the function with the same parameters, you don't run the function but instead just look up the return value you remember from before.

But that a function can only be memoized for *known* parameters; we cannot look up the result of 3 + 2 if we have not run the function with those parameters yet, just like you cannot remember something that hasn't happened yet. (You can *imagine* it, but that's something different.) Also note that this only works *because* addition always returns the same result for the same inputs.

Now consider this slightly modified version of addition:

```clojure
(defn plus' [a b]
  (println "Computing...")
  (+ a b))
```

This function (`plus'`, read "plus prime") differs from the previous one in that it prints something to the user before computing and returning the result. In this case, it's a simple message letting whoever is running the function know that it's busy. This would normally be reserved for function calls that take a while, but it illustrates my point: namely, that this function now has a [*side effect*](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/40314). The term "side effect" is a bit misleading because it does *not* mean that something is happening that was not intended. A side effect in programming is when a function *changes something somewhere*; for example, printing something to the screen, or writing some value to disk, or mutating some value.

Why do we need to care about side effects? Because we are trying to see if memoization works as a mechanism for recording a function. Let's see what this function does when we invoke it with parameters 5 and 5 for the first time:

```clojure
(plus' 5 5)
; Computing...
=> 10
```

Once we have memoized it, we can look it up:

```clojure
(look-up plus' 5 5)
=> 10
```

So what's the difference? When the look it up, it doesn't print "Computing...". Why not? Because the whole point of memoization is to *not run the function again*, but to instead immediately look up the return value corresponding to the given parameters. After all, memoization is an *optimization* technique. But without side effects, we do not get an accurate recording, and so we would need to come up with a *new* technique that is *like* memoization but *still performs side effects*.

I will get to that shortly, but first I need to mention that we can write functions that do not always return the same value for the same inputs. For example:

```clojure
(defn rand-times [a]
  (let [i (rand-int 10)]
    (* i a)))
```

First, the function takes a number `a`. Then it generates a random number between 0 and 10 and assigns it to the variable `i`. Lastly, it multiplies `i` by `a` and returns the result.

If you run this function several times with the same input, you will get a different return value almost every time:

```clojure
(rand-times 5)
=> 40
(rand-times 5)
=> 10
(rand-times 5)
=> 25
(rand-times 5)
=> 30
```

Functions that either do not return the same values for the same inputs, or that have side effects (or both) are known as *impure* functions. Here's an overview from [ClojureBridge London's website](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/workshop/functions/pure-functions.html):

![Image for post](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/img/0_4QtvmslYWlwlI2gK.png)

If any side causes influence a function, or if a function causes any side effects (both red in the picture above), it is impure.

People are impure functions: they have side effects (they shape the world around them, they physically move things, etc), the world around them influences them, and they do not always do the same thing given the same circumstances. A bored person who decides to go to the movies may well, all else being equal, have decided to do something else. (This is because a person is, or at least contains, an evolutionary algorithm he uses to guess solutions to problems, such as what to do when bored, and evolutionary algorithms are always impure. They make people *creative*; creativity is the defining attribute of people.)

Let's extend the above function to also contain side effects. If we can record this impure function, we have found a way to record functions that works:

```clojure
(defn rand-times' [a]
  (println "Computing...")
  (let [i (rand-int 10)]
    (* i a)))
```

It does the same thing as before, with the addition of printing "Computing...". Let's say we invoke function with the number 5, and it happens to generate the number 2 as a random number to multiply by 5. What would a recording of this look like? We know now we cannot use memoization. It would have to be a *new function*:

```clojure
(defn rand-times'-recorded []
  (println "Computing...")
  10)
```

This is a completely different function. It would have to be the same function to be the same person. And, though it looks a bit like the original, it does something else entirely: it takes *no* parameters and *always* returns 10. The only thing the recording has in common with the original is that it always causes the same side effect. So, if you recorded a person, all their actions would become perfectly reproducible: the opposite of creativity. Since creativity is the defining attribute of people, a function lacking creativity is not a person.

That is the difference between a computer program and a recording of it, and that is why a recording of a person cannot *be* a person.

**I am ignoring for the moment the moral problem that recording a person violates his privacy. So please, nobody do this once we can program people (i.e. build AGI).*

# How Do Some Peaceful Ideas Result in Violent Protests?

The violent protests that have ensued in response to the recent death of a black man, George Floyd, at the hand of the Minneapolis police, and the resulting social pressure regarding how we are all supposed to react and agree with each other, have got me thinking about ideas.

In this essay, I want to attempt a solution to the following two problems.

1.  The opposition to racism is usually based on core values of peace and human rights. Yet the recent anti-racist protests themselves are violent and infringe upon basic human rights (such as property rights by looting stores). That's a contradiction.
2.  Related to that is the more general problem of how some ideas evolve into their opposites, and, in particular, by what *logic* initially peaceful ideas --- and/or associated ideas --- turn violent.

I believe both problems have the same solution, but before I can state my main thesis, I must briefly mention *memes*. A meme is an idea that manages to spread from person to person (Dawkins 2016, chapter 11). Many ideas are memes, such as catchy songs, funny jokes, good scientific theories, and so on. Memes, Dawkins argues, replicate and, like all replicators, are subject to variation and selection: they evolve. For example, one person tells another a joke, who then tells it to someone else. Maybe he changes part of it a little bit, either creatively or by mistake, without even realizing it. If that makes the joke slightly funnier, it will spread even more. Memes can differ in how they spread and how they affect their holders' behavior *to* spread, as I will elaborate below. (There is a *lot* to memes, but here I can only scratch the surface. Suffice it to say that a meme that is good at spreading will instruct its holder to enact behaviors which, once observed by others, help it get itself copied by those others and enacted further. Memes that spread are not necessarily good or useful or true ideas. They spread primarily because, well, they are good at spreading --- for whatever reason.)

Perhaps one of the best examples of the dangers and irrationalities caused by meme proxies is the meme of being a social-justice warrior, so I will spend some time criticizing it. (It is more of a *group* of associated memes, a so-called *meme-complex* (Dawkins 2016, chapter 11) (or simply *memeplex*), but I will refer to it as a single meme for simplicity.) Social-justice warriors are those who exploit good causes to advertise their alleged virtues and gain social status. (They will, of course, deny this, but whether they are aware of this motivation is not at issue here.) Their good causes are usually reactionary, i.e., they define themselves in opposition to something: a social-justice warrior opposes racism, environmental destruction, poverty, etc.

Being a social-justice warrior belongs to a class of memes whose main replication strategy, I conjecture, is the following: when one criticizes such a meme, one may seem to condone the thing in opposition to which it defines itself. That is my main thesis. When that definition is or at least seems good, memes that rest on it --- the proxies --- are harder to criticize, as are other associated memes. Proxies can then mutate more freely and are not subject to the selection pressures to which they would normally be subject. As a result, they can evolve into strange forms almost unchecked --- forms that criticism would normally eliminate fairly quickly.

This theory of meme proxies solves both problems above. The peaceful idea of opposing racism is hard to criticize (for good reason). Ideas associating with it are also hard to criticize (sometimes for reasons not as good) --- they "inherit" the level of criticizability. These associated ideas can now mutate relatively unchecked and, sometimes, even turn into the opposite of the core idea without losing their association. That is why the protests against police brutality are themselves brutal, and it is the logic by which the meaning of a memeplex can evolve into its opposite.

That social-justice warriors oppose racism, is, in and of itself, good. But the content of their ideology does not stop there --- they smuggle in many other ideas. For example, many social-justice warriors today believe that white people suck simply for being white, which is an immoral (and false) idea. Additional ideas, even ones that are as blatantly false as this last one, manage to spread because they are tied to the good cause of opposing racism. How on Earth an opposition to racism could associate with ideas that have morphed into ones racist against white people is not clear unless we explain the reason through the almost unchecked mutation of those associated ideas. Self-contradiction is usually a disqualifying attribute of a theory, but not in this case. These ideas are harder to criticize because they are bundled up in such a way. They and the original idea --- the good cause of opposing racism --- have become a "package deal."

To illustrate this phenomenon, consider the following example. Just earlier today, I saw a post by a company called gymshark on Instagram (2020). (For context: they share posts about gym workouts and other gym-related stuff.) The post featured a white-on-black image saying "Fuck standing on the sideline." The caption said:

> Strength has no identity, only unity. We're working closely with our team, our athletes, and our entire community to unite against injustice and make a genuine difference, not just a statement.
>
> In our world of sports, strength and conditioning, we're used to seeing black athletes as icons, heroes and teammates. We should not be used to seeing injustice against black friends, family and strangers.
>
> We thank our friends in the industry --- from Nike to Adidas to Lululemon --- for their outspoken commitment to the cause. Because silence is not impartiality. It's ignorance. And tomorrow is not soon enough. We must push for change today.

Though the post doesn't make any explicit mention of it, given the timing, it is clearly a response to the event in Minneapolis. I dislike when companies use social-justice themes to raise product awareness because it's difficult to tell whether this rests on a genuine concern for the cause and because I distrust good intentions for reasons I will elaborate below. As a more practical and immediate concern: I don't follow accounts like gymshark because they are pro social justice --- I follow them because I like going to the gym. (The inversion of this is true as well: I still enjoy watching, say, Kevin Spacey's movies, even if the allegations against him are true. I have enjoyed those movies *because Spacey is a good actor*, not because he hasn't committed any particular misdeed.)

I decided to unfollow gymshark. If I had done so quietly, they would have never known and there would have been no opportunity for them to improve, so I decided to share my thoughts, even though I was under no obligation to do so. I commented (2020):

> I follow you for gym-related posts, not for social-justice-warrior posts. Unfollow.

My comment received several replies in a short amount of time. All of them were negative. Consider the following subset:

> 117% you won't be missed

--- coolestkidouttt

> look at you telling on yourself

--- barnalireardon

> hey buddy, your racism is showing

--- luce.paloma

These are only three out of nine. Most other comments either said roughly the same as the first one above or contained mutual encouragement. I am not relaying these comments because I feel bad or because I am surprised --- I don't and I'm not, I knew to expect such a response --- but only to give an example of the kind of meme we are dealing with here. Take a look at comments two and three in particular. What the second one merely implies the third states explicitly: they allege the reason for unfollowing gymshark was racist.

Why did these people think that? My comment didn't contain a pro-racist stance (nor an anti-racist one, for that matter). It simply stated a reason for unfollowing this account, and that reason did not mention race. So how come they alleged racism? They did so *by extension*: the ideas social-justice warriors spread act as *proxies* of ideas opposing racism. They are treated as a kind of "fall-through." Criticism is *delegated* and applied to the underlying ideas, and then judged accordingly --- even when the criticism was meant to apply only to the proxy. *That's* why these commenters thought criticizing ideas around social justice means advocating racism, even though I hadn't said anything about race one way or the other.

In some cases, these proxies can even have an anticipatory character: you must not talk about something without preemptively condemning an aspect of it. It is for this reason I suspect some readers will not get past this essay's first paragraph without bemoaning how I didn't condemn what happened in Minneapolis --- but this essay is not about my opinion on Floyd's death. It is for this same anticipatory reason that gymshark wrote: "[...] silence is not impartiality. It's ignorance," meaning if you don't make a pronouncement they agree with, they consider you ignorant. And it is the reason why, bafflingly, millions of people, one after the other, have started to post *nothing but a black picture* on social media, allegedly in an attempt to silence their usual online activity and to give room for posts relating to the cause, oh the perfect little goody-two-shoes they aspire to be, completely oblivious to the social con they are committing collectively.

Of course, in reality, posting this meme achieves nothing but signaling one's commitment and feeling better about oneself. People see the meme, and, because it's tied to a good cause, and because of statements like gymshark's, feel the pressure to share it, lest they look like racists. A social-justice warrior, aiming to gain social status, will comply, as did those responding to my comment: they were not responding to *me*, they were signaling to *each other*, putting on a sanctimonious show, hoping to display their commitment to the cause and gain likes. (Worse yet, social-justice warriors comply *reliably* and, therefore, *predictably*, which makes their movement susceptible to exploitation by the political enemies of the West who try to destroy our free society from within by strategically placing destructive memes they know social-justice warriors will spread.) A better name for "social-justice warrior" is "social-approval seeker."

Several other instances of proxies that spread with the help of their underlying ideas come to mind. In the late 1920s and the early 1930s in Germany, for example, both national socialism and communism were on the rise and competed for popularity. (These memeplexes competed quite literally in the evolutionary sense.) I am no expert on the history of either idea, but I would imagine that adherents to either one did not adhere to it because they wanted to be evil, but because they believed it was right and did good. Therefore, I imagine national socialism managed to spread because it associated with the good intention of restoring pride in a beaten Germany after World War I, and communism managed to spread because it associated with the good intention of helping the poor. And so, I conjecture those who openly criticized the Nazis were accused of having wanted to lose the war or wanting Germany to remain beaten, and those who openly criticized communism were accused of endorsing poverty. (In this particular historical example, these two ideas, despite being similar in their violent execution, also defined themselves in opposition to one another, so that those opposing the Nazis were accused of being communists, and vice versa. Not only can you criticize one without advocating the other, your ability to criticize *both* relies on that fact.) Many of those who, still undecided at the time, considered opposing the Nazis must have asked themselves, "but do I want Germany to remain beaten?", and, as they answered "no" to themselves, wrongly concluded, "all right, I guess that means I am in favor of national socialism," when they could have realized there was a third way: reviving Germany peacefully, i.e., without Nazis. Proxy memes spread particularly well when they present false dichotomies, which prevent one from thinking of other ways to solve a problem.

The allegedly anti-fascist organization Antifa has gained popularity by exploiting such a false dichotomy and presenting itself as one side of it. This exploitation has afforded Antifa the same old defense. Here is a version of it by New York City councilman (!) Justin Brannan (2018):

> Dudebro, if you are anti antifa that means you are pro-fascist.

It doesn't mean that. The "anti-anti" doesn't turn into "pro" in this case because Antifa does not stand only for the single idea of opposing fascism. Several meme proxies surround it (hating the police, hating capitalism, etc). You can absolutely oppose these proxies without supporting fascism. You don't have to take the package deal. Alas, many today, like impressionable German voters in the thirties, ask themselves, "do I support fascism?", and, answering "no" to themselves, wrongly conclude, "all right, I guess that means I am in favor of Antifa," proudly pronouncing their decision, lest they look like fascists.

Another instance of the phenomenon of meme proxies is the idea behind the good intention of helping poor people. This idea helps smuggle in the mistaken assumption that wealth inequality is bad. Sympathy for the poor and the condemning of wealth inequality have become so intertwined in many people's minds they think criticism of one always means criticism of the other. But that is not the case. You can see poverty as a horrible thing without opposing wealth inequality. (In fact, wealth inequality is the very means by which poverty can be alleviated, for, alleviating poverty requires people to become richer, at which they succeed at different speeds, if at all.) However, a mind that considers ideas about wealth inequality as a proxy for ideas about poverty cannot dissociate the two.

(There are more instances of such ideas, such as this timely one, given the current COVID-19 pandemic: you can oppose *forcing* people to wear masks without advocating they get sick and without opposing the idea they *should* wear masks.)

Because the ideas around being a social-justice warrior immunize themselves from criticism in the way I have described, I believe they are what Deutsch calls *static memes* (2012, chapter 15). These are memes that, rather than spreading for being helpful, spread through the inhibition of criticism. I think the memes I describe above are a specific *type* of static meme. (Alternatively, they may be a specific type of what Temple (2019) calls *static companion memes*, which seem to be a related topic.)

Social-justice warriors suffer from the particular affliction of identifying with one's ideas. We all do this to some degree, but a healthy mind can dissociate from the ideas it contains, at least temporarily, to take a step back and investigate them critically. Social-justice warriors, on the other hand, rather than thinking critically, are largely concerned with doing "the right thing" (or rather, advertising doing so) and thereby only entrench any mistakes they may have already made without being able to correct them. For example, the idea that white people suck for being white is itself racist, but the allegedly anti-racist social-justice warriors have created new ideas to protect that mistaken idea (mistaken by *their* standards, even). Not only that, but they identify *personally* with the (sometimes only seemingly, sometimes genuinely) good cause they have taken up, so they see any criticism of their *ideas* (i.e., *impersonal* criticism) as a personal attack. Such ideas manage to serve as proxies not just for other ideas, but for the entire holder. To many, this identification with their ideas is so entrenched that criticism can be somewhat traumatic (which is perhaps partly why rather ridiculous memes such as "trigger warnings" have managed to spread).

This defensive attitude in the face of criticism that results from identifying with one's ideas can create such strong dissonance in a mind that it may instruct its body to physically attack those sharing criticism. This is another answer to the first problem above. Violence may also result from trying to do "the right thing," as the great philosopher Karl Popper explained (see below). If Popper were alive today, he would no doubt recognize what has been happening these past few days as the consequence of static memes hiding behind good causes, as many American cities are ravaged by looting and violence in the name of the good cause of opposing racism.

Memes that are proxies of good intentions can go undetected for a long time because they evade criticism. To evade criticism is to evade the selective mechanisms of meme evolution, so mutations happen almost unchecked. Since mutations are not targeted, they are usually not for the better --- they deteriorate the meme's structure and content. Normally, criticism would detect and weed out such poorer memes. But now, this does not happen. Soon, what started as a benign, genuinely good intention, can turn into a monstrous memeplex demanding a violent revolution.

Social-justice warriors love to talk about *systemic* issues. "The system is broken," they say, "so to hell with it. Let's burn it all down." That is what we have been seeing these past few days as government buildings and businesses are being set on fire by an angry mob. Rather than improving things piece by piece, in a stable fashion, this mob wants a revolution. Only such a revolution, they argue, can create a system that is just and free of the shortcomings of our irreparably "racist, misogynist, and patriarchal society."

"I am convinced that revolutionary methods can only make things worse --- that they will increase unnecessary suffering; that they will lead to more and more violence; and that they must destroy freedom." Karl Popper (2002, 462). Photo credit: AP Photo/Alex Brandon, as posted by Collinson (2020).

Popper identified the destructive nature of revolutions in his criticism of the doctrine of Marxism (which doctrine, unbelievably, despite the well-known death toll of millions, still inspires social-justice warriors today). He wrote (2002, 462):

> I shall not here discuss the problem of the humanitarian aims of Marxism. I find that there is a very great deal in these aims which I can accept. The hope of reducing misery and violence, and of increasing freedom, is one, I believe, which inspired Marx and many of his followers; it is a hope which inspires most of us.

Popper is careful to distinguish between the aims of Marxism --- the good intentions of Marxism, as it were --- and *the methods by which Marxists want to achieve these aims.* In other words, Popper did not fall prey to the trickery of the proxy. He continues:

> But I am convinced that these aims cannot be realized by revolutionary methods. On the contrary, I am convinced that revolutionary methods can only make things worse --- that they will increase unnecessary suffering; that they will lead to more and more violence; and that they must destroy freedom.
>
> This becomes clear when we realize that a revolution always destroys the institutional and traditional framework of society.

--- e.g. burning down government buildings and businesses, or "push[ing] for change today," not tomorrow, as gymshark said ---

> It must thereby endanger the very set of values for the realization of which it has been undertaken.

If doing good, let alone causing a revolution, is not the answer, that creates a third, new problem for us: what *should* we do? The answer: *piecemeal* error correction and problem-solving. As Taleb (2017) suggests: stop virtue signaling and *start a business*. It's so safe and easy to signal a virtue with which everyone around you already agrees. "The best virtue requires courage," Taleb writes --- "accordingly it needs to be unpopular." I agree. And I should add another suggestion: instead of following causes, *follow your interests.* A mind preoccupied with causes is a mind devoid of purpose. It is a mind floating lazily in a sea of virtues, surviving only by drifting wherever the tide washes it. A mind driven by *interests* and self-generated *purpose*, on the other hand, is like a strong swimmer who will swim against the tide when that is what it takes to follow his interests.

Purpose and interests are determined by the problems you want to solve. Create or identify your interests and then, optionally, identify *shared* interests --- they indicate what Deutsch has called "shared problems." (2019) Following one's interests is compatible with Taleb's advice to start a business because, once you have found shared interests, you can start a business that sells solutions to those with whom you share problems, thereby *happening* to make the world a little bit better, one day at a time. No grand solutions, no utopian dreams: piecemeal, realistic problem-solving. And you get to live by your interests, not by what some meme proxy says you should do. Value and improvements are created by businesses through trade, not by political agendas, and least of all by social-justice warriors.

Understanding how certain memes spread can be done through a meta-analysis of types of memes without referring to their specific contents. (That applies to racist memes as well, so social-justice warriors should take an interest in meme theory.) In other words, the question "why does person x hold idea y?" can be answered roughly by answering the question "why is idea y good at spreading?". Memes are also criticizable based on their replication strategy alone whenever we have good explanations of how and why their replication strategy leads to violence or other negatives. I suspect those who are unwilling to entertain meta-analyses of memes will have a hard time correcting errors in their thinking. And I conjecture those who consider looting stores and burning down buildings a warranted response to the aforementioned death do not perform such meta-analyses.

You can criticize social-justice warriors without supporting racism. You can criticize communism without espousing poverty. You can oppose feminism without hating women. You can oppose violent protests without condoning police brutality. Etc. People need to realize this and identify meme proxies. Do black lives matter? Should we oppose fascists? Should we fight poverty? To all of these questions, we may be tempted to reply, "*obviously*, yes." I agree we should reply, "yes." But we should not reply "obviously," for the "truth is hard to come by" (Popper 2002, 502), and the opposite idea --- that it is self-evident --- has led to much suffering and violence. Beware of meme proxies associating with a good idea to gain traction, initially just surrounding the true core of it, then growing around it until they suffocate that core and it disappears almost entirely. In some cases, it does, and may even be inverted. We see this inversion in how the supposed anti-racists have become racist against white people, and in how those trying to help the poor push them further into poverty by opposing wealth inequality.

A remaining problem this essay does not solve is how to successfully persuade someone infected with proxies to adopt an idea which opposes those proxies. I have a hunch this can be done by convincing him of a seemingly unrelated idea. It must seem unrelated so that it can pass the proxy guards. If he later discovers the idea is in conflict with the proxies he harbors, he can then resolve the conflict in favor of the new idea, thereby discarding the proxies. For now, this is just a rough conjecture. In a time of increased political division and violence, it would be good to know how to do this.

In any case --- because bad ideas like to hide in the shade of good intentions, I have developed a knee-jerk suspicion toward anyone doing things "for good" or "for the right reasons," especially when advertised. I suggest you do the same.

PS: By the way, how many of those who, only weeks ago, wanted to force businesses to close and people to stay home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are now among those huddling up to protest, thereby further spreading the virus? And how many pressured us to stay home, only to drop that demand immediately in favor of encouraging everyone to go protest? Both things are about forcing people to do what's "right," so I expect a significant overlap between advocates of either one. Would they explain this contradiction by saying the evil of racism is greater than the evil of the virus, and, therefore, forceful efforts designed to address the former must, when in conflict, override those designed to address the latter?

# How Do Some Peaceful Ideas Result in Violent Protests?

The violent protests that have ensued in response to the recent death of a black man, George Floyd, at the hand of the Minneapolis police, and the resulting social pressure regarding how we are all supposed to react and agree with each other, have got me thinking about ideas.

In this essay, I want to attempt a solution to the following two problems.

1.  The opposition to racism is usually based on core values of peace and human rights. Yet the recent anti-racist protests themselves are violent and infringe upon basic human rights (such as property rights by looting stores). That's a contradiction.
2.  Related to that is the more general problem of how some ideas evolve into their opposites, and, in particular, by what *logic* initially peaceful ideas --- and/or associated ideas --- turn violent.

I believe both problems have the same solution, but before I can state my main thesis, I must briefly mention *memes*. A meme is an idea that manages to spread from person to person (Dawkins 2016, chapter 11). Many ideas are memes, such as catchy songs, funny jokes, good scientific theories, and so on. Memes, Dawkins argues, replicate and, like all replicators, are subject to variation and selection: they evolve. For example, one person tells another a joke, who then tells it to someone else. Maybe he changes part of it a little bit, either creatively or by mistake, without even realizing it. If that makes the joke slightly funnier, it will spread even more. Memes can differ in how they spread and how they affect their holders' behavior *to* spread, as I will elaborate below. (There is a *lot* to memes, but here I can only scratch the surface. Suffice it to say that a meme that is good at spreading will instruct its holder to enact behaviors which, once observed by others, help it get itself copied by those others and enacted further. Memes that spread are not necessarily good or useful or true ideas. They spread primarily because, well, they are good at spreading --- for whatever reason.)

Perhaps one of the best examples of the dangers and irrationalities caused by meme proxies is the meme of being a social-justice warrior, so I will spend some time criticizing it. (It is more of a *group* of associated memes, a so-called *meme-complex* (Dawkins 2016, chapter 11) (or simply *memeplex*), but I will refer to it as a single meme for simplicity.) Social-justice warriors are those who exploit good causes to advertise their alleged virtues and gain social status. (They will, of course, deny this, but whether they are aware of this motivation is not at issue here.) Their good causes are usually reactionary, i.e., they define themselves in opposition to something: a social-justice warrior opposes racism, environmental destruction, poverty, etc.

Being a social-justice warrior belongs to a class of memes whose main replication strategy, I conjecture, is the following: when one criticizes such a meme, one may seem to condone the thing in opposition to which it defines itself. That is my main thesis. When that definition is or at least seems good, memes that rest on it --- the proxies --- are harder to criticize, as are other associated memes. Proxies can then mutate more freely and are not subject to the selection pressures to which they would normally be subject. As a result, they can evolve into strange forms almost unchecked --- forms that criticism would normally eliminate fairly quickly.

This theory of meme proxies solves both problems above. The peaceful idea of opposing racism is hard to criticize (for good reason). Ideas associating with it are also hard to criticize (sometimes for reasons not as good) --- they "inherit" the level of criticizability. These associated ideas can now mutate relatively unchecked and, sometimes, even turn into the opposite of the core idea without losing their association. That is why the protests against police brutality are themselves brutal, and it is the logic by which the meaning of a memeplex can evolve into its opposite.

That social-justice warriors oppose racism, is, in and of itself, good. But the content of their ideology does not stop there --- they smuggle in many other ideas. For example, many social-justice warriors today believe that white people suck simply for being white, which is an immoral (and false) idea. Additional ideas, even ones that are as blatantly false as this last one, manage to spread because they are tied to the good cause of opposing racism. How on Earth an opposition to racism could associate with ideas that have morphed into ones racist against white people is not clear unless we explain the reason through the almost unchecked mutation of those associated ideas. Self-contradiction is usually a disqualifying attribute of a theory, but not in this case. These ideas are harder to criticize because they are bundled up in such a way. They and the original idea --- the good cause of opposing racism --- have become a "package deal."

To illustrate this phenomenon, consider the following example. Just earlier today, I saw a post by a company called gymshark on Instagram (2020). (For context: they share posts about gym workouts and other gym-related stuff.) The post featured a white-on-black image saying "Fuck standing on the sideline." The caption said:

> Strength has no identity, only unity. We're working closely with our team, our athletes, and our entire community to unite against injustice and make a genuine difference, not just a statement.
>
> In our world of sports, strength and conditioning, we're used to seeing black athletes as icons, heroes and teammates. We should not be used to seeing injustice against black friends, family and strangers.
>
> We thank our friends in the industry --- from Nike to Adidas to Lululemon --- for their outspoken commitment to the cause. Because silence is not impartiality. It's ignorance. And tomorrow is not soon enough. We must push for change today.

Though the post doesn't make any explicit mention of it, given the timing, it is clearly a response to the event in Minneapolis. I dislike when companies use social-justice themes to raise product awareness because it's difficult to tell whether this rests on a genuine concern for the cause and because I distrust good intentions for reasons I will elaborate below. As a more practical and immediate concern: I don't follow accounts like gymshark because they are pro social justice --- I follow them because I like going to the gym. (The inversion of this is true as well: I still enjoy watching, say, Kevin Spacey's movies, even if the allegations against him are true. I have enjoyed those movies *because Spacey is a good actor*, not because he hasn't committed any particular misdeed.)

I decided to unfollow gymshark. If I had done so quietly, they would have never known and there would have been no opportunity for them to improve, so I decided to share my thoughts, even though I was under no obligation to do so. I commented (2020):

> I follow you for gym-related posts, not for social-justice-warrior posts. Unfollow.

My comment received several replies in a short amount of time. All of them were negative. Consider the following subset:

> 117% you won't be missed

--- coolestkidouttt

> look at you telling on yourself

--- barnalireardon

> hey buddy, your racism is showing

--- luce.paloma

These are only three out of nine. Most other comments either said roughly the same as the first one above or contained mutual encouragement. I am not relaying these comments because I feel bad or because I am surprised --- I don't and I'm not, I knew to expect such a response --- but only to give an example of the kind of meme we are dealing with here. Take a look at comments two and three in particular. What the second one merely implies the third states explicitly: they allege the reason for unfollowing gymshark was racist.

Why did these people think that? My comment didn't contain a pro-racist stance (nor an anti-racist one, for that matter). It simply stated a reason for unfollowing this account, and that reason did not mention race. So how come they alleged racism? They did so *by extension*: the ideas social-justice warriors spread act as *proxies* of ideas opposing racism. They are treated as a kind of "fall-through." Criticism is *delegated* and applied to the underlying ideas, and then judged accordingly --- even when the criticism was meant to apply only to the proxy. *That's* why these commenters thought criticizing ideas around social justice means advocating racism, even though I hadn't said anything about race one way or the other.

In some cases, these proxies can even have an anticipatory character: you must not talk about something without preemptively condemning an aspect of it. It is for this reason I suspect some readers will not get past this essay's first paragraph without bemoaning how I didn't condemn what happened in Minneapolis --- but this essay is not about my opinion on Floyd's death. It is for this same anticipatory reason that gymshark wrote: "[...] silence is not impartiality. It's ignorance," meaning if you don't make a pronouncement they agree with, they consider you ignorant. And it is the reason why, bafflingly, millions of people, one after the other, have started to post *nothing but a black picture* on social media, allegedly in an attempt to silence their usual online activity and to give room for posts relating to the cause, oh the perfect little goody-two-shoes they aspire to be, completely oblivious to the social con they are committing collectively.

Of course, in reality, posting this meme achieves nothing but signaling one's commitment and feeling better about oneself. People see the meme, and, because it's tied to a good cause, and because of statements like gymshark's, feel the pressure to share it, lest they look like racists. A social-justice warrior, aiming to gain social status, will comply, as did those responding to my comment: they were not responding to *me*, they were signaling to *each other*, putting on a sanctimonious show, hoping to display their commitment to the cause and gain likes. (Worse yet, social-justice warriors comply *reliably* and, therefore, *predictably*, which makes their movement susceptible to exploitation by the political enemies of the West who try to destroy our free society from within by strategically placing destructive memes they know social-justice warriors will spread.) A better name for "social-justice warrior" is "social-approval seeker."

Several other instances of proxies that spread with the help of their underlying ideas come to mind. In the late 1920s and the early 1930s in Germany, for example, both national socialism and communism were on the rise and competed for popularity. (These memeplexes competed quite literally in the evolutionary sense.) I am no expert on the history of either idea, but I would imagine that adherents to either one did not adhere to it because they wanted to be evil, but because they believed it was right and did good. Therefore, I imagine national socialism managed to spread because it associated with the good intention of restoring pride in a beaten Germany after World War I, and communism managed to spread because it associated with the good intention of helping the poor. And so, I conjecture those who openly criticized the Nazis were accused of having wanted to lose the war or wanting Germany to remain beaten, and those who openly criticized communism were accused of endorsing poverty.

> Dudebro, if you are anti antifa that means you are pro-fascist.

It doesn't mean that. The "anti-anti" doesn't turn into "pro" in this case because Antifa does not stand only for the single idea of opposing fascism. Several meme proxies surround it (hating the police, hating capitalism, etc). You can absolutely oppose these proxies without supporting fascism. You don't have to take the package deal. Alas, many today, like impressionable German voters in the thirties, ask themselves, "do I support fascism?", and, answering "no" to themselves, wrongly conclude, "all right, I guess that means I am in favor of Antifa," proudly pronouncing their decision, lest they look like fascists.

Another instance of the phenomenon of meme proxies is the idea behind the good intention of helping poor people. This idea helps smuggle in the mistaken assumption that wealth inequality is bad. Sympathy for the poor and the condemning of wealth inequality have become so intertwined in many people's minds they think criticism of one always means criticism of the other. But that is not the case. You can see poverty as a horrible thing without opposing wealth inequality. (In fact, wealth inequality is the very means by which poverty can be alleviated, for, alleviating poverty requires people to become richer, at which they succeed at different speeds, if at all.)

Social-justice warriors, on the other hand, rather than thinking critically, are largely concerned with doing "the right thing" (or rather, advertising doing so) and thereby only entrench any mistakes they may have already made without being able to correct them. For example, the idea that white people suck for being white is itself racist, but the allegedly anti-racist social-justice warriors have created new ideas to protect that mistaken idea (mistaken by *their* standards, even). Not only that, but they identify *personally* with the (sometimes only seemingly, sometimes genuinely) good cause they have taken up, so they see any criticism of their *ideas* (i.e., *impersonal* criticism) as a personal attack. Such ideas manage to serve as proxies not just for other ideas, but for the entire holder. To many, this identification with their ideas is so entrenched that criticism can be somewhat traumatic (which is perhaps partly why rather ridiculous memes such as "trigger warnings" have managed to spread).

This defensive attitude in the face of criticism that results from identifying with one's ideas can create such strong dissonance in a mind that it may instruct its body to physically attack those sharing criticism. This is another answer to the first problem above. Violence may also result from trying to do "the right thing," as the great philosopher Karl Popper explained (see below). If Popper were alive today, he would no doubt recognize what has been happening these past few days as the consequence of static memes hiding behind good causes, as many American cities are ravaged by looting and violence in the name of the good cause of opposing racism.

Memes that are proxies of good intentions can go undetected for a long time because they evade criticism. To evade criticism is to evade the selective mechanisms of meme evolution, so mutations happen almost unchecked. Since mutations are not targeted, they are usually not for the better --- they deteriorate the meme's structure and content. Normally, criticism would detect and weed out such poorer memes. But now, this does not happen. Soon, what started as a benign, genuinely good intention, can turn into a monstrous memeplex demanding a violent revolution.

Social-justice warriors love to talk about *systemic* issues. "The system is broken," they say, "so to hell with it. Let's burn it all down." That is what we have been seeing these past few days as government buildings and businesses are being set on fire by an angry mob. Rather than improving things piece by piece, in a stable fashion, this mob wants a revolution. Only such a revolution, they argue, can create a system that is just and free of the shortcomings of our irreparably "racist, misogynist, and patriarchal society."

*"I am convinced that revolutionary methods can only make things worse --- that they will increase unnecessary suffering; that they will lead to more and more violence; and that they must destroy freedom." Karl Popper (2002, 462). Photo credit: AP Photo/Alex Brandon, as posted by Collinson (2020).*

Popper identified the destructive nature of revolutions in his criticism of the doctrine of Marxism (which doctrine, unbelievably, despite the well-known death toll of millions, still inspires social-justice warriors today). He wrote (2002, 462):

> I shall not here discuss the problem of the humanitarian aims of Marxism. I find that there is a very great deal in these aims which I can accept. The hope of reducing misery and violence, and of increasing freedom, is one, I believe, which inspired Marx and many of his followers; it is a hope which inspires most of us.

Popper is careful to distinguish between the aims of Marxism --- the good intentions of Marxism, as it were --- and *the methods by which Marxists want to achieve these aims.* In other words, Popper did not fall prey to the trickery of the proxy. He continues:

> But I am convinced that these aims cannot be realized by revolutionary methods. On the contrary, I am convinced that revolutionary methods can only make things worse --- that they will increase unnecessary suffering; that they will lead to more and more violence; and that they must destroy freedom.
>
> This becomes clear when we realize that a revolution always destroys the institutional and traditional framework of society.

--- e.g. burning down government buildings and businesses, or "push[ing] for change today," not tomorrow, as gymshark said ---

> It must thereby endanger the very set of values for the realization of which it has been undertaken.

If doing good, let alone causing a revolution, is not the answer, that creates a third, new problem for us: what *should* we do? The answer: *piecemeal* error correction and problem-solving. As Taleb (2017) suggests: stop virtue signaling and *start a business*. It's so safe and easy to signal a virtue with which everyone around you already agrees. "The best virtue requires courage," Taleb writes --- "accordingly it needs to be unpopular." I agree. And I should add another suggestion: instead of following causes, *follow your interests.* A mind preoccupied with causes is a mind devoid of purpose. It is a mind floating lazily in a sea of virtues, surviving only by drifting wherever the tide washes it. A mind driven by *interests* and self-generated *purpose*, on the other hand, is like a strong swimmer who will swim against the tide when that is what it takes to follow his interests.

Purpose and interests are determined by the problems you want to solve. Create or identify your interests and then, optionally, identify *shared* interests --- they indicate what Deutsch has called "shared problems." (2019) Following one's interests is compatible with Taleb's advice to start a business because, once you have found shared interests, you can start a business that sells solutions to those with whom you share problems, thereby *happening* to make the world a little bit better, one day at a time. No grand solutions, no utopian dreams: piecemeal, realistic problem-solving. And you get to live by your interests, not by what some meme proxy says you should do. Value and improvements are created by businesses through trade, not by political agendas, and least of all by social-justice warriors.

Understanding how certain memes spread can be done through a meta-analysis of types of memes without referring to their specific contents. (That applies to racist memes as well, so social-justice warriors should take an interest in meme theory.) In other words, the question "why does person x hold idea y?" can be answered roughly by answering the question "why is idea y good at spreading?". Memes are also criticizable based on their replication strategy alone whenever we have good explanations of how and why their replication strategy leads to violence or other negatives. I suspect those who are unwilling to entertain meta-analyses of memes will have a hard time correcting errors in their thinking. And I conjecture those who consider looting stores and burning down buildings a warranted response to the aforementioned death do not perform such meta-analyses.

You can criticize social-justice warriors without supporting racism. You can criticize communism without espousing poverty. You can oppose feminism without hating women. You can oppose violent protests without condoning police brutality. Etc. People need to realize this and identify meme proxies. Do black lives matter? Should we oppose fascists? Should we fight poverty? To all of these questions, we may be tempted to reply, "*obviously*, yes." I agree we should reply, "yes." But we should not reply "obviously," for the "truth is hard to come by" (Popper 2002, 502), and the opposite idea --- that it is self-evident --- has led to much suffering and violence. Beware of meme proxies associating with a good idea to gain traction, initially just surrounding the true core of it, then growing around it until they suffocate that core and it disappears almost entirely. In some cases, it does, and may even be inverted. We see this inversion in how the supposed anti-racists have become racist against white people, and in how those trying to help the poor push them further into poverty by opposing wealth inequality.

A remaining problem this essay does not solve is how to successfully persuade someone infected with proxies to adopt an idea which opposes those proxies. I have a hunch this can be done by convincing him of a seemingly unrelated idea. It must seem unrelated so that it can pass the proxy guards. If he later discovers the idea is in conflict with the proxies he harbors, he can then resolve the conflict in favor of the new idea, thereby discarding the proxies. For now, this is just a rough conjecture. In a time of increased political division and violence, it would be good to know how to do this.

In any case --- because bad ideas like to hide in the shade of good intentions, I have developed a knee-jerk suspicion toward anyone doing things "for good" or "for the right reasons," especially when advertised. I suggest you do the same.

PS: By the way, how many of those who, only weeks ago, wanted to force businesses to close and people to stay home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are now among those huddling up to protest, thereby further spreading the virus? And how many pressured us to stay home, only to drop that demand immediately in favor of encouraging everyone to go protest? Both things are about forcing people to do what's "right," so I expect a significant overlap between advocates of either one. Would they explain this contradiction by saying the evil of racism is greater than the evil of the virus, and, therefore, forceful efforts designed to address the former must, when in conflict, override those designed to address the latter?

# The Neo-Darwinian Theory of the Mind

*This article was first published with [Conjecture Magazine](https://medium.com/conjecture-magazine/the-neo-darwinian-theory-of-the-mind-d84c0bcc6485?source=friends_link&sk=833a1ac51009d680ed948428dbabd460).*

The age-old question of how the mind works is a fascinating one. Yet researchers have been ignoring it strategically in the hopes of achieving AGI (artificial general intelligence) through an ever larger repertoire of tricks (Deutsch 2012). But there is no way around *explaining* intelligence if we want to program it.

Here, I take the challenge head-on with what I call *the neo-Darwinian theory of the mind*. It simply states that minds create new knowledge through the neo-Darwinian evolution of self-replicating ideas. It builds on philosopher Karl Popper's guess that knowledge evolves through alternating conjecture and criticism (1983), but considers that a rather high-level explanation of a richer, underlying phenomenon. It solves several open problems in Popperian epistemology in addition to some others, such as how people evolved, how memory works, what it means to believe one thing rather than another, and why we are conscious of some phenomena and not others. Last but not least, it upholds and strengthens the Popperian notion that what's central to the mind --- the thing intelligence researchers have been bending over backward to ignore for the past 70 years --- is *knowledge creation*.

Neo-Darwinism in general starts with a remarkably simple core concept --- *replication* --- yet it is rich in implications.

The first implication is that if you start with a single self-replicating *something*---anything, it need not be biological---pretty soon, you will have a population of them. I will call that something an *instance* of a *replicator.* A single instance creates another, each of which repeats this process, and so on. One turns into two, then four, eight, etc.

The second implication is that, because the world is messy and mistakes are inevitable, an instance of even the best replicator will eventually make a mistake during replication. That mistake changes the information the replica contains compared to the original. This change --- a *mutation* --- is inherited by all of its offspring (if it manages to replicate further). Mutations introduce *variations*. A mutated instance is called a *variant*. Usually, a mutation impedes any replicator's ability to spread. Why? Because the replicator is already *adapted* to spreading, meaning any slight change would lessen its ability to do so (compare Paley's remarks on adaptation, 1813). Also, keep in mind that mutations are accidental. A good replicator prevents them from happening.

Sometimes, however, a mistake can be *beneficial*. Beneficial for what? For the replicator's ability to spread. That is its primary concern. Remember this crucial point, as many people tend to think of biological evolution in particular as optimizing "the good of the individual organism" or even "the good of the species." Neither is the case (compare Dawkins 2016 and Deutsch 2012). Evolution does not optimize anything --- it merely favors good replicators. That's it. In biological evolution, that replicator is the gene, not an organism, nor any group of organisms (Dawkins 2016).

*The primary reason this peacock has a colorful tail is that its genes were able to spread through the gene pool because they happened to code for colorful tails.

The third implication is that better replicators will spread through the population. This fact may sound tautologically true, and neo-Darwinism has repeatedly gotten a bad rap for it. It doesn't matter. This fact --- that better replicators will spread through the population --- is the most critical thing you can realize not just about biological evolution, but also about meme evolution and the evolution of ideas in a mind. I will get to those other types of evolution a bit later. For now, just know that it's that simple: better replicators will spread through the population at the expense of their rivals. Worse replicators will fall behind. We call these differences in the rate of replication *selection* (Dawkins 2016). Selection can result from competition, predation, mutations, changes in the environment, etc.

The fourth implication is that because of this repeating interplay of variation and selection, complex adaptations can emerge, and replicators can gain abilities beyond mere replication. Each adaptation will always be in the service of the primary purpose: replication (otherwise, it would not have been selected). Still, sometimes adaptations are complex enough to have sub-purposes that distract from this primary purpose. (Remember this below when I discuss the question of why we believe some things and not others.)

An age-old example of a curious adaptation that doesn't serve any apparent purpose is the peacock's tail. Why do peacocks have such beautiful and conspicuous tails? We could conjecture that it's because their feathers are pigmented (WebExhibits n.d.), or because they "impress the opposite sex" (Peacock 2014 --- yes, if you can believe it, the author's name is Peacock *and* she wrote about peacocks), or whatever. These reasons are true, but they do not get at the heart of the matter. The primary reason is the same not just for peacocks' tails, but also for why baboons have such prominent butts, why birds can fly, why bats hang upside down, and any other arbitrary trait: *it happened to help the organism's genes spread through the population at the expense of their rivals.* I say "happened" because adaptations are not planned. Peacock genes that happened to code for slightly more colorful tails spread better through the population (i.e., gene pool) than those that didn't. Baboon genes that happened to code for slightly more prominent butts spread better through the population than those that didn't. Etc. Generally speaking: the reason any arbitrary trait *x* exists in some organism *y* is that genes that happened to code for slightly more of *x* in *y* spread better through the population than those that didn't.

*Most variants don't have what it takes to spread through the pool of replicators. But sometimes, a mutation causes a variant to spread --- like this genetic mutation resulting in white peacocks.

What does all of this have to do with the mind? Popper discovered that human knowledge evolves (1983). In other words, evolution as a phenomenon is not limited to the biosphere; it also explains how people create new knowledge. (Dawkins later added that evolution also explains how ideas change and spread *between* people (2016). He calls such ideas *memes*.) Popper offered a strict analogy between genetic mutations and conjectures on one hand and natural selection and criticism on the other. His explanation was a huge epistemological breakthrough. That's why[ I have called](https://soundcloud.com/doexplain/11-a-window-on-intelligence-with-dennis-hackethal) (2020b) Popper the foremost AGI researcher of his time, even though he wouldn't have called himself that.

Popper's epistemology is *problem-driven*. He argued that we create knowledge by conjecturing solutions to problems, then criticizing them, and finally adopting them tentatively if we fail to criticize them. He considered the quest for certainty and the notion that we should try to confirm our theories justificationist mistakes.

I think he was correct about all of these things. Nonetheless, there are open problems with Popperian epistemology.

First, where do conjectures come from? They have the appearance of design (compare Paley 1813 and Hackethal 2020a), and so we need to explain their emergence as the result of evolution. Therefore, saying that human knowledge evolves using conjecture and criticism just kicks the can down the road, for, conjectures are themselves a product of the evolution that happens in a mind. (The same is true for criticism, as it is conjectural as well and also has the appearance of design.)

Second, Popper's evolutionary model lacks the neo-Darwinian notion of a replicator. There may be a historical reason for this: he started developing his theories before the modern synthesis of neo-Darwinism was completed and before the discovery of DNA. That discovery was the first of a physical instance of a replicator (although it was known from theory beforehand). It wasn't until the modern synthesis that the importance of replication was widely recognized. I have not read *all* of Popper's books, but as far as I am aware, he did not introduce replication into his theory of human knowledge. (There has been an ongoing, friendly point of contention between the intelligence researcher Ella Hoeppner and me about the role of replication in any theory of evolution. Citing Donald Campbell's evolutionary epistemology, she argues that replication *can* drive evolution, but is not *necessary*. All that's needed, she argues, is variation and selective retention. I am agnostic on the question of *necessity* and think that *if* we introduce replication in a mind, we can explain a great many things that we couldn't (at least not as well and as easily) without it. Hoeppner and I discussed this topic in more detail [on my podcast](https://soundcloud.com/dchacke/15-theories-of-agi) (Hoeppner 2020).)

Third, some other problems aren't directly related to Popperian epistemology but are nonetheless fascinating and in dire need of solving. Some of them relate to memory. For example: why do we remember some things but not others? Why do some people remember some things better than others? Why do some memories last longer than others? Why are they so notoriously unreliable? Further open problems relate to the question of beliefs: why do some people believe some things over others? Why is it easier to convince one person of idea *x* than it is another? (Popperian readers may recognize that the issue of "beliefs," and especially "reasons for belief," is foreign to Popperian epistemology --- for good reasons, as they pave the way to justificationism. I do not intend to reinstate the traditionally important but undeserved and justificationist role of beliefs --- instead, I want to understand why some people hold some ideas dearer than others. That's all I mean by "belief.")

To solve these problems, I propose the following conjecture: the mind contains an arena of *self-replicating ideas*. This conjecture is at the heart of my theory.

When we hear "replicating ideas," we may immediately think of memes (Dawkins 2016), but they are not what I mean. Memes are ideas that spread *between* people. I am concerned here only with the dynamics *within* a single mind. The neo-Darwinian theory of the mind is not about meme evolution (though, like any theory of creativity, it does lay the groundwork for explaining how complex memes can spread between people at all: it takes creative minds to do that).

We start with the same, simple concept at the core of neo-Darwinism: replication. Then we apply its implications to the mind.

First, one self-replicating idea will generate a pool of ideas in a mind: an "idea pool." (Since a single such idea is sufficient to do so, of all the inborn ideas we have, perhaps only one of them self-replicates.)

Second, because the mind is messy and mistakes are inevitable, sooner or later, an idea will make a mistake during replication: a mutation occurs. This mutation results in a variant idea. Usually, the variant will have a harder time spreading than the original. But now and then, the variant is better at spreading.

Third, ideas that are better at spreading will spread through the mind's idea pool. There will be selection because some are better at spreading than others.

Fourth, because of the repeating interplay of variation and selection, complex adaptations can emerge, and ideas can gain abilities beyond mere replication. Such adaptations do not necessarily benefit the mind: evolution, as always, merely favors better replicators.

I believe it's truly as simple as that. We can now solve the problems mentioned above:

*Where do conjectures come from?* They are newly-evolved variants of ideas.

*Why do we remember some things but not others?* Because some ideas are better replicators. Memories are not some distinct type of idea. They are simply self-replicating ideas of high longevity and relatively high copying fidelity. In other words, they manage to stick around for longer than most other ideas in the mind, and they manage to stay more or less the same for longer periods. Ideas that have these characteristics are the ones we call "memories."

*Why do some people remember some things better than others?* Let's say a husband and wife both remember their last vacation generally, but the wife remembers many more details. Why? Because her mind happens to be a suitable environment for the ideas encoding those details --- meaning they can spread through her mind relatively smoothly --- whereas her husband's mind is not.

*Why do some memories last longer than others?* Because some replicators --- and this is true of any replicator, not just ideas --- are longer-lived than others. (However, I suspect that any particular *instance* of that replicator is usually pretty young. For example, if you are 30 and remembering something that happened when you were three, that particular instance of the idea encoding the event is not 27 years old --- it may only be a few seconds old!)

*Why are memories so notoriously unreliable?* Because even the best and most consistent replicator won't stay consistent forever. Mistakes are made eventually during replication. The same holds for ideas in a mind.

*Why do some people believe some things over others?* Because some ideas spread through their minds better than others.

*Why is it easier to convince one person of idea x than it is another?* Because one person's mind makes it easier for idea *x* to spread through it than another person's.

You may have noticed that questions of belief/conviction have very similar answers as those related to memory. That's because memories are just long-held beliefs: long-lived self-replicating ideas. While there are significant differences between biological and mental evolution, the neo-Darwinian theory of the mind has a strongly unifying character generally.

As I said before, one answer to the question "why do peacocks have such colorful tails?" is "because their feathers are pigmented." That answer is correct but misses the point and the central role of replication: again, peacocks have colorful tails because those genes that happened to code for slightly more colorful tails were better able to spread through the gene pool. The primary explanation involves replication, even if we may be tempted to forget that. Observe the same phenomenon when you ask people why they think some idea is true. If you ask someone "how come you think you were born in 1960," they will almost certainly answer along the lines of "because I really was born in 1960," or "because it says so on my birth certificate," or "because my parents told me so." All of these things may be true, but the *primary* reason he thinks he was born in 1960 is that the idea encoding this information managed to spread through his mind. Yet he will never give that as the reason.

The same holds for opinions as well. Let's say Charlotte believes that people should pay their taxes. Why? If we ask her, her answer will invariably relate to why people should, in her opinion, pay taxes, not *why she believes* they should. To most, there is no difference between these two questions, yet this difference is crucial if we want to begin to understand the mind. She may respond that taxes are a great way to help the poor. Or that "transferring" money from the rich to the poor is a moral imperative. Or that we need to finance the government somehow. Or that everybody has to pitch in and do their part. Whether these statements are morally or factually correct is not at issue here --- just note that she will never mention the primary reason: that those ideas have spread through her mind at the expense of their rivals. It is the primary reason anyone holds any arbitrary belief in mental evolution, just like it is the primary reason any organism has any arbitrary trait in biological evolution. Yet it will never occur to her. That is why I said earlier that the phenomenon of complex sub-purposes of adaptations distracting from the primary purpose plays an important role in the mind as well.

But why exactly will the primary reason not occur to Charlotte? I think it's because she does not *know* how her mind works. None of us do. That's the thing we are trying to explain here. And the vast majority of mental activities seem to happen subconsciously. We are *unaware* of the millions and millions of variants of self-replicating ideas in our minds, some collaborating, some competing, and we are *unaware* of the replication that occurs there. But we know of all of these things from theory.

*The human mind trying to understand itself: that's all epistemology is. Photo by [Jr Korpa](https://unsplash.com/@korpa?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

Awareness brings us to the question of consciousness. It is perhaps the single most fascinating and mysterious phenomenon in the universe yet. Popper (1983) conjectured it has to do with *disappointed expectations*: we often do not even know we had a particular expectation until it is disappointed. For example, if you go up a flight of stairs and reach the end, thinking there is one more step, you will become acutely aware that there isn't one and of your disappointed expectation. More broadly speaking, consciousness seems to have to do with *error correction*. (Error correction generally plays a central role in Popperian epistemology, not just when it comes to consciousness.) I have given the example (2020c) of learning to ride a bike as a child. Initially, you are acutely aware of every little movement you make: steering, keeping your balance, pedaling, etc. The process may be a bit overwhelming at first. Your mind evolves many new ideas for how to develop this new skill. Most of them won't do the trick, but some variants happen to improve your abilities. Over many iterations, your ideas about how to ride a bike further improve. And as they do --- i.e., as you correct errors --- you become *less aware* of riding your bike. After riding thousands of miles, you won't even know anymore *how* you do it. You just *do it*.

I believe disappointed expectations will play an essential role in any good upcoming explanation of consciousness, but they do not strike me as sufficient (or even necessary). Whenever you sit down, close your eyes, and observe the thoughts that pop into consciousness, not all of them have to do with disappointed expectations. Some of them are merely memories, for example. However, we *do* know that all of them are *ideas* --- be they descriptive, argumentative, or explanatory --- and they all have the appearance of design. We never seem to be aware of any "junk" ideas, although our minds must contain many of them at any given moment because of imperfect replication. Therefore, I conjecture that a necessary condition for something to pop into consciousness is that it be sufficiently --- by some yet-to-be-determined criterion --- adapted.

Maybe part of a mind is like a brewing soup of ideas, some of which manage to bubble up here and there. Those may be our conscious thoughts. When competition between ideas is especially fierce, and the soup goes through some turbulent times, it "boils," and many ideas bubble up to the top, demanding urgent attention and occupying our thoughts. Maybe further development of this theory would explain anxiety.

Perhaps consciousness takes *snapshots* of the soup to examine ideas that have bubbled up far enough. Or perhaps it only ever looks at a single instance of an idea at a time. That could be why we are not aware of replication.

I hinted above that the neo-Darwinian theory of the mind sheds light on how people evolved. For more on that, read [my book](https://www.windowonintelligence.com/) (2020c), which contains a much more detailed account of the theory generally. Here I will only mention briefly that the explanation involves something very similar to the [RNA-World Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world) occurring in a single one of our ancestors' minds. I conjecture that a genetic mutation resulted in a self-replicating idea in that ancestor's mind. Once he invoked that idea, it replicated and created an idea pool, which kickstarted the first instance of mental evolution.

The theory is incomplete because it doesn't explain consciousness. I suggest that as the next problem to work on. I conjecture that consciousness is software that can be written like any other software and that, due to computational universality, it can run on any existing universal computer. But whatever the case, we will need the neo-Darwinian theory of the mind --- or something like it --- to explain the mind and build AGI.

Only time (and criticism) will tell whether there is something to this theory. As a solution to the problems I laid out above, I think it works well. All I am doing is taking neo-Darwinism seriously. And all I ask is that you do the same --- and help the theory spread.

# Anyone Can Become a Developer — Here’s How I Did It

![Image for post](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/img/1_dhUaNFsYJMVV2d9m6wd2Qw.jpg)

*Photo by [Joshua Aragon](https://unsplash.com/@goshua13?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/code?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

I happened upon coding through nothing more than a happy accident. It was in late 2010 that I wrote my very first line of code during an internship. That internship was at a bank, in a field not at all related to software engineering. At the time, I didn't even know I would be interested in coding. I was interested in finance. But my manager showed me some tricks to automate workflows in Excel and Outlook using what's called a *macro*. Macros are small programs you write an embed in your spreadsheet or email client to make your life a little easier. I believe the very first macro I wrote must have been roughly ten lines of code. It merely added a button to my manager's Outlook interface to move the selected emails to a predetermined folder. In the words of Jamie Foxx: ["It was easy, it was simple, it was cool."](https://youtu.be/XRFW5MUwehc?t=86)

Writing the macro and seeing my manager use it were both magical for me. I had built something with my hands, and it helped someone. I could instruct a computer to do stuff for me! I realized that if I learned how to write more such code, there would be no limit to how much I could achieve. It felt like a superpower. A few weeks later, while my manager was on vacation, I found myself browsing the company's books24x7 account. (I'm pleased to discover that their [login page](http://web.archive.org/web/20200801071651/https://library.books24x7.com/login.asp?ic=0) hasn't changed in all these years!) It was there that I stumbled upon the book [*HTML For Dummies*](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-Dummies-Ed-Tittel/dp/076450214X). This book was my first real step into the world of programming. Something I especially liked about learning HTML was that I could see visible results on my screen. It was learning by doing, and there was *immediate* feedback to see the changes I was making. It allowed for *rapid error correction* and thereby made learning faster and easier.

I was hooked. There I was, making real progress, quickly, by myself, on my own time. That progress did not depend on what any supervisor let me do. It was completely self-determined. First, I learned about the different HTML elements, how to put them together in a hierarchy, how to generate a webpage's layout, and how to put text on a screen. Next, I wanted to make things prettier, so I learned about a language called CSS. Then I wanted things to happen programmatically on the page, so I learned about JavaScript. Then I wanted to know how to build servers, so I learned PHP. I took baby steps, but I took them rapidly. My process was guided by the problems I encountered, and as I solved them, my knowledge grew. Everything I needed was right there in front of me. It all happened organically, and I was in flow. It was easy, it was simple, it was cool.

After my internship was over, though I was still interested in finance, I also wanted to keep learning how to code. I thought college could help me with both, so I enrolled in a finance and computer science degree. I was wrong. College was probably among the least creative times in my life. Instead of working on the problems I was interested in, I was told which problems to work on. One cannot learn in such an environment. I kept teaching myself how to code on the side. A friend of mine was starting an ebook-publishing company and needed an online e-reader page. He and his co-founder hired me to build it for some $500. I think that was in early 2012. It was my very first gig as a programmer, and I cannot describe how empowering it was having made money from a skill I had taught myself.

After a few months, I googled "freelancing online" on a whim and found a site called elance.com (now [upwork.com](http://upwork.com/)). I signed up and quickly found my first clients. We built rapport, and some of them became repeat clients. Within a few months, I made enough to pay the bills. A couple of months after that, I was able to put money aside into a savings account. There was no end in sight. If college was meant to teach me the skills I needed to make money, and I had already learned those skills, what did I need college for? Why should I wait for another three years before I could make money doing what I already loved doing? And why on Earth would I wait for someone else to approve of my skills by handing me a certificate? I already knew I could do the job.

Almost everyone at the time discouraged me from dropping out, but I did so anyway. I haven't looked back. I lasted two semesters, and I should have dropped out after the first one.

One of the secrets to my financial success was that I lived well below what I could afford. You don't always have a steady income as a freelancer, so you need to be prepared for less busy times. I shared an apartment with two roommates and lived in a tiny room for roughly $300 a month. Adding groceries to that made for maybe $700 of expenses each month. I charged $50 an hour at the time, so I knew I could pay my entire month's bills as long as I worked a long day or two. That made my business easy to sustain. Except for some slow weeks, I made money almost every day --- and on the few days I didn't, I still spent all day on the computer, learning new things and improving my skills. I discovered an exciting treasure chest of knowledge called StackOverflow. And what was this thing called GitHub? Ruby on Rails? The world of opportunities was infinitely big. I was my boss, and I was on my schedule. I loved working long nights, listening to the Inception soundtrack, fueled by midnight Nutella toast.

I remember trembling with excitement when I first deployed a website I had built using a tool called Heroku. I could create anything I wanted and put it online for free and all the world to see instantaneously! It was easy, it was simple, it was cool.

Within a few months, I was on the Elance homepage, celebrated as one of their most successful freelancers. I attribute part of my success to the following: *I never doubted myself*. Whenever a prospective client explained what he needed and asked me, "can you build this?", even when I didn't quite know yet *how* to build it, I always emphatically replied, "yes!". Once I committed, I had to figure out how to do it --- and I always figured it out.

Through networking in college --- probably the only good thing that came out of college for me --- I made some friends who wanted to start a company. I joined them as CTO and co-founder and built the company's entire tech product and infrastructure from scratch. I had only been writing code for a year and a half at that time --- what employer would let you do that? After a couple of years, I left the company and started freelancing again. Fast forward another year or two, a hiring manager from Apple reached out to me on LinkedIn. Two years into the job, in 2017, I was promoted to independent contributor level 4 out of 5. Most people retire at that level.

And the rest is history. I really do believe anyone can be a developer. Contrary to stereotypes, coding doesn't require genius. It just requires some fascination and tenacity. I'm by no means a genius, I just love the craft.

To recap, if you want to make it as a developer, I suggest the following:

-   Initially, keep your monthly expenses as low as possible without compromising your quality of life. Ideally, you can pay your monthly bills after a day or two of work. This point is especially crucial if you start as a freelancer.
-   Learn, learn, learn. Always keep a beginner mindset. There are infinitely many things to learn in this rapidly evolving industry, and you will always be a beginner.
-   Do not let people dissuade you from pursuing your goals. They will try to convince you to take "the safe route." But the safe route isn't safe if it requires giving up on your passions and dreams. Don't fall for that.
-   Believe in your ability to figure things out. Say yes to jobs and problems you haven't solved before.

# The Tragedy of Children Becoming Teachers

It is one thing when a young mind, after some twelve years of forced indoctrination, voluntarily decides to continue the slavery in college and beyond. But it is quite another to then inflict the horror on the next generation.

Here's a conversation I had recently with a young school teacher. Let's call her Beth.

**Beth:** I was a demon child in Kindergarten. Biting, hitting, spitting, calling kids buttholes...\
**Dennis:** And now you're a teacher. The system defeated you :(\
**B:** Haha now I get a taste of my own medicine!\
**D:** I'm curious, why did you become a teacher?\
**B:** I've always loved working with kids and just making that connection! But also I think I didn't have a great experience with some teachers (probably cause I was a terror 😂) and just thought that I could try and provide a better relationship with kids who struggle?? Like I never really liked school when I was younger haha\
**D:** What do kids mostly struggle with in school?\
**B:** Well last years struggle was mostly around behaviors. This year..looks quite different with everything being online haha.\
I would say most of them are on grade level. Usually two or three are struggling academically\
**D:** What kinds of behaviors do you mean?\
**B:** Hmm one last year was more extreme, he would get physical when he got angry. But just maybe talking in class, not following direction, bullying other kids..things like that\
**D:** Hmmm. Have you considered what the root cause of those behaviors might be?\
**B:** Hmm..which one?\
The one who would get physical was actually one of my favorite students. He was so sweet and amazing in the classroom. But was very into football and would get too competitive. I think that he puts a lot of pressure on himself be the best and if he doesn't win he doesn't know how to take it..it's ok to feel angry but just needs to learn how to react to those feelings more appropriately..but I also think some things were going on at home with the parents.\
**D:** All of them, actually.\
**B:** Being completely honest? I think not all but a lot of it sometimes comes from what they get away with at home\
**D:** I see. What do you think they "get away with" at home?\
**B:** Haha gosh you're making me think hard right now! I'm thinking more than getting away with stuff they get what they want. Sometimes if there's some issue at school parents don't really believe us lol. Idk what do you think it could be?\
**D:** Could it be that those kids don't want to be in school?\
**B:** Hmm possible. Never asked that one before.\
**D:** And could it be that you were a "demon child" in school because you also didn't want to be there?

Never heard back from her.

# “The Brain Works in Mysterious Ways”

A friend sent me this site: [mymind.com](https://mymind.com/manifesto). It appears to be a smart note-taking tool, pre-launch.

I won't comment on their product as I haven't tried it. But let's evaluate what they wrote about the brain [here](https://mymind.com/manifesto) from a Popperian point of view.

I realize this is a marketing page and they're trying to entice prospective users. It's not meant as a philosophical position. But I think it's worth analyzing it as one because, whether they realize it or not, they're making *epistemological* claims.

> The brain works in mysterious ways. So mysterious, we know very little about it.

So far so good. Note, however, that for a company that calls itself "my *mind*," focusing on the brain is peculiar---the two are not at all the same and explaining one does not explain the other.

> What we do know is that it's like a sponge. Everything we experience is soaked up and stored in tiny cells.

Woah. Empiricism and reductionism in two sentences! "Everything we experience" is not "soaked up." We are not passive recipients of knowledge. We are its *active creators*. The real world really exists, but our experience of it is a virtual-reality rendering that we ourselves create through conjectures and refutations (see [David Deutsch's "The Beginning of Infinity" chapter 10](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359)).

> To think means to access these cells and make connections between bits of information.

Maybe thinking accesses cells on the hardware level, but that's not the point. The brain is a computer, so that's like saying "running a program on a computer accesses data stored in memory." Yes, but we already knew that, didn't we? So that doesn't tell us anything about the brain or the mind.

In this vein, I vaguely remember pop neuroscience memes saying something along the lines of "memories that are associated with each other are stored in nerves that physically connect." That's completely false---another reductionist mistake. Nerve cells may connect in the brain to get the basic functionality of the brain working on a low level. But ideas live on a different level of emergence---they can refer to each other without the neurons on which they're stored being physically connected.

> This happens in an instant, far beyond our conscious understanding.

It is true that there is much we don't know about how thinking works. Currently, that is---one day we'll understand it.

> Our brain is the most advanced machine in existence, but it can be equally unpredictable. Sometimes we can call to mind a specific memory from when we were children. Other times we can't, for the life of us, remember what outfit we wore yesterday.

Whether something is easy or hard to remember is not a property of hardware. It's a property of long-lived vs short-lived *ideas*.

> But what if we could upgrade our brain? What if we could collect the information around us -- what we see, what we read, what we hear, what inspires us -- and access it at any time?

This point is interesting as it seems to aspire to something like perfect memory. If my conjecture that [ideas in a mind replicate](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/2020/07/22/the-neo-darwinian-theory-of-the-mind.html) is correct, then mutations are inevitable. That does *not* mean that what they're going for couldn't be built---it just means that the information would need to be stored independently of the mind. Similar to how we store information in books and on the internet. The mind cannot store information reliably, but certain media can.

I'd love to see a product page that makes Popperian references to the mind. Until then, I'm afraid it's like David Deutsch says: ["As if Popper had never lived."](https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/1075833407547023360) :(

# Three Revolutionary Ideas

*This is a guest post by [Logan Chipkin](https://twitter.com/ChipkinLogan).*

Introduction
------------

So many ideas that we take for granted had once been considered revolutionary. Historically, common responses to founders of such ideas have been charges of heresy, ostracism, or death. Famously, [Socrates was sentenced to die for "corrupting the youth"](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html), which is a euphemism for his genius Socratic method. Effectively, Socrates was killed for popularizing the very idea of discourse --- a concept now so deeply ingrained in Western Civilization that it hums unexamined in the background, silently serving as the primordial soup from which all other new ideas emerge. And its earliest champion was killed over it.

Socrates is far from the only example. Nineteenth century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann received harsh criticism for using the conceptual atom in his theoretical work, and [it is thought that this contributed to his suicide at the age of 62](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2364235?journalCode=pto). He has since been vindicated, and the atom is widely accepted by scientists and laypeople alike.

There is no dearth of these tales. But if history is riddled with awesome ideas that are not appreciated until long after their origins, could there be such ideas floating about right now, under our noses?

There are. In fact, I can think of three ideas that are so deep, so potentially useful, and so paradigm-shifting that widespread acceptance of even one of them would transform civilization for the better. I musingly call these 'The Big Three': critical rationalism, praxeology, and constructor theory.

Critical rationalism
--------------------

Critical rationalism is our best theory of knowledge and how it can grow. The twentieth century philosopher Karl Popper spent his career developing and advocating for it across [books](http://strangebeautiful.com/other-texts/popper-logic-scientific-discovery.pdf), [essays](https://philpapers.org/rec/POPOKA), and [lectures](https://books.google.com/books/about/In_Search_of_a_Better_World.html?id=L33XSZE77OkC). The theory is concisely summarized in the title of a compendium of his essays: [*All Life is Problem Solving*](https://www.bookdepository.com/All-Life-is-Problem-Solving-Sir-Karl-Popper/9780415249928). As people, we face problems --- conflicts between ideas, to quote the physicist David Deutsch. This is true not only in science, but in our personal lives, in economics, and it's even true for both genes and creatures of the biosphere. The theory is as deep as it is wide --- critical rationalism applies anywhere in nature where knowledge can be found.

How do people solve problems? They *conjecture solutions*. For the scientist, this takes the form of creating explanations, or hypotheses, of some physical phenomenon. For the entrepreneur, this could be offering an original product to the market. For the gene, this could be a mutation that allows it to spread at the expense of its rivals (to be sure, *this* process is not conscious). Notice what these cases have in common --- something genuinely novel has entered Reality. Before Einstein's theory of general relativity, no one ever held the thought that "space-time tells matter how to move; matter tells space-time how to curve", to quote the physicist John Wheeler. Before the invention of the wheel, [there were no such objects in the entire Universe](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-salute-to-the-wheel-31805121/). And biology is well-known to create chemicals that do not exist anywhere else --- proteins, for example, can't be found in the dark oceans of the cosmos, and yet they abound on Earth, in the presence of life.

But if we are only ever guessing solutions to problems, how can we be sure of ourselves? *We can't*. Here was another stroke of genius by Popper. The quest for foundations, for certainty, was itself a mistake. In science, for example, even our most basic presumptions are forever tentative, forever liable to revision and improvement. We can never know how a new theory will change our worldview, and so no assumption is perfectly secure.

Typically, more than one solution is conjectured to solve a given problem. By the 1600s, for example, there were two rival explanations for the motion of falling objects: that of the ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, and that of the contemporary thinker, Galileo Galilei. Aristotle held that objects fell at a speed proportional to their weight, while Galileo conjectured that all objects fall at a uniform rate, independent of their weight. What to do in such a problem-situation in which more than one solution is offered? Popper explained that we *criticize* all candidate solutions. This step is itself a creative process, as our methods of criticism and criteria for what constitutes a good explanation are themselves ever-evolving and improving.

In science, the most salient form of criticism is the so-called crucial experiment. When two or more theories attempt to explain the same phenomenon, we conduct an experiment whose outcome contradicts the predictions made by all but one of the rival theories. In the case of Aristotle's and Galileo's explanations of falling objects, the test was straightforward --- drop objects of different weights from some height and record their time to impact. Famously, if only apocryphally, Galileo did just that by dropping balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Veracity of this tale aside, only Galileo's theory was in fact shown to be consistent with experimental outcomes. Aristotle's explanation of motion was banished from the scientific community and relegated to the history books.

And so critical rationalism holds that we conjecture as many solutions as we want, criticize all of them, and retain those that survive. Even after some scientific explanation survives scrutiny, *its* shortcomings are eventually exposed, and we must conjecture new solutions yet again. Galileo's theory was soon improved and brought into a much deeper explanatory framework by the seventeenth century physicist, Isaac Newton. And *Newton's* theory was further superseded in the early twentieth century by both quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of relativity. The scientific process is open-ended, as problems are latent in all of our theories, and we are forever trying to solve problems in our worldview, to resolve errors in our theories.

In general, the scientific method proceeds as follows: whatever our current understanding of the world is, it invariably contains gaps and misconceptions, and there are phenomena for which it cannot account. We then conjecture a *new* theory that resolves at least one such flaw in our worldview. We *criticize* that theory with all of the tools at our disposal, only one of which is experimentation. For example, we demand that the new theory is internally consistent, not arbitrary, and so on. A theory that fails those *criticisms* doesn't need to be corroborated by experimental evidence. Only when we have multiple candidate theories to explain the same phenomenon do we conduct the crucial experiment. Once we have criticized all available theories, we retain whichever have survived. But we then find ourselves in a new, deeper problem-situation, for even with our updated worldview, there remain gaps in our understanding of Reality --- some that would never have even been previously conceivable. The entire scientific scheme in the critical rationalist framework is shown in Figure 1.

![The entire scientific scheme in the critical rationalist framework](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/img/scientific-scheme.jpg)

*Figure 1. Diagrammatic representation of Popper's critical rationalism. Discover a problem/unexplained phenomenon, propose several potential theories/solutions (TS1, TS2, etc.), criticize all potential theories/solutions until one remains, eliminate errors/explain phenomenon by applying the surviving theory/solution, discover new problems (P21, P22, etc.), repeat.*

Many of the so-called crises in science today are a result of bad philosophy --- that is, of ignoring critical rationalism. In contrast to much of what is done in research, we cannot simply gather more data and hope to better understand Reality. Rather, we must *first* conjecture an explanation --- or several rival explanations --- and *then* criticize all such candidate theories. Data serves as a mode of criticism --- theories make different predictions about how the world ought to behave, and those theories whose predictions are inconsistent with data are said to be falsified, while those theories whose predictions are consistent with data are said to be corroborated. Moreover, it is logically impossible to 'go from data to theories', since interpreting a set of data is itself a theoretical act. So no amount of data-gathering can help us to solve problems absent some good explanation of what we expect to observe. Rival philosophies, such as empiricism --- which emphasizes only what we can observe --- and inductivism --- which claims that we proceed from observations to theories --- are false. So much effort is wasted by researchers and thinkers who are stuck in these mistaken frameworks.

So acceptance of critical rationalism would save many scientific fields that have stagnated in the last few decades, because researchers would reorient away from the overemphasized activity of *gathering data* towards the overlooked but fundamental activity of *explaining reality*.

Because critical rationalism shifts the emphasis from *data* to *problems* and *conjectured solutions*, the philosophy reaches far beyond science and into other important areas, such as how to live. A state of unhappiness is a *problem-situation*, and conjecturing explanations of why one is in such a state can inform a person as to what action to take. If the action still fails to resolve the problem, the person can conjecture yet another solution, and so on, in a trial-and-error fashion. A person continuously takes action in striving to go from problem-situation to better problem-situation. In fact, all of life takes this form, even if only implicitly.

Praxeology
----------

Economics was always destined to be treated differently than the hard sciences. Unlike physics and chemistry, in which the objects of study are predictable systems like stars, planets, and metals, economics is a science of people --- and people are themselves creative, and hence unpredictable even in principle. This is cause for concern only for those who think that the goal of science is *prediction*. But as we've seen, critical rationalism implies that the goal of science is rather to *solve problems in our worldview*, to *explain Reality*. Prediction, then, is merely a way of testing, of criticizing theories. So the fact that people are inherently unpredictable is no problem for the critical rationalist.

Nevertheless, the astonishing effectiveness with which physicists had been able to predict the motion of objects ranging in size and speed from bullets to planets made an impression on thinkers in other fields. And critical rationalism was only discovered in the last century, so scientists and philosophers alike were vulnerable to all sorts of misconceptions that Popper's ideas would eventually resolve. In the meantime, predictions, mathematics, and sensory experience were thought to be fundamental to all sciences.

But, following Popper, our goal is to explain Reality with whatever tools we have at our disposal. [The methods used by so-called Austrian economists are *a priori* and *deductive*](https://mises.org/library/economic-science-and-austrian-method) --- they begin with an axiom so self-evidently true that to deny it would entail a self-contradiction. They then proceed to deduce logical implications of that axiom. In this way, no experiment could contradict their conclusions, because they were founded and deduced by logic alone.*

The Austrian school of economics was founded by the Viennese Carl Menger with the publication of his 1871 book, [*Principles of Economics*](https://mises.org/library/principles-economics). Menger and a few others ushered in the 'marginal revolution' in economic thought, so-called because they recognized that goods are consumed 'at the margins', an idea that solved the diamond-water paradox. Why is water typically cheaper than diamonds, if the former is more fundamental to human survival? The first generation of Austrian economists realized that 'water as such' and 'diamonds as such' are never consumed by the economic actor. Rather, a person consumes *either* a unit of water *or* a unit of diamonds *at the margins* --- he purchases whatever he values the most at a particular moment in time, after all of his lower values have already been satisfied. So, even though water is more biologically necessary than are diamonds, if John has already satisfied his desire to hydrate, then the *next* purchase he may prefer is a unit of diamond, rather than *another* unit of water. People make choices *at the margins of their present scale of values*. Value, then, is not intrinsic in any scarce resource, but rather is in the eye of the economic beholder. This subjectivist approach to economics contradicted both Adam Smith's classical school and the nascent Marxist view.

But how could anyone be sure that Austrian economics is correct, and those rival theories false? In physics, we could conduct a crucial experiment, as had been done successfully many times by that point in history. Enter Ludwig von Mises, arguably the greatest economist of all-time. In his 1949 magnum opus, [*Human Action*](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0), Mises elegantly derived --- and *explained* --- the entire edifice of Austrian economics via *praxeology*, the science of human action.

Mises' praxeology begins with the irrefutable axiom that man acts purposefully (I welcome the reader to reject the axiom and notice what happens). It is astounding how many conclusions follow. For example, in acting purposefully, it is immediately implied that John has chosen to pursue end A rather than end B. Had end A been unavailable, John would have indeed pursued end B. In this way, the action axiom implies the scale of values mentioned above. Furthermore, pursuing end A requires the use of some *means*, which, because they are being directed towards end A, they *cannot* be directed towards other ends. In other words, man acts in a world of scarce means. Because *time* is a scarce resource, then, all else being equal, man prefers to satisfy his ends sooner rather than later. In this way, the concept of *time preference* is derived.

Mises goes on to apply this way of thinking to ever more complex scenarios, starting with one man alone on an island to a society with diverse individuals desiring a multitude of ends. Through this deductive approach, he shows how prices emerge, the role of profits and losses in an economy, and, crucially, the damaging effects of coercive intervention into an economy of free actors.

I am only scratching the surface of what Mises accomplished. From first principles, he not only built an entire edifice of economic thought, but he also provided the explanation for *why* this school, the Austrian school, is the only correct one. After Mises, the Austrian school and its praxeological methods were here to stay, even though they remain the object of dismissal or mockery by economists from other schools of thought who demand that economics be empirical.

Murray Rothbard took the baton from Mises and [continued developing Austrian economics](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market). He also applied it forcefully to politics, creating the legal philosophy of anarcho-capitalism. Libertarianism had been defended in various forms in the past, but no one had unified praxeology, morality, and the concept of private property so thoroughly. In doing so, Rothbard spawned his greatest brainchild --- a consistent and elegant defense of a society without government and any other violations of the so-called nonaggression principle.

What Mises and Rothbard have demonstrated is that understanding is not limited to experimentally testable explanations. The dogma that scientific theories must be mathematical, and must make predictions about how objects will behave, is false. And with respect to politics, Austrian economics suggests that no government intervention may possibly improve the overall standard of living of mankind, to put it mildly. The ideas of these great men have radical implications that can be summarized in nine words:

*You cannot coerce your way to a better world.*

Constructor theory
------------------

The last of the Big Three is the youngest but perhaps the most fundamental. Constructor theory is officially less than a decade old, if the clock starts with the publication of its [foundational paper in 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7439) by physicist David Deutsch.

As with most of our deepest theories in physics and elsewhere, constructor theory's beauty is in its simplicity. That's not to say that the details wouldn't take effort to understand, but it's not some impenetrable labyrinth of mathematics and jargon. You don't have to be an expert in physics or epistemology or anything else to understand the ideas behind and within constructor theory.

In what Deutsch calls the prevailing conception of physics, theories take the form of 'initial conditions plus laws of motion'. For example, Newton's physics, called classical mechanics, allows you to predict an object's *future* position and momentum (mass times velocity) as long as you know all of the forces acting on it, as well as its *current* position and momentum. As we've seen, the success of Newtonian physics and other physical theories to *predict* a system's behavior over time was so impressive that predictive ability became a standard by which future theories would be judged.

In the 1800s, the theory of electromagnetism, while explaining a different class of phenomena than did Newton's theory, also took the form of 'initial conditions plus laws of motion'. In this case, the motion of charged particles, such as electrons, could be predicted if one knew the forces acting on them, and again, their initial state.

Even with the advent of general relativity and quantum mechanics in the 20th century, this paradigm reigned supreme. Although the state of a system was no longer necessarily expressed in terms of its position and momentum, the theories were still cast in terms of trajectories over time. Even in the notoriously weird quantum mechanics, something called a wavefunction evolved predictably over time, given particular laws of motion for that wavefunction.

So theories were thought to be all about what *actually happens* in the world. To reiterate, given some state of the world at any point in time, a successful theory, it was thought, should predict (or retrodict) the state of the world at some other time. In this prevailing conception, a theory provides equations of motion that predict what *will* happen to some system, given some current state, or initial conditions, of this system. Whether this system is a ball rolling down a hill, or the entire universe itself, or a quantum wave function, the prevailing conception is all about predicting what *will* happen to the system in question.

But some of our deepest explanations simply don't conform to this prevailing conception. Consider the other two of The Big Three --- critical rationalism and praxeology. In neither case do we predict the future according to some equation coupled with data of initial conditions. And, funnily enough, as I'd mentioned, one of the criticisms of praxeology is that it does *not* employ such equations! But the point is that some of our deepest theories of Reality simply cannot be expressed in terms of the prevailing conception. If Reality is as unified and comprehensible as most scientists fully expect it to be, then there has to be a way of formally unifying those theories that do conform to the prevailing conception, such as the ones I'd mentioned earlier, with these other theories that cannot be put in terms that the prevailing conception can handle. Other examples of the latter, by the way, include evolution by natural selection and computation.

So if our worldview is ever going to encompass both the wildly successful theories that do conform to the prevailing conception, as well as all of our theories that explain higher level phenomena --- such as praxeology and critical rationalism --- then we need some new theory, one that provides a language in which we can express all of the theories in the prevailing conception, as well as our other theories. This theory, it turns out, is constructor theory.

A final preliminary note --- there is a host of principles that most working scientists accept, but that are only implicit and cannot be expressed in any of the prevailing conception's theories. The principle of testability, that a theory must be falsifiable, is one such example. Until constructor theory, people just took that as a methodological rule, a rule of how science ought to be done. But constructor theory naturally and elegantly makes this principle explicit. Another example that seems to hold true but that the prevailing conception has no room for is the so-called Turing Principle, which essentially states that it is possible to build a computer that can simulate any physical process.

These two principles, along with others, have no place in the prevailing conception, because they're not about initial conditions and predicting the future state of a system. In fact, they're about what's physically *possible* and what's *impossible*.

This leads us to the governing idea of constructor theory --- that is, all of the laws of physics can be expressed in terms of which transformations are possible and which transformations are impossible, and why.

So while theories that conform to the prevailing conception will tell you the trajectory of the state of a system according to some laws of motion and given some initial state of a system, constructor theory tells you which trajectories are *possible* according to that theory, which are *impossible*, and why. While in the prevailing conception, what matters is what *will* happen, constructor theory is all about what can be caused to happen in principle. What actually happens is only an emergent consequence of what can possibly happen.

As a brief example, in Einstein's famous theory of special relativity, no object with mass can travel faster than the speed of light. And so in the prevailing conception, you have some object and its initial velocity, and the equations of special relativity can tell us the object's velocity at any future point in time. In those equations, it turns out to be impossible for the object's velocity to ever exceed the speed of light in a vacuum.

In constructor theoretic terms, we can say that the object's velocity cannot be transformed into a velocity that's greater than the speed of light, or, equivalently, that transforming an object's speed into a speed that's greater than the speed of light in a vacuum is an *impossible task*.

In that example, we don't get much purchase by switching to constructor theoretic terms, because the prevailing conception already has a handle on the phenomenon at hand. But what about questions that we can ask about other aspects of Reality? For example, under what conditions is life possible, in principle? That certainly can't be answered by the prevailing conception. How about: what resources are required to build a universal computer --- a computer that can simulate any other computer? There's no way we can answer these questions in terms of initial conditions plus laws of motion, but we might be able to answer them in terms of possible and impossible transformations. For example, maybe it's impossible for life to emerge in the absence of a genetic code, or any other sort of code. Maybe that can be shown under constructor theory. Maybe constructor theory can also show exactly under what conditions a universal computer can be built.

There are all sorts of questions that one can ask once one understands the power of constructor theory. And notice that the theory brings in counterfactuals into fundamental physics. In other words, what's fundamental is not what *actually* happens, but rather what *could've been caused* to happen. So what's interesting about, say, a computer, is not that it runs a particular program, but that it could be caused to run other programs.

And since constructor theory can just as well account for theories in the prevailing conception, as I had briefly shown with my special relativity example, we see that the prevailing conception is really just a limiting case that allows for classes of phenomena that do conform to an 'initial condition plus laws of motion' kind of theory. Constructor theory allows for a much wider class of phenomena, including those that are unpredictable in principle, those that require counterfactuals to explain, and those that can't be explained by resorting to a reductionist framework, in which we explain greater, bigger, or more complex phenomena in terms of their constituent parts. All of this is possible because of the single genius idea that all of the laws of physics can be expressed in terms of transformations that are possible and transformations that are impossible, and why.

Constructor theory is several decades younger than the other two of the Big Three, and so many of its accomplishments remain to be discovered (but read [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02625), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5563), and [here](http://constructortheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ct-life.pdf) for scientific problems it has already solved). Still, constructor theory has many philosophical implications for our worldview, and even for our understanding of the role of people in the cosmos. Consider all of the transformations that are capable of being caused. Of those, only an extremely tiny minority occur 'naturally' --- there are few unique objects there are across the universe. Stars, planets, black holes, asteroids, and a whole lot of cold, dark, and empty.

Now consider what people have created in just the last few thousands of years. People have converted rocks into cathedrals. They've mixed the fiery energy of the sun with the guts of Earth itself to produce the orderly, purposeful devices that prevail in our digital age. They've turned wolves into dogs, trees into books, and metal into vehicles that fly through space. And the set of transformations that people are capable of causing is limited by what they *know* how to do. It follows, then, that both *people* and *knowledge* are fundamental in a constructor theoretic understanding of Reality --- only people are capable of causing any transformation capable of being caused, and their repertoire at any moment is limited by their *knowledge*.

Constructor theory also demands that we be philosophical optimists. Any problem that we face requires some transformation of our environment from the problematic state to an unproblematic state. But, as we've seen, people can render *any* transformation permitted by the Laws of Nature, so long as they acquire the requisite knowledge. It follows that any problem we face is necessarily solvable (see Deutsch's 2011 book, [The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359), for a longer discussion), it is just a matter of creatively discovering the solution.

Conclusion
----------

The Big Three are available for anyone to study. I have merely introduced them in this article. Each of them contains so much more than I've offered in these brief pages.

Widespread understanding of any of The Big Three would resolve so many errors in our collective consciousness. Taken together, The Big Three constitute a revolution in the making on par with any of those that came before. There are numerous connections between them, but that's for another essay. The curious reader might already be putting the pieces together.

Socrates himself could never have imagined that our understanding of Reality might deepen and unify to such an astonishing degree. Although we remain infinite in our ignorance, our knowledge is deeper than in any age past. And yet, here we are, sitting atop a goldmine of mind-bending explanations. Best get digging.

*An open problem is how praxeology can be said to be empirical, if it is deducible from logic alone. This is one of the ways in which The Big Three come together, but that is a story for another essay.

# Scientific American?

The first time I wondered how scientific *Scientific American* could be was when I noticed their cover story titled ["The New Science of Sex and Gender."](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-science-of-sex-and-gender/#) The editors published this article in September of 2017. I didn't read it then, but I made a mental note with the following prediction: there's not going to be any science whatsoever in that article, and they're going to be pandering to social-justice warriors.

After finishing the article just moments ago, I was right on both accounts. There is no science to be found in it---no problem to be solved, and no conjectured explanations to solve it.

And yet, the magazine managed to hit a new low with the editors' [official endorsement](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientific-american-endorses-joe-biden1/) of a presidential candidate on October 1st, 2020. To be clear, it's not so much about their choice. *It's that they endorse a---any---presidential candidate at all.*

It seems that until recently, they would have agreed with that. After all, the article's subtitle reads:

> ### We've never backed a presidential candidate in our 175-year history---until now.

And the first paragraph reads:

> *Scientific American* has never endorsed a presidential candidate in its 175-year history. This year we are compelled to do so. We do not do this lightly.

Why did *Scientific American* go 175 years without backing a presidential candidate? Because it would be (or should be) unprofessional and unethical for a scientific magazine to display a political bias.

They portray our times as so bad that the magazine had to drop its long-loved practice of remaining impartial. As if their awareness of how unusual it is for a scientific magazine to endorse a candidate made it okay. As if they had no choice. But of course, they do have a choice. What they don't have is a spine in the face of social-justice warriors spreading doomsday scenarios---the ability to resist the urge to jump on the political bandwagon.

> The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the U.S. and its people---because he rejects evidence and science.

As has been pointed out by Popperians over and over, the same evidence can be used to support an infinite number of conflicting theories. So evidence by itself cannot *show* anything. It can only be used as a transient factor to adjudicate between theories. Science is not "evidence-based." We don't gather evidence and then build theories on top of them. Theories decide what evidence to look for, which to ignore, and which to use to adjudicate between theories. The above quote is ironic because by displaying bad epistemology, *Scientific American* itself rejects science.

After listing some of Trump's alleged mistakes, the article continues:

> That is why we urge you to vote for Joe Biden, who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health, our economy and the environment.

There is the same epistemological mistake again---*fact-based* plans! They also haven't argued why it should be any government's responsibility to protect anyone's health, the economy, or "the environment." That's simply assumed. How scientific is it to make unargued claims?

> These and other proposals he has put forth can set the country back on course for a safer, more prosperous and more equitable future.

Calls for "equity" are dangerous. They are part of the latest fad of social-justice warriors. Saying the word "equitable" is no doubt a Chamberlainesque attempt to appease them. "Equity" is a codeword for equal outcomes, which can only be achieved through government-mandated regulation, theft, and violence. "Equity" is a deeply un-American idea because it goes against the pursuit of happiness and individual freedom. In a free society, people are different, and those differences are either celebrated as different achievements and skills or considered challenges that can be overcome through hard work. "Equity" can only be achieved through tyranny.

The article goes on to claim that European and Asian countries were able to recover and reopen businesses sooner through testing and tracing of infected people and that the "rebound" that happened in June in America could have been prevented by adopting those other countries' measures. If that is so, why is Europe going through another rebound right now, with cases rising in several countries, including Belgium, Italy, and Austria? The problem with lockdown policies, apart from their disgusting castration of people's freedom, is that they are unscientific because they are impossible to prove ineffective. When lockdowns are implemented and lifted again, only for another rebound to occur, lockdown advocates can always claim that the previous lockdown was not strict or long *enough*. On the other hand, should cases fall during or after a lockdown, advocates can claim that it was thanks to it. Whatever happens, advocates can always rescue their theory in support of lockdowns, and nobody learns anything. When a theory has this property, it fails Popper's test for being *scientific*, applying his criterion of demarcation. Isn't that something that a magazine that calls itself scientific should take seriously?

Bad epistemology of "fact-based" and "evidence-based" "science" makes *Scientific American* unscientific. The purpose of science isn't to gather evidence and build theories on top of them, let alone political theories or endorsements---it's to *explain the world*: impartially, no matter where the consequences of your theories take you (cf. Deutsch, "The Beginning of Infinity," chapter 1). And their support for the concept of equity makes them deeply un-American, too. By pandering to social-justice warriors and contributing to the moral panic they have been perpetrating, both words in *Scientific American*'s name have, sadly, become lies.

# What to Do in the Face of Corporate Wokeism

There has been a cancer growing in the West, and it's called Wokeism. The idea that "social justice" trumps everything, that everything must be viewed through the lens of race, gender, and sexual preferences. Social-justice warriors (SJWs) view society as a zero-sum game between the oppressors and the oppressed. They don't oppose oppression itself, they just want to reverse its direction. They agree with racists that the most important determinant of social interactions is (or should be) race. Dissenters are punished by being "canceled" and, in some cases, having their livelihoods destroyed.

SJWs are the perpetrators of this ideological crime. Rather than seeing the West as flawed but improvable, they see it as an evil, racist empire beyond redemption, and they demand it be brought down. They consider our institutions oppressive, our freedom a farce. They demand a revolution. The violent protests and looting across America are a token of what's to come if they are left unchecked. They are a threat to our freedom.

Unfortunately, it appears that many powerful companies have publicly spoken in support of the concept of "social justice" and associated organizations, such as "Black Lives Matter" (BLM). Tech in particular is infected. As someone working in tech, this saddens me. The industry has always been left-leaning, but it's never been as bad as it is now, with dozens of established companies and countless startups jumping on the social-justice bandwagon.

We are all users of tech, and many of us work in the industry. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the social cost for dissent is high, and the vast majority of people think alike, many are afraid to speak up. There is tremendous pressure to spread social-justice memes, or at least to acquiesce. Many companies are subjecting their employees to pseudo-scientific "sensitivity trainings" and "unconscious bias" trainings. Some investors make investment decisions based on race (and have admitted as much, such as Gumroad's founder Sahil Lavingia [here](https://twitter.com/shl/status/1291104973284159492) (archived [here](http://archive.vn/KzNXG))).

If you don't recognize the industry and are afraid to speak up, know that you are not alone. If you don't want your money going to socialist organizations, I have compiled a list of companies that support BLM and/or associated groups and ideas which can point you to alternatives so that a change requires as little sacrifice as possible. You can find that list at the bottom of this article.

If you are approached by recruiters for positions at such companies, you can politely but clearly turn the request down. I have turned down interview requests from several companies for potentially very lucrative roles, including Amazon. (That's not a brag; it's quite common for software engineers in the Bay Area to be approached several times a week.)

Here's a slightly modified version of what I wrote to an Amazon recruiter. I have adjusted it to make it generally applicable to your use case.

> It appears that [company name] has publicly spoken in support of the "Black Lives Matter" movement. Though I'm sure there are good intentions behind this, BLM is not what it seems to be---among other things, they are a revolutionary, anti-capitalist organization that threatens to take away some of our American liberties. It's rather ironic for a company to be supporting an anti-capitalist organization. I would have liked to pursue this role, but I would have to violate my integrity to work for [company name]. I cannot do that.

Practicing integrity, like practicing anything else, is difficult at first, but it gets easier over time. It's something I am practicing myself and want to get better at. An essay I found very helpful is [How Does One Lead a Rational Life in an Irrational Society?](https://courses.aynrand.org/works/how-does-one-lead-a-rational-life-in-an-irrational-society/) by Ayn Rand. It makes a convincing case for the necessity of moral judgment and contains the following gem:

> And then, on some gray, middle-aged morning, such a man realizes suddenly that he has betrayed all the values he had loved in his distant spring, and wonders how it happened, and slams his mind shut to the answer, by telling himself hastily that the fear he had felt in his worst, most shameful moments was right and that values have no chance in this world.

It's a bit ironic to publish a list like this because it's usually SJWs themselves who tell people what companies to avoid because they use plastic straws or something. Having said that, unlike SJWs, I won't think of people as evil or uncaring just because they continue to use the above companies' products.

To be clear, I don't think it's necessary to abandon all of these companies' products at once. It would be too difficult and you might be very tempted to go back to using them all after a few days or weeks. Some of them are easy to do, like going to Burger King instead of McDonald's, and searching on DuckDuckGo instead of Google. Start with that, and then see if you can make the switch for some other items on the list.

Nor do I think these companies have to be avoided forever. For example, if, after x years, a company hasn't spread any SJW memes or supported any related organizations, we might consider that a statute of limitations of sorts. If, on the other hand, any of them post a public retraction, I will likely resume using their products immediately.

I haven't made the switch for all of them, and I may never manage that, but for many, I have. I don't eat at those restaurants anymore, I don't use Google as a search engine anymore, I have moved most of my articles from Medium to this self-hosted blog, I have canceled Netflix, I have stopped using Airbnb, and I have canceled my Outsite membership.

Disclaimer: my search wasn't exhaustive, and I did it a couple of weeks ago. It's possible some of the companies have since retracted their statements or posted some new ones. To find out whether a company supports, say, BLM, you can do a DuckDuckGo search for "company name BLM" or "company name black lives matter." Likewise, social media is a good candidate. [Here's](https://twitter.com/search?q=(from%3A%40WordPress)%20black%20lives%20matter&src=typed_query) an example of how I checked WordPress's Twitter history for support of BLM, which, at the time of writing this article, turned up clean. [Here's](https://twitter.com/search?q=(from%3A%40podia)%20black%20lives%20matter&src=typed_query) an example of one of Gumroad's competitors, Podia, which turned up dirty. You can also check a company's Instagram account for pictures of black squares. Sometimes companies have whole arms of their business dedicated to "amplifying black voices." Sometimes it's just a tagline in their Twitter profile description. Sometimes it's the CEO speaking on behalf of the company. If the company sent you an email directly, it's easy. Etc.

# What to Do in the Face of Corporate Wokeism

There has been a cancer growing in the West, and it's called Wokeism. The idea that "social justice" trumps everything, that everything must be viewed through the lens of race, gender, and sexual preferences. Social-justice warriors (SJWs) view society as a zero-sum game between the oppressors and the oppressed. They don't oppose oppression itself, they just want to reverse its direction. They agree with racists that the most important determinant of social interactions is (or should be) race. Dissenters are punished by being "canceled" and, in some cases, having their livelihoods destroyed.

SJWs are the perpetrators of this ideological crime. Rather than seeing the West as flawed but improvable, they see it as an evil, racist empire beyond redemption, and they demand it be brought down. They consider our institutions oppressive, our freedom a farce. They demand a revolution. The violent protests and looting across America are a token of what's to come if they are left unchecked. They are a threat to our freedom.

Unfortunately, it appears that many powerful companies have publicly spoken in support of the concept of "social justice" and associated organizations, such as "Black Lives Matter" (BLM). Tech in particular is infected. As someone working in tech, this saddens me. The industry has always been left-leaning, but it's never been as bad as it is now, with dozens of established companies and countless startups jumping on the social-justice bandwagon.

We are all users of tech, and many of us work in the industry. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the social cost for dissent is high, and the vast majority of people think alike, many are afraid to speak up. There is tremendous pressure to spread social-justice memes, or at least to acquiesce. Many companies are subjecting their employees to pseudo-scientific "sensitivity trainings" and "unconscious bias" trainings. Some investors make investment decisions based on race (and have admitted as much, such as Gumroad's founder Sahil Lavingia [here](https://twitter.com/shl/status/1291104973284159492) (archived [here](http://archive.vn/KzNXG))).

If you don't recognize the industry and are afraid to speak up, know that you are not alone. If you don't want your money going to socialist organizations, I have compiled a list of companies that support BLM and/or associated groups and ideas which can point you to alternatives so that a change requires as little sacrifice as possible. You can find that list at the bottom of this article.

If you are approached by recruiters for positions at such companies, you can politely but clearly turn the request down. I have turned down interview requests from several companies for potentially very lucrative roles, including Amazon. (That's not a brag; it's quite common for software engineers in the Bay Area to be approached several times a week.)

Here's a slightly modified version of what I wrote to an Amazon recruiter. I have adjusted it to make it generally applicable to your use case.

> It appears that [company name] has publicly spoken in support of the "Black Lives Matter" movement. Though I'm sure there are good intentions behind this, BLM is not what it seems to be---among other things, they are a revolutionary, anti-capitalist organization that threatens to take away some of our American liberties. It's rather ironic for a company to be supporting an anti-capitalist organization. I would have liked to pursue this role, but I would have to violate my integrity to work for [company name]. I cannot do that.

If your employer wants you to attend a seminar about racism, refuse. If they don't accept that and you can afford it, quit. If your employer publicly endorses SJW memes, bring it up and ask them to post a retraction. If they don't, quit. If your colleagues casually agree with each other over lunch about how evil white and/or straight people are, disagree with them.

Practicing integrity, like practicing anything else, is difficult at first, but it gets easier over time. It's something I am practicing myself and want to get better at. An essay I found very helpful is [How Does One Lead a Rational Life in an Irrational Society?](https://courses.aynrand.org/works/how-does-one-lead-a-rational-life-in-an-irrational-society/) by Ayn Rand. It makes a convincing case for the necessity of moral judgment and contains the following gem:

> And then, on some gray, middle-aged morning, such a man realizes suddenly that he has betrayed all the values he had loved in his distant spring, and wonders how it happened, and slams his mind shut to the answer, by telling himself hastily that the fear he had felt in his worst, most shameful moments was right and that values have no chance in this world.

# Balinski and Young—beyond Elections

*Representativeness* is said to be a desirable feature of government. If candidate A gets only 20% of the votes, and candidate B gets 80%, surely candidate B should win. That intuitively makes sense. However, there are profound issues with the concept of representativeness. David Deutsch explores these issues in chapter 13 of his book [*The Beginning of Infinity*](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359/).

Deutsch explains that the *quota* is the exact number of seats a state should be assigned under strict proportionality. For example, if Congress has 100 seats (I'm simplifying here), and your state has 10% of the country's population, then the state should receive exactly 10 seats in Congress. *To stay within the quota* means that under a given apportionment rule, the number of seats assigned to the state never deviates more than one whole seat from the quota. Since the quota is rarely a whole number, it has to be rounded somehow. The rounding method is called the *apportionment rule*. With the above numbers, there is no need to round, but if, say, Congress instead had 105 seats, then your state's quota would be 10.5. The apportionment rule then has to either round that down to 10 or round it up to 11, all while trying to remain as representative as possible. The rule may take any information into account, but if it is *capable* of deviating from a state's quota by more than 1, it is said to "violate quota."

Consider the following example of a tricky election outcome, which example is thanks to Deutsch. Imagine a country of 4 states with a congress of 10 seats total, with the first state having just under 85% of the population, and the remaining states having just over 5 percent each. Recall that a representative apportionment rule must never deviate more than 1 seat from the quota. That means that the first state must receive either 8 or 9 seats. This could be achieved through an apportionment rule that says to simply round each state's quota to the nearest integer. It would assign 8, 1, 1, and 1 seats, bringing the total number of seats to 11---which, as Deutsch says, doesn't seem to be a big problem at first, until you realize that 85% of 11 is 9.35, not 8. So 85% of the population would be underrepresented in Congress. That apportionment rule violates quota.

As Deutsch points out, the problems resulting from apportionment rules always seem to merely require a quick fix---which is why he aptly describes them as "why don't they just..." suggestions. Why don't they just round to the nearest integer? Why don't they just add another seat to Congress? Etc. Depending on the apportionment rule, such ad-hoc fixes may temporarily work, but they will always fail in the long run.

Apportionment rules, despite being devised to improve representativeness, paradoxically lead to *less representative* and "unfair" outcomes. One such paradox is the *population paradox*. Deutsch explains that the population paradox is when, according to a given apportionment rule, a state whose population has grown since the last election loses seats to a state whose population has shrunk. It's a paradox because, although the given apportionment rule is designed to be as representative as possible, it has resulted in an outcome that's less representative. A state whose population has grown should---intuitively, at least---be awarded more seats.

There are other paradoxes, too. One is the [*Alabama paradox*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_paradox#Alabama_paradox), which is when an increase in the number of seats leads to a decrease in seats for one state. There is also the [*New-states paradox*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_paradox#New_states_paradox), which is when the addition of a new state leads to a reduction of seats for existing states. Why don't they just increase the number of seats accordingly? Because that can trigger the Alabama paradox.

According to the Wikipedia article explaining the above paradoxes, an apportionment rule may be free of the Alabama paradox. It may even be free of the population paradox. But Balinski and Young proved that whenever a rule stays within the quota, it *cannot* be free from the population paradox. In other words, to avoid the population paradox, a rule *must* violate quota.

Deutsch then explains that the purpose of elections is not to make government as representative as possible, and therefore such paradoxes are not as problematic as they seem. Instead, their purpose is to implement Popper's criterion of democracy by making it possible to remove bad leaders and policies without bloodshed. However, I want to linger on the concept of representativeness and apportionment paradoxes as they relate to ideas of so-called "social justice."

Social-justice warriors (SJWs) have long been calling for "diversity" and "representativeness" in the workplace. For example, when a company's workforce consists almost exclusively of white people, it is said to lack diversity and be unrepresentative of the general populace. Of course, those of us who are individualists and don't believe in group grievances already know that there is only one valid hiring strategy---qualification---and that it is no company's job to play the role of social do-gooder. But let's take SJWs' argument seriously and see if it leads to any contradictions.

I believe Balinski & Young's theorem can help us uncover the same paradoxes in this context. It reaches beyond elections. To see how, simply replace "state" with, say, "race," "Congress" with a company, and "seats" with, say, "number of employees."

In other words, instead of a state being allocated its "fair" share of seats in Congress, think of a group of people of the same race being allocated their "fair" share of jobs in a company. Applying our previous example to this thought experiment, instead of four states there would be four races, with one (say, white people) making up just under 85% of the population, and the remaining making up just over 5% each. Imagine a company with 10 employees total, whose CEO would be looking to (or, let's be honest, forced to) "make changes" to his workforce to make it more racially representative. The CEO can't hire 8.5 white people, so he'd need to round somehow. Under the same rule, he'd round down to 8 white people, and 1 of each remaining race---but his workforce is only 10 people strong, not 11! And if the CEO *did* hire an additional person, what race should *that person* be? And how would the company account for the vast majority of the population now being underrepresented in the workforce? Etc.

A company looking to employ an apportionment rule to have a workforce that's as representative as possible will eventually violate quota or be subject to the above paradoxes. That is still true if it is only parts of the company's workforce that are required to be "representative," such as the board of directors. The population paradox will result in one group of employees that belong to a race that has been growing in number in the general populace losing jobs to another race that has been shrinking. The Alabama paradox will lead to an employee of a certain race being fired when the company hires additional people---when the workforce grows in total number. The new-state paradox means that when a new category of race is added to the grievance catalog, existing hires of a certain race may get fired. And so on.

According to the Wikipedia article, such paradoxes occur whenever there are three or more alternatives. There are more than three recognized racial categories, so the above paradoxes would invariably happen to companies trying to stay within the quota. The same holds for other categories SJWs are concerned with, such as sexual orientation and disability. They would have had an easier time convincing people that the two genders could be represented perfectly in companies---but now that they have convinced themselves that there are dozens of genders, "representative" hiring practices based on gender will be subject to the same paradoxes as well.

In the case of hiring, it gets more complicated than in the case of elections, because here we are told to optimize across *multiple* dimensions of representativeness: not just along race, but also along gender, sexual orientation, etc. I believe that this can only lead to additional paradoxes and undesirable consequences, such as a black man having to be fired to hire a white woman and vice versa.

Presumably, it is likewise impossible to make all teams and organizations within a company and the company as a whole perfectly representative, as intra-company transfers of employees would have to happen between teams and organizations. Such transfers would, I conjecture, result in similar paradoxes. (If anyone knows of a theorem that proves these two conjectures, please [let me know](mailto:dennis.hackethal@googlemail.com).)

The population paradox is a particularly damning one for SJWs. Surely they wouldn't want black people to be fired from companies when the population of black people grows? But that's exactly what companies would need to do *in the name of representativeness* that SJWs so desire. Keep in mind that ad-hoc fixes of the sort "when in doubt, just keep the minority hire" are likewise apportionment rules---*and there can be no apportionment rules that stay within the quota without resulting in the population paradox*. There is no way out of this mathematical reality.

At least, for now. Our knowledge of mathematics does not have a monopoly on the truth that people think it has. It contains mistakes. Balinski & Young's theorem may later be found to be wrong. Should that happen, that *does not* mean that laws forcing companies to have "representative" workforces or boards of directors would be a good thing. They still wouldn't be because the only sensible hiring rule is based on *qualifications*. SJWs would first need to come up with a good, non-refuted *moral explanation* for doing such a thing. Since their answers usually involve force, I doubt they could produce one.

An SJW might try to wiggle his way out of this conundrum by pointing out that apportionment paradoxes typically don't occur *every* election. Likewise, an apportionment rule is said to violate quota if it is *capable* of deviating from the quota by more than one---but that need not happen every election either. While that is true, companies don't hire every four years. They hire all the time. With hundreds of thousands of companies in the US alone, said paradoxes would result in what SJWs consider injustices *every day*.

In reality, calls for "diversity"---in whose service the idea of "representativeness" stands---are hidden calls for every company to be *the same*. In a flowery, perfectly "socially just" (but mathematically impossible) world, every company would need to have the same proportions of their employees belonging to certain groups. Every company would look the same in terms of demographics. That is not what happens in a free society with free hiring practices. In an open society, you'll see different kinds of companies with various degrees of representativeness, most of them averaging out anyway.

A workforce need not be representative of the general populace. As with democracies, representativeness is not and cannot be its purpose. A workforce need only be qualified to solve the problems the company hires them to solve. Indeed, hiring managers should be free to discriminate based on any characteristics they like---but of course, they would be foolish to take anything other than qualification into account. Any company that discriminates only based on merit has a larger pool of qualified candidates to choose from and therefore has a better chance to outperform bigoted competitors. So there's no need to make bigotry illegal. The free market has built-in mechanisms to promote tolerance and discourage irrational discrimination. Laws and regulations determining hiring and firing based on "representativeness" not only increase discrimination---because now, hiring managers are forced to look at characteristics other than qualification---but also lead to paradoxes that achieve the opposite of what the lawmakers had in mind when they drafted those laws.

To those who think representation in the workforce---or anywhere---is important, surely being mathematically proven wrong will change their minds? But it won't, because nothing can. So do you see now how irrational SJWs are?

# The True Purpose of Schools

The other day, it "clicked" for me: I think I understand better now what schools are really for.

It is generally believed that schools exist to help children learn. Of course, we critical rationalists know that that's baloney. Instead, we understand---thanks to *Taking Children Seriously*---that schools exist to *standardize* children: to get them to replicate society's memes as faithfully as possible under threat of punishment. Static-society stuff (cf. David Deutsch, [*The Beginning of Infinity*](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359/)). At least that was my current understanding of it. But I'm starting to see that it goes deeper than that.

Consider a child who is interested in, say, astronomy. Most elementary schools do not offer astronomy classes. And even if they did, it is highly unlikely that any given child would happen to be interested in *all* of the things that are shoved down his throat year after year, at just the right time. A child's interests don't evolve in sync with the school's schedule. If the child is lucky, he will be genuinely interested in a few of the topics any given year, but never even close to all of them.

So, the child wants to learn about astronomy---but doesn't get to. Instead, he is forced to learn *other* things he *isn't* interested in. Day in, day out, for some 12 years. As Popper said, he has to learn answers to questions he didn't ask.

A child is then faced with two options: to go insane, or to learn to cope with the situation. So, what can one possibly *do* in such a situation to stay sane? I see only one solution: one must learn to put one's *own* interests on the back burner and prioritize *other people's* interests---in this case, the teacher's, and society's at large. One must learn to coerce oneself to neglect one's preferences. I think *that* is what school is really for: not just to standardize children, but to break them, too, to place others' interests over their own.

I recently asked a 14 year old close to me if she'd like to go to college. She said no, but that she probably will anyway because she thinks she *should*. It's heartbreaking.

It is only after 12 years of mind-numbing boredom and neglecting one's preferences that people voluntarily spend the next 30, 40, sometimes 50 years at jobs they hate. Forever delaying their dreams is what they're good at. It is in school that they learn how to live with problems and endure them instead of *solving* them. It is there that they are taught that their interests have no chance of leading to anything fruitful, so they shut them down quickly.

Parents are often complicit in this. E.g., they take away things that their children enjoy, such as their computers, gameboys, etc, or at least put time limits on them---so that their kids spend less time doing what they *want* and more of what they allegedly *need*, which is determined by anyone but the child.

I'm thankful that David Deutsch puts emphasis on *fun* and *interests*. They're hugely underrated.

If school's main purpose is to teach children how to neglect their own interests and instead pursue other people's interests, that also explains where *altruism* comes from---the evil doctrine Ayn Rand so eloquently refuted and which, she says, "regards man, in effect, as a sacrificial animal," quoting Auguste Comte, who coined the term "to mean, specifically, the placing of the interests of others above your own." This quote is from [this interview with her](https://youtu.be/7RFlPmjUbRo).

The true purpose of schools is to turn children---born individualists---into altruists; to systematically neglect their own interests in favor of others' interests.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is to force children to betray their intellectual integrity. They must "sacrifice [their minds] to what *others* believe or want to be true." --- Ayn Rand (though she didn't state this in the context of schooling and children in particular, but society at large)

This true purpose explains why people *live for others*, and then expect others to do so as well. It's what they were forced to do during the most formative years of their lives after all!

It explains why so many expect their peers to sacrifice their happiness for the health of others by agreeing to house arrests. Why those who don't want their salaries to be cut in half by taxes are considered "evil." Why so many can't begin to imagine a world without coercion. "If I had to do it, why should anyone else get a free pass?"

I'm guessing that most teachers do not understand this true purpose of school. They become teachers because [they want to "help" children](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/2020/10/25/the-tragedy-of-children-becoming-teachers.html)---that is, give children what they allegedly "need." It is only altruists who can become teachers and perpetuate the cycle. In other words, the memeplex of schools depends on breaking children so successfully that some of them decide to continue the tradition. Not only do teachers not know why they're contributing to this altruism machine, *it relies on teachers not understanding its true nature to keep itself alive.* This makes me wonder if schools as a whole are static memeplexes.

I think many experienced critical rationalists, on the other hand, understand school's true purpose deeply. For me, it was a breakthrough. Though the topic is sad, writing this post was fun. A lot of stuff is beginning to make more sense. I'm pursuing my interests *right now*. I love critical rationalism.

# Two Razors to Quickly Evaluate Any Theory of the Mind

**TL;DR:** *If a theory of the mind depends on sense data or the brain, it cannot be true.*

### So you want to know how to evaluate theories of the mind?

Theories of the mind are a dime a dozen. So how to wade through them all?

First, there's David Deutsch's test "for judging claims to have explained the nature of consciousness (or any other computational task): *if you can't program it, you haven't understood it.*"\
--- [*The Beginning of Infinity* (BoI)](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359/)

Nobody can yet program a mind, which tells us that nobody has yet understood how the mind works. Somebody will need to come up with a good explanation of that first.

But until then, how can we judge whether we are even heading in the *right direction*? And, with so many theories of the mind being proposed all the time, most slight variations of each other, how can we evaluate them *quickly* and without becoming overwhelmed?

Use the following two "razors":

1.  **Does the theory work without sense input?**

    Many research efforts are heavily influenced by *empiricism*, a philosophical doctrine which states that knowledge is derived from the senses. As Deutsch explains in BoI chapter 1, this doctrine is completely false. Although papers may not specifically mention empiricism, they are usually variations on the theme of processing sense input, claiming that thinking somehow relies on it.

    Any theory claiming that sense input is necessary for thinking/learning is empiricist and therefore false. Sense input does play a vital role while learning, but not that of being a starting point from which knowledge can be "derived." A mind uses sense input to test guessed theories *against it*. The theories *come first*, then comes a whole lot of critcism (which most theories don't survive), and then comes the testing against sense input (cf. BoI chapter 10).

    But not all of a mind's theories need sense input to be tested. Only theories about what our immediate surroundings look like do. Many of our theories don't involve sense data at all, nor could they: knowledge about morals or math, for example, simply aren't about our immediate surroundings. They're about abstract truths, and we can still criticize them using other yardsticks, such as internal consistency and conflicts with other theories. *Problems* are the starting point, not sense data.

    Therefore, we know that a brain in a vat could still contain a fully functioning mind. It could still conjecture about the world outside itself, albeit only in a very limited way. It could, in principle, still *imagine* things like elephants, even if it had never seen them---though admittedly that would be very difficult. But, more importantly, that mind would be self-aware, it could explore morals and math and philosphy, and invent new fields and explore new concepts we haven't yet thought of. None of the things that make a mind *depend* on sense data.

    Therefore, if a theory of the mind *depends* on sense data to work, it can't be true. This razor alone will let you cut out ~90% of candidate theories of the mind.

2.  **Does the theory work without mentioning the underlying hardware (the brain)?**

    Most seem to think that a sufficient understanding of the *brain* will automatically confer an understanding of the *mind*, and perhaps vice versa. But why should that be the case? There is a difference between hardware and software. Understanding how computers work does not automatically make you a programmer, and vice versa.

    At this point, you might raise a finger and say, "but wait, the brain is not really a computer, is it?" Yes, it is. Due to computational universality, any kind of information processing is computation. The brain clearly processes information, so it must be a computer. It really is as simple as that. (And no, information processing does not depend on sense input. The information that's being processed can come from *inside the structure*, it need not come from outside.)

    We also know from computational universality that anything the brain does could be simulated on *any other* universal computer (within memory and processing-power constraints), be it one made of tissue and neurons or one made of metal and silicon. While complex and stunning, the brain's *physiology* has no special or mystical status. There's nothing the brain can do in terms of information processing that any other universal computer (our smartphones and laptops included) couldn't also do. *The mind does not depend on the brain to function---any other universal hardware will do.*

    Overthinking the brain and neglecting the mind is a reductionist mistake. It's reductionist because it is an attempt to explain software (i.e., something abstract) in terms of hardware (i.e., something physical), and because it pictures the causal chain always to go from lower level (the brain) to higher level (the mind). In reality, it's the software that instructs its hardware top down, and there is feedback between both levels of abstraction.

    So, for the remaining ~10% that the first razor didn't cut, use this second razor and you'll find that only 10% of *that* subset make it.

    Deutsch explains the difference between higher and lower levels of emergence as well as the nature of abstractions in chapter 5 of BoI. He covers computational universality in chapter 6. I also write about these concepts [in my book](https://www.amazon.com/Window-Intelligence-Philosophy-Evolution-Implications-dp-1734696133/dp/1734696133).

If a theory doesn't survive either one of these razors, reject it.

Theories of the mind often contain many or even all of the misconceptions mentioned in these razors because they make each other more plausible. Researchers may think of the brain as a "special kind of perception machine"---the culmination of everything wrong I have just described---and then think that this will tell them something about the mind. Perhaps this is due to the misconception that a brain's information processing requires sense data as a starting point. Worse, most theories don't make any mention of *creativity*---which is the core of the mind, perhaps synonymous with it. They try to find some pre-existing algorithm for recognizing shapes (or something comparable) that could just as well be executed mindlessly. Thinking that knowledge could be created through the use of existing knowledge is the mistaken evolutionary theory of *Lamarckism*, due to the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.

Which brings me to additional razors. For example, thanks to Karl Popper, we know that the true theory of the mind must employ evolution. So, whatever the algorithm is that runs on our brains that instantiates our minds, it must be an *evolutionary* one. That cuts it down even further. But using the two razors above already cuts out 99% of all theories---at least of the ones I have seen.

Part of taking ideas seriously is to reject them when one finds that they're false. Empiricism, reductionism and violations of computational universality still spread because people don't take them seriously. Once you do, you'll have a much easier time evaluating claims about how the mind works. Many worry they're not qualified to reject theories of the mind. But you've read this article now, so you are. Feel encouraged to reject bad theories wholesale and without remorse. The more you practice using these razors, the more skilled you become at rejecting bad theories quickly. You won't need to read whole essays on perception anymore to see if anything's wrong with them. The mere premise gives it away.

To be clear, if you do find a theory that survives both razors---such as my [neo-Darwinian theory of the mind](https://blog.dennishackethal.com/2020/07/22/the-neo-darwinian-theory-of-the-mind.html)---that doesn't mean it is true. Razors can only be used to *reject* theories. The theory then needs to survive to a lot more scrutiny and finally meet Deutsch's test as well.

Until then, I hope you find these razors useful.

# How to Use the Proper Mood in English-to-German Translations

*This article assumes a basic command of German.*

There is a problem when translating an English text into German: that of determining exactly when the author is paraphrasing someone else or distancing himself from an idea or concept. English and German use different moods for that.

What are moods? They express the function of the verb or sentence and the writer's or speaker's attitude toward what he says. In English, regular old statements are formulated using *indicative mood*. For example:

> Tom **plays** the guitar.

This sentence is in the indicative mood because it's presented as an objective fact.

Then there is the imperative mood:

> **Play** the guitar, Tom!

Imperative moods are used to convey a command. Note that verbs are conjugated differently in this mood---here, it's "play," not "plays." Also, the imperative mood can only address others, meaning it exists only in the second-person singular and plural.

There is also the subjunctive mood:

> It is imperative that Tom **play** the guitar.

This expresses the speaker's perceived necessity of Tom's playing the guitar. Note again the conjugation of the verb "play."

Another example of the subjunctive mood is:

> If I **were** rich, I would buy a house.

In this case, the subjunctive mood expresses that the described scenario is not real. The speaker is not rich, but if he *were*, he would buy a house.

From what I know, these are the three main English moods. (There are other moods, but those need not concern us here.)

German likewise has the indicative mood:

> Tom **spielt** Gitarre.

The infinitive of the verb is "spielen," and it's conjugated here in third-person singular, "spielt."

The imperative mood also works in German:

> **Spiel** Gitarre, Tom!

Here, the verb is conjugated in the imperative mood, second-person singular.

Since both the indicative and the imperative mood exist in German, translating works well in both directions.

With the subjunctive mood, things are a bit harder. I'm tempted to say that there is no subjunctive mood in German, but that wouldn't be quite true. There appears to be a remnant of it of the form:

> Lang **lebe** der König.

This example is not in the indicative mood because it doesn't say "lang *lebt* der König." That would be an attempt at a statement of fact (and a prophetic one at that because it makes an unknowable claim about the future). Instead, the speaker expresses the *hope* that the king will live long.

The same example exists in English:

> Long **live** the king.

The same logic applies: a (prophetic) statement of fact would instead say "long *lives* the king."

This is all well and good, but it's the only example of the subjunctive I am aware of that works in German. If that is true, how does one write "if I were rich..." in German? The example with the house from above would read:

> Wenn ich reich **wäre**, würde ich ein Haus kaufen.

Isn't this the subjunctive mood in German? "wäre" and "were" seem very similar, and they *feel* almost the same. But in German, this is called the *Konjunktiv* mood. There are two of them, and this one is Konjunktiv 2.

Konjunktiv 2 is likewise used to describe a scenario that isn't real. One can also use it to be polite:

> **Wärest** du so nett, ...

which means

> **Would** you be so kind as to...

or

> **Könntest** du bitte...

which means

> **Could** you please...

Especially in its use for counterfactuals the Konjunktiv 2 is so similar to the English subjunctive that one may *call* it the "past subjunctive" in German. However, I hesitate to call it that because most Germans don't know what a subjunctive mood is until they learn Spanish or French (where it has another function altogether, at least in Spanish). The topic *may* come up in English class, but I don't remember the subjunctive being mentioned explicitly when I went to school. Another reason is that Konjunktiv 1, from what I know, has no counterpart in English, not even in the subjunctive, and so it would be misleading to call it a "present subjunctive"---and yet I have seen it called that.

Which brings me to the purpose of Konjunktiv 1. It is used to convey indirect speech and/or distance oneself from what one is saying. For example:

> Tom says his friend is nice.

In proper spoken and written German, this would *not* read:

> Tom sagt, sein Freund **ist** nett.

but instead

> Tom sagt, sein Freund **sei** nett.

"sei" is Konjunktiv 1 mood third-person singular of the verb "sein" ("to be"). It says "sei" and not "ist" because that's *Tom's* statement, not the speaker's. Konjunktiv 1 makes this explicit.

The conjugation of "leben" in the example "lang lebe der König" is equivalent to the Konjunktiv 1 present tense third-person singular of "leben." But I'd bet money that most native speakers of German would not think of that example when tasked with coming up with a sentence using Konjunktiv 1, and indeed would remark that the example feels different from all other uses of Konjunktiv 1 and that they would consider this a separate category altogether---which is why they may agree that it could be a remnant of an actual "Subjunktiv" that used to exist in German (?).

Konjunktiv 1 is especially useful when the speaker wants to *distance* himself from what is said. Imagine how useful this is in journalistic and legal contexts. Consider the following eyewitness account of a robbery in progress:

> Augenzeugen berichten, der Täter **beraube** die Bank.

In English:

> Eyewitnesses are reporting that the perpetrator **is robbing** the bank.

(For clarity, the English present progressive is merely turned into the simple present in German, but that's not important here.) The English sentence does not undergo a mood change, whereas the German one does. Any professional journalist would make that change. And while I am not an experienced translator, I believe it is important to recognize and make the change in translations, too.

Since English does not have a Konjunktiv 1 mood, accurate German-to-English translations will necessarily be lossy in those situations. It also means that going the other way round translators will need to carefully analyze what's explicitly said and what's implied to put the Konjunktiv 1 where needed.

Imagine you are tasked with translating the following, made-up sentences:

> The idea that the natural sciences **are** only predictive **has** caused much damage. Because if the scientist **believes** that he **must** only predict, he **loses** the most important element: explanations.

All verbs are in the indicative mood. We can tell that the author is partially relaying information he disagrees with---he is not advocating for purely predictive but explanatory science---but it is on us to tell from the sentence structure and from certain cues with which information he disagrees and with which he agrees. I have highlighted those part-sentences that the author wants to distance himself from. Note how granular and interposed the shift can be.

The German translation makes the distinction explicit:

> Die Vorstellung, die Naturwissenschaften **seien** ausschließlich vorhersagend, **hat** zu viel Schaden geführt. Denn wenn der Wissenschaftler **glaubt**, er **dürfe** nur vorhersagen, dann **geht** ihm oft das Wichtigste verloren: Erklärungen.

The highlighted part-sentences correspond exactly to the ones in the English original, but they use Konjunktiv 1.

There *is* a loophole which allows the translator to use Indikativ after all: the word "dass" ("that"):

> Die Vorstellung, dass die Naturwissenschaften ausschließlich vorhersagend **sind**, **hat** zu viel Schaden geführt. Denn wenn der Wissenschaftler **glaubt**, dass er nur vorhersagen **darf**, dann **geht** ihm oft das Wichtigste verloren: Erklärungen.

Using "dass" works well and is grammatically valid. But without Konjunktiv 1, we're missing a key feature: grammatically explicit information about the author's intention. Also, using "dass" every time gets repetitive quickly; it's best to mix both styles. Luckily, it can be combined with the Konjunktiv 1: "dass die Naturwissenschaften ... seien."

In the above example, it is still relatively easy to tell that Konjunktiv 1 should be used because it contains *cues*: "Die Vorstellung" and "glaubt." Such cues need not be given, however, and frequently they are not. Consider this example:

> According to this theory, science is predictive. Therefore, the answer is false.

The second sentence is tricky. Whose opinion is that? I see the two possibilities: either the author is presenting a conclusion which advocates of the theory he mentioned draw, or he is drawing a conclusion himself. If the former, it needs to be Konjunktiv 1; if the latter, Indikativ.

So how can the translator know which mood to use? He needs to understand the author's stance on the issue. When unclear, he can ask the author. In cases where the author is paraphrasing someone else and interspersing his own thoughts without always giving cues, which can span several paragraphs, the translator may need to check the source. In the above example, the translator needs to understand the theory's implications.

In other words, the translator needs to explicitly place Konjunktiv 1 when German requires it based on cues, context, and sources.

# Want to Learn about AGI? Read These Chapters from "The Beginning of Infinity"

There is no bad chapter in David Deutsch's [*The Beginning of Infinity*](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0670022756/). But if you're looking specifically for AGI-related content, here are the chapters you should read, in that order:

1.  Chapter 1: *The Reach of Explanations*

    You'll hit the ground running learning about how the growth of knowledge was traditionally understood and why that's wrong, and how we learn instead: through conjectures and refutations. When taken seriously, this chapter alone will allow you to refute much of present-day "AGI research."

    > Empiricism said that we derive it from sensory experience. This is false. The real source of our theories is conjecture, and the real source of our knowledge is conjecture alternating with criticism.

2.  Chapter 4: *Creation*

    The growth of knowledge is an evolutionary process. There is literally evolution happening in our minds. That means an AGI is an *evolutionary algorithm*. In this chapter, Deutsch explains the traditional misconceptions surrounding evolution, including creationism and Lamarckism, and lays out our current best explanation of evolution: neo-Darwinism.

    > [Both] human knowledge and biological adaptations are abstract replicators: forms of information which, once they are embodied in a suitable physical system, tend to remain so while most variants of them do not.

3.  Chapter 6: *The Jump to Universality*

    As Deutsch explains in this chapter, sometimes systems undergo a sudden change from being able to solve a narrow range of problems in a given domain to all of them. That's the *jump* to universality. Deutsch argues that AGI will be achieved in a similar jump. Current research programs aimed at gradual emulation of human abilities must fail for several reasons, and this is one of them.

    > All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain.

4.  Chapter 7: *Artificial Creativity*

    This chapter is perhaps the most important of the AGI-related ones. Deutsch refutes the applicability of the Turing test and explains what the focus of research efforts should be: understanding how the mind works. The absence of this focus is also why there has been no progress in the field, Deutsch argues. Think artificial evolution has already been achieved? According to Deutsch, this is not the case, despite appearances.

    > The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult.

5.  Chapter 10: *A Dream of Socrates*

    In a beautiful, fictional dialog between Socrates and the Greek god Hermes, Deutsch masterfully explores the inner workings of the mind and explains that our experience is a "waking dream of reality":

6.  Chapter 16: *The Evolution of Creativity*

    Brains have no way of downloading ideas from other brains directly. Nor can minds acquire ideas through imitation, Deutsch argues citing Popper. But they *can* replicate memes through creativity. And, according to Deutsch, that is why our species exists.

    > Complex memes do not mandate specific bodily actions, but rules. We can see the actions, but not the rules, so how do we replicate them? We replicate them by creativity.

Read [*The Beginning of Infinity*](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0670022756/) to learn more about AGI (and so much more). If you take the ideas seriously, I am confident you will know more than 90% of researchers in the field.

21世纪和平新政救世主倡  否定全盘西化的世上唯一强有力论证
Initiatives of the 21st Century Peace New Deal:凡将《21世纪和平新政宣言》复制于网上或帮助该宣言及将开创实施的元首获诺贝尔和平奖提名者,为救世组成员载入互联网史册,旨在使宣言家喻户晓最终全球实施；奥巴马黑帮操控美国大选再显全球政党政治腐败崩溃，将掀起"21世纪新政救世"热!

《21世纪和平新政宣言》
---孙中山旗下唯一有利两岸统一且各方都易接受的，改革西式政体一切政党社团参政议政都不执政的，中西结合优化五权分立的(民)选(科)举智者治国的，否定全盘西化作世上唯一强有力论证的21世纪和平新政（以下“【】”内文字为非正文内容的说明）
    20世纪苏联的消亡和东欧的大变革，使这21世纪初的现中国大陆成为世界关注的最主要焦点和影响新世纪和平文明发展的关键。特别是大陆这些年对外意识形态普遍大规模输出，震撼整个世界；全球各国对本世纪大陆十几年里两次引发严重病毒疫情的反思；美中关系恶化实际已打响人类意识形态领域最后的冷战甚至有引发热战危险；海峡两岸也有触发冲突大风险；香港不断的大规模游行动荡；与南海邻国关系紧张，世界和平受到严重挑战。大陆经济急速下滑衰退，内外矛盾激化高端深感前所未有的严重危机，高端甚至反复提高到防“亡党”的严重程度。美国发展到以禁止高科技芯片进入中国大陆的要害制裁，遏制和衰萎大陆发展，高端强调过毛时代“紧日子 ”。其实美国这种高科技芯片要害制裁只能维持” 仅仅几年“ ，IBM公司去年宣布几年后量子计算机商用等等高科技飞速发展可证明，标志着可以无需现行芯片非仅仅是当代计算机的多元高科技时代将开始，新的同时起跑状态将呈现，问题是，不要在这 ” 仅仅几年“  就倒下！“21世纪和平新政”就是唯一理想而有效的救急。包括中共上下在内的几乎国内外所有人都很清楚，大陆已到必须政治体制改革的时候了，大变革将是民意世潮下的必然结果。中国大陆内外即全球正合力促成这人口第一大国的大变革大复兴，这也为中国开创新政治体制提供了一次最佳机会。

       综合各政体和各国现实，绝大多数国家改革或变革选择了西方政体，但西方政体固有的越来越明显的缺陷已成为有人攻击、拒绝或怀疑的理由。这也是近年来西方国家出现了宽容那必将灭亡的独裁专制政府的左派当选，是不少选民失去信心的表现和原因。不仅如此，西方现政体的缺陷还有:  很难产生最佳决策而大多是不优不劣成心对抗后的折衷方案使施政不理想选民失去信心；财团商界巨头对政治影响过大；对立政党轮流执政决策易翻来覆去劳民伤财前后混乱选民也易失去信心; 并不只是几人而是几党几大群体竟争最高权力，强对抗易使社会撕裂更易使选民失望；另外还有竞选的形象口才和资金作用偏重，不利于博才寡言的理论家和不利于无大财团资助的竞选人；大多数博才的却不善辩的竞选人易被仅仅是形象口才好的竞选人击败等等；最明显的例子，西式政体在伊拉克之类的国家就完全失败，根本无法解决誓不两立的多党多教派的和平执政问题；还有俄国和美英法德等西方甚至世界各国政坛媒体最高端政客及左派，被极左Antifa等组织全球总后台暗地收买，极左惯用的腐败这“灵丹妙药”不仅收买拉拢一批大陆高官，还长期不断收买拉拢大批各国高官。如联合国及其人权组织、WHO、美国两党和VOA等要员被收买为腐败统治辩护或服务极为普遍。美国政坛巨商媒体等各界，在近代最黑恶势力极左全球总后台暗地收买下，在克林顿掌权时猛兴起，更在奥巴马和拜登掌权时黑恶势力普遍全面壮大，美国政坛巨商媒体等机构和部门几乎全被极左腐蚀收买，大有彻底颠覆美国体制之势。黑恶政党政治诸如“肯尼迪刺死事件”、"奥巴马门"、”希拉里邮件门“、“拜登父子门”和“佩洛西电脑门”黑暗丑恶事件一个接一个，最典型的奥巴马、拜登和贺锦丽等人及其中私家企业被极左及他国政府收买，奥巴马甚至暗示离美去加拿大逃避罪责，全球应高度关注！还有早年共和党的老布什甚至为了贸易和私利，而容忍独裁者的血腥惊世事件。他们都是为打击政敌和为其个人及政党利益而丢弃原则不顾国家利益；甚至美国有市议会通过废除警察局或成立短命极左政府等荒唐之举，选举年更易出现街头暴动打砸抢；基辛格也被收买去重庆支持极左薄熙来夺权唱红多次为极左服务，更荒谬绝伦。2020美国总统大选，两大党政客和大多数美国媒体被全球极左总后台长期全力收买后的极端做法可谓“文革“2.0国际版，在危急和震撼美国及世界的奥巴马和拜登黑恶势力恐怖操控2020大选突显美宪法危机之后，完全政党政治面临死亡将掀起"21世纪新政"热。而实西式政体的治国并非利国利民的理想制度，西式政体势必改革完善，使注重发展孙中山五权分立的考试和监察更有必要。改革西式政体一切政党社团参政议政都不执政，中西结合优化五权分立(民)选(科)举智者治国，实施否定全盘西化作世上唯一强有力佐证的21世纪和平新政。另外，美国无限泛滥混血的全国灰色人种化，结果显而易见，若干年后美国将没有白种人黄种人和黑种人，终将全是“灰色“杂交种。纯种人自寻消失，一国还可，他国不可推广，地球物种特别是人种的保护更为人类重中之重，旨为人类非灰一色的丰富多彩而圆满理想的未来，所以这一点也证明“美国模式”并非最佳榜样。各派严重对立社会撕裂不利和平威胁地区安全的台湾模式也无需效仿，地震多发地台湾的台独意识实是朝向断祖绝孙。日本也是地震多发岛屿，从日本近代史可见，多年许多决策高层都有扩张野心，侵略南北韩和中国等陆地，因为他们知道自己的子孙后代,终将会在一次地震中遇难绝后的概率极大，因此也出于私心而野蛮侵略大陆等地而不安心于日本岛。可是亲日的李登辉却与之不同，去开创撕裂社会不利和平的台独断祖绝后危局，实是一大因弃大陆而会导致许多家族断祖绝孙的短见，只迎合无远见阶层的愚眛，也对地区安全和世界和平不利。
 
      动荡震撼世界的的美国2020大选也揭示了这21世纪初的人类信仰危机，有神论与无神论及极右与极左的交锋已至生死决斗登锋造极。其实与人战胜自然的创举相似，非自然或超自然的"神"力是有的，人不能自以为至极，在无限之中"人"与"自然"是有限的定义。不过这个"神"或其"化身"不会是凡间人类，一切活佛神话都是虚构。可以引入"N 阶宇宙"或"N 阶世界"的概念，不论何时若把已知微观世界看成N之N1阶，已知宏观世界看成N之Nn阶，那么人类只能认识N1至Nn 阶，此外N-1、N-2、N-3...和N+1、N+2、N+3...阶等等永有未知。不同的观察和分析方法会有不同的形态和规律等局限结果。因此值得强调的是，实质与真理是无穷多的有限条件下科学描述之和，乃无穷大。生命只是物质运动和存在的无穷多形式之一. 未知微世界和未知宏世界的"未知生命"、“超生命”或超生命之极限即“神”, 都不能用已知生命来定义、分析和寻找。也就是说, 人类可以不断发现, 不断获取此类知识, 但不会最终找到细胞基因之下极限"基因"或超人之上极限"超人"。发现和找出规律是神圣美妙的，探索必有错出错也有其价值之处。为此信神的人不妨猜想，也许唐山大震、日本和台湾不断的地震，或许是神知极左、军国主义和台独撕裂社会的危险而起的搔动吧，中国人常言"老天有眼"或许是“不完全归纳法”的结论，我看"老天也无情"，至少是它与人间对情的定义无法一样。还是积德才能心安理得，如数千年之中原大陆是华人祖宗牢靠的根据地，就象地球是人类的根据地一样应当保全，不可分裂和破坏。 一切需要和平，一切基于科学，一切为了发展。新的世纪随文明和教育的发展，应以法治和德理相结合，法治的存在旨在维护社会公德，应以公法与公德的社会治与理相结合，即法治与德理，治标与理本相结合；以民众与学者、民意与学理相结合，如公民直选与学者科举的选与举相结合；以东西方文明及各民族文化精华相结合，开创高速发展的新21世纪。

       中国是影响新世纪和平文明发展的关键，人们也普遍希望中国大变革应该和平过渡避免付出巨大社会成本和沉重代价，新世纪社会变革更要终止杀人流血。旨在也包括左翼的更多中国人欢迎和接受的,  不完全西化中西结合的，有利两岸和平统一的，最佳选择必是都相聚在中共也一贯崇敬的孙中山先生的旗帜下，完善健全和发展孙中山的五权分立体制，实施本文倡导的21世纪和平新政。这一使命由中共真改革派完成所付代价则最小，应当引起他们的高度关注，劝其为国为民勇于担当。 倒退则是自取灭亡，必是遗臭万年的中华民族的大罪人。中共改革派和大多数党员也不会愿意被往往只可能得势一时的极左倒退势力捆绑连累，中共改革派要去做的第一件事是促成落实中共曾在联合国签署的《世界人权宣言》包括中共所立宪法的基本人权和自由。【中共也许有人会说这是使党变色，那这几十年变的色还少吗？不是那些名“社”实“资”的变色不就早和前东欧苏联一样完蛋了吗？既是如此无可否认就再变最后一次又何妨？而且已是面临无法逃避的大变革前夜，天堂与地狱只一念一步之差！“资本主义社会”其实是来源于马克思主义的贬义词，是指西方自由民主社会。】只有中国完成了顺民意世潮的大变革，才是开创21世纪全新的和平文明世界的开始。
 
      否定全盘西化改革西方民主制，加入东方元素，将孙中山先生的西式完全政党政治较浓厚的五权分立体制，进一步改革为不完全政党政治，中国古代就有“结党营私”一说。所有政党社团参政议政都不执政，无执政党和在野党之分， 避免执政党自身权益高于国家及一切的完全政党政治弊病。除了那拒绝政改变革而要倒退的是主动自杀，将不会有执政党下台被动推翻消亡或执政地位被他党取代的艰险和痛苦从而长存久安。【这是中共唯一可选择的避免亡党的主动体面而又圆满的过渡,  是和平自救或重整求生的唯一有利有效的办法。包括中共在内的几乎所有世人都认为中共政治体制改革已到尽头，再真政改只会亡党或改名，这里提出的新政则是使其可不亡党也可不改名的唯一圆满理想的办法，而且在这转型过程中中共仍可能会是人数第一大党。】中共转型为参政议政党，同样如此，海内外华人其他政党社团也应放弃争取执政的目标也仅参政议政，为全中华复兴和和平统一，发挥高尚的政治智慧和修养，修改各自政党社团和要员个人的利益诉求，放弃过高权力欲望更改奋斗目标，以两岸各地全中国各族人民的利益为重，为世界树立榜样。【若如此，可以说历史进程偏偏給中共以任何政党社团都不易有的改革出新型政体真正复兴中华的优先机会，应当明智果断地把握住，失之必然逃不过亡党有的受审被彻底清算的命运。】
 
      华人必定都希望中国和平统一复兴一个文明而又富强甚至为第一强国，这一伟大使命也需要全球所有华人和政党社团以及政治家们的共同努力。这可供和平过渡的，孙中山旗下唯一有利两岸统一且两岸都易接受的，中西结合优化五权分立真正落实考试权的高智商群体智者治国的，一切政党社团参政议政都不执政不完全政党政治的，否定全盘西化作世上唯一强有力论证的，及优化改革完善甚至可谓挽救现西方政体的21世纪和平新政，即士辅民主的“三府合政”制。其分权为手段合政为目的，其架构概述为：

1，改革孙中山先生提出的五权分立和西式三权分立为三府合政: （1）由新科举考试后全民大选出的“行政府”（可简称官府），其各机构和职能与西式三权分立之行政相似；（2）民选不需新科举考试的旨在立法的“议政府”（可简称民府），其各机构和职能与西式三权分立之议会相似；（3）新科举考试不需民选的具多重制衡权的“理政府”（可简称士府），理政府包括行使提供全民免费的教育院、医疗社保院等生存权【中共强调的】；文物院、（包括专利的）私产院和（包括国土的）资源院等资产权；科学院、智库和考试院等考试权；检查院、廉政院和法院等司法权；（包括报刊和网络的）传媒院、诚信院和监察院等监察权等的，组成松散结合的理政府，因此，理政府还具有小部分专业性极强的行政功能和部分西式议会参议院功能。

2，每届政府任期四年，行政府和议政府的大选为四年一届次，新科举考试为两年一次。参加科举的人必须是经体检、诚信和前科等资格审查的规定范围的名校博士获得者。参加科举考试不管是否考上是否任职过最多可参加三届科举，新科举考试是主题为行政科管理学、政治科法学和经济学，加辅题即全部众多学科。新科举考试是超极限数量和范围之试题的考试，和才能智商检测（此项检测跟随高科技发展逐步推进深化）。

3，最终引入逐步精细化的公正而且高效的“投票份额”制，即选举公决和提案表决等一切重要公事投票表决的，历次累积的取决于对错结果并经电脑统计出的，每人每次投票的各自不同不断变化的“份额”，并记入诚信、资历和各资格等项。使所有人所有重要投票表决更认真谨慎，特别是更为有效。科举考试及大选、政迹统计、新政评估和投票份额等等要充分紧跟并利用不断飞速发展的电脑网络技术的资源和作用，不断提高新政的管理水平。

4，行政府总理（兼军警最高统帅）由科举的两名排序最早的头名科举贤士申请参选总理者，为总理候选人，并在头名贤士中自主结合成两组竞选伙伴受总理级保护，再全民大选出正副总理，每次科举并大选上的总理最多可竞选连任一届；经二次和三次科举并大选上可再连任。各正副部长级行政府官员由总理在对口各届科举考试合格的贤士中任命，经另两府半数通过，可被辞但无再聘次数限制。各省（特区）及市县（区）正副行政长官每职位取两名，在各届科举考试合格贤士中按规定届序名次经电脑处理出的申请参选人经当地选民选出，其他官员由其行政长官任命。

5，各级行政长官当选后辞去原社团党派教派之类职务，行政不带社团教派党派偏见，按需灵活择取各方各党各派争辩而出的非仅一方一党的全部最优决策。【避免西式体制因执政党的变更而翻来复去折腾。】只有行政府设至市县（区）级行政机构止，和其下仅设办事处即乡办镇办及基层村办街办；议政府和理政府设至省（特区）级止其之下各级均不设立，仅由议政府和理政府常设适量“巡视组”据案需巡回暂驻于所辖市县（区）行政府院内，议政府和理政府事务及案件（如起诉立案）可广泛运用互联网。简化西式体制机构的繁杂臃肿，行政府是“管”的概念必须设至市县（区），而议政府和理政府是“议”和“裁”的概念，完全可充分运用互联网及其视频而简政减员和废止其市县（区）级机构。

6，以辖内注册的各党各派各社团身份或个人身份之参选者，经资格审查后均可角逐中央议政府和各省（特区）议政府议员，经由所辖选民选出不需科举考试，当选届次不限。其正副议长由议政府当届议员选出得票多者担任，中央议政府议员加各省（特区）正副议长的总人数与另两府参加三府联席会议的人数相当。【不会被动推翻或消亡的而只要回归一度曾放弃暴力革命和阶级斗争等教条的现共产党，放弃违宪易撕裂社会的台独主张的民进党和孙中山开创的国民党等以及经辖内注册的海内外华人政党社团,  都可在两岸各地发展并竞选各级议政府正副议长或议员。】

7，中央理政府和各省（特区）理政府的正副理士、院长、考官、检查官和法官等级要员由各届新科举考试合格人士即贤士，根据其新科举考试主题分数和辅题对口学科分数排名，可参照原名校获得的博士专业或从事的工作专业分类入档，定期内三志愿对口投档按规定届序名次经电脑处理再公榜后上任。不需民选，也不由行政长官任命不对之负责，只依宪法法律为国服务，并行使仅不包括需“三府联席会议"裁决的一切各案裁决，不同与西式政体，使司法权、监察权和考试权等更分权独立。每界理政府正副理士、院长、考官、检查官和法官等级要员任期四年后卸职，重新科考中榜才可连任。卸职后留理政府还原为理政府贤士，可接受理政府“巡视组”任职或行政府正副行政长官之外的职务任命。

8，立法提案三府均可经简单多数提出由各府参与审核，行政府提案先交理政府可作修正案再齐交议政府审定其一或过三分之二通过废止；理政府提案先交行政府可作修正案再齐交议政府审定其一或过三分之二通过废止；议政府提案先交理政府可作修正案齐交行政府也可作修正案再回议政府审定其一修正案或过三分之二通过原提案；议政府过三分之二通过的提案为不需交另两府直接审定，提案最终是由议政府审定由总理签署，若拒签则十日后自动生效。修宪、公决发起案、中央正副总理弹劾案、主席团成员请辞除名等特大案的终审裁决需至少两府表决通过提出，主席召集，须由“三府一团（主席团）联席会议"过三分之二表决通过；各省长（或特区区长）弹劾案由至少当地两府表决通过提出，总理召集，须其当地“三府联席会议"过三分之二通过；省（特区）重大案及各市长县长区长镇长弹劾案由省（特区）至少两府表决通过提出，省（特区）长召集，须其当地“三府联席会议"各府过半通过。

9，主席团成员均为无权的资政，其中最新卸任总理为国家主席（象征性国家元首），最新卸任副总理为国家副主席，国家正副主席任满后都与其余历届卸任正副总理、卸任正副议长和卸任正副理士为主席团终身资政，主席团行使礼仪特使、独立调查和巡视通报及参与特大案表决等职能【为国为民再作贡献发挥余热，填补和缓解下台后中老年生活的心理空虚和猛然变化，这一变化易产生下台后各种纠葛并影响寿命】。

10，新政为民选和科举有分有合的“三式选举制”，既顺民意而又规范于学理,  也有利于博才寡言的理论家和灵话善辩的活动家及两者兼优人才都有发辉和贡献的机会。这新政的民选与科举不受年龄，姓别、民族、党派、贫富、形象和口才等局限，公平合理，远强于现西式选举。

11，和平新政为“士辅民主制”，至今为止所有所谓民主，都是只有那些强大的党派和利益集团才有能力导向的，经科举和民选脱颖而出之贤人贤士则是民意与学理的代表，而不是某政党、社团、教派或利益集团的代表。

12，各民族和各具特色地区有充分自治权，一个最小的群体最小的民族或最小地区只要出智者就有出总理、议长、理士等最大摡率，远比现西式选举摡率大得多，突显平等公正。历史上曾附属过的或有民意支持的邻邦可入此大中华和平新政，无条件接受对其军事保护灾难救援和经济协助等，其有参选被选和完全自治权。全球效仿此和平新政而大同共享，可延伸扩大为联合和平新政共同体。
  
     党不执政与军不从政同理合理, 易天下太平避免社会撕裂和政变动乱，和平且安全。【若中共签署或实施本新政宣言，可能有两三年以上过渡期在签署宣言的多党群体选出的新政筹备委员会中主政，包括完成筹备期突击新科举考试及筹备大选等，为21世纪和平新政奠基。中共也可让香港立即启动先行试点，这也是解决香港大难题的一劳永逸最理想的方案。很明显，香港西式政党易争得执政权是中共不愿香港普选的最主要原因，而这一切政党社团参政议政都不执政的和平新政正是摆在中共面前的一理想台阶，是唯一圆满解决香港问提的双赢方案！而且此和平新政一经普遍传播，中共很大可能最终也在大陆只能作这一最理想选择，现在暂时不想也最好收藏这一方案。全国和全香港人要齐心协力集中精力追求新政这一可行而又避免社会动荡易于各方接受的和平政改诉求！】这中西结合不完全政党政治的高智商群体智者治国的，优于现西方民主制的真正理想而先进的新型政体，能让中国人也真正感受且超越美国人所一直感受的，对国家、社会及政治制度的自信和骄傲，并为包括美国在内的世界树立榜样！也是世界真正进入新和平文明世纪的里程碑。【希望大家全面广泛地讨论，求得最大共识，以创新决定全中国乃至全人类命运的21世纪和平新政】。

Obama gang Manipulating the U.S. election, once again showing the corruption and collapse of global party politics!

"The 21st Century Peace New Deal Declaration"
【Subject to the original Chinese   】（以中文原文为准）gist.github.com/Hlianhe ； pastebin.com/fSy36jWM ； matters.news/@halanh  
---Under the banner of Sun Yat-sen, it is the only thing that is conducive to the reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and it is easy for all parties to accept, reform the Western political system, all parties and organizations participate in politics, do not govern, integrate Chinese and Western, optimize the separation of powers, general elections and imperial examinations, wise People in power, veto full Westernization; it is the only "21st Century Peaceful New Deal" in the world that has been proven
      The demise of the Soviet Union in the 20th century and the great changes in Eastern Europe made the present mainland China at the beginning of the 21st century the most important focus of the world and the key to the development of peace and civilization in the new century. In particular, the mainland has generally exported large-scale external ideology in recent years, which shocked the entire world; countries around the world have reflected on the serious virus epidemic caused by the mainland twice in more than a decade in this century;  The deterioration of US-China relations has actually started the final cold war in the field of human ideology, and there is even a risk of hot war; there is also a great risk of triggering conflicts on both sides of the strait; Hong Kong has continued large-scale demonstrations; relations with neighboring countries in the South China Sea are strained, and world peace is seriously challenged. The mainland's economy is rapidly declining, and internal and external conflicts have intensified. The high-end feels an unprecedented serious crisis, and the high-end has even repeatedly increased to the level of preventing "party death". The United States has developed critical sanctions that prohibit the entry of high-tech chips into mainland China to contain and decay the development of the mainland, and the high-end emphasizes the "tight days" of the Mao era. In fact, the critical sanctions on such high-tech chips in the United States can only last for "a few years." IBM announced last year that quantum computers will be commercialized in a few years, and the rapid development of high technology can prove that it is possible to eliminate the need for current chips, not just relying on modern computers. , The era of diversified high-tech will begin, and at the same time a new start-up race will appear. The problem is, don't fall here in just a few years! The "21st Century Peaceful New Deal" is the only ideal and effective emergency relief. Almost everyone at home and abroad, including the CCP, is well aware that the time has come for the mainland to reform its political system, and that major changes will be the inevitable result of the current wave of public opinion. Mainland China, both inside and outside the country, and the world are working together to promote the great transformation and revival of this most populous country, which also provides the best opportunity for China to create a new political system.
     Considering the realities of various political systems and countries, the vast majority of countries have chosen Western political systems for reforms or major changes. However, the increasingly obvious defects inherent in Western political systems have become reasons for attack, rejection or suspicion. This is also the reason why the leftists who tolerate dictators in Western countries have been elected to power in recent years; it is the manifestation and reason why voters have lost confidence.  Not only that, but the shortcomings of the current Western political system include: it is difficult to produce the best decisions and most of them are neither good nor inferior. The compromise plan after deliberate confrontation makes governance unsatisfactory and voters lose confidence; consortia and business giants have too much influence on politics ; Political parties take turns in power, frequent changes in decision-making, waste of manpower and financial resources, chaos, and voters easily lose confidence;  It is not just a few people, but a few parties and several large groups that compete for the highest power. Strong confrontation tends to tear society apart and make voters disappointed. In addition, there are campaigns that are eloquent and fund-oriented, which is not conducive to talented theorists. , And are not conducive to candidates who are not funded by large consortia; most talented but not eloquent candidates are easily defeated by candidates who are merely eloquent, etc.;  The most obvious example is the complete failure of Western-style polity in countries like Iraq, and it is unable to solve the problem of multi-party and multi-sectarian peaceful governance. There are also Russia, the United States, Britain, France, Germany and other Western and even world governments. The most high-end politicians and leftists in the media were secretly bribed by the global backstage of organizations such as the ultra-left Antifa. The "magic pill" of corruption used by the ultra-left not only bribed a group of senior officials in mainland China, but also bribed a large number of senior officials from various countries for a long time.   Bribery of important members of the United Nations Human Rights Organization, the World Health Organization, the U.S. parties and the Voice of America is to defend corruption or to serve corruption governance. The U.S. government, business, media, and other modern underworld forces were secretly bribed by the ultra-left global backstage. They appeared when Clinton was in power, and when Obama and Biden were in power, the underworld forces were fully developed. The U.S. government, business, media, and other institutions and departments have almost all been bribed by the ultra-left, which is very likely to overthrow the U.S. system.   Dark and evil party politics such as "Kennedy's Death", "Obama Gate", "Hillary Mail Gate" and "Biden Father and Son Gate" dark and ugly events one after another, the most typical Obama, Biden, He Jinli and others Private companies were bribed by the extreme left and the governments of other countries. Obama even hinted that he would leave the United States and go to Canada to evade accountability. The world should pay close attention! There is also the old Bush of the Republican Party in the early years that even tolerated the shocking incidents of dictators massacring people for trade and personal gain.  They are all for the purpose of fighting against political opponents and discarding principles for their personal and political interests, regardless of national interests; even some city councils in the United States have adopted absurd measures such as abolishing police stations or establishing short-lived ultra-left governments, and street riots are more likely to occur in election years; Kissinger was also bought to Chongqing to support the ultra-left Bo Xilai, singing red songs to serve the ultra-left many times, even more absurd.  Especially in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the extreme practice of the Democratic Party and most U.S. politicians and media after being bribed by the global ultra-left general backstage for a long time can be described as the "Cultural Revolution" 2.0 international version. In the crisis and shocking the United States and the world, Obama and Biden are evil. Power and terror control the 2020 elections, highlighting the US constitutional crisis, and the death of party politics will set off the "21st Century New Deal" fever.  However, governing a country with a Western-style regime is not an ideal system for peacefully judging the good for the country and the people. The Western-style regime is bound to be reformed and perfected, making it more necessary to focus on the development of Sun Yat-sen’s examination and supervision. Reforming the Western-style political system All political parties and organizations participate in politics and do not govern. The combination of Chinese and Western parties optimizes the separation of five powers and the election of the people and the rule of the imperial examination.  In addition, the United States is infinitely proliferating mixed races, and the country is gray-ethnic. The result is obvious. In a few years, the United States will have no white people, yellow people and black people, all gray-skinned people. It is an example of the disappearance of a purebred person. The United States can still do the same, and other countries cannot learn from it. The protection of species, especially races, is the most important thing for mankind. It is aimed at a colorful and perfect future for mankind. It also proves that the "American model" is not the best example.  There is no need to imitate the Taiwanese model that is detrimental to peace and threatening regional security. Taiwan is prone to earthquakes, and independence is to cut off ancestors. Japan is also an earthquake-prone island. From the modern history of Japan, it can be seen that many senior decision-makers have ambitions for expansion, invading South and North Korea, and invading China and other land, because they know that their descendants will eventually die in an earthquake; the probability of extinction Great, but also out of selfishness and brutal invasion of the mainland and other places, uneasy on the Japanese island. However, the pro-Japanese Lee Teng-hui went to create something that would tear the society apart, which is detrimental to peace. The crisis after Taiwan’s independence and annihilation would lead to the extinction of many families and only cater to the lack of vision, which would be detrimental to regional and global security.  
      The turbulent US 2020 election that shook the world also revealed the crisis of human faith in the early 21st century. The confrontation between atheism and theism and the extreme right and the extreme left has reached the extreme of a life and death duel. In fact, similar to the pioneering work of man overcoming nature, there are unnatural or supernatural "divine" powers. Man cannot think of himself as the extreme height. In the infinite, "man" and "nature" are limited definitions.  But this "god" or "incarnation" will not be a mortal human being, and all living Buddha myths are fictitious. The concept of "N-order universe" or "N-order world" can be introduced. Whenever the known micro world is regarded as the N1 order of N, and the macro world is regarded as the Nn order of N, then humans can only recognize the N1 to Nn orders. In addition, N-1, N-2, N-3... and N+1, N+2, N+3... and so on are never known.   Different observation and analysis methods will have different forms and laws and other limitations. Therefore, it is worth emphasizing that substance and truth are the sum of infinite scientific descriptions under limited conditions, which is infinite. Life is only one of the infinite forms of material movement and existence. The "unknown life", "super life" or the limit of super life, namely "god" in the unknown micro-world and the unknown macro-world, cannot be defined and analyzed by the known life And look for it. In other words, human beings can continuously discover and acquire such knowledge, but will not eventually find the limit "gene" below the cell gene or the limit "superman" above the superman.   Discovering and finding out the rules is sacred and wonderful, and there must be mistakes in the exploration and there is value in it. For those who believe in God may wish to guess: the Tangshan earthquake, the constant earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan, may be that God knows the danger of extreme leftism, militarism and Taiwan independence tearing up society. The Chinese often say "God has eyes", this It is the conclusion of the "law of incomplete induction", I think "God is also ruthless", at least it cannot be the same as the definition of human emotion.  Only by accumulating virtue can one feel at ease. For thousands of years, mainland China is a solid base for Chinese ancestors. Just like the earth is a base for mankind, it should be preserved and cannot be divided or destroyed. Everything needs peace, everything is based on science, everything is for development. With the development of civilization and education in the new century, the rule of law and morality should be combined. The existence of the rule of law aims to maintain social morality, and the social governance of public law and morality should be combined, that is, the rule of law and morality should be combined; The combination of people and scholars, public opinion and academic theory, such as popular elections and scholars’ imperial examinations; the combination of Eastern and Western civilizations and various ethnic cultures, to create a new 21st century of rapid development.
     China is the key to the development of peace and civilization in the new century. People generally hope that China's major changes should be peacefully transitioned to avoid paying huge social resources and heavy costs. Social changes in the new century will even stop killings and bloodshed. It is aimed at more Chinese people on the left to welcome and accept those that are not fully Westernized and are conducive to the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait. The best choice must be to gather together under the banner of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who has always been respected by the Chinese Communist Party. Develop Sun Yat-sen's system and implement the "21st Century Peaceful New Deal" advocated in this article。 This mission is fulfilled by the CCP’s true reformists, which will minimize the cost. It should arouse their attention and persuade them to take courage for the country and the people. Regression is a dead end, a sinner who has been stinking for years. The CCP reformists and most of the party members will not be willing to be tied up by the ultra-left regressive forces that can only gain power for a while. The first thing the CCP reformers must do is to facilitate the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights signed by the CCP at the United Nations. Including the basic human rights and freedoms of the Constitution of the CCP. Only when China completes a major transformation can it be the beginning of a new peaceful civilization in the 21st century.
     Denying total Westernization, reforming the Western democratic system, adding Eastern elements, and further reforming Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Western-style party political system into incomplete party politics. In ancient China, there was a saying of "party formation for private interests". All political parties and organizations participate in and discuss politics without ruling, and there are no ruling or opposition parties, so as to avoid the complete political ills of the ruling party's own rights and interests above the state and all of it. Except for refusing political reforms and retreating is suicide, there will be no ruling party to step down, not to be overthrown, not to be eliminated, or to have the pain of being replaced by another party.  After the CCP is transformed into a non-ruling party, other Chinese political parties and associations should abandon their goal of governing and only participate in the discussion of politics. For the rejuvenation and peaceful reunification of China, they must have noble political wisdom and cultivation, and change the requirements of political parties and personal interests. Give up the desire for excessive power and change the goal of our efforts, put the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in China on both sides of the strait as the top priority and set an example for the world.
      The Chinese must all hope that China's peaceful reunification will revive a civilized, prosperous and even the strongest country. This great mission also requires the joint efforts of all Chinese, political parties, organizations, and politicians around the world. This kind of peaceful transition is the only thing under the banner of Sun Yat-sen that is beneficial to the reunification of the two sides of the strait, and is easy to accept. The combination of Chinese and Western optimizes the separation of five powers. Really implements the power of examination, the high IQ group and wise people govern the country. Incomplete party politics, denying total Westernization, the only powerful argument in the world, and the optimization of reforms and improvements can even be described as the "21st Century Peaceful New Deal" that saves the current Western political system. In other words, scholars assist the democratic "triple government" system. The separation of power is a means and cooperation is an end. Its structure is summarized as follows:
      1. Reform the separation of powers proposed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the separation of powers in Western style: "Three coalition government": (1) "Administrative government": first the imperial examination, and then the election by the people. , Various institutions and functions are similar to Western management; (2) "Parliamentary government": elected by the people, does not require imperial examinations, only for legislation, and its institutions and functions are similar to Western three-power parliament; (3) "Leoch Government": The imperial examination does not require elections and has multiple checks and balances. The Leoch government has the right to exercise and provide free educational institutions, medical and social insurance institutions and other rights of survival; cultural heritage institutions, private property institutions (including patents) and resource institutions (including land resources) and other asset rights; academies of sciences, think tanks and Examination agencies; judicial agencies, such as prosecutors' offices, ICAC and courts; (including newspapers and the Internet) media institutes, ICAC and supervisory agencies form a loosely integrated Leoch government. The government also has a small portion of highly specialized administrative functions, as well as some Western-style Senate functions.
      2. The term of office of each government is four years, the general election is every four years, and the new imperial examination examination is every two years. The person participating in the imperial examination must be a "doctorate" winner from a prestigious school who has passed the qualification examination of physique, integrity and other qualifications. Participate in the imperial examinations regardless of whether they are admitted or not; whether they have already served in a post, you can take up to three times. The new imperial examinations are the subjects of administration, political science, law, and economics, with supplementary questions covering all subjects. The new imperial examination is an examination of over-limit number and over-limit range test questions; as well as the ability and IQ test (this test is gradually deepened with the development of high-tech).
      3. Eventually introduce a gradually refined, fair and efficient "voting share" system, that is, voting on all important public affairs such as election referendums and proposal voting. The different "shares" of each vote shall be included in the qualifications and other items. Make all important votes of everyone more serious, especially more effective. Imperial examinations and general elections, deeds statistics, New Deal evaluations, voting shares, etc., should fully follow and use the resources and functions of the rapidly developing computer network technology to continuously improve the management level of the New Deal.
     4. The Premier of the Executive Government (and the Supreme Commander of the Military and Police): After each imperial examination, no two terms have served as Prime Minister, and a maximum of three examinations can be applied. They were ranked first in the past imperial examinations, and selected two sets of candidates for the prime minister’s running partners to elect the prime minister and deputy prime minister. The prime minister can be re-elected for a second term at most. He appointed other administrative government officials. They can be removed from office and there are no restrictions on reappointment. Among those who passed the imperial examination, the administrative heads and deputy administrative heads of provinces (special zones), cities, and counties (districts) each had two groups of running partners for each position. Applicants who pass the imperial examination in the prescribed order and are sorted and processed by computers are then elected by local voters. Other officials are appointed by the local CEO.
     5. After the chief executives at all levels are elected, they resign from the posts of the original associations and sects, without the prejudices of associations, sects and parties; flexibly choose all the best decisions of all parties and parties, not just one party. The administrative government sets up administrative agencies at the city/county (district) level, under which they appoint offices, namely township offices, town offices, and grassroots village offices and street offices. The parliamentary government and the Leoch government only have the provincial level and above. Not established; there is a permanent "patrol team" by the parliamentary government and the Leoch government, which needs to patrol according to the case, and is temporarily stationed in the county (district) government under its jurisdiction. The parliamentary government and the Leoch government can use the Internet extensively for affairs and cases (such as case registration) . To simplify the complex and bloated Western-style institutions, the concept of administrative government as "management" must have cities and counties (districts); parliamentary government and Leoch government are concepts of "legislation" and "judicial", and the Internet and its videos can be fully utilized , Streamline administration and reduce staff and abolish its city, county (district) level institutions.
      6. Candidates registered under the jurisdiction of various parties, factions, associations or personal identities can compete for members of the central parliament government and provincial assembly governments after qualification review. They are elected by the people within the jurisdiction and do not require imperial examinations. No limit. The chief and deputy heads of the parliamentary government are elected by the current members with the most votes. The total number of members of the parliamentary government plus the heads and deputy heads of the provincial assembly governments is equivalent to the number of people in the "triple government" joint meeting of the parliamentary government and the Leoch government.
     7. The main members of the Leoch government, academicians, examiners, prosecutors and judges, and the main members of the Leoch government of each province (special zone) shall be ranked according to the ranks of those who have passed the new imperial examination. For the results of the new imperial examination subjects and corresponding subjects, you can refer to the doctoral degree major or occupation of the original prestigious school. Volunteer files will be processed by computer regularly in the prescribed order, and then appointed after the list is made public. No elections, no appointments, no responsibilities, only serve the country in accordance with the Constitution and laws, and exercise rulings on all cases that do not need to be decided by the "Tripartite Government" joint meeting. It is different from Western governments and has judicial power. Supervision and inspection power is more decentralized and independent. Officials and assistants of various departments, academicians, examiners, prosecutors and judges will retire after a four-year term. Back to the Leoch government, you can accept the appointment of the Leoch government "inspection team", or other appointments other than the chief and deputy chief executive officer of the administrative government.
    8. The legislative proposals of the three governments can be submitted by a simple majority and each government participates in the review. The government proposal can be submitted to the government for amendment and then submitted to the government for review. One or more than two-thirds of the legislative proposal will be repealed; The Bank of Communications government can make amendments and then submit them to the government for review and repeal one or more than two-thirds of them; the government can submit the proposals to the government first, and the government can make amendments. The government can also make amendments and then return to the government to review the first amendment. The original proposal passed by more than two-thirds of the proposal; the proposal passed by the government of more than two-thirds does not need to be submitted to the other two governments for direct review. The proposal is finally approved by the government and signed by the prime minister. The final rulings of constitutional amendments, referendums, impeachment of prime ministers and deputy prime ministers, and the resignation of members of the presidium must be passed by at least two governments. The chairman must be convened by the"Tripartite Government" joint meeting. The second is voted through; the impeachment case of each provincial governor (or the mayor of a special zone) is proposed by at least two local governments, and the prime minister must pass it by more than two-thirds of the local ""Tripartite Government" joint meeting"; major provincial (special zone) cases and municipalities The impeachment case of the mayor of the Chang County and the mayor shall be passed by at least two provinces (special zone) through a vote. The governor of the province (special zone) shall convene it and must pass more than half of the local ""Tripartite Government" joint meeting".
       8. The legislative proposals of the three governments can be submitted by a simple majority, and each government participates in the review; the proposal passed by the parliamentary government more than two-thirds is directly reviewed; the proposal of the "executive government" is first submitted to the "Leoch government" and then to the parliament Government"; Proposals from "Leoch government" are first handed over to the "Executive Government" and then to the "Parliamentary Government"; proposals from "Parliamentary Government" are first handed to the "Leoch Government" and then to the "Executive Government"; proposals can be transferred with amendment ; The proposal is finally reviewed by the parliamentary government and signed by the prime minister. If the visa is refused, it will automatically take effect after ten days. Constitutional amendment, referendum initiation, the recall of the prime minister and deputy prime minister, the resignation of the presidium, etc., the final ruling of a very major case must be passed by at least two governments and must be passed by more than two-thirds of the "triple government" joint meeting; all provinces The long-term recall proposal shall be proposed by at least two local governments through a vote, and must be passed by more than two-thirds of the local "triple government" joint meeting; major provincial cases and the mayors, county chiefs, district heads, and mayor recall proposals are proposed by at least two provincial governments. More than half of the "Triple Government" joint meeting passed.
     9. The members of the Bureau have no power. Among them, the recently retired prime minister and deputy prime minister are the country’s "chairman" and vice-chairman. After the term of the "chairman" and vice-chairman of the country expires, they will be members of the "presidium" for life, and the other three heads of government will also serve as members of the "presidium". Be a courtesy envoy and independent investigative report, and participate in voting for very large cases.
      10. The New Deal is a three-type election system in which popular elections and imperial examinations are separate and integrated; it is not only in compliance with public opinion but also standardized in academic theory, but also conducive to "theoreticians" who are talented and not good at words; "activists" who are eloquent and eloquent; And, talented and eloquent. The elections and imperial examinations of the New Deal are not restricted by age, surname, nationality, party, rich or poor, image, and eloquence. They are fair and reasonable, far stronger than the current Western elections.
     11. The Peaceful New Deal complements the democratic system. All so-called democracy so far has been guided by only those powerful parties and interest groups. The wise men who stand out by the imperial examination and popular election are representatives of public opinion and academic theory, not A representative of a political party, association, sect or interest group.
      12. All ethnic groups and regions with their own characteristics have full autonomy. As long as the smallest group is the smallest ethnic group or the smallest region, as long as the "wise" is selected, the prime minister, chairperson, and Leoch, etc. can be produced. The greatest possibility; far more ideal than the current Western elections , Highlighting equality and justice. Neighbors that have been attached to or supported by the public in history can enter this Greater China Peace New Deal, unconditionally protect their military, rescue and economic assistance, etc., and have the right to stand for election and full autonomy. The whole world follows the example of this New Peace Deal and shares great unity, which can be extended and expanded into a "community" for the New Peace Deal.
     The party is not in power and the army is not in politics for the same reason. It makes the world peaceful, avoids social tearing and political changes, and is peaceful and safe. The combination of Chinese and Western, incomplete party politics, high IQ groups, and wise people governing the country. The real ideal and advanced new political system that is superior to the current Western democratic system allows the Chinese to truly feel and surpass what the Americans have always felt, to the country, society and politics The self-confidence and pride of the system, and set an example for the world including the United States! It is also a milestone for the world to truly enter a new century of peaceful civilization.

【52】王沪宁拟订处理港台和钓鱼岛等问题的“统一大业政策领导小组”打台湾剑上弓弦
据内悉日前王沪宁指示中共中央政策研究室常务领导拟订表面目的是处理港台和钓鱼岛等问题的“统一大业政策领导小组”两套方案，“统一大业政策领导小组”王沪宁为组长，备用方案取名为“统一大业领导小组”，组长习近平副组长王沪宁。同时据悉北戴河会期间习近平和王沪宁是受冲击的最主要对象，北戴河会一结束王沪宁高调露面后立即拟订成立“统一大业政策领导小组”，真实目的是随时准备以武统打台湾为自己脱危解困。我早就指出王沪宁策划任期修宪，旨在接习近平的班是最大受益人，习近平则是任期修宪唯一受害者。王沪宁策划打垮所有派系包括习的根基太子党，策划改变太子党基地香港，目的就在于此，接习近平的班，夹着尾巴做作清廉蓄谋数十年。最后高调豁出，卷袖解衣最后一搏，他深知全面树敌，故从不敢出门在公众公开露天场合露面，怕太子党和被打江派暗杀，也怕被他策划针对西方的生化武撼病毒害的最惨的美国斩首。(详请搜索:郝雪森20.8.18

【49】双管齐下解体中共有绝招
最快解体中共的关键人物是习近平，最能左右这无知无能虚荣愚蠢的习近平的关键人物是他女儿习明泽，只要对习明泽的工作做到位，中共必即解体。由于习近平因武汉生化病毒害死全球二十余万人及中国的也不下于二十万人，这死者家属几百万亲人在全球必有复仇者，习近平国内仇人则更多得惊人。他更不敢将习明泽留在国内，所以将她隐姓埋名送美国哈佛继续读书，并由几个特工24小时暗地保护。但这种危险还是很大，美国川普总统应将习明泽接出送“国安部指定陪读教授的网上哈佛教室”严密监管下网上读书，防止复仇者或绑架团伙。直至习近平提出接回国，并同意解散中共和交出谋划决策的三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁等则更好。当然，如果习公开表示不同意定期解体中共的“罪后通帖”，川普则随时将习明泽从安全部保护室赶出门，并不对其安全负责，相信习近平绝不会不顾这最疼爱的女儿的安全。若习明泽还未来美开学，则来后再实施这〝国安部指定陪读教授的网上哈佛教室”防复仇者或绑架团伙计划，习近平已有人类前所未有的天大罪恶，习明泽在哈佛实地上学绝对不安全。第二绝招是，给习近平定期解散中共交出战犯王沪宁等的〝罪后通帖”的同时，指出违则联合全世界要求中共赔偿的国家一起，冻结中共历届官员的境外全部资产！中共内斗猛爆，双管齐下 何愁中共不解体乎？(详请搜索:郝雪森20.5.2

【48】中共北京两个对立中央
三天前我在网上发文“王沪宁被软禁？孙力军是被反习高端合谋抓捕的”,昨天得知香港镇压反送中学生的警官被抓,而且是发生在习中央刚抓李柱铭等香港民主人士之后,突显中共北京已是两个中央。多数媒体对抓香港警官困惑而认为抓李柱铭等是江派所为，其实习为其家族利益，早在定为一尊前就将香港牢牢控制在手中，有特务孙力军监港韩正敢抗习？抓李柱铭等凶猛之举是为被软禁的王沪宁解困？这个反习中央得以作出相对反应发令抓警官，是与被习打压的前38军调换控制中南海这一明显反习之举有关。王沪宁可能被软禁中南海还有一迹象,就是习近平27日的深改委13次会议，习可能不是在北京主持的视频会议。原来全是王沪宁班子撰稿的常是长篇大论卖弄大学问的习讲话，与这次短短的讲话完全不同，这次还大都是摘于旧稿，如此大会讲稿，明显没有与王沪宁碰过头。还有，王沪宁操控的央视也失控反常，新闻联播破天荒大骂美国现任国务卿，与习命运捆绑的王沪宁的决策班子，不可能让习在国际舞台上乱上加乱，央视王的人马见王被软禁而恐慌歇斯底里？
不仅习王的忠实走狗孙力军可能是被反习中央抓捕，而且习的两得力干将，傅政华的悬念，和王小洪最关键特重要的北京公安局长一职的免去，都是反习中央所为的可能性很大。(详请搜索:郝雪森20.4.29

【47】王沪宁被软禁？孙力军可能是被反习高端合谋抓捕的
孙力军在香港和新彊等问题上为习表现得最卖力,是最忠实的走狗,也是安全系统派往武汉的最高官员,主要负责P4试验室的保密和负责真假习近平到访武汉的重任,习绝对信任他。再者,习一个多月没在北京露面,绝大部分时间在外省,若他要抓孙力军必定要与王沪宁碰头商讨。因为孙力军从上海调北京负责安全系统,这兼管的大特务头子三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁一定起了重要作用。去武汉掩盖王策划实施的生化武器这天大的秘密用别人也不放心,可见孙对习王来说最忠实可信,不太可能是习下今抓捕。亲胡锦涛被习打压的王牌38军换守北京中南海明显是反习举动,善谋的王歧山立即露面,习一个多月未回京。很可能赵乐际在胡锦涛、李克强、汪洋和王歧山等支持下,抓了孙力军,报习抓赵乐际手下的一箭之仇。对孙罗列的罪名也罕见,“对习近平不知敬畏”明显是低级红。或许王沪宁也被38军软于禁中南海,二十多天未露面。4月初38军进京,没对习采取任何行动,让习外出是不作最后全面摊牌。软禁王沪宁逼不了习弃王,因为生化武器把习王捆绑在一起。反习势力再抓捕孙力军对习王就是致命威胁,孙不一定会和王沪宁一样守口如瓶。一来孙不是生化武器的策划实施者,二来孙很清楚自己被往死里整比惩罚王沪宁简单容易得多。习近平有三个最关键人物：若“控制”了他女儿习明泽可令其立即下台甚至下令解散中共也会答应；斩首王沪宁，没了主意则可断他倒退极左路；孙力军的位置和职能是知习底细最多甚至可取他性命的最信任的人。反习势力抓孙从而掌握习王制造生化武器的把柄是一步好棋,也许只有王歧山想得出。逼习近平下台或退居二线并同意将王沪宁交国际法庭,否则公开生化武器秘密,习则必伴同王沪宁一起扛罪,给全世界一个交代,中共或许可逃脱。(详请搜索:郝雪森20.4.26

      任志强先生出于良知和爱民之心所为，却犯了一个很可能是他致命的错误，他明知习近平文化低智力差和心眼小，却把矛头直接指向实际上只是王沪宁之傀儡的习近平，这就不用王多说习必会跳脚严惩任志强。如果任志强直接把矛头指向王沪宁，习碍于王歧山等高层政要红二代和众知名人士们，王沪宁是无法唆使习抓捕任志强的。而且，任志强若能号召打倒王沪宁，必断了习的极左路，可避免疯狂的王沪宁毛极左策施的种种毒计或不断的生化武器危害中国和世界。(详请搜索:郝雪森20.4.1

       世人包括中共高层都知道倒退是绝对没有出路的必然是祸国和亡党,而对中共来说若政改选择西方模式就也意味着亡党。随文明进步的发展,西式政治体制的弊病也越来越明显,我已在《21世纪新政宣言》中全面透彻地阐明了。最明显的例子,就是西式政体在伊拉克之类的国家就完全失败,根本无法解决誓不两立的多党多教派的执政问题。我提出的各党各派参政议政都不行政执政的不完全政党政治的《21世纪新政宣言》,就完全彻底解决了这一难题。
       但这继承和发展孙中山先生五权分立的“21世纪新政”,很明显若让各西式政体国家去实施,如同中共实施西式政体一样困难,任何党掌权执政后都不愿放弃执政地位。因此,这里提出的包括有新科举加民选并辞党派教派职务的行政机构、各党各派参加竞选的参政议政的立法机构和直接只需新科举的司法等机构的“21世纪新政”,只有包括高层都公开承认面临亡党危险的中共才可能去实施。这是唯一避免亡党而又选择了纠正西式政体弊病的新政,更可贵的是真正开始造福于人民,也有利各民族团结和两岸统一。

       昨天国际人权日发生的两件大事,一是百万法轮功学员要求法办江泽民,二是八十万港人守护香港并要求制裁特首等,其实江泽民和香港特首甚至习近平都只是应声号令的前台傀儡。
       众所周知中共近三朝党魁都是平庸之辈,特别是习近平无知愚蠢且虚荣。中共这三朝最高决策全来源于中共情报汇总与分析和决策的中央政策研究室,也就是王沪宁掌控经营几十年最不愿放弃的号称中共"大脑"的秘聚资源与人才提供最终最高决策的机构。也因此,王沪宁是不折不扣的中共三朝罪恶元凶！
      法轮功被血腥镇压前,并没有把矛头指向中共和江泽民,也并不过问政治,主张"真善忍"的宗教气功组织。对江泽民本人并不构成威胁,江没有与之为敌大树对立面的必要和现实愿望。而他一手提拔的极左王沪宁,在引其左转遭邓南巡阻止后,策划江仅经济应合邓的改革,政治则逐步倒退。支持前南斯拉夫政府导致中共使馆被炸,以掀起北京反美大游行而极左起家,以法轮功组织人员规模会超过中共等理由泡制了血腥镇压法轮功的一系列最高决策。法轮功在全球呼吁法办前台应声号令的傀儡江泽民的同时,更应呼吁法办幕后筹划决策的元凶王沪宁。
       香港此次遭中共血腥镇压原因起于铜锣湾书店抓人事件,习已抓人报复了也早已平息。习虽无知愚蠢,但不至于愿将这丑闻再扩大甚至惊世炒作,激起全港奋起对自己的仇视。只有王沪宁要借此一步步逼习手上粘血,与王一同反邓倒退极左,终结邓的"一国两制"。有人分析香港送中案是前朝江派作梗,其实,为习家族海外利益,专横执政七年的习近平早把香港这通往海外的桥梁牢牢掌握。江派出身的韩正现在也必定按习意旨办事,,唯一有能力就此大作文章的也只有背后操控习的王沪宁。港人呼吁制裁特首等官员,更应呼吁制裁王沪宁,反共反习更要呼吁打倒三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁。
       美国的维护人权制裁中共官员也应首选制裁王沪宁,王从20年前策划支持前南斯拉夫政府导致使馆被炸而策划反美大游行开始,一直不忘极左初心,牢记反美使命：支持国际恐怖组织反美,长年在边境庇护塔里班使之无法被灭,近年便公开接待之;多次金王的密谈而破坏川金会谈的正面成果;策划一带一路梦想与美争夺世界影响力,策划中共意识形态海外扩张,打造全球极左命运共同体;美国若不便对形式上的中共头目习近平制裁,对这中共幕后黑手王沪宁制裁应不是问题,难道上述罪证还不足矣?!(详请搜索:郝雪森12.9

【34】川普眼下若不支港人灭共必将被历史彻底弹劾：
中共的倒行逆施被世人彻底看清楚,美国众议院通过的香港人权与民主法案,摆在共和党与川普面前,是支持还是为了达成中共绝不可能履行的协议而犹豫或拖延,川普应作出明智选择。若不明确支持港人而与中共达成阶段性协定,保住了连任票仓或排除了弹劾,这眼前的胜利,让中共喘息解困,在人类历史上川普将被彻底弹劾。
我预言,中共习傀儡在王沪宁的操纵下极左倒退,很可能摧毁香港或挑起台海战乱。为阻止其继位野心和灾难,川普应按马格尼茨基人权问责法,海牙国际法庭和国际社会应开始准备对中共三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁如下反人类罪通缉审判和制裁：策划支持前南斯拉夫战犯要对中共使馆十余死者负责;策划迫害法轮功学员六四学运幸存者和策划新疆西藏等地种族残害要对全部死难者负责;必须对中共这二十余年来策划的三朝罪恶而致死的冤魂负责;必须对庇护塔里班勾结支助国际恐怖分子和红色恐怖扩张罪恶负责;必须对策划终结香港一国两制的极左倒退造成的死难者负责,必将对策划鼓吹武统台湾和未来台海战乱负责。三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁不倒党国无宁日,也威胁全世界。作为世界文明社会的领头大国的总统川普,有责任阻止中共的扩张,彻底铲除邪恶的共产主义,妥协等同投降,不打就是告败！历史必将证明这一点,容不得一时糊涂一下手软,川普身边的人,提醒一下吧,像里根终结美苏冷战一样做终结共产邪恶的英雄!而不是只求眼前利益有幸政坛一游的商人(详请搜索:郝雪森11.18

无数事实证明中共邪教是人类文明进步的最大威胁,要铲除中共首要的是让被蒙骗的大陆人觉醒和了解真相,推翻中共只有靠大陆人群起攻之。让大陆人摆脱网络"柏林墙"即网管防火墙,是让大陆人觉醒的最快途径。一旦网络防火墙被突破,中共有史以来的一切罪恶暴露无遗,中共现行的一切罪恶也全在阳光之下,中共的崩溃必随之到来！
中共为防崩溃而窃取全球高科技巩固网络防火墙,三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁操纵习傀儡极左倒退,并对外扩张,威胁全人类,全球文明发达的民主社会必须利用高科技突破中共防火墙。发起全球企业个人与政府一起捐助高科技公司,研发类似谷歌全球卫星免费上网宏伟计划的,优先针对中国大陆的更快更简便的方案研究开发和实施。全社会敦促微软和谷歌等公司,开发电脑或手机可对本地地址不使用代理服务器的翻墙软件捆绑在一起并自动升级的,中国大陆可免费使用的操作系统。瘫痪或推倒中共防火墙,加速中共的灭亡(详请搜索:郝雪森

大凡欲望最大的人必在官位最高的人身边,官位至顶其身边人欲望便至极,内斗惨烈便登峰造极。在庸人昏官身边更是如此,中共内斗最终必然波及习傀儡的幕后操盘手们。
丁薛祥最近所说维护习核心维护习中央,强调不是维护其他的或习身边的任何人任何伪核心。众所周知习傀儡身边掌控实权最可能自称中央核心的,只有实已掌控中共的常务书记三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁。王强调党管一切实是自管一切,最近又强调警队姓党是要掌控不亚于军队的警队组建私家党卫军,以彻底铲除江派团派太子党和前朝全部军头及一切异己。重组青一色的红毛极左派走其全面倒退路线,内外树敌,正是丁薛祥打击王沪宁的好机会。习身边的大内总管丁薛祥比王沪宁年轻有为岂愿落后示弱?中共内斗至此,垮台指日可待矣！(详请搜索:郝雪森11.11

【31】第五个现代化"党管一切"是加强落实王沪宁掌控中共最高权力:
实只小学毕业无知无能且虚荣的习,只是王沪宁诱以"习思想"牵着鼻子走的傀儡。王在官媒自我介绍的首要职务"书记处书记"和"政研室主任",一个是实管一切党务;  一个是使他成为三朝罪恶元凶的中共情报汇析与最高决策机构主任。习提王入常为书记处书记,让王乘机从幕后掌控跳前台直接掌控中共最高权力。
"党管一切"的第五个现代化是王沪宁策划的,为进一步加强他对中共的全面深入掌控,加强实施他的下一步：一是掌控针对对手和踢除所谓中共接班人的要害部门中纪委,其现任书记较年轻的常委赵乐际和原接班人之一胡春华已被边缘化,另一个孙政才已被踢除。最近热议的几个准接班人是他下一步踢除的目标,并且他会尽力阻止准接班人入常,若不能则利用中纪委如同调查处理赵乐际同党并最后使赵边缘化一样。王沪宁要统管一切要彻底打倒江派团派太子党和前朝军头等一切异己,夺权抢财,形成青一色全面倒退所谓初心毛极左的王沪宁路线；最后一步是实控军权,这一步是当中共或王沪宁面临绝境时,实施武统而攻打台湾,从而实控军权转移危机重建"政绩"作上位最后一搏(详请搜索:郝雪森10.29

【28】中共末日的表演：二王牵引习傀儡
从香港近况可看出,掌控情报与决策机构中共政研室的,三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁,在操纵实只小学毕业且愚蠢虚荣的习向极左倒退,引来必然灾难后,不得不由较为务实的王歧山扑火。从习在党校读王定调稿58次强调文革式"斗争",和将在四中全会宣布的未日对策定可证明这一点,确定中共末日表演常态模式:王沪宁和王歧山二王两手左右牵引习傀儡。
中共未日对策,若不是戈尔巴乔夫式垮台宣告,就只有由王沪宁操控学毛极左倒退实施红色恐怖。必然也会在大陆出现这香港式灾难,要扑火只得让亲习而务实的王歧山和刘鹤那几人出来表演。对美贸易战也会如此应付,极左救火再极左再救火,反复折腾直至下台退出记为历史。美国和各民主文明国家若强硬施压内外夹攻,中共垮台则更快,人类将真正进入全球和平文明新世纪。(详请搜索郝雪森9.7

【27】眼下是川普施压彻底击垮中共的最佳时机
川普与多数国家可对中共实施包括经济金融的全面制裁和冻结中共及决策层境外资产,会有两点充分理由：1，美中贸易战眼下两种可能:中共十一前会掀起极左高潮,继续意识形态渗透扩张,以显强势拒绝美方而不达成贸易协议;或是,虚假达成协议后不履行,拖延违约耍赖。川普和多国为防中共极左危害世界应与其贸易脱钩,全面制裁中共及其决策层并冻结其境外资产。理由2，中共会指令香港(回归至今违约非普选出的)伪港府伪特首和潜入共警,更残酷镇压大抓捕抗争民众并部分押送大陆落实"送中"中止一国两制,川普和多国更有理由全面制裁中共和中港决策层并冻结其境外资产。
这样中共立即会一片恐慌引发前所未有的内斗和内乱,很可能年内就崩溃。加之三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁十一更会将极左潮推至顶峰,不呼"习万岁",也会叫"习近平啥思想万岁"之类,使习遭党国内外唾弃。王想乘乱作最后一搏,寻机正式接管中共,从几十年的幕后掌控改上前台直接掌控,其疯狂的"初心"使其妄想完成全球极左命运共同体的"使命"。中共的大动荡和全面崩溃已在眼前,就看川普是否有此政治远见和胆略,乘机内外夹攻而必定终结中共。(详请搜索郝雪森8.30

【23】三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁
----大陆修宪香港恶法台湾武统朝鲜毁约美中冷战等都是王沪宁愚弄习思想极左命运共同体的大策划
    中共窃国这半个多世纪所犯下的滔天罪恶，前期是毛泽东策划的，中期6.4前后是邓小平策划的，后期是毛的极左追随者三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁策划的。
    王沪宁高小肆业因文革政治和情报需要保送“学院外语班“红色仕途翻身，所以王的本质是极左的。他是在上海底层弄堂长大的，因其本性也促成其瘪三下三滥个性，所以也都说他有易主“变色龙””哈巴狗“的天性。大陆像王沪宁这样学马列政治所谓"法学"专业的人，在除朝鲜古巴所有国家特别是在文明发达国家是无法找到专业对口工作必定失业，唯独在大陆却是重用的紧缺“人才”，6.4后中共信仰大危机更是最重用的救党“人才”。这也就是像王沪宁此类工农兵假“大学生”平步青云的原因，他们最熟悉毛泽东历次运动的宫庭内斗经验手段和残酷的阶级斗争等暴力恐怖的“政治学”。王沪宁能平步青云靠他这马毛伪“政治学”资本和头衔，不是什么真才实学，能干实事有点真才实学的或许在他手下的谋士及秘书班子中可以找到。王沪宁的“真才实学”只不过是一个只读四年小学的人，大半辈子在社会上磨炼特别是在中共官场滚打炼出的的手段和经验而已，他和习近平等保送的工农兵假“大学生”都一样，无法从事原“专业”都凭红资本而从政。六四学运期间各界一边倒支持学生，王沪宁一度去法国躲避和筹谋，他还加入了反学运签名，成为极少有的反学运者仕途突显，在六四和苏联垮台后中共意识形态危机，江泽民上台看上唯一能应急的王沪宁聚谋士泡制的"稳定统一领导"和之后的"新权威"谬论。左转被邓小平南巡阻止后，王策划顺邓经济改革却将政治改革逐步全面终止和倒退，泡制“三个代表”为极左转建立庞大牢固的红色既得利益集团。因此六四后各重大决策和危机难题都摆在中共中央政策研究室王沪宁桌面上，使王沪宁成了此后中共三朝都无法摆脱的幕后最有决策性实权的人，中共中央政策研究室是王为其野心巨资经营几十年，聚众谋士的间谍情报汇总研究的特务机关和策划制定决策重要机构与基地，王沪宁本人和决定其仕途关键的首任岳父及家属就有情报工作背景。中央政研室重要到王沪宁入常后为了死抓这中共情报与决策大权，宁可放弃国家副主席和中央党校校长。后再加个除习外唯他担任的中共几核心领导小组之一的“不忘初心牢记使命”主题教育工作小组组长。此后他把持的舆论必将以宣传“不忘初心牢记使命”为主，打造众所周知的所谓“习思想”其实是”王思想“。王自从主导中央政研室开始决策后，策划中止邓小平的与美妥协路线回归毛极左的反美路线。帮助前南斯拉夫提供情报打落美机放中使馆引发炸使馆事件，以此掀起六四后唯一的全国大规模游行并借此反美而起家。后又帮江泽民提供法轮功会是超过中共组织的情报，策划决策镇压迫害开始并没有把矛头指向江的法轮功群体，策划决定阻止党内外近三十年来平反六四的呼声。
    胡温时期，王鼓吹与江派“和谐”，使胡温时期一直延续江时王的路线。而后亦只小学水平虚荣且蠢的习近平上台，给王沪宁更大机会公开大倒退。共党现在主要有三派,一是新组滥竽充数的习派，一是江派,另是团派。在大野心家王沪宁心中，江派和团派现没有接班的可能，习派和习的根基太子党也竟然被王政治边缘化。中共政权若没因党外而崩溃，党内只有去习才能大权变更完成王的野心。习近平若突发事件中学毛邓江镇压而双手沾血，必定会走到尽头。党内能收拾残局的只有三朝不倒的王沪宁，江派和团派都不会让对方取代习，一惯突显八面玲珑“不结帮派”的“变色龙”王沪宁渔翁得利。因此，重大突发事件如港“反送中”和大陆民众的抗争正是王沪宁学毛唯恐天下不乱而冒尖的机会，必定暗使习近平沾血镇压走向“自杀”，施计取而代之。不能的话，其极左路线被揭穿和挫败后，特别是朝鲜恼火他的教唆而使他失去唯一危机外逃地之后，这“变色龙”今后可能急变脸右转，甚至学普金窃取倒共成果，王除此绝无其他任何机会。
    王沪宁还策划帮助朝鲜核导实现拥核，多次金王密谈而毁川金会谈使朝鲜上当而一度疏远中共。王还多次与塔利班等国际恐怖组织密谈，中共是苏垮台后全球最大恐怖组织，种种事实证明名“无”其实的全球恐怖组织的幕后总后台，是三朝罪恶元凶中共谍报机关及决策机构中共政研室掌门王沪宁。为什么美国几十年未剿尽小小塔利班残余，我断言他们常躲与阿接壤的中国境内。塔利班和朝鲜是最合王沪宁极左专制恐怖口味的。还策划资助委瑞内拉劝说古巴企图策划全球反美阵容，策划“新共产国际大会”和马毛邪教传播输出及习独裁的“中国梦”。策划修宪破除邓后的接班制全面回归红色独裁专制，策划一带一路浮夸“国造2025”吹嘘“厉害我的国”。中共政策研究室根据情报分析制定决策，要赶上美国唯有扩大黑客网军抢窃美尖端技术，实施千人计划和留学生情报队伍，及逼迫外企尖端技术转让。甚至疯狂到超文革，红色教育从幼儿园娃娃抓起并渗透香港教育，妄想红色王朝在国际上领先崛起。策划破坏美中贸易谈判, 鼓吹新“长征”还要求用学习毛泽东著作与美打贸易战。引来美方冻结贪官境外资产断了外逃路，摆出与美国“决一死战”姿态，策划严控网络严管民众回归毛时的闭关锁国过紧日子的红色恐怖。破坏邓小平的香港“一国两制”扶持傀儡港首泡制恶法，日本G20前习一出国王令党媒大反美。“送中”恶法出笼正是针对习玩女人一书抓港人“合法”化的高极黑做法，习玩女人一书立即炒热。一来搞臭习近平，二来逼习反美极左转至悬岩边，G20时习无法起程无法与美及国际社会和解。王沪宁还策划制定武统台湾的與论准备和决策计划等等，愚弄引诱习做统领全球极左命运共同体的“世界领袖”。王罪大恶极与毛邓江李有一拼，有些没头脑的人易被隐谋多年的王沪宁那“夹着尾巴做人”所蒙蔽，这足以证明王水平文化和人格低劣，将低俗戏言捧作“座右铭”，王沪宁承认有见不得人的尾巴而要夹着是不让人给揪着踩到，他这水平文化也不可能写出虽荒谬较系统的“三个代表”“科学发展观”“习思想”之类，这都是政研室谋士们之作。。
    当务之急是全国上下并促共党内部一起欣起捣王高潮，彻底打倒王沪宁，清算其历经三朝的罪恶。王沪宁愚弄习助长毛派，倒了江派团派和邓家，也捣了习的根基太子党，内外树敌公愤极大下场必定最惨。毛泽东死前没有遭清算是中共还未倒，但在最后一次新冷战的决战中王一定会最惨！美国应对全球恐怖国际总后台王沪宁制裁和通辑， 操纵习近平的三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁不倒，不仅中国大陆无宁日，世界也面临中共新法西斯的威胁！(详请搜索郝雪森2019.6.12

第二,《全球马格尼茨基人权问责法》对犯有侵害人权或贪腐的外国官员可以实施冻结其在美资产等制裁,。由于中共历届高官及家属把持大陆经济命脉贪腐世人皆知,违反美国对几国制裁的也是他们的私家公司,其侵犯人权更是世界之最。政府下步落实上述问责法条款有无计划和行动是否冻结他们的非法所得资产？我呼吁有知情权的国会社会各届和国民,敦促政府就这两个问题作以表态解释和制定纠错计划,如颁布"中共官员腐败和侵犯人权的问责规定"。因为这些是为了世界和平,能给中共内乱升级而解体的最致命打击的关键策略,将利于终结共产邪恶,建立世界和平新秩序从而载入史册。(郝雪森

【19】短评一，刘昕仕途暗淡
从刘昕几天停职准备和中宣部外交部及官媒造势来看，中美主播辩论原是要直播的，忽然改为对话并不直播很可能是刘夫妇的原因，刘的德国丈夫若为孩子考虑也不希望为明知的没落政权如此大露锋芒。所以刘昕一开口就否认是中共党员声明不为中共说话，刘仕途若此后而止将佐证这点。(郝雪森

【17】给习总女儿习明泽的公开信
习明泽小姐:你比谁都清楚你父亲的学识和能力,能影响他决策的只有他身边的人和你。他目前学毛极左独裁,一定是听信了王沪宁。但唯有你会真心为你父亲考虑,你在美国多年,传说你现在就在美国学习。应该明确主政者选择民主或独裁的区别和最终命运,这不仅对你父亲和家庭很重要,而且对我们的祖国乃至全世界也极为重要。你父亲被王沪宁等弄得焦头烂额,精神压力极大,发展下去很危险,要让你父亲解脱唯有顺世潮随民意。身为党魁要放弃这独裁的党政虽不容易,但这也是转变后能让世人原谅的理由。要回头先要严惩三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁,重新回归你祖父开启的改革开放,全面政治体制改革,融入世界文明民主社会,这才可留名青史。
若知错不改你父亲必是屈指可数的历史罪人,想必你不希望如此。你父亲身边的人与你的想法就一定不同,因为你应该不会有他们那般巨大的权力欲望。然而能让你父亲清醒的只有你,你在他心中的份量应该是他人无法相比。你最可能使你父亲转变,告诉你父亲,他不转变你就不回国或不回家。找个地方躲起来,党魁女儿申请政治庇护出个世界奇闻也未尝不可,也可载入史册。如果你不这样会后悔一辈子,不信,也不容等着瞧!(郝雪森

【16】若用这三张王牌中共必垮川普成为终结共产邪恶的英雄必赢得连任
王沪宁愚弄习近平学毛极左倒退,使中共面临全面崩溃边缘。若川普用以下三张王牌施压,中共绝对熬不过两年而垮台。
首先是贸易战要尽快升级,与中共谈判别抱丝毫幻想,中共从不可信,只有以失信违约尽快升级制裁甚至加以40%关税,让中共先经济快速崩溃；第二是多渠道促其社会动荡,频繁暴发较大规模的民众抗争；第三是最致命的大王牌,即挑起中共内斗加剧升级,中共高官普遍贪腐且绝大部分资产已转国外,这大王牌是尽快启动对中共贪腐高官境外资产的冻结。先选择几员开刀即可震撼整个贪腐的高层,内斗必升级加速崩溃,会非常见效。最好在习家族、极左的王栗家属和江李红色权贵中,选几员冻结其境外资产,中共内部必大乱而崩溃。美方制裁的几个国家得到中共暗助的主要是这些权贵家族公司,以此为由对其海外资产冻结顺理成章。
若川普让步或达成缓解协议,让中共喘息而又未解决不公平贸易,对川普明年11月竞选连任极为不利。只有利用贸易战升级、促使大陆动荡及内斗加剧中共迅速垮台,美国和盟友打赢终结共产主义邪恶的冷战,川普便成为英雄载入史册,连任必成定局（祥请搜索:郝雪森

【15】王沪宁如此策划令习近平再活不过两年
习实是小学毕业保送工农兵"大学"坐飞机,比毛泽东初中肆业还差。故毛习都不敢临场答记者问,离秘书稿讲话必出错。王愚弄习学毛一明显不同的是,毛很少公开露面,无紧张的精神压力,故活过80岁,文明国家换届也为免于过重精神压力。但三朝罪恶策划元凶王沪宁,令习频繁开会出访开会讲话,与毛的精神压力大不相同。最近传出的习讲稿可看出,习有持续严重精神恐慌。习从政讲话几十年,连讲稿常用词"谨向"'"衷心""会晤"""体系""难民"等小学生大都认识的字,已读几万遍还记不住须注音于稿。有人难信认为高级黑,我说习已有持续严重的精神恐慌病态心理。习这几年衰老很快,面黄暗无血色,白发甚多。也许是其女的"形象"策划,近年渐露少许白发作假使人心理感觉"真实"。
王若再策"习思想"古今中外一绝出口乃名言,加重习精神压力,预言年近七十的习熬不过两年随时随地粹死。王策划修宪旨在不明确安排习的接班人,习死后常委中可能掌大权的是王。王久谋从不入帮派三朝不倒都易接收,但江派和团派都绝不会让对方主政。王筹谋几十年的野心可能实现,除了习死乱局中高人涌现,激民起思变而走向民主。（祥请搜索:郝雪森

【14】美中贸易战谁胜谁负,只需看中共是否仍然推行王沪宁极左路线
美中贸易谈判过程中和履行协议期间,中共不肃清而是仍然推行王沪宁学毛文革极左路线 ,这时与之达成协议而不是加紧惩罚中共则是最大失败。美方要求中方结构性改革,中方只是书面承诺却行动仍向极左倒退,达成这种协议美方就是投降。
中共三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁一惯极左仇美,中共若不肃清其路线,倒退拒绝政改,继续内外号召反美,支持反美国家,打击西方民主自由世界,企图一路称霸世界,是极端危险的。中共从不循规蹈矩 ,有极左的中共世界必乱无经济秩序可言。眼下只需看中共是否有意釆纳其党内"平反六四"的意见,对六四学运人士的打压是否加剧,就可看出中共有无改的诚意。
面对倒退的中共,美国和西方世界唯有团结一致对付它。除了大陆不断暴发突发事件危急中共,外部世界只有在经济上施压能起作用,如果这一点也放弃,绝无胜算可言。是考验川普有无里根的政治远见智慧和魄力的时候,也是能造就人类终结共产邪恶的世纪英雄之时刻。在此贸易战掀起意识形态冷战的关键时刻,希望川普留名于史的是一代伟大的政治家,而不是只图眼前商场利益而有幸官场一游的商人。祥请搜索: 郝雪森

中共自六四政治危机和前苏东欧垮台的信仰危机后,江泽民等中共领导人全靠王沪宁的诡辩“理论”撑门面维持一直动荡的政局,法轮功并没有把矛头指向江泽民等中共领导人.中共领导人都是没经竞选的众所周知的庸人,特别是习近平,竟然是没念过初高中的小学毕业生，文革上的工农兵大学和在职校外马列法学博士更是极假.江泽民等中共领导人之所以会用残酷镇压手段,实际上是听信了中共政策研究室王沪宁对政治的分析后,幕后操作江泽民等对法轮功和六四事件延续三届二十余年的定调和阻止翻案,及在朝核问题都是耍王沪宁阴阳两面法,并正在逐步倒退至去毛臭标签的文革意识形态.…

Getting nowhere: VR implementation fucking sucks

I'm still VERY much against this whole "sentient" camera.
This is FUCKING RETARDED, in so many ways !

Think about it :
You make a FPS controller. But instead of moving the player,
and just attaching a camera on its head, you move the camera
instead, and try to reattach everything to the camera on
each frame.
Does it sound sane to you ?
Well, that's how VR system actually work on Godot... And
other engines too, it seems.

It's SOOO stupid. Seriously, camera are supposed to be FIXED
to some place. I'm okay with Tilting, a little less about
pivot. But moving around should NOT move the camera. It
should move the character, on which the camera is attached !

And no, offseting the ARVROrigin every time IS NOT a way to
go.

This whole system is stupid and really need an internal
rework... That said, I'd like to at least release SOMETHING...

The last straw being that the camera position is ALWAYS
relative to last "centering" call. So you cannot try to
regain distance between the player and the camera, if the
camera is moving away, because the camera position is
ALWAYS relative to your current room and the latest
centering call, regardless of the player position or
whatever.
I might still have to try with absolute positions
and see how it kind of work, but I don't think it's going
to work well.

Also, RenIK failed on two other models, so it's unusable.
The only model on which it kind of worked was the KemoonoFriends-Tora
model, but it still could not pull the arms correctly and
had this noodle arm issue, where the forearms try to fold
on themselves when the target was too near, instead of
flexing the elbows back to touch the targeet with the hands.

So, yeah, back to ZombieIK with a camera system that suck
ass. Yay...
No ETA at this point, I need to focus on anothe project
before resuming this one, and I have no idea on how I'm
going to settle these issues.

Meanwhile, WebXR has been added to Godot, so I might
add WebXR support ASAP, once OpenXR support is handled
remotely correctly.
I'm not holding my breath for WebXR, since Linux implementations
are unavailable.

Apply transform to constrain RBFKernel lengthscale in LCEMGP (#643)

Summary:
## Motivation

This adds a transform to `UniformPrior` in `LCEMGP` class to convert real values to constrained values in `[0, 2]`. Otherwise, with distribution validation enabled (which will be the default once https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48743 is merged), this throws an error in `Uniform.log_prob` method. We were facing this issue in an internal FB test that uses botorch.

While this fixes the specific issue, my thinking is that this transform should ideally be applied automatically within `gpytorch.priors`. That said, my understanding of the codebase is very limited, so would love to hear others' thoughts on this.

### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?

Yes

Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/pull/643

Test Plan:
Turned `Distribution.set_default_validate_args(True)` and succesffully ran `test_contextual_multioutput.py: ContextualMultiOutputTest.testLCEMGP` with a fixed seed and increased `maxiter` (this test fails without the fix).

How to save aliases when using fish shell

First, apologies if I have submitted two pull requests, I'm not a developer and this is my first time contributing to something that isn't my personal repository.

This is something I initially found confusing. I installed fish shell based on a recommendation online and didn't realize that the alias command behaves differently. It creates the alias just as bash would but only for the current session. I think that many newcomers that happen to have fish installed may become confused that when their aliases are gone the next session.

If you are interested it may be nice to add a section on fish shell here as I personally find it a great "quality of life tweak". If you are interested let me know and I can draft something up.
