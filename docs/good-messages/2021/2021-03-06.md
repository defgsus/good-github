New data: 2021-03-05: See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (BC, MB, ON, QC, SK).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “10 new deaths, for a total of 10,455 deaths: 3 deaths in the last 24 hours, 5 deaths between February 26 and March 3, 1 death before February 26, 1 death at an unknown date.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

Started Adding Farmhouse Code

Added new events allowing Alex to ask the player to stay the night at the farmhouse if they are dating. (Should be also based on Alex's love, but that code isn't working for some reason.)

Also added the beginnings of code allowing player to sleep at the Farmhouse! Still need to do a ton of work on this, but the start is there. (Need to add a scene where Alex gives you the key, add how said key affects things like Alex being locked in the house, make a button so you can get in when not directly invited, etc.

1856: Fix 4247 (small fixes + first unit test)

I had some trouble with the relatively bigger CGR train borrow PR with
  getting everything working in the unit test there so I decided
  that making some shorter PRs to clean up the small edge cases
  so that I can get some rules-correct unit tests in would make my
  life less painful

Docker: fixed sudoers username

You have no idea what I went through to find this as this commit is
probaby a force push deleting the last 7 days of my life from Gits
history (~20 pushes).
This copy-paste error causes a error that, when googled, leads you down
a path of a recent ArchLinux image
[bug](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/69563), that seems to be the
cause, but isn't.

I've also wrote this much of a DevOps Stackexchange question, before
realizing my mistake:

```
I've been trying to migrate my CI setup from Travis to GitHub actions as I need to run it in an Arch Linux environment. This means that I have to run it in a Docker container, and that just [refused to work][1] with Travis.

So I've looked over the GitHub [actions workflow documentation][2], and [their own guide][3] on how to run a docker container via actions. There is a [complication][4], that I think stems from this [bug][5], that I need to first install the *runc* package on the host machine - meaning I need to run scripts in both the host & the container.

  [1]: https://travis-ci.community/t/unable-to-access-file-structure-of-docker-container-when-running-in-travis/11229
  [2]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
  [3]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/dockerfile-support-for-github-actions
  [4]: https://github.com/niraami/dotfiles/runs/1995551118
  [5]: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/69563
```

So yeah. Let this commit be a painful lesson...

Feature: add a dark theme

Dark themes are something I’ve sought since my early days on a computer. I remember finding a way to apply a black background to Microsoft Word 2003, then being horrified when I accidentally printed the document. In uni I scripted my desktop to boot into [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)’s darkroom mode. One of my only lasting contributions to [Signal](https://rileyjshaw.com/blog/the-pool-on-the-roof-must-have-a-leak) was loudly advocating for dark mode on iOS and Desktop, not just Android. I even [made a browser extension in 2015](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-theme-everywhere/nibjplbnmmklkfnkpecgbffkifmdbjed) to apply a dark theme to the entire Internet.

It’s not the most pressing or exciting work, but I decided my site should have a dark theme of its own. I took a lot of inspiration from my former Khan Academy teammate [Josh W. Comeau’s dark mode post](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/), with a few differences.

UI-wise, I decided to go a different route than a binary toggle between dark and light. There were three motivations behind this. From most to least important:

• I wanted to include a “system” option. Theming is still a fresh concept for most web users, so I think it’s worthwhile to expose a way to control theme, motion, brightness etc from within the webpage. But [there should _always_ be a simple way to revert back to your system’s display preferences](https://kilianvalkhof.com/2020/design/your-dark-mode-toggle-is-broken).
• I may add more options later (greyscale? low-res? melty??) and this leaves my options open and unlimited.
• I liked the animated eyeball idea.

Speaking of the animated eyeball… I’m happy with how it turned out! It was quite a deep dive, since I didn’t want to include a heavy animation library like [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) (>25kb) or [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (>90kb). **Thankfully, the coolest thing I learned while working on this feature is that [SVG has a declarative animation specification called SMIL](https://css-tricks.com/guide-svg-animations-smil/)!** It didn’t take long to pick up, and it’s very easy to work with. I’m really happy to add it to my toolkit.

Animations were the _coolest_ deep dive, but they weren’t the deepest. Back when I started building this website, I split the header into Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow (CMY) channels. They [combined subtractively](https://rileyjshaw.com/blog/your-art-teacher-lied) to make a black-ish color, which I used across the site for text. I removed that feature in late 2019, but recently added it back.

With a single theme, that’s three combinations, for a total of 7 colors. With two themes… the combinations explode a bit.

I use [mix-blend-modes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) to combine colors, of which there are limited options. For my initial color palettes, I wanted to pick three pretty primary colors (light: CMY, dark: RGB) that would blend into three pretty secondary colors (light: RGB, dark: CMY), and all blend together into something with enough contrast from the background to use as body text. Tall order! [So I built a tool for that](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/palette-test-tool), and spent a few idle hours tweaking settings until I was happy.

And the initial palettes are… pretty good? I wish I was more thrilled with the result, but there are so many conflicting requirements that it’s impossible to get a result as good as if I’d hand-picked the colors independently. I’ve done an initial a11y pass of the colors, and there are some areas of the site where I want to improve the contrast. So I’ll probably end up with a palette split between the “true” colors, and their slightly modified, more attractive cousins.

I also needed to add a global settings provider in this commit. Now that I’ve done the work for that, look forward to more settings (reduce motion, contrast preference, block embeds… cheat codes??) coming soon!

I made a few minor changes while working on this commit:

• Update a bunch of the site doodles to fit either theme.
• Share theme colors between CSS-land and JS-land. No more mismatches!
• Keep the `<Layout>` component mounted between pages. Transitions and performance will be just _sliiightly_ smoother.
• Clarify the color variables a bit; `--cb` is now `--color-blue`.
• Add theme-dynamic color variables. For instance, `--color-p1` (“primary one”) maps to `--color-red` in dark mode and `--color-cyan` in light mode.
• Update some non-standard colors (eg. scaling faders demo) to fit the new palettes.
• Super simplify state-handling in the site nav (fixes a persistent console error).
• Standardize the handling of `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.

Hope you enjoy!

#### Saturday 2021-03-06 21:22:05 by Eric Berman

Fix issue #229 and issue #235: the implementation with multiple simultaneous calls was screwing things up left and right, with multiple race conditions that actually broke issue #229.

A few kinda hacky things that solves this:
 - callsAwaitingCompletion is a count of outstanding calls for which we are awaiting results, instead of a simple true/false.  This avoids thinking that there isn't an outstanding call when in fact there is (e.g., pendingflightsforuser can return much more quickly than flightswithqueryandoffset, which results in the trigger row calling flightswithquery multiple times, which just confuses the hell out of things.  So now we use addPendingCall/removePendingCall, which sets self.callInProgress as appropriate.
- refreshOnResultsComplete: if commit flight finishes while there are still outstanding calls, we need to do one more refresh; this flag says to do so.
- activeSections: because we might refresh the table multiple times, we have a potential race condition between counting sections and mapping sections to rows, so we compute this on the count and re-use it on mapping of sections.

I'm the shit with no makeup, don't have to curl my hair up
All this booty here, mine, I'm a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
"I know I'm cute, I know I'm fly"
You ask me why? 'Cause I'm the shit
