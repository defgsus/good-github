[MIRROR] Makes stations more airtight (#163)

* Makes stations more airtight (#57535)

I've gone through delta, meta, and icebox and added some choice windoors, changed some areas around, added some more doors, and changed some other miscellaneous things.

I'll list the full changes in drop downs, for both our sakes

Delta:
<details>
Splits the central hallway into fore and aft central hallways

Adds the spaces that jut out of medbay and sci into the central hallway, rather then having them be a part of
medbay and sci

Adds medbay access locked windoors to the back desk of the medbay reception area

Adds airlocks to both the upper and lower parts of the main hallway
</details>

Meta:
<details>
Gives the storage wing another set of firelocks, and two fire alarms. It didn't have any alarms in the first place, so hopefully this helps things

Adds the spaces that jut out of medbay and sci into the central hallway, rather then having them be a part of
medbay and sci

Replaces a small bit of the science area with nanite lab, to prevent a breach near xenobio causing fire alarms
at the front of sci

Adds a windoor in front of the ORM to block air

Adds a wall behind a smart fridge in chemistry
</details>

Icebox:
<details>
Added airlocks between arrivals and the port hallway, and the escape hallway and the starboard hallway

Added a windoor between the kitchen and the bar
</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game

Cuts delta's main hallway in half, with the goal of reducing fire alarm strain. Some thoughts on this would be nice, I don't want to make everything else that uses areas worse just because fire alarms are dumb, and I'm worried that's what I've ended up doing here.

I've also added the portions of medbay/sci that jut out into the main hallway into the main hallway, I think? I could make these into lobby areas, but I'm not sure if that's appropriate or not.

Adds a few windoors and airlocks to better section off portions of the station, this should reduce the amount of mass gas spreading that can occur.

My goal here is to reduce the amount of uninteresting gas movement and make firelocks less hellish when there's a breach

(misc): Cleanup + Refactor

Overall this commit has vastly reduced the amount of stuff going on at
emacs startup. I've gone from about 700/800 features being included in
~features~ to just around 465 (including autoloads).

It's still far higher than it has any need to be but a good improvement
all the same.

Changes include:
+ Amended ~bin/tangle~ so it tries to avoid eln-cache being made in
  my user home directory... it doesn't work but it's a slight
  improvement.
+ Disable line-numbers in init.org. Apparently it improves performance.
+ Move ~eglot-maybe-connect+~ from eglot into my outer base
  configuration. Technically it doesn't work with lsp-mode yet but it's
  fine for eglot.
+ Reconfigure default reccomended modules. Included removing a few
  un-necessary ones and switching from ivy to selectrum propper.
+ Removed ruby-robe... I've never used it and solargraph seems better
  because it has a consistent LSP backed interface.
+ Switched a bunch of defvars into defconst. Hopefully the bytecompiler
  can inline them or otherwise get a performance boost.
+ Disable ~menu-bar-mode~ and ~tool-bar-mode~ directly from ~early-init.el~
+ Update titles for all headings to make them easier to jump to with
  ~consult-outline~.
  From now on try to keep headings labelled in a way where you can
  understand their meaning without knowing the value of previous or
  leading headings.
+ Reduce a bunch of compilation warnings related to unused parameters or
  free variable declarations.
+ Decouple ~goto-home-buffer~ command from dashboard.
+ Update lisp-indent-function from upstream doom! emacs.
+ Remove over-reliance on ~:defer t~ on use-package and instead make
  ~:defer t~ the default format for use-package. Now you must specify
  ~:demand t~ when you don't want things deferred.
+ Prevent automatic requiring of ~org-mode~ at startup by deferring
  ~org-link-minor-mode~ till after emacs has started.
+ Defer loading of ~org-roam-mode~.
  It's now enabled after the org-roam package is loaded... but can probably
  be autoloaded after a few second idle delay.
+ Move hydras back from ~hydras.org~ into ~init.org~.
  I initially moved them out due to performance concerns or what not but
  seeing as I can't use ~(package-yes! ...)~ clauses in ~hydras.org~ I've
  decided to bring them back... hopefully for the last time.
+ Removed the ~open-junk-file~ package.
  I've literally never used it and currently have my own junk-file setup
  courtesy of my shell.
+ Replaced custom ibuffer-icon setup with [[https://github.com/seagle0128/all-the-icons-ibuffer][all-the-icons-ibuffer]].
+ Added an initial configuration for (GNU) Info mode.
+ Added a command to move up a directory with ~find-file~ and selectrum.
+ Replaced custom xref implementation in consult with official one.
+ Moved goto-error and goto-compile-error from error map to jump map.
+ Added a command to toggle the order of eldoc-documentation-functions
  in eglot managed buffers.
  Now you can priorities errors over documentation.
+ Removed buggy flycheck configuration for eglot.
  Lets face it, it's never gonna happen.
+ Removed jupyter-notebook related configs.
  God help me if I should ever need them.
+ Replaced ~evil-magit~ with custom fork inside ~init.org~.
  The upstream maintainer seems to have left ([[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-magit/issues/87][#87]]) evil magit behind, so
  rather than installing all of evil-collection I've copy-pasted the bare
  minimum needed to get a usable magit experience.
+ Added git-forge configuration... still seems kinda buggy but it's usable.
+ Adapted ~skeletor-expand-project+~ to be more flexible with project
  directories and automatic detection of project names.
+ Removed the default skeletor project types cause I've like never used them.
+ Added the ~modern-cpp-font-lock~ package to the c/cpp module.
+ Adapted ~bibtex-insert-pdftools-link+~ to allow replacing the active
  region when active with bibtex selection.
+ Update avy faces in theme to have better contrast.
+ Update lockfile versions for straight.

Create dubstep.js

Dubstep!!!

Polycarpus works as a DJ in the best Berland nightclub, and he often uses dubstep music in his performance. Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them.

Let's assume that a song consists of some number of words (that don't contain WUB). To make the dubstep remix of this song, Polycarpus inserts a certain number of words "WUB" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighboring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including "WUB", in one string and plays the song at the club.

For example, a song with the words "I AM X" can transform into a dubstep remix as "WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX" and cannot transform into "WUBWUBIAMWUBX".

Recently, Jonny has heard Polycarpus's new dubstep track, but since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Polycarpus remixed. Help Jonny restore the original song.

Input
The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't exceed 200 characters

Output
Return the words of the initial song that Polycarpus used to make a dubstep remix. Separate the words with space.

Examples
songDecoder("WUBWEWUBAREWUBWUBTHEWUBCHAMPIONSWUBMYWUBFRIENDWUB")
  // =>  WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIEND

I found that a 4pm or other non midnight required buffering. (#16182)

* Update history_stats.markdown

---
title: History Stats
description: Instructions about how to integrate historical statistics into Home Assistant.
ha_category:
  - Utility
  - Sensor
ha_iot_class: Local Polling
ha_release: 0.39
ha_quality_scale: internal
ha_domain: history_stats
---

The `history_stats` sensor platform provides quick statistics about another integration or platforms, using data from the [`history`](/integrations/history/) integration.

It can track how long the integration has been in a specific state, in a custom time period.

Examples of what you can track:

- How long you were at home this week
- How long the lights were ON yesterday
- How long you watched TV today

## Configuration

To enable the history statistics sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: history_stats
    name: Lamp ON today
    entity_id: light.my_lamp
    state: 'on'
    type: time
    start: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration %}
entity_id:
  description: The entity you want to track.
  required: true
  type: string
state:
  description: The states you want to track.
  required: true
  type: [list, string]
name:
  description: Name displayed on the frontend. Note that it is used by Home Assistant to generate sensor's `object_id` so it is advisable to choose a unique one and change name for frontend using [customization](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/#friendly_name) or via [Lovelace](/lovelace/entities/#name).
  required: false
  default: unnamed statistics
  type: string
type:
  description: "The type of sensor: `time`, `ratio`, or `count`."
  required: false
  default: time
  type: string
start:
  description: When to start the measure (timestamp or datetime).
  required: false
  type: template
end:
  description: When to stop the measure (timestamp or datetime).
  required: false
  type: template
duration:
  description: Duration of the measure.
  required: false
  type: time
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>

  You have to provide **exactly 2** of `start`, `end` and `duration`.
<br/>
  You can use [template extensions](/topics/templating/#home-assistant-template-extensions) such as `now()` or `as_timestamp()` to handle dynamic dates, as shown in the examples below.

</div>

## Sensor type

Depending on the sensor type you choose, the `history_stats` integration can show different values:

- **time**: The default value, which is the tracked time, in hours
- **ratio**: The tracked time divided by the length of your period, as a percentage
- **count**: How many times the integration you track was changed to the state you track

## Time periods

The `history_stats` integration will execute a measure within a precise time period. You should always provide 2 of the following :
- When the period starts (`start` variable)
- When the period ends (`end` variable)
- How long is the period (`duration` variable)

As `start` and `end` variables can be either datetimes or timestamps, you can configure almost any period you want.

### Duration

The duration variable is used when the time period is fixed. Different syntaxes for the duration are supported, as shown below.

```yaml
# 6 hours
duration: 06:00
```

```yaml
# 1 minute, 30 seconds
duration: 00:01:30
```

```yaml
# 2 hours and 30 minutes
duration:
  # supports seconds, minutes, hours, days
  hours: 2
  minutes: 30
```

<div class='note'>

  If the duration exceeds the number of days of history stored by the `recorder` component (`purge_keep_days`), the history statistics sensor will not have all the information it needs to look at the entire duration. For example, if `purge_keep_days` is set to 7, a history statistics sensor with a duration of 30 days will only report a value based on the last 7 days of history.

</div>

### Examples

Here are some examples of periods you could work with, and what to write in your `configuration.yaml`:

**Today**: starts at 00:00 of the current day and ends right now.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

**Yesterday**: ends today at 00:00, lasts 24 hours.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      hours: 24
```

{% endraw %}

**This morning (6AM - 11AM)**: starts today at 6, lasts 5 hours.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ now().replace(hour=6, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      hours: 5
```

{% endraw %}

**Current week**: starts last Monday at 00:00, ends right now.

Here, last Monday is _today_ as a timestamp, minus 86400 times the current weekday (86400 is the number of seconds in one day, the weekday is 0 on Monday, 6 on Sunday).

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ as_timestamp( now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) ) - now().weekday() * 86400 }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

**Next 4pm **: ends today at 00:00, lasts 30 days. Easy one.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      days: 30
```

{% endraw %}

**Last 30 days**: ends today at 00:00, lasts 30 days. Easy one.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      days: 30
```

{% endraw %}


** 4PM always in the future**: ends in the future at 16:00, starts 24 hours before.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ (now().replace(minute=0,second=0) + timedelta(hours=8)).replace(hour=16) }}'
    duration:
      hours: 24
```

{% endraw %}

**All your history** starts at timestamp = 0, and ends right now.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ 0 }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

<div class='note'>

  The `/developer-tools/template` page of your Home Assistant UI can help you check if the values for `start`, `end` or `duration` are correct. If you want to check if your period is right, just click on your component, the `from` and `to` attributes will show the start and end of the period, nicely formatted.

</div>

Added important disambiguation to swarm mode (#10987)

* Added important disambiguation to swarm mode

This really needs to be added, I had no idea people gave up on docker/swarm because of a misunderstanding, but it's common enough we need to clarify it.

From Docker's public #swarm slack channel:
```
andrew grosser  4:45 PM
Hey @channel I am about to give a talk in San Francisco to a bunch of devops experts about swarm using my ingress and reverse proxy controller https://github.com/sfproductlabs/roo and one of the organizers said swarm was deprecated, is that so? It's so much easier than kubernetes, I can't imagine losing it.
sfproductlabs/roo
A zero config distributed edge-router & reverse-proxy (supporting multiple letsencrypt/https hosts). No dependencies.
Stars
40
Language
Go
<https://github.com/sfproductlabs/roo|sfproductlabs/roo>sfproductlabs/roo | Apr 9th | Added by GitHub
4:46
Is there something we don't know?
james_wells  4:48 PM
As of the most recent official Docker release, no Swarm is still officially part of Docker...  They merely added native support for Kubernetes
andrew grosser  4:49 PM
:pray: Phew, is there an EOL?
4:49
Thanks @james_wells
4:50
I think they going to get the grenade launchers out if I can't answer these questions
james_wells  4:51 PM
Now that is a good question and my guess is that no, there is no plan to remove it, at least before Docker 3.
andrew grosser  4:52 PM
Amazing thx, I have a system that is a startups dream and is personally saving me more than 10x using swarm, so praying it stays
bmitch:docker:  4:53 PM
Classic container deployed swarm is deprecated (I believe). Swarm mode that's integrated into the engine is still being developed by Mirantis with no EOL set.
4:53
So if someone says swarm is deprecated, make sure to ask "which swarm" they are referring to.
andrew grosser  4:54 PM
Ok thanks @bmitch
4:54
Think that's a brand thing we'll need to help change
james_wells  4:56 PM
@bmitch I am not sure I understand what you are sayin there.  Could you please explain the differences
bmitch:docker:  4:56 PM
See the disambiguation section: https://hub.docker.com/r/dockerswarm/swarm
james_wells  4:57 PM
Excellent.  Thank you sir
andrew grosser  5:02 PM
Thanks
bmitch:docker:  5:02 PM
See also this link where they are getting ready to archive the standalone swarm, aka classic swarm. https://github.com/docker/classicswarm/issues/2985#issuecomment-640486361
justincormackjustincormack
Comment on #2985 Why have all issues been closed?
The vast majority of issues were from 5 years ago when it was being actively developed, and the recent ones were all mistakes for swarmkit, other than some issues I resolved. Many were issues in components or Moby or other software and may be resolved. It is GitHubs (reasonable) recommendation that you close issues and PRs before archiving a repository so that people know they are not being worked on, and I was also looking to see if anyone came forward to say that they were still working on things or, indeed, actively using Swarm Classic.
<https://github.com/docker/classicswarm|docker/classicswarm>docker/classicswarm | Jun 8th | Added by GitHub
james_wells  5:08 PM
That is really unfortunate...  Kubernetes is simply too expensive IMNSHO, Swarm is nice and lightweight.
andrew grosser  5:08 PM
Both the different swarms point to the same point in the documentation in the disambiguation @bmitch
bmitch:docker:  5:09 PM
Swarm mode, aka swarmkit is alive and well.
andrew grosser  5:10 PM
Whoa I can see why they were confused
bmitch:docker:  5:10 PM
If you type docker swarm init you are not running classic swarm
andrew grosser  5:11 PM
Can someone inside docker add this to the swarm docs page? I think it's important
5:12
I think something talking about 2014 was EOLd but this is still current and alive would help.
bmitch:docker:  5:12 PM
Docker themselves isn't maintaining it, that team went to Mirantis, so someone over there would need to submit the PR
andrew grosser  5:12 PM
OK, could I?
bmitch:docker:  5:13 PM
Docs are in GitHub
andrew grosser  5:13 PM
Thanks

feat!: #5 STATUES

BREAKING CHANGES: Forge version / mapping updated to 35.1.37 / 20201028-1.16.3 respectively.

Work in progress. No worldgen. Dialog is missing many lines and littered with TODO errors and NOTEXTs. Would be appreciated if someone can provide footage of missing lines...

New block, Goddess Statue, with one default and two alternative looks. Can actually talk and get orbs exchanged to vessels.
Horned Statue is also redesigned. Now you talk to him to convert vessels using emeralds. Yeah :/ Not free anymore. But the first one is free, like in BotW.
New item called Anti-Vessel is added, it's creative-only consumable that returns all Heart Containers / Stamina Vessels you consumed as items. It's basically what pre-update Horned Statue did.
Vessel crafting recipe is gone. Use Goddess Statue.
Besides, yeah, just JSON-based dialog system capable of handling fairly complicated sequences and basic server-client communication, animated dialog screen(oh my god I HATE minecraft GUI system so much), datagen stuff, achievements used by horned statue, bunch of code cleanup here and there, and 2 months of my life fucking annihilated because this damn thing lmao
