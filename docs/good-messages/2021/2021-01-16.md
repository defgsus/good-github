Fix mounts being usable after a disk is ejected

This probably fails "responsible disclosure", but it's not an RCE and
frankly the whole bug is utterly hilarious so here we are...

It's possible to open a file on a disk drive and continue to read/write
to them after the disk has been removed:

    local disk = peripheral.find("drive")
    local input = fs.open(fs.combine(disk.getMountPath(), "stream"), "rb")
    local output = fs.open(fs.combine(disk.getMountPath(), "stream"), "wb")
    disk.ejectDisk()

    -- input/output can still be interacted with.

This is pretty amusing, as now it allows us to move the disk somewhere
else and repeat - we've now got a private tunnel which two computers can
use to communicate.

Fixing this is intuitively quite simple - just close any open files
belonging to this mount. However, this is where things get messy thanks
to the wonderful joy of how CC's streams are handled.

As things stand, the filesystem effectively does the following flow::
 - There is a function `open : String -> Channel' (file modes are
   irrelevant here).

 - Once a file is opened, we transform it into some <T extends
   Closeable>. This is, for instance, a BufferedReader.

 - We generate a "token" (i.e. FileSystemWrapper<T>), which we generate
   a week reference to and map it to a tuple of our Channel and T. If
   this token is ever garbage collected (someone forgot to call close()
   on a file), then we close our T and Channel.

 - This token and T are returned to the calling function, which then
   constructs a Lua object.

The problem here is that if we close the underlying Channel+T before the
Lua object calls .close(), then it won't know the underlying channel is
closed, and you get some pretty ugly errors (e.g. "Stream Closed"). So
we've moved the "is open" state into the FileSystemWrapper<T>.

The whole system is incredibly complex at this point, and I'd really
like to clean it up. Ideally we could treat the HandleGeneric as the
token instead - this way we could potentially also clean up
FileSystemWrapperMount.

BBut something to play with in the future, and not when it's 10:30pm.

All this wall of text, and this isn't the only bug I've found with disks
today :/.

        <p id="way"> Everything started when 5 best friends decided to spend their summer holiday together. No in reality we were 6. 5 of us traveled to the Batumi with train.it was 5 hour trip, at first we were so excited we played games, took funny videos and photos, ate all the snacks, made fun about other passangers, after 2 hours we got tired, we realy wanted to sleep but it was really hard because of the uncomfortable seats. The arriving time never came, time was going so slow, we were bored and at that time we saw the sea, this is the best feeling when you are seeing sea after very long time. we were so haapy that we fanilly made to Batumi, we went straight to our apartment. there is also a story of one of us who was coming from anotehr city, she took bus and we thought she woulb be in batumi way earlier than us, but turned out that she struggled more than us because she was on the ride for 7 or more hours and we arrived 2 hours earlier than herBut finally she came too and the girls trip was officially started.</p>
        
        <h2>my birthday</h2>
        <h6>07/08/2020</h6>
   <p id="bday"> After the day we arrived it was my birtday. being in batumi with my friend at my birtday was my all time dream. It was the perfect day. we dressed up, got wines and food, girls bought cake and everything was so perfect and without any expectation someone shoot the firework, we were so excited and haapy, took beutiful pictures and videos, drink and danced lot, and then we decided to go to beach it was 3 am and we bought some beers and made to the beach, we swimed a lot and listned some music, it was very fun. At this point there was also ather group of friends who had guitar and they heard that i had birthday, so they came and sang for me, it was so sweet.it really was the happiest birthday.</p>
