Update Depth3D.fx

Depth3D: Harden to help prevent cheating.                                                       -=let me know if I can do more=-

+Cursor Is now Bound to the 3D image only.
+Removed Depth Buffer Debug view to keep users from using this to cheat.
+Basic VR Compatibility added so that it can be used with VR Desktop apps.
+Basic Theater Mode added for Cellphone VR users.
+Renamed many items in the UI to help new users with controlling this shader.
+New Depth Detection Code.
+New Screen Boundary Detection added.
+Edge Handling added from SuperDepth3D

Fixed issues with the UI in Freestyle and automated many functions as I could to reduce UI clutter. The idea was to keep as much of the functionality as possible without sacrificing too much.

Fixed issues with NV System that was causing a black screen on my Testers PC. This was not easy, I had to remote into a user's pc halfway across the world since I needed someone with an NV Card that was able to help me. Seems like this may be an issue for me with porting my other shaders. Thank you, Durante - aka Dorinte & TheGordinho - aka Gordinho

The goal of Depth3D to allow users to experience the world of 3D Gaming by adding real depth to your game. -=This shader requires depth access to work=-

This shader will work with 3D TV, 3D Monitors, and the NEW VR HMDs. The VR Theater experience worth exploring in VR.
Here are two free applications for VR Headsets That I seen people use that anyone can try.
Virtual Space
https://store.steampowered.com/app/703480/Virtual_Space/
Big Screen
https://bigscreenvr.com/help/gettingstarted/sbs3d/

Older games and non-VR games can benefit from being played again with Stereo3D.
I have been working on My 3D Shader for some time now and learned how to improve things over time even with limitations. My hope is to share this experience with as many people as possible.
I would like this shader to be considered as a standard shader to be used as openly as NV discontinued 3DVision Stereo Software. Since I know many users in the 3D community still enjoy 3D gaming.

Please let me know if there is anything I can change. That can help. Thank you.

Noted Issues
One of the things that bug me with Depth3D It's hard to use for new users. So I will be making better tutorials when I have the hardware to do so for VR.

"10:45am. I am up. Let me chill a little and I will start. Not programming, but opening that sponsor page on the Spiral repo. That has been a long time coming.

I noticed last night I got a reply by scoder on the TCO issue so I need to reply to him.

Let me do my morning reading first.

11:25am.

///

> I doubt that you would see any difference whatsoever in the runtime if that C level optimisation was applied to your code.

Do you mean to say that on the toy example the performance will be dominated by the memory allocation? If that is so, I understand that. If TCO worked though, the program would not stack overflow regardless of the number of iterations.

> You are asking for tail call optimisation after (probably) just creating a new Python object, allocating memory for it and initialising it?

I am pointing out that any new objects passed in a tail call effectively block TCO because they need to be decref'd after the method returns. For TCO to work, the method call needs to be the last and not followed by a decref.

For this to be the case, Cython needs an alternative construct to the usual `cdef` methods. This is what I am asking for.

If I were doing a C backend I could fulfil all of the requirements on the Spiral wishlist for it. I could do the same with Cython if I were to compile objects to pointers and do ref counting manually, but I do not know how to deal with exceptions. Exceptions would leave pointers hanging. So I have no choice, but to make a request.

///

Let me do a reply...this is good.

11:50am. Had to take a short break. I really spent my time slacking this morning. Before I stop for breakfast, I can get a bit work done. Let me see if that display card works. Let me crack open the envelope.

11:55am. Yeah, the card is there. This one does not seem to have an expiry date.

12:10pm. Logged in. Between 2015 and now, it seems I wasted 72$ dollars just for having the account open. Those thieves took 1.2$ per month from me. My father should have drained it completely.

Well, no matter. Let me see about opening that sponsor page.

https://docs.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors

12:20pm. How disappointing. I joined the waiting list as Github Sponsors is not supported in Croatia.

Back in my trading days I had an account with Interactive Brokers, so that might have sufficed, but that has been closed for 7 years now. Should I be aiming to open an account outside the country just to get on this program? I am not sure.

I do not have much interest in this.

12:25pm. Forget this. It would have been different if I had an waiting audience for Spiral, but I'll just focus on my current plan instead.

Today I will change i32 to u32 arrays. I'll rename the modules to from `arrayu64` to `a64` and `arrayu32` to `a32`. It is really hard to keep writing out `arrayu64` every time. `array` or `list` are fine, but `arrayu64` are like 3 different words for me.

`a64` would be 2, but at least it will be concise.

12:30pm. https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#error-return-values

Oh, damn it. So this is how exceptions work in Cython. I actually hadn't even read this part of the docs. It seems that for every function that returns a primitive, I should be using except *.

Would this crush TCO? What would the performance impact of this be for that TCO loop?

```
cdef int loop_tail(int s, int i, int nearTo) except *:
    if i < nearTo: return loop_tail(s+i,i+1,nearTo)
    else: return s
cpdef int sequence_tailrec(int fron, int nearTo) except *:
    return loop_tail(0,fron,nearTo)
```

...Yes, it ends up blocking TCO just as one would expect.

1pm. Hmmm...maybe I will add a compiler option to generate `except *` on every join point. No way around this one. I really am learning a decent amount aren't I?

1:05pm. Let me have breakfast here. I am overdoing it."

Any socks I wear are, by defn., programming socks

An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar.

The first mathematician orders a beer.

The second orders half a beer.

"I don't serve half-beers" the bartender replies.

"Excuse me?" Asks mathematician #2.

"What kind of bar serves half-beers?" The bartender remarks. "That's
ridiculous."

"Oh c'mon" says mathematician #1 "do you know how hard it is to collect
an infinite number of us? Just play along".

"There are very strict laws on how I can serve drinks. I couldn't serve
you half a beer even if I wanted to."

"But that's not a problem" mathematician #3 chimes in "at the end of the
joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the
sum of a continuously halving function-"

"I know my limits" interjects the bartender.

"Oh, alright then. I didn't want to assume a bartender would be familiar
with such advanced mathematics".

"Are you kidding me?" The bartender replies, "you learn limits in like,
9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced
mathematics?"

"HE'S ON TO US" mathematician #1 screeches

Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a
cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing
insects of a different shade.

The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. "FOOLS" it
booms in unison, "I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH
MALARIA"

The bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. "But wait"
he inturrupts, thinking fast, "if you do that, politicians will use the
catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much
that will hurt the taxpayers!"

The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. "My God, you're right. We
didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this
dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!" and with that, they vanish.

A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. "How did you know that
that would work?"

"It's simple really" the bartender says. "I saw that the vectors formed
a gradient, and therefore must be conservative."
