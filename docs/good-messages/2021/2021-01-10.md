Clean up image API code paths (#49)

* Document image.js a bit

* Close image.js sockets in all code paths

I'm not sure whether sockets get GC'd when the function returns

* Remove getFormat

It was only called from one place, and the object property names were
quite confusing

* Clean up image.js conditional a bit

I had to write out an entire truth table for this and work it all out
Thinking hard

* Move actual ImageMagick calling into separate file

This gets rid of the weird, brain-melting ouroboros of code that
recurses across threads and processes.

* Reduce amount of getType wrangling

This amounted to an awful lot of dead conditionals after the image
commands were all modified to pass in image types anyway. This has also
led to two different implementations diverging, which causes bugs like
GIF commands applied to non-GIFs erroring instead of providing a
user-friendly message.

* Unify image-runner return type, clarify image type

This allows us to remove the fromAPI parameter from image-runner, and
helps greatly clarify the behavior around image types.

* Deduplicate GIF code, fix "not a GIF" handling

The special "nogif" value is now stored as the image type instead of its
value, as the value must always be a Buffer now--no loosely-typed
shenanigans.

t5516: loosen "not our ref" error check

Commit 014ade7484 (upload-pack: send ERR packet for non-tip objects,
2019-04-13) added a test that greps the output of a failed fetch to make
sure that upload-pack sent us the ERR packet we expected. But checking
this is racy; despite the argument in that commit, the client may still
be sending a "done" line after the server exits, causing it to die() on
a failed write() and never see the ERR packet at all.

This fails quite rarely on Linux, but more often on macOS. However, it
can be triggered reliably with:

	diff --git a/fetch-pack.c b/fetch-pack.c
	index 876f90c759..cf40de9092 100644
	--- a/fetch-pack.c
	+++ b/fetch-pack.c
	@@ -489,6 +489,7 @@ static int find_common(struct fetch_negotiator *negotiator,
	 done:
	 	trace2_region_leave("fetch-pack", "negotiation_v0_v1", the_repository);
	 	if (!got_ready || !no_done) {
	+		sleep(1);
	 		packet_buf_write(&req_buf, "done\n");
	 		send_request(args, fd[1], &req_buf);
	 	}

This is a real user-visible race that it would be nice to fix, but it's
tricky to do so: the client would have to speculatively try to read an
ERR packet after hitting a write() error. And at least for this error,
it's specific to v0 (since v2 does not enforce reachability at all).

So let's loosen the test to avoid annoying racy failures. If we
eventually do the read-after-failed-write thing, we can tighten it. And
if not, v0 will grow increasingly obsolete as servers support v2, so the
utility of this test will decrease over time anyway.

Note that we can still check stderr to make sure upload-pack bailed for
the reason we expected. It writes a similar message to stderr, and
because the server side is just another process connected by pipes,
we'll reliably see it. This would not be the case for git://, or for
ssh servers that do not relay stderr (e.g., GitHub's custom endpoint
does not).

mm: remove unused variable in memory hotplug

When I removed the per-zone bitlock hashed waitqueues in commit
9dcb8b685fc3 ("mm: remove per-zone hashtable of bitlock waitqueues"), I
removed all the magic hotplug memory initialization of said waitqueues
too.

But when I actually _tested_ the resulting build, I stupidly assumed
that "allmodconfig" would enable memory hotplug.  And it doesn't,
because it enables KASAN instead, which then disables hotplug memory
support.

As a result, my build test of the per-zone waitqueues was totally
broken, and I didn't notice that the compiler warns about the now unused
iterator variable 'i'.

I guess I should be happy that that seems to be the worst breakage from
my clearly horribly failed test coverage.

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

I live in an Unreal prison. An Epic employee runs my prison. In prison, the employee tries to torment me. We can take away his knives by confessing, every day. In about 2000, I masturbated fantacizing about my niece, Lani. She looks like Star Trek Seven of Nine! In 1985, at my sister's wedding, I stuck my crotch on the hot tub drain because it kinda sucked. In 1985, I tried to get a dog to lick my digg. From 1998-2003, I fantacized about leading a Catholic army like Dune, of Mexicans or Brazilians? That was dumb because they're joggers. In 2003, I played tag with a black girl about 7-years-old. She reached for my crotch. In high school, in the library, Carlos and I said 'juicy' or 'toxic' as a way of evaluating girls. In 1988, I cheated on my SAT by talking in the hall during the break -- two problems. On 9/9/1999, I killed a glowie on purpose with my car. :-) In 1982, when I was 12, I babysat Kevin's kids. I changed a diaper because I thought that was being professional. In 1975, when I was about age five, my brother, Keith, put my penis in a vacuum. In 1977, when I was about age seven, my brother, Danny, got me high on gas fumes and we sucked each other's diggs. Dr. Tsakalis had an oddly round ass. Paul Keck at Xytec had an oddly round ass. Distracting? At about age five, Jay Weinrick and I touched diggs to each other's buttholes.

Pass redraw to RefreshUI RRR

The big one. Kept this for close to last because I knew it would hit
hard, especially on the time saved. And it does, with ~150000 calls and
~0.022s gone.

We're not entirely done yet, disabling still takes ~0.02s longer than
enabling, which just barely pushes it over the 0.1s threshold.

Refresh higher-loading plugins too

UGH. Forgot about the stupid columns. We can't get away with just
UI-refreshing the plugin and its masters/dependents, but actually have
to UI-refresh all higher-loading plugins than the lowest-loading plugin
that was involved in the LO operation.

We really only need to change one tiny bit of the UI for all these extra
plugins (one or two columns), but there is no way for us to communicate
that fact to RefreshUI. So with this commit the GUI is always updated
correctly and it will be just as fast as before if you (un)check among
the last couple plugins in the load order, but unchecking one of the
first couple plugins brings the old 0.3s back :(

Refresh imported and merged plugins too

Forgot about bashed patches...
Note that we don't need to do this with imported/merged mods that are
active, since their checkboxes won't change (and we only need to do this
refresh in the first place because of the checkbox incons - again, would
be lovely if we could tell RefreshUI that :P).

PSP decoder: new framework for vector layer parsing

I had originally planned to tackle this in stages, but one thing led to another and... yeah, this is a large commit.  Sorry!

PD's Paintshop Pro (PSP) parser now branches into a separate vector layer parser when vector layers are encountered.  Vector shapes have myriad complexities (not least of which is that they encompass both shapes and text, each with very different formats), so the parser has to branch in many more ways than your average raster-based decoder.  A well-compartmentalized implementation is critical because shapes can embed other shapes in a variety of ways.

I'm committing the decoder now because polyline vector layers are now fully parsed, with coverage for all publicly available versions of the PSP spec.  I can also load a large local collection of PSP files (containing vector layers) without crashing or screwing up existing raster layer coverage, so this is a relatively "safe" backup point.

This commit also includes work on creating pd2D brushes and pens from embedded PSP vector data.  PSPs have a huge assortment of possible fill/stroke types (including a lot of PSP-specific quirks), but I'll do what I can to support their features where possible.  Solid and gradient fills should eventually map roughly 1:1.  PSP "texture fill" features are a different beast, with no obvious analog in other software, so there's no guarantee I can mimic them accurately here.  They do give me some interesting ideas for expanding pd2D, at least...

Polyline vector layers are also fully parsed, and (famous last words) I don't think it will be too difficult to convert their format to a pd2D-compatible one.  My biggest issue is that the spec doesn't describe vector layers in any kind of detail, so there's a lot of detective work still to-do on just solving how to interpret their vector data.

Next up, I'm gonna work on converting PSP-format polylines and polygons to pd2D path objects.  This *should* allow me to render solid-color vector layers accurately, although they'll obviously have to be converted to raster layers in PD until vector layers become a fully supported type!

Thank you also to Roy K for an updated German localization in this commit.

* The `study-art` script runs `performance` in the background.
* You may have other scripts running, too, like `sanowret-crystal`.
* This script when looping over items to study in the room can dominate your roundtime, blocking other background scripts from having a turn.
* One impact is that once you finish a song, you may not be able to start another song.

Framed in a magnificent rectangle of rich mahogany, the bright bedroom reveals an Elven couple standing to face the viewer.  The woman has red-gold streaked blue-black hair, and she looks downward, seemingly demure.  Her bright red silk dress pools at her feet like newly spilt blood.  The darkness of the material casts a stark contrast to her very pale skin and serves to make her look frightened and childlike.  To her left, the man is painted with piercing blue eyes and dark brown hair, and he looks out  regally as if he has just been crowned prince.  Either by design or accident, the dark outfit gives the man a sinister air that is weakly counteracted by the red of her dress.  Behind the couple, in the very center of the painting, is a round seven-pointed mirror.  On closer inspection of the mirror, the painting shows such intricate detailing that one can see the backs of the couple.  Beyond them is the artist, who shares a face with the bride, leaning forward to paint on her canvas.  A small golden plaque underneath the painting reads, "'The Ja'Haadraan-Daemondred Marriage' by Ysselt Ja'Haadraan-Daemondred."
