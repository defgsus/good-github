Add initial_mrkdwn and replace_assets options. (#9)

* Add initial_mrkdwn and replace_assets options.

These are the last two features I need for this action to be perfect
for my current continuous deployment flow! I want to be able to
specify markdown to use as a template when creating the initial
release, but then be able to hand-edit it later, and be sure that my
edits will not be destroyed by future action runs. This new option is
a backwards-compatible way of achieving that. The old `body_mrkdwn`
option works the same as it always has, but you can now specify an
`initial_mrkdwn` value that is used only when creating a new release.
If you don't specify `initial_mrkdwn`, then `body_mrkdwn` is used
instead for the new release, and if neither was given, your standard
fallback string is still used.

But if you specify only `initial_mrkdwn` and no `body_mrkdwn`, then
the markdown text is only used for creating new releases, and existing
release descriptions are left unmodified.

The second argument, `replace_assets`, controls whether to do the new
feature you added this weekend. My jobs run in two different modes,
because they are based on the Maven package management system which is
the foundation of the Java world. Snapshot releases are works in
progress, and can be released many times. Their assets get updated
with each release. But a non-snapshot release is final, and its
artifacts _never_ change. So I want to replace assets when building
snapshot releases, but flag it as an error if anyone ever attemts to
replace assets for a non-snapshot release. And my jobs can determine
the kind of release from the most recent git tag.

* Remove redundant text

Sorry, I was up too late!

New data: 2021-02-14: See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (AB, MB, ON, SK).

Distributed vaccine numbers from PHAC up to February 11 were updated today. They have been added retroactively.

Toronto (ON) did not report any cases or deaths today due to ongoing issues regarding the transition of their data system.

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “The data also report 15 new deaths, but the total of deaths amounts to 10,214 due to the withdrawal of 2 deaths that the investigation has shown not to be attributable to COVID-19. Among these 15 deaths, 2 have occurred in the last 24 hours, 11 have occurred between February 7 and February 12 and 2 have occurred before February 7.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

EAT THIS BOB!! :D :D
Running my code through Hyperskill I got me a failure because I didn't read the description good enough. The task was to recognize the parameters and their values, but I thought there would only be the values of pass, port, cookie and host. As they checked my code to recognize the parameter "name" and its value "Bob"... well, one month of coding and thinking felt wasted at first.
I was disappointed.
But I remembered that learning to code is a journey, a hard one and my time was never wasted, since I learned so much even if it lead to a failure at first.
Then I felt challenged.
I didn't want to let this - to be honest, not existing - guy Bob win over me. Not after this amount of time I put into this coding challenge. Not after coding for more than a year now.
So I got my stuff together and rewrote the WHOLE code within under hours (~2h40m), made it even better than ever ever ever before and BOOM baby! I mastered this challenge 8-)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/compare/1.15.1...1.15.2)

##### What's Changed

-   What `1984` means to you? To us, this number means PR [#&#8203;1984](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/1984), one of the oldest PRs we had open and... finally merged! 😅 Thanks to an amazing contribution by [@&#8203;seglo](https://togithub.com/seglo), we now provide an example of testing Kafka clusters where multiple `KafkaContainer`s are connected into one network. Try it!
-   Another "old" PR is [#&#8203;3180](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3180) by [@&#8203;oussamabadr](https://togithub.com/oussamabadr). Those of you who run Selenium tests with Testcontainers will appreciate this newly added option to use (scrollable!) MP4 format instead of FLV.
-   The connection with Ryuk (our watchdog sidecar container) now sets the socket timeout and retries the failures - helps with some rare networking edge cases. ([#&#8203;3682](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3682)) [@&#8203;diegolovison](https://togithub.com/diegolovison)
-   The logs consumer no longer adds extra new lines thanks to [#&#8203;3752](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3752) by [@&#8203;perlun](https://togithub.com/perlun)
-   Locally built images no longer get affected by the `hub.image.name.prefix` setting! ([#&#8203;3666](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3666)) [@&#8203;reda-alaoui](https://togithub.com/reda-alaoui)
-   Jackson dependency is now forced to an older version to help with `NoClassDefFoundError (com/fasterxml/jackson/annotation/JsonMerge)`.

And more!

A little experiment with macros instead of build scripts.

This commit is basically me messing around with procedural macros,
to try them out as a potential future iteration of the UniFFI
developer experience.

As a crate author, I think it would be amazing not to have to
worry about .udl files and built scripts and what-not, but
instead be able to declare my API with a macro and have Rust
just take care of the details. This commit is a tiny experiment
in that direction, based on existing features of UniFFI.

The idea is that I can wrap my Rust code in a little macro
like this:

```
[uniffi_macros::declare_interface]
pub mod my_component {
  ...my rust code goes here...
}
```

And I can provide a corresponding `my_component.udl` file that
declares the interface, and all the Rust scaffolding code just
gets taken care of automagically.

I still have to provide a `.udl` file, but I hope you can imagine
one day the possibility of generating the interface definition
directly from the Rust code that is decorated by the macro.
Not any time soon! But one day...

pinctrl: qcom: Don't clear pending interrupts when enabling

In Linux, if a driver does disable_irq() and later does enable_irq()
on its interrupt, I believe it's expecting these properties:
* If an interrupt was pending when the driver disabled then it will
  still be pending after the driver re-enables.
* If an edge-triggered interrupt comes in while an interrupt is
  disabled it should assert when the interrupt is re-enabled.

If you think that the above sounds a lot like the disable_irq() and
enable_irq() are supposed to be masking/unmasking the interrupt
instead of disabling/enabling it then you've made an astute
observation.  Specifically when talking about interrupts, "mask"
usually means to stop posting interrupts but keep tracking them and
"disable" means to fully shut off interrupt detection.  It's
unfortunate that this is so confusing, but presumably this is all the
way it is for historical reasons.

Perhaps more confusing than the above is that, even though clients of
IRQs themselves don't have a way to request mask/unmask
vs. disable/enable calls, IRQ chips themselves can implement both.
...and yet more confusing is that if an IRQ chip implements
disable/enable then they will be called when a client driver calls
disable_irq() / enable_irq().

It does feel like some of the above could be cleared up.  However,
without any other core interrupt changes it should be clear that when
an IRQ chip gets a request to "disable" an IRQ that it has to treat it
like a mask of that IRQ.

In any case, after that long interlude you can see that the "unmask
and clear" can break things.  Maulik tried to fix it so that we no
longer did "unmask and clear" in commit 71266d9d3936 ("pinctrl: qcom:
Move clearing pending IRQ to .irq_request_resources callback"), but it
only handled the PDC case and it had problems (it caused
sc7180-trogdor devices to fail to suspend).  Let's fix.

>From my understanding the source of the phantom interrupt in the
were these two things:
1. One that could have been introduced in msm_gpio_irq_set_type()
   (only for the non-PDC case).
2. Edges could have been detected when a GPIO was muxed away.

Fixing case #1 is easy.  We can just add a clear in
msm_gpio_irq_set_type().

Fixing case #2 is harder.  Let's use a concrete example.  In
sc7180-trogdor.dtsi we configure the uart3 to have two pinctrl states,
sleep and default, and mux between the two during runtime PM and
system suspend (see geni_se_resources_{on,off}() for more
details). The difference between the sleep and default state is that
the RX pin is muxed to a GPIO during sleep and muxed to the UART
otherwise.

As per Qualcomm, when we mux the pin over to the UART function the PDC
(or the non-PDC interrupt detection logic) is still watching it /
latching edges.  These edges don't cause interrupts because the
current code masks the interrupt unless we're entering suspend.
However, as soon as we enter suspend we unmask the interrupt and it's
counted as a wakeup.

Let's deal with the problem like this:
* When we mux away, we'll mask our interrupt.  This isn't necessary in
  the above case since the client already masked us, but it's a good
  idea in general.
* When we mux back will clear any interrupts and unmask.

Allow effects to reference parents

Having each attack effect (e.g. slice, burn, shock, electrocute,
poison) be its own process is a pain: what if an electric sword depends
on a main effect (e.g. slice) connecting (successful hit roll) before it
can affect the target?
Plus, I want each application of an effect to be handled by its own
process: I don't want a single one-per-weapon attack effect (e.g. poison)
to be managing the effects of one poisoned sword on several different
targets: if you hit something with a poisoned sword and the poison takes
hold, then you have a process devoted solely to applying poison to that
one target.

I was going to have one attack process configured to kick off multiple
effects, but I think I'm going to have parent effects referenced by
child effects. In that case I'll need each effect's properties in a
dedicated process; however, if I want one process per affected target,
then I need those effect processes to be prototype processes (or parents
in another sense) where the "property holder process" spins off a copy
of itself each time the effect is applied to a target. This means I need
to have a prototype version of the effect process and an instance of the
effect process.

So:
1) player initiates attack on target "T" with an attack object/process,
   e.g. sword "S"

2) Prototype cut effect "PC" sees an attack by it's parent attack "S"
   and creates an instance of itself "IC" and tells it to attack "T"

3) If IC manages to hit "T":
   a) Prototype poison effect "PP" sees that its parent effect, "IC",
      hits "T" and creates an instance of poison "IP"
   b) "IP" calculates its own hit roll on "T"

In this way, I could have effects that are children of effects which
are also children of other effects, creating a cascade of effects based
on a single attack.

Each effect can calculate its own hit roll, thus allowing any other
nearby process to mitigate that hit or effect.

One thing that will be difficult, but is probably over-engineering at
this point, is responding to a combination of effects: e.g. if I get
poisoned and burned then my magic ring kicks in and nullifies one of them
(edited)

(Actually, that would be easy: the magic ring can listen to effect events
and turn it's logic on or off depending on its current state) (edited)

WIP: moving most logic from attack to effect

Moving the attacks over to various effects still makes sense; however,
moving resource allocation doesn't: are there any effects of an attack
that have different resources? If so, how do we coordinate them? If the
"slice" effect of a sword has the resources it needs, does it wait for
whatever resources "shock", "burn" or "poison" might need? (A creative
person could always come up with a scenario where something like this
could be possible). Having a parent effect wait for the resources
required for a dpeendent effect sounds like over-engineering.

My go-to example is a flaming sword: it has a main effect of slicing (or
whatever) but it has a secondary, dependent effect of burning (if you
don't hit with the sword then you also don't burn with it.

Does the "burn" effect have it's own resources? Does it need to request
resources every time it applies itself (if it's an on-going/repeating
effect)?

I don't think so. The idea of an "attack" is that it's some kind of
offensive action like a weapon, or a spell. We can't activate the
offensive without the appropriate resources required to kick off _any_
of the effects. So, the attack should wait for resources (e.g. stamina
and focus for a sword) and then tell the effects to kick off. Dependent
effects will wait for parent effects to hit first before kicking into
action.

So, I'm going to move the resources back to the attack handler from the
effect handler.

Having effects handle their own rolls to hit and calculate effect
amount, and having the hits cascade (i.e. the dependency: if A hits then
B might hit) still makes sense.

NOTE:

I need to remember that I'm ignoring time, CPU and transactionality:
things don't have to happen exactly in order and groups of effects don't
need to be atomic: if you manage to shock something twice when you've
only hit it with a sword once, well good for you. Life is messy.

Wasn't properly deleting all it should.

Changes it to assume if there isn't a socket in the dir, it's not in
use.

Fuck you chrome.

ARROW-11289: [Rust][DataFusion] Implement GROUP BY support for Dictionary Encoded columns

This PR adds support for GROUP BY with for columns of Dictionary type.

The code basically just follows the pattern (aka is mostly copy/paste) from the take kernel: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/rust/arrow/src/compute/kernels/cast.rs#L294

I chose the "correct first, optimize later" approach here -- there are many ways to make this code faster, especially when grouping on string types.

It feels like a lot of copy/paste in my mind and I would love any thoughts / suggestion about refactoring out the recurring pattern of switch and dispatch for structured types (like `Dictionary` and `List`)

Closes #9233 from alamb/alamb/gby_dicts

Implemented SubCommands and SubCommandGroups properly.

Details:
To implement them I had to get creative. First thing i did was manually register a command that uses sub commands and sub command groups. Two things I noticed immediately:
1) I can create a subcommand on a "root" command - where no SubCommandGroup is used
2) The current implementation of the Interactions doesn't know what type of value an option is. Good thing is that there is only 1 option when querying subcommands and subcommand groups, so I can find out what the "path" of the subcommand is.
TOP/root/rng
TOP/root/usr/zero
TOP/root/usr/johnny (i misspelled it in the source files, woops)
[See SlashCommandsExample/DiscordClient.cs]

Next I wanted to make command groups (I'll use this term as to mean a slash command with subcommands and regular slash command groups) to be implemented in code in a sort of hierarchical manner - so I made them classes with attributes. Unfortunately to make this work I had to make them re-inherit the same things as the base module - UGLY but I see no other option to do this other than making them inherit from another class that remembers the instance of the upper class and implements the same methods aka a whole mess that I decided I won't want to partake in.
[See SlashCommandsExample/Modules/DevModule.cs]

Next-up is to search for these sub-groups. I decided that the most intuitive way of implementing these was to make SlashModuleInfo have children and parent of the same type -- from which arose different problems, but we'll get to that.
So I gave them some children and a parent and a reference to the CommandGroup attribute they have on themselves. The boolean isCommandGroup is unused, but could be useful in the future... maybe. Also I've added a path variable to internally store structure.
I wanted (after the whole reflections business) for commands to be easly accessed and deal WITH NO REFLECTION because those are slow, so I changed the final string - SlashCommandInfo dictionary to containt paths instead of command infos, something like what I exemplefied above.

In any case, I edited the service helper (the search for modules method) to ignore command groups and only store top level commands. After that I made a command to instantiate command groups, and the command creation and registration were changed as to be recursive - because recurion is the simpest way to do this and it's efficient enough for what we want - we only run this once anyway.

The biggest change was with command building - commands no longer build themselves, but now we command each module to build itself. There are 3 cases:
Top-Level commands
Top-Level subcommands (or level 1 command group)
subcommands within slash command groups

The code is uncommented, untidy and I'll fix that in a future commit. One last thing to note is that SlashCommands can have 0 options! - fixed that bug. Also SlashCommandBuilder.WithName() for some reason was implemented wrongly - I pressume a copy-paste error,
Also I implemented 0 types of enforcing rules - I'm going to leave this to other people to do.

A lot of random changes. My commit comments suck and I will hate myself later for it.
