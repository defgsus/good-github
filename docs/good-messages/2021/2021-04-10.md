# Hacker-Statistics

Imagine the following: you're walking up the empire state building and you're playing a game with a friend.

You throw a die one hundred times.

If it's 1 or 2 you'll go one step down.

If it's 3, 4, or 5, you'll go one step up.

If you throw a 6, you'll throw the die again and will walk up the resulting number of steps.

Of course, you can not go lower than step number 0. And also, you admit that you're a bit clumsy and have a chance of 0.1% of falling down the stairs when you make a move. Falling down means that you have to start again from step 0. With all of this in mind, you bet with your friend that you'll reach 60 steps high.

use hardcoded namespace

The macro defined namespaces confused the hell out of lupdate and more or less broke translations permanently. Looks like the only way we can do it is to have a hardcoded namespace, which goes against my instinct, but honestly how likely is it that we'll change the namespace anyway (I guess forks might want to do it, but that's their problem ;) )

"11:20am.

> Play Rance Quest
> H scene plays
> Think about how CFR works for half an hour instead while My Glorious Days plays in the background

That is an episode of my life from last night.

At any rate, I've figured something out. In fact, I understand CFR about 80% and I doubt I'll be able to move past that without understanding the specifics of how regret matching interacts with the rest of the system. This is most likely impossible since it involves interacting nonlinearities.

My suspicions from yesterday were right.

```
inl self_prob = exp_log_prob (add_log_prob chance_prob player.prob)
```

I've proven it to myself on a toy example mentally. To optimize the whole path you need to optimize `self_prob * chance_prob * op_prob`, those kinds of paths. I thought it was suspicious that right now, the graph has been factored into `self_prob * chance_prob` and `chance_prob * op_prob`, instead of `self_prob` and `chance_prob * op_prob` respectively. This later way of doing it is right after all.

PG optimize `softmax (self_prob * chance_prob * op_prob * r)`. CFR optimizes `self_prob * (norm << relu) (chance_prob * op_prob * r)`. So the whole path across the sums of probability factors is there.

The paper was right that it would be possible to sample old policies, I mean enough samples are taken `self_prob` average out across training runs.

Though this kind averaging would make the optimization biased though. There is no choice though in the NN case, you can't keep a net after literally every single update. Neither can I update one sample at a time.

The best way to resolve this is to use memory - make sure that the infostates are neatly separated and things will work fine.

11:40am. I am not sure why I made a mistake in strategy averaging. I am pretty sure that `x_i` and `x_-i` were both intended to use the path probs in the paper, but I could have missed it. The reason why this was never a problem when I tested it is because on all of the games the chance nodes were uniform and at the start of the game so they evened out.

It might have not been a problem for optimizing those games, but it sure was a problem when it comes to optimizing my own understanding of the algorithm.

```
inl self_prob = exp_log_prob player.prob
```

This should be like so, no doubt about it.

11:45am. Oh yeah...

```
        // This one might give better results during training.
        // let actions_prob () = regret_match (if is_update then d.regret else d.avg_policy)
```

I've also been wondering whether it would be better to use the average policy, but now that I understand what is being done, I see that using the current policy is just sampling the latest policy net from the ensemble. This is actually the best choice for the sake of driving exploration. I do not need to drive old policies forward and load up the buffer with stale data.

11:55am. Hrmmm...I really am going to have to do some reasearch and see if I can figure out how to average policies rather than keeping old nets around. Keeping the old nets around would be too inefficient in terms of memory.

...Though I wonder. Imagine if the learning rate was something like 0.01. In that case, I can assume that this would decay the old data samples at this rate anyway. Meaning it would keep around the information of the last 100 training runs at most.

12pm. If it was something like a 64 or 128 nets, I could afford to keep them around. It is no biggie. It might be better pay the memory cost up front rather than having to deal with having to optimize another net, and then heaving to deal with limitation imposed by having a limited memory buffer.

12:10pm. Hmmm, if I went the route of training a separate net to average policies, instead of doing that, what I could do is train a much slimmer net to predict the targets generated by the main training net. The main net could be 100mb, but it could generate the targets for a 1mb student net. I could afford to keep those nets around.

12:15pm. ...Forget that, it does not matter. I'll do the simple thing and keep old policy nets around. I'll figure out how to optimize that step later.

Let me read the Single Deep CFR paper.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07621
Single Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization

This guy also wrote the DREAM paper.

12:45pm. Actually, rather than training a separate slim net, what I should do after an initial period of training for the large one is freeze the lower layers and train just the head. I should then create an ensemble of heads. That will absolutely crush the size down while not reducing the network capacity in any way.

This is the ideal way. I'll actually go with this.

1pm. Let me stop here. I haven't even started, but I am already tired. Let me have breakfast here.

CFR is absolutely remarkable and profound. What did I learn from it? How to optimize probability distributions by averaging them. That strategy averaging works is nothing short of miraculous.

I could hypthesize it on my own, but whether I'd have the courage to actually try it out is a completely different thing.

It also has philosophical implications. My having a model of the self and factoring it out, one can get remarkable performance increases. Ultimately, self modeling is a large part of CFR. Right now, CFR only has two levels of optimization, but it might turn out to be the case that it would work for a multitude of factors, rather than just the self and the environment.

Who knows, maybe not. The self and the env are the two most important factors one can think of.

1:10pm. I can already see my victory. Let me stop here so I can eat."

Create Medicine from Best Medical University in Russia 2021-22 Twinkle InstituteAB

MBBS in Russia- Studying MBBS in Russia is the best option for Indian medical students because Russia holds the 8th top medicine study destination where students choose to Study MBBS in Russia. Almost all Best Medical University in Russia are recognized by MCI, WHO, European Council and other world’s health organisations. After completion of MBBS in Russia, the degree awarded to the graduates is M.D (Physician) which is equivalent to an MBBS degree in India.

Russia Medical College become a global educational hub for Indian medical students to pursue the MBBS course. Indian students that pursue MBBS from Russia are eligible to appear for the MCI screening test in India. There are around 50+ medical universities in Russia. The student to teacher ratio in all Russian Medical Universities is 7:1. The medium of instruction of this MBBS course is English as well as Russia in a few of the Russian medical universities.

These are the advantages for Indian students to study MBBS in Russia:

The MBBS program in Top Ten Medical University In Russia is recognized worldwide so students can practice anywhere after graduating.
The students are also trained for the MCI (Medical Council of India) screening test so that the students can easily qualify for the test and can practice medicine in India.
There is no demand to pay the bulk of donation or capitation fee to these top medical college in Russia.
The fee structure in all Russian Medical Universities is affordable.
There is no need for any competitive entrance test for pursuing MBBS in Russian Medical Universities.
All faculty members are internationally commendable.
The Indian medical students will also get to experience the knowledge and the exposure of different cultures and traditions celebrated by the Russians.
The medical degrees that are being awarded to students after completion, of course, are recognized by WHO, UNESCO, and the MCI. It provides a great benefit to them to practice medicine anywhere in the world.
Each MCI recognized Russian Medical Universities provide hostel rooms to the Indian medical students travelled there for accommodation with an Indian food facility.
High-quality teaching techniques with outstanding facilities equipped with great state-of-the-art infrastructure and well-maintained laboratories, libraries.
Since 1990 students from India attracted to studying MBBS in RUSSIA because of its government recognized medical universities & low-cost fees. Thousands of doctors are now practising in India who has done their MBBS from Russia for 25 years. As we have mentioned above medical Universities in Russia is recognized by the Medical Council of India (MCI). According to the surveys every year more than 3500 students choose Russia over any other country for their MBBS study because of its low-cost fee and affordable expense of living. Many students who finished MBBS in Russia is now practising in many European countries and America after doing PG from these respective countries. Students from different countries like Europe, Africa, Asia and America comes to Russia for MBBS (MD) because of its highly qualified faculties and advanced teaching methods. The MBBS syllabus in Russia is full of practical knowledge and hands-on experience in hospital and clinics visit. The top medical universities have the experience to teach MBBS course in Russia for as long as 150 years or more. Studying at medical colleges in Russia for Indian students is a far better option than the Indian private medical college lack practical experience and quality of education provided to the students. Getting an MBBS degree from Russia from a top-rated Medical University in Russia in English medium of instruction ensures a great medical career ahead.

 MBBS in Russia in English is possible at a few goods and top Russian medical colleges.

#### Saturday 2021-04-10 14:01:18 by Marko Grdinić

"2:10pm. Done with breakfast and chores. Let me chill a little and I will start.

2:35pm. Let me start. I really need to catch up with Aiki S at some point, the latest chapter was fun. I have so much on my backlog. Gone are the days where I could just watch and read everything. There is just not enough time. Maybe I'll go back to them once I get a galaxy brain.

Forget about that.

Let me put the finishing touches on my thinking. I've been obsessing about CFR for so long, and in the last few days, I've finally pushed my understanding from 40% where it was stuck for months, to about 80%.

I now understand all of its most salient aspects and can derive a sampling version directly from the original one. This includes the neural version of it.

The simplifications that I've arrived are remarkable. I won't have any need for policy gradients anymore and will be able to derive the policy from value nets instead. This is something I've thought about even before 2018, but never figured out how to do it.

In fact the way I will do sampling CFR will be novel not just to myself, but the field at large.

2:45pm. Yesterday I started out the day wanting to work on the UIs, but around this time just went to bed so I can think about CFR.

```
inl funsTrain (d : state _) = player_funs {
    action = dyn fun {chance_prob player player' actions next} =>
        inl num_actions = length actions
        inl d = value d num_actions player.observations
        inl self_prob = exp_log_prob player.prob
        inl op_prob = exp_log_prob (add_log_prob chance_prob player')
        inl reward,reward_wsum =
            inl state = state player
            am.mapFold2 (fun s prob a =>
                inl r =
                    if prob = 0 && op_prob = 0 then 0 // the pruning optimization
                    else next ((to_log_prob prob,a),state)
                r, s + prob * r
                ) 0 (regret_match d.regret) actions
        d.regret |> am.mapInplace (fun i x => x + op_prob * (index reward i - reward_wsum))
        inl actions_prob = regret_match d.regret
        d.avg_policy |> am.mapInplace (fun i x => x + self_prob * index actions_prob i)
        am.fold2 (fun s prob r => s + prob * r) 0 actions_prob reward
    terminal = fun _ => ()
    }
```

Let me make this like so. And I will make a version just for evaling the game tree.

```
union cfr_mode = PlayAvgPolicy | PlayCurrentPolicy | TrainCurrentPolicy
```

Let me make this.

```
inl funsPlayEnum (d : state _) = player_funs {
    action = dyn fun {chance_prob player player' actions next} =>
        inl num_actions = length actions
        inl d = value d num_actions player.observations
        inl op_prob = log_probm.exp (log_probm.add chance_prob player')
        inl state = state player
        am.fold2 (fun s prob a =>
            inl r =
                if prob = 0 && op_prob = 0 then 0 // the pruning optimization
                else next ((log_probm.from prob,a),state)
            s + prob * r
            ) 0 (regret_match d.avg_policy) actions
    terminal = fun _ => ()
    }

inl funsTrain (d : state _) = player_funs {
    action = dyn fun {chance_prob player player' actions next} =>
        inl num_actions = length actions
        inl d = value d num_actions player.observations
        inl self_prob = log_probm.exp player.prob
        inl op_prob = log_probm.exp (log_probm.add chance_prob player')
        inl reward,reward_wsum =
            inl state = state player
            am.mapFold2 (fun s prob a =>
                inl r =
                    if prob = 0 && op_prob = 0 then 0 // the pruning optimization
                    else next ((log_probm.from prob,a),state)
                r, s + prob * r
                ) 0 (regret_match d.regret) actions
        d.regret |> am.mapInplace (fun i x => x + op_prob * (index reward i - reward_wsum))
        inl actions_prob = regret_match d.regret
        d.avg_policy |> am.mapInplace (fun i x => x + self_prob * index actions_prob i)
        am.fold2 (fun s prob r => s + prob * r) 0 actions_prob reward
    terminal = fun _ => ()
    }
```

Let me back this up.

3:40pm.

```
union cfr_mode = PlayAvgPolicy | PlayCurrentPolicy | TrainCurrentPolicy
inl funsTrain mode (d : state _) = player_funs {
    action = dyn fun {chance_prob player player' actions next} =>
        inl d = value d (length actions) player.observations
        inl op_prob = log_probm.exp (log_probm.add chance_prob player')
        inl state = state player

        inl r prob a =
            if prob = 0 && op_prob = 0 then 0 // the pruning optimization
            else next ((log_probm.from prob,a),state)

        let weighted_sum actions_prob = am.fold2 (fun s prob a => s + prob * r prob a) 0 actions_prob actions

        match mode with
        // For evaling the overall quality of the policy whose agents are done training.
        | PlayAvgPolicy => weighted_sum (regret_match d.avg_policy)
        // Alternating updates between the players works better than training both simultaneously.
        // For the sake of training it is better to play the latest policy and get the freshest data instead of
        // sampling the old ones, which in effect would happen if the avg_policy was used for training.
        | PlayCurrentPolicy => weighted_sum (regret_match d.regret)
        // Trains the current policy. The old F# version in the `v0.2` branch of the Spiral repo has some bugs.
        // The way it is done currently reflects my current understanding of the way the algorithm is supposed to be implemented.
        // For example, I am decently sure that `self_prob` should not have the chance probability like the paper suggests.
        // Also the latest policy should be added to the average one rather than the stale one.
        // To speed up learning I also reweight the rewards using the updated policy.
        | TrainCurrentPolicy =>
            inl reward,reward_wsum =
                am.mapFold2 (fun s prob a =>
                    inl r = r prob a in r, s + prob * r
                    ) 0 (regret_match d.regret) actions
            d.regret |> am.mapInplace (fun i x => x + op_prob * (index reward i - reward_wsum))
            inl actions_prob = regret_match d.regret
            inl self_prob = log_probm.exp player.prob
            d.avg_policy |> am.mapInplace (fun i x => x + self_prob * index actions_prob i)
            weighted_sum actions_prob
    terminal = fun _ => ()
    }
```

Yeah, this is. This is the definitive CFR implementation. Linear CFR reweighting might make things work better, but that aspect is not important in comparison.

I've run it so many time through my mind. I've literally bashed my head against the CFR wall for months trying to understand the algorithm. And now I finally understand it well enough to make my own modifications and derive the sampling versions on my own.

3:45pm. Ah, I want a break. Right now I am too hung up on this. Let me think, do I finally have enough to focus on the UIs?

Can I shift my goal to working on them? The learning algorithm itself is finally clear.

3:55pm. Let me take a break here. I do not feel like it.

4pm. Yesterday I literally pried myself off from work at 8pm, and I was still interrupted by the subjects after that.

Let me chill a bit now."

added shiftCourse methods

methods added:
	parseShifterCSV
		- this one is honestly just parseCSV, except I changed it so that it accommodates the ShifterData.csv
		- we can modify the original parseCSV so that it can account for both .csv files
		- I coded it like this so that it can be semi-independent;  people were still updating their source codes so I didn't want to overwrite/modify yet
	shiftCourse
		- this method compares the course descriptions of the shifter's data with the curriculum.csv
		- if the method finds an equivalent course, the grade would be carried over
		- if the method did not find an equivalent grade, nothing really happens
	showShifterCourses
		- this method is basically showCourses, but for the shifter's data
		- but there was a comment sa showCourses, so I don't really know if I should invoke it muna or not
		- so I made the method instead, we can remove this one tho and make it so that showCourses is the one being invoked
		- just like parseShifterCSV
	showUncarriedCourses
		- this method compares the course descriptions of the shifter's data with the curriculum.csv
		- but instead of changing the grade, this method removes the course from the shifter's data
		- originally, this was part of shiftCourse but I kept getting ConcurrentModificationException
		- (in which I honestly did not know how to handle)
		
known bugs:
	after the whole shiftCourse method, it prints an errror message from the main method regarding the menu choice
		- I did some tests, and we can remove it by just removing the part of shiftCourses where the user has a (y/n) choice
		- I kept it tho, it's up to the group to remove it (I just thought it was funny to ask the user if they REALLY want to shift courses)
		
If there are any problems, additions or anything required of me, feel free to contact me on messenger
thank you! have a nice day

* Mazovian Socio-Economics

People think Communism was some crazy idea that had its comeuppance 40 years ago. A fever that shook the world, never to return again. They were right. Until *he* woke up today – a spiritual corpse responsive only to the call of Commodore Red, prostitutes, and Kras Mazov. For him, Communism is still a *thing*. He will single-handedly raise the Commune of '02 from the oceanic trench where it has been resting, covered in ghosts and seaweed! He is the Big Communism Builder. Come, witness his attempt to rebuild Communism in the year '51!

0.000% of Communism has been built. Evil child-murdering billionaires still rule the world with a shit-eating grin. All he has managed to do is make himself *sad*. He is starting to suspect Kras Mazov *fucked him over* personally with his socio-economic theory. It has, however, made him into a very, very smart boy with something like a university degree in Truth. Instead of building Communism, he now builds a precise model of this grotesque, duplicitous world.

TeamCodeRed- Hack36 4.0
Welcome all! Our project for this years Hack36 is based on the theme LIFE IN PANDEMIC. The basic idea behind the project was to create an e-wallet for users with a daily set limit for spending amount. This would allow them both contactless and safe payments in this pandemic situation as well as to keep a check on their daily expenditure, as we all know how hard it is to stop ourselves from overspending our money on stuff we will probably never use or ordering food online just because we are sitting at our homes being bored! 
We really enjoyed building this project! And we hope you like it too.

Just why? No one is talking to her

I haven't uploaded in over 20+ days and she is still rattling on. No one is talking to her. No one is even contacting her, and yet here she is, going off like a crazy person. 

Lets talk about the MRN(Medical Records Number) she willy nilly gave out on April 10th 2021. Yup! One of the screen grabbers caught that one. Like how dumb do you have to be to not cover that up? As one of the folks in my discord put it "All someone would have to do is take that number, her information that she has given out, and tada, they have all her medical history and who only knows what else."  She screams and screams about all sorts of shit and here she is DOXXING herself, again. 
On another note, some of us have been contacted by individuals on Reddit about what the hell is wrong with her, and if she is crazy. You can see some of the convo I had with them on 04092021. The person is nice, but I warned them heavily that she is crazy.

Lets talk about Lamby. I love the fact she is outright talking shit about my favorite artist. No joke. I have commissioned a piece from her, and seeing how her other work has been, will likely commission more. I also love the fact that Lamby is probably the most patient, loving and sadistic one out of all of us. She unblocked the TURD and has been letting her go crazy. You can see a few chunks starting about March 25th to recently. Lets make something clear, Lamby has no control of how other people react, or don't react to Emily. What Lamby has done, is give people the information that is publicly out there, so others can make an informed decision whether or not they want to deal with Emily's form of nutjob. If they choose to not interact with her, its because of her, not Lamby.

Aislinn, has been AWOL for a while now, thanks to a messed up shoulder and a remodel of I want to say her kitchen. Yup. Emily is not the first and last thing any of us think of during the day or much at all to be precise. 

Her snotty remarks of Video taping herself showering is disgusting and has made a few of us gag. I personally think it would solve several of our problems, because that can be reported for pornography. Go Nuts turdlet! None of us believe she showers on the regular or often enough to keep from being disgusting. She has shown enough images of herself to prove she is not maintaining a respectable level of bathing of her person. And I am sorry, not really, her house is filthy. My own home, may be well loved in, but is always clean, there are no chicken bones on my floor, unlike hers.

Anyways, No one is talking to her. No one cares to. And those that do, when they find us, we tell them the truth. Simple as that.

Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Unlike linear regression which outputs continuous number values, logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value which can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes.

for more -https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logistic_regression.html

K Nearest Neighbors
The model representation for KNN is the entire training dataset.

It is as simple as that.

KNN has no model other than storing the entire dataset, so there is no learning required.

Efficient implementations can store the data using complex data structures like k-d trees to make look-up and matching of new patterns during prediction efficient.

Because the entire training dataset is stored, you may want to think carefully about the consistency of your training data. It might be a good idea to curate it, update it often as new data becomes available and remove erroneous and outlier data.

KNN works well with a small number of input variables (p), but struggles when the number of inputs is very large.

Dataset can be downloaded from - https://www.kaggle.com/rakeshrau/social-network-ads#Social_Network_Ads.csv

Our Goal is to predict whether a person will be able to buy a car depending upon his age and his salary
Using Logistic Regression we achived an accuracy of - 0.875

Using K Nearest Neighbours we achived an accuracy of - 0.9166666666666666
