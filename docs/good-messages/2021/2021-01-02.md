Create README.md

For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that all who believe in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

And into the new year she is still screaming about James.

So the latest bullshit is her screaming James is some Emily Rose scammer. Yeah. Emily Rose is an Actress that was on Haven the series that aired on scifi. Why is Emily attached to this. Because she found some odd ball shit in an email from secondlife of someone called Emily Rose. Likely a simple wrong IM, sent it to the wrong person and because they never heard from the person, realized they messaged wrong person and got in touch with the right one. But to Emily that is all some conspiracy that James, her step dad, scammed people.  

And also look at the songs. Is that creepy? Its creepy. She is associating songs meant for an ex lover to her Step Dad. As I was telling my Cohort in crime AKA Ruin, lastnight. I feel that due to the schizoaffective disorder, she is trying to put herself into her mothers place, so James will react to her the in the same way, IE loving and nurturing. Of course he will not, because she is not her mother and she has tormented him for ages now. I really do believe it is because she is infatuated with james being the older father figure and... BLEGH! Its not a pretty sight to say the least.

fix(testing): travis doesn't like Maria, so I'm dropping it for now

Bloody hell. CI with multiple databases is very, very hard. I've tried CircleCI, GitHub Actions and
Travis. All of them has some weird wrinkle. My favourite was MariaDB/Travis - on Bionic, It Just
Worked and I couldn't get MySQL working for love or money. When I switched to Focal, MySQL Just
Worked and Maria ghosted me. Anyway, I want to move on to goreleaser failings, so I'm calling it
quits on multiple databases. I've had the code working with Cockroach, MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL
on my laptop, but I just can't get a CI build that will get all four databases up.
