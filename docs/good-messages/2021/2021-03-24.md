Create ACM birth of Noah

The following is the family of Noah.

5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God made man, he made him in the image of God;
5:2 Male and female he made them, naming them Man, and giving them his blessing on the day when they were made.
5:3 Adam had been living for a hundred and thirty years when he had a son like himself, after his image, and gave him the name of Seth:
5:4 And after the birth of Seth, Adam went on living for eight hundred years, and had sons and daughters:
5:5 And all the years of Adam's life were nine hundred and thirty: and he came to his end.
5:6 And Seth was a hundred and five years old when he became the father of Enosh:
5:7 And he went on living after the birth of Enosh for eight hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters:
5:8 And all the years of Seth's life were nine hundred and twelve: and he came to his end.
5:9 And Enosh was ninety years old when he became the father of Kenan:
5:10 And after the birth of Kenan, Enosh went on living for eight hundred and fifteen years, and had sons and daughters:
5:11 And all the years of Enosh were nine hundred and five: and he came to his end.
5:12 And Kenan was seventy years old when he became the father of Mahalalel:
5:13 And after the birth of Mahalalel, Kenan went on living for eight hundred and forty years, and had sons and daughters:
5:14 And all the years of Kenan's life were nine hundred and ten; and he came to his end.
5:15 And Mahalalel was sixty-five years old when he became the father of Jared:
5:16 And after the birth of Jared, Mahalalel went on living for eight hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters:
5:17 And all the years of Mahalalel's life were eight hundred and ninety-five: and he came to his end.
5:18 And Jared was a hundred and sixty-two years old when he became the father of Enoch:
5:19 And Jared went on living after the birth of Enoch for eight hundred years, and had sons and daughters:
5:20 And all the years of Jared's life were nine hundred and sixty-two: and he came to his end.
5:21 And Enoch was sixty-five years old when he became the father of Methuselah:
5:22 And after the birth of Methuselah, Enoch went on in God's ways for three hundred years, and had sons and daughters:
5:23 And all the years of Enoch's life were three hundred and sixty-five:
5:24 And Enoch went on in God's ways: and he was not seen again, for God took him.
5:25 And Methuselah was a hundred and eighty-seven years old when he became the father of Lamech:
5:26 And after the birth of Lamech, Methuselah went on living for seven hundred and eighty-two years, and had sons and daughters:
5:27 And all the years of Methuselah's life were nine hundred and sixty-nine: and he came to his end.
5:28 And Lamech was a hundred and eighty-two years old when he had a son:
5:29 And he gave him the name of Noah, saying, Truly, he will give us rest from our trouble and the hard work of our hands,
because of the earth which was cursed by God.
5:30 And after the birth of Noah, Lamech went on living for five hundred and ninety-five years, and had sons and daughters:
5:31 And all the years of Lamech's life were seven hundred and seventy-seven: and he came to his end.
5:32 And Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

Given two names described above,you must show me whether one man is the ancestor of another,and who lives longer.

Create ACM Noah's Ark

Now,our story begins.As usual,I'll tell you the background as follows:
6:13 And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come; the earth is full of their violent doings, and now I will put an end to them with the earth.
6:14 Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it, and make it safe from the water inside and out.
6:15 And this is the way you are to make it: it is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.
6:16 You are to put a window in the ark, a cubit from the roof, and a door in the side of it, and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors.
6:17 For truly, I will send a great flow of waters over the earth, for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything on the earth will come to an end.
6:18 But with you I will make an agreement; and you will come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.
6:19 And you will take with you into the ark two of every sort of living thing, and keep them safe with you; they will be male and female.
6:20 Two of every sort of bird and cattle and of every sort of living thing which goes on the earth will you take with you to keep them from destruction.
6:21 And make a store of every sort of food for yourself and them.
6:22 And all these things Noah did; as God said, so he did.

Most Hebrew scholars believe the cubit to have been 18 inches long [45.72 centimeters]. This means that the ark would have been 450 feet long [137.16 meters], 75 feet wide [22.86 meters] and 45 feet high [13.716 meters]. Noah's Ark was said to have been the largest sea going vessel ever built until the late nineteenth century when giant metal ships were first constructed. Its length to width ratio of exactly six to one provided excellent stability on the high seas. In fact, modern shipbuilders say it would have been almost impossible to turn over. In every way, it was admirably suited for riding out the tremendous storms in the year of the flood.


These dimensions are especially interesting when compared to those given in the mythical, Babylonian account of the Ark. Here the ark is described as a perfect cube, extending 120 cubits in all directions and with nine decks. Such a vessel with the same length and width would spin slowly round and round in the water and from the standpoint of stability, would be a disaster.


You task is to show me stability of Noah's Ark.

Create ACM feeding animals

7:13 On the same day Noah, with Shem, Ham, and Japheth, his sons, and his wife and his sons' wives, went into the ark;
7:14 And with them, every sort of beast and cattle, and every sort of thing which goes on the earth, and every sort of bird.
7:15 They went with Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.
7:16 Male and female of all flesh went in, as God had said, and the ark was shut by the Lord.
Once abroad,many have suggested that Noah's problems really began, with only 8 people to feed and water, to provide fresh air and sanitation
for the huge menagerie of animals.Given a list of how much time it takes for one person to feed an animal, you must find the minimum account of
total time needed to feed all of the animals.The time given from any person to feed any animal will not exceed 10000.

Create ACM the legend of valiant emigration

The holy topic of human being,love,appears now.Firstly,I'd like to introduce a love song cited from <>
to you as follows.

The Woman
Your lips cover me with kisses;
your love is better than wine.
There is a fragrance about you;
the sound of your name recalls it.
No woman could help loving you.
Take me with you,and we'll run away.
be my king and take me to your room.
We will be happy together,
drink deep,and lose ourselves in love.
No wonder all women love you.
Women of Jerusalem,I am dark but beautiful,
dark as the desert tents of Kedar,
but beautiful as the curtains in Soloman's palace.
Don't look down on me because of my colour,
because the sun has tanned me.
My brotherw were angry with me
and made me work in the vineyard.
I had no time to care for myself.
Tell me,my love,
Where will you lead your flock to graze?
Where will they rest from the noonday sun?
Why should I need to look for you
among the flocks of the other shepherds?

The Man
Don't you know the place,loveliest of women?
Go and follow the flock;
find pasture for your goats near the tents of the shepherds.
You,my love,excite men as a mare excites the stallions of
Pharaoh's chariots.
Your hair is beautiful upon your cheeks
and falls along your neck like jewels.
But we will make for you a chain of gold with ornaments of silver.

The Woman
My king was lying on his couch,
and my perfume filled the air with fragrance.
My lover has the scent of myrrh as he lies upon my breasts.
My lover is like the wild flowers
that bloom in the vineyards at Engedi.

The Man
How beautiful you are,my love;
how your eyes shine with love!

The Woman
How handsome you are,my dearest;
how you delight me!
The green grass will be our bed;
the cedars will be the beams of our house,
and the cypress-trees the ceiling.
I am only a wild flower in Sharon,
a lily in a mountain valley.

The Man
Like a lily among thorns
is my darling among women.

The Woman
Like an apple-tree among the trees of the forest,
so is my dearest compared with other men.
I love to sit in its shadow,
and its fruit is sweet to my taste.
He brought me to his banqueting hall
and raised the banner of love over me.
Restore my strength with raisins
and refresh me with apples!
I am weak from passion.
His left hand is under my head,
and his right hand caresses me.
Promise me,women of Jerusalem;
swear by the swift deer and the gazelles
that you will not interrupt our love.

How beautiful the song is! The God is moved by the holy love between them and decides to help them run away to that place
having full-blown the green grass,the cedars,the cypress-trees and the flowers .There are many cities at that time,such as
Jerusalem,Bethlehem,Carmel,Hebron,Ziklog,Beersheba,Gath,Libnah,Ekron,Beth Horon,Shiloh,Gilgal,and so on.The two lovers
sets out from Jerusalem,and the destination is The Garden of Eden.There are roads between cities,each road has a
guard who has "pguard" power to beat and "sguard" speed to run.The two lovers can run away together,they have "plovers"
power to beat and "slovers" speed to run.  They can go through the road if and only if their power "plovers" is bigger than the guard and the speed "slovers" 

is bigger than the guard..The God help them calculate the cost of each road,and place a

heart-shaped elixir,associated with a letter to distinguish them,in each road.Your task is to minimize the cost

and display the letters of elixirs they will get in the way.

libctf: eliminate dtd_u, part 5: structs / unions

Eliminate the dynamic member storage for structs and unions as we have
for other dynamic types.  This is much like the previous enum
elimination, except that structs and unions are the only types for which
a full-sized ctf_type_t might be needed.  Up to now, this decision has
been made in the individual ctf_add_{struct,union}_sized functions and
duplicated in ctf_add_member_offset.  The vlen machinery lets us
simplify this, always allocating a ctf_lmember_t and setting the
dtd_data's ctt_size to CTF_LSIZE_SENT: we figure out whether this is
really justified and (almost always) repack things down into a
ctf_stype_t at ctf_serialize time.

This allows us to eliminate the dynamic member paths from the iterators and
query functions in ctf-types.c in favour of always using the large-structure
vlen stuff for dynamic types (the diff is ugly but that's just because of the
volume of reindentation this calls for).  This also means the large-structure
vlen stuff gets more heavily tested, which is nice because it was an almost
totally unused code path before now (it only kicked in for structures of size
>4GiB, and how often do you see those?)

The only extra complexity here is ctf_add_type.  Back in the days of the
nondeduplicating linker this was called a ridiculous number of times for
countless identical copies of structures: eschewing the repeated lookups of the
dtd in ctf_add_member_offset and adding the members directly saved an amazing
amount of time.  Now the nondeduplicating linker is gone, this is extreme
overoptimization: we can rip out the direct addition and use ctf_member_next and
ctf_add_member_offset, just like ctf_dedup_emit does.

We augment a ctf_add_type test to try adding a self-referential struct, the only
thing the ctf_add_type part of this change really perturbs.

This completes the elimination of dtd_u.

Create ACM bishops

KO learned the rules of chess and defeated his father, all his friends, his little brother, and now no one wants to play with him any more.
And so he plays with himself, that is, he often asks some interesting questions. One day, he moved to this question: ?Given a N*N chessboard,
how many bishops can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other at most??. KO was in trouble and you must help the poor boy.

Create ACM Olympic

"One World One Dream" fully reflects the essence and the universal values of the Olympic spirit ---- Unity, Friendship, Progress, Harmony,
Participation and Dream. It expresses the common wishes of people all over the world, inspired by the Olympic ideals, to strive for a bright future
of Mankind. In spite of the differences in colors, languages and races, we share the charm and joy of the Olympic Games, and together we seek for the ideal of Mankind for peace. We belong to the same world and we share the same aspirations and dreams.

"One World One Dream" is a profound manifestation of the core concepts of the Beijing Olympic Games. It reflects the values of harmony connoted in the concept of "People's Olympics", the core and soul of the three concepts -- "Green Olympics, High-tech Olympics and People's Olympics".
While "Harmony of Man with Nature" and "Peace Enjoys Priority" are the philosophies and ideals of the Chinese people since ancient times in their pursuit of the harmony between Man and Nature and the harmony among people, building up a harmonious society and achieving harmonious
development are the dream and aspirations of ours. It is our belief that peace and progress, harmonious development, living in amity, cooperation and mutual benefit, and enjoying a happy life are the common ideals of the people throughout the world.

"One World, One Dream" is simple in expressions, but profound in meaning. It is of China, and also of the world. It conveys the lofty ideal of the
people in Beijing as well as in China to share the global community and civilization and to create a bright future hand in hand with the people from the rest of the world. It expresses the firm belief of a great nation, with a long history of 5,000 years and on its way towards modernization, that
is committed to peaceful development, harmonious society and people's happiness. It voices the aspirations of 1.3 billion Chinese people to
contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and bright world.

The English translation of the slogan is distinctive in sentence structure. The two "One"s are perfectly used in parallel, and the words "World" and "Dream" form a good match. The slogan is simple, meaningful, inspiring, and easy to remember, read and spread.

In Chinese, the word "tongyi", which means "the same", is used for the English word "One". It highlights the theme of "the whole Mankind lives in the same world and seeks for the same dream and ideal".

Please help us write a program to count down days to the upcoming Beijing 2008 Olympic games.

Remove claim regarding "defense of pedophilia"

I'm writing this PR purely in the interest of making this letter's appendix more objective. I don't support or admonish this letter, and I don't want to step on anyone's toes or get involved in a big political mess. If you don't like my PR, you can close it off, but my hope is that it'll be accepted or at least discussed properly.

This PR deletes the following text (and updates the citation numbers to be accurate):

```markdown
He defended pedophilia, in general, in saying that “there is little evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts children.”[9]
```

If we look at the cited reference, we find the following entry on Stallman's blog:

> 04 January 2013 (Pedophilia)
> There is little evidence to justify the [widespread assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts children](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/03/paedophilia-bringing-dark-desires-light).
> 
> Granted, children may not dare say no to an older relative, or may not realize they could say no; in that case, even if they do not overtly object, the relationship may still feel imposed to them. That's not willing participation, it's imposed participation, a different issue.

I do not agree that Stallman's post constitutes, as the letter's text says, a _"defense of pedophilia"_. He's linking to, and quoting/paraphrasing an article published in The Guardian, which says:

> A liberal professor of psychology who studied in the late 1970s will see things very differently from someone working in child protection, or with convicted sex offenders. There is, astonishingly, not even a full academic consensus on whether consensual paedophilic relations necessarily cause harm.
> [...]
> Even now there is no academic consensus on that fundamental question – as Goode found. Some academics do not dispute the view of Tom O'Carroll, a former chairman of PIE and tireless paedophilia advocate with a conviction for distributing indecent photographs of children following a sting operation, that society's outrage at paedophilic relationships is essentially emotional, irrational, and not justified by science. "It is the quality of the relationship that matters," O'Carroll insists. "If there's no bullying, no coercion, no abuse of power, if the child enters into the relationship voluntarily … the evidence shows there need be no harm."

The article seems to be discussing the surprising lack of scientific consensus concerning some aspects of pedophilia. Anyone could read this article and link to it saying, "it appears that there is little evidence to justify the assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts children". This is the point that the The Guardian piece is making, that there is a lack of scientific consensus on this matter.

I don't think that by merely repeating The Guardian's statement, or the statement that followed it in his post, that Stallman actually engaged in what this open letter describes as a _"defense of pedophilia"_, and think it would be more accurate if this claim was removed.

Again, please don't mob me for proposing this change. I'm not trying to upset anyone or to make any kind of defense or admonishment of Stallman. I just think this letter could stand to remove a misleading claim.

The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian: novella for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the Latin: novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning "new".[1]

Some novelists, including Nathaniel Hawthorne,[2] Herman Melville,[3] Ann Radcliffe,[4] John Cowper Powys,[5] preferred the term "romance" to describe their novels.

According to Margaret Doody, the novel has "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years", with its origins in the Ancient Greek and Roman novel, in Chivalric romance, and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance novella.[6] The ancient romance form was revived by Romanticism, especially the historical romances of Walter Scott and the Gothic novel.[7] Some, including M. H. Abrams and Walter Scott, have argued that a novel is a fiction narrative that displays a realistic depiction of the state of a society, while the romance encompasses any fictitious narrative that emphasizes marvellous or uncommon incidents.[8][9][10]

Works of fiction that include marvellous or uncommon incidents are also novels, including The Lord of The Rings,[11] To Kill a Mockingbird,[12] and Frankenstein.[13] "Romances" are works of fiction whose main emphasis is on marvellous or unusual incidents, and should not be confused with the romance novel, a type of genre fiction that focuses on romantic love.

Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, an early 11th-century Japanese text, has sometimes been described as the world's first novel, but there is considerable debate over this — there were certainly long fictional works that preceded it. Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of classical Chinese novels by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). An early example from Europe was written in Muslim Spain by the Sufi writer Ibn Tufayl entitled Hayy ibn Yaqdhan.[14] Later developments occurred after the invention of the printing press. Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first significant European novelist of the modern era.[15] Literary historian Ian Watt, in The Rise of the Novel (1957), argued that the modern novel was born in the early 18th century.

Defining the genre

Madame de Pompadour spending her afternoon with a book (François Boucher, 1756)
A novel is a long, fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences. The novel in the modern era usually makes use of a literary prose style. The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in printing, and the introduction of cheap paper in the 15th century.

Fictional narrative
Fictionality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from historiography. However this can be a problematic criterion. Throughout the early modern period authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion. Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes. Novels can, on the other hand, depict the social, political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history.

Literary prose
While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel, the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the Romance language of southern France, especially those by Chrétien de Troyes (late 12th century), and in Middle English (Geoffrey Chaucer's (c. 1343 – 1400) The Canterbury Tales).[16] Even in the 19th century, fictional narratives in verse, such as Lord Byron's Don Juan (1824), Alexander Pushkin's Yevgeniy Onegin (1833), and Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh (1856), competed with prose novels. Vikram Seth's The Golden Gate (1986), composed of 590 Onegin stanzas, is a more recent example of the verse novel.[17]

Experience of intimacy
Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe, prose fiction created intimate reading situations. On the other hand, verse epics, including the Odyssey and Aeneid, had been recited to select audiences, though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters. A new world of individualistic fashion, personal views, intimate feelings, secret anxieties, "conduct", and "gallantry" spread with novels and the associated prose-romance.

Length
The novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction, followed by the novella. However, in the 17th century, critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival. A precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction, is, however, not possible. The philosopher and literary critic György Lukács argued that the requirement of length is connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the totality of life.[18]

title: History Stats
description: Instructions about how to integrate historical statistics into Home Assistant.
ha_category:
  - Utility
  - Sensor
ha_iot_class: Local Polling
ha_release: 0.39
ha_quality_scale: internal
ha_domain: history_stats
---

The `history_stats` sensor platform provides quick statistics about another integration or platforms, using data from the [`history`](/integrations/history/) integration.

It can track how long the integration has been in a specific state, in a custom time period.

Examples of what you can track:

- How long you were at home this week
- How long the lights were ON yesterday
- How long you watched TV today

## Configuration

To enable the history statistics sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: history_stats
    name: Lamp ON today
    entity_id: light.my_lamp
    state: 'on'
    type: time
    start: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration %}
entity_id:
  description: The entity you want to track.
  required: true
  type: string
state:
  description: The states you want to track.
  required: true
  type: [list, string]
name:
  description: Name displayed on the frontend. Note that it is used by Home Assistant to generate sensor's `object_id` so it is advisable to choose a unique one and change name for frontend using [customization](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/#friendly_name) or via [Lovelace](/lovelace/entities/#name).
  required: false
  default: unnamed statistics
  type: string
type:
  description: "The type of sensor: `time`, `ratio`, or `count`."
  required: false
  default: time
  type: string
start:
  description: When to start the measure (timestamp or datetime).
  required: false
  type: template
end:
  description: When to stop the measure (timestamp or datetime).
  required: false
  type: template
duration:
  description: Duration of the measure.
  required: false
  type: time
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>

  You have to provide **exactly 2** of `start`, `end` and `duration`.
<br/>
  You can use [template extensions](/topics/templating/#home-assistant-template-extensions) such as `now()` or `as_timestamp()` to handle dynamic dates, as shown in the examples below.

</div>

## Sensor type

Depending on the sensor type you choose, the `history_stats` integration can show different values:

- **time**: The default value, which is the tracked time, in hours
- **ratio**: The tracked time divided by the length of your period, as a percentage
- **count**: How many times the integration you track was changed to the state you track

## Time periods

The `history_stats` integration will execute a measure within a precise time period. You should always provide 2 of the following :
- When the period starts (`start` variable)
- When the period ends (`end` variable)
- How long is the period (`duration` variable)

As `start` and `end` variables can be either datetimes or timestamps, you can configure almost any period you want.

### Duration

The duration variable is used when the time period is fixed. Different syntaxes for the duration are supported, as shown below.

```yaml
# 6 hours
duration: 06:00
```

```yaml
# 1 minute, 30 seconds
duration: 00:01:30
```

```yaml
# 2 hours and 30 minutes
duration:
  # supports seconds, minutes, hours, days
  hours: 2
  minutes: 30
```

<div class='note'>

  If the duration exceeds the number of days of history stored by the `recorder` component (`purge_keep_days`), the history statistics sensor will not have all the information it needs to look at the entire duration. For example, if `purge_keep_days` is set to 7, a history statistics sensor with a duration of 30 days will only report a value based on the last 7 days of history.

</div>

### Examples

Here are some examples of periods you could work with, and what to write in your `configuration.yaml`:

**Today**: starts at 00:00 of the current day and ends right now.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

**Yesterday**: ends today at 00:00, lasts 24 hours.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      hours: 24
```

{% endraw %}

**This morning (6AM - 11AM)**: starts today at 6, lasts 5 hours.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ now().replace(hour=6, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      hours: 5
```

{% endraw %}

**Current week**: starts last Monday at 00:00, ends right now.

Here, last Monday is _today_ as a timestamp, minus 86400 times the current weekday (86400 is the number of seconds in one day, the weekday is 0 on Monday, 6 on Sunday).

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ as_timestamp( now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) ) - now().weekday() * 86400 }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

**Next 4pm **: ends today at 00:00, lasts 30 days. Easy one.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      days: 30
```

{% endraw %}

**Last 30 days**: ends today at 00:00, lasts 30 days. Easy one.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) }}'
    duration:
      days: 30
```

{% endraw %}


** 4PM always in the future**: ends in the future at 16:00, starts 24 hours before.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    end: '{{ (now().replace(minute=0,second=0) + timedelta(hours=8)).replace(hour=16) }}'
    duration:
      hours: 24
```

{% endraw %}

**All your history** starts at timestamp = 0, and ends right now.

{% raw %}

```yaml
    start: '{{ 0 }}'
    end: '{{ now() }}'
```

{% endraw %}

<div class='note'>

  The `/developer-tools/template` page of your Home Assistant UI can help you check if the values for `start`, `end` or `duration` are correct. If you want to check if your period is right, just click on your component, the `from` and `to` attributes will show the start and end of the period, nicely formatted.

No error for no-ops in `ungroup` and friends

Currently, `ungroup` and `unsubtract` throw a `DataErr`, if a dataset is not
grouped or not subtracted. Why is this necessary?
For purely interactive use if just one or two datasets, an Exception is one way
of providing feedback to the user and remind him "hey, you did not even group
 this before, are you sure you know what you are doing?".
However, when working with more datasets, it gets annoying and it's even worse
when I have a long-running script. Why does the script fail, if all I'm doing is
to accidentally ungroup something that was ungrouped before.
Here is what I do: I play around interactively, group with or that and then I
want to ungroup or unsubtract everything. Currently, I have to go one by one,
with code like this:
```
for i in ui.list_data_ids():
        try:
            ui.ungroup(i)
        except sherpa.utils.err.DataErr:
            # It's already ungrouped
            pass
```

That's clunky, so I wonder: Why is it necessary to throw an Exception when a
dataset is already ungrouped or unsubtracted?
If I want to ungroup, why would it matter to me if data was previously grouped
or not? What matters is that it's ungrouped after.

This PR removes some of those (in my opinion) annoying exceptions.

Makes stations more airtight (#57535)

I've gone through delta, meta, and icebox and added some choice windoors, changed some areas around, added some more doors, and changed some other miscellaneous things.

I'll list the full changes in drop downs, for both our sakes

Delta:
<details>
Splits the central hallway into fore and aft central hallways

Adds the spaces that jut out of medbay and sci into the central hallway, rather then having them be a part of
medbay and sci

Adds medbay access locked windoors to the back desk of the medbay reception area

Adds airlocks to both the upper and lower parts of the main hallway
</details>

Meta:
<details>
Gives the storage wing another set of firelocks, and two fire alarms. It didn't have any alarms in the first place, so hopefully this helps things

Adds the spaces that jut out of medbay and sci into the central hallway, rather then having them be a part of
medbay and sci

Replaces a small bit of the science area with nanite lab, to prevent a breach near xenobio causing fire alarms
at the front of sci

Adds a windoor in front of the ORM to block air

Adds a wall behind a smart fridge in chemistry
</details>

Icebox:
<details>
Added airlocks between arrivals and the port hallway, and the escape hallway and the starboard hallway

Added a windoor between the kitchen and the bar
</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game

Cuts delta's main hallway in half, with the goal of reducing fire alarm strain. Some thoughts on this would be nice, I don't want to make everything else that uses areas worse just because fire alarms are dumb, and I'm worried that's what I've ended up doing here.

I've also added the portions of medbay/sci that jut out into the main hallway into the main hallway, I think? I could make these into lobby areas, but I'm not sure if that's appropriate or not.

Adds a few windoors and airlocks to better section off portions of the station, this should reduce the amount of mass gas spreading that can occur.

My goal here is to reduce the amount of uninteresting gas movement and make firelocks less hellish when there's a breach

Let me go through these two videos starting with the first one.

I'll have to go for a math explanation when this is done. I do not understand what is going on just from this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzjtU4WLYNs

I'll leave the next in the serie for later. I want an explanation for how the equations are derived.

11:30am. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS3677PlIos

This video explains how the splines are derived succinctly enough. Ok. I might as well watch the rest.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEhBM2x5MG9-e_JSOzU068w

There is a lot of stuff here actually. At some point I should study all of this. But what is the next one in the series?

Math for Game Developers - Constant Speed Splines

This is the next one. Let me go for it.

11:45am. https://youtu.be/-mad4YPAn2U?t=470

I find this quite confusing.

`f t = integrate (from: 0 to: t) (fun t => L t) = d`

Where does the `t` parameter disappear if `f t = d`. Then...

`g t = f t - d = 0`

Is the hidden `t` in `d` in fact `t`. So the above is equivalent to writing `g t = f t - f t = 0`? Or maybe it is meant to mean something like...

`g t = f t - f x = 0` where x is an arbitrary constant. Then...

`t (n + 1) = t n - (g (t n)) / g' (t n)`. Reducing that step...

`t (n + 1) = t n - (f (t n) - d) / L (t n)`

I suppose it makes sense. I am guessing that `d t` will turn out to be `t (n+1) - t n`...or maybe not.

11:55am. Looking at this from a programming angle, it just show how loose and unrigorous math can be. I wouldn't rate this explanation highly.

This might be good for creating the clould of Spiral icons.

I've though about it yesterday and I've realized that the Spiral logo will resemble a snail.

...That is strangely fitting given my trajectory.

> PShapes also support loading shape files, such as an SVG (for 2D shapes) or OBJ (for 3D shapes). This can be achieved with the loadShape() method.

Ah, so this is why these shapes exist.

https://processing.org/tutorials/rendering/

Let me read this.

After I am done with the Processing tuts, I'll go back to Kivy. I am going to have to go through its examples. Maybe I'll even get a Processing book from libgen.

```java
PGraphics circles;

void setup() {
  size(100, 100);
  circles = createGraphics(width, height); circles.beginDraw();
  circles.background(0);
  circles.noStroke();
  circles.fill(255, 100); circles.endDraw();
  noCursor();
}

void draw() {
  image(circles, 0, 0);
  stroke(255);
  line(mouseX, 0, mouseX, height);
  line(0, mouseY, width, mouseY);
}

void mousePressed() {
  circles.beginDraw();
  circles.ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 40, 40);
  circles.endDraw();
}
```

This is interesting. If it were for PGraphics, I'd need to use an array and accumulate the circles there.

> Transparent backgrounds aren’t possible for the display window, the default PGraphics object. They are one of the primary advantages of creating a new drawing surface.

I can't focus on this right now. Let me move on.

What is this?

3:10pm. This is too advanced for me right now. It would take me too much time to study this. Forget it.

https://processing.org/tutorials/p3d/
https://processing.org/tutorials/pvector/

Let me just skim these two again.

> In particular, using the new "shape recording" functionality available in PShape (see PShape tutorial) can greatly increase speed in P3D mode.

3:25pm. Uah, enough. I can't take this anymore. Let me break just for a bit. Unless I want to spend some time writing the Spiral logo and the card icons in Processing, the next stop is Kivy.

I think at this point I understand the very basics of graphics. I am not sure if I am even 2/5, but I am not a low 1 anymore.

3:35pm. Let me take a look at the two Kivy books. After that I'll take a look at the Kivy examples again to see if I can make rectangles without outlines. After that comes drawing shapes that are filled.

3:40pm. The book by Dusty Phillips is really small. I'll skim through its 139 pages quickly.

> The width and height values themselves are pretty easy to interpret. They can be integer values, in which case they refer to the pixel size of the widget on the screen. However, you can also pass string values such as "1cm", "0.75in", or "100dp" to render the widget relative to the resolution of the display. This is almost always a good idea, because modern devices can have an extremely wide variety of pixel densities. A pixel on a cheap laptop might be three times the size of a pixel on a high-end smartphone, and the disparity is even larger for so-called retina displays.

Oh, I did not know about this. Ok, I see.

> Personally, unless I have a good reason to do otherwise, I always use Kivy’s concept of display pixels by passing a suffix of dp to my height and width properties. A display pixel is a resolution-independent value that roughly maps to “the size of a pixel on a typical laptop at 72 dots per inch.” On a lower-end screen, 1 display pixel is equivalent to 1 pixel. On top-end displays, a display pixel might be 3 or 4 real pixels wide. The display pixel will be roughly the same size on all the devices; it’s the pixels themselves that are smaller. It’s not guaranteed, but I find that a display pixel on mobile devices is a bit bigger than on desktops and laptops. This is useful, since touch interfaces need to provide a bit more room for widgets to accommodate the clumsy size of the human finger.

I should do this as wlel.

4:15pm. Ok, enough. I know I said I am supposed to be reading books, but my focus is at its lowest. I just don't care about this and it is boring me out of my mind.

It is time to get back to Kivy.

Let me try doing that table that I did in Processing in Kivy.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/index.html

I need to go through these. Many of these are drawing examples.

```py

        animation += Animation(size=(500, 500), pos=(200, 100), t='out_bounce')
        animation += Animation(pos=(0, 0), size=(100, 50))
```

&= does not work for me, but this is interesting either way.

```fs
type AttentionState = {
    modules : string Set * string list
    packages : string Set * string list
    old_packages : SchemaEnv
    supervisor : SupervisorState
    }

let attention_server (errors : SupervisorErrorSources) (req : _ Ch) =
    let push path (s,o) = Set.add path s, path :: o
    let add (s,o) l = Array.foldBack (fun x (s,o as z) -> if Set.contains x s then z else Set.add x s, x :: o) l (s,o)
    let update (s : AttentionState) (modules,packages,supervisor) = {modules = add s.modules modules; packages = add s.packages packages; supervisor = supervisor; old_packages = s.supervisor.packages}
```

I started wondering about the way old packages are cleared and I've realized that I might have a bug.

But nevermind this. I'll worry about this later if it comes to that.

Focus on the Kivy examples.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36203712/kivy-fill-a-custom-shape-with-color
> There is not a single 'fill' instruction, you must draw a triangulated shape that fills the area. If it isn't something with its own instruction, like an ellipse or rectangle, you can use a Mesh.

Damn.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.graphics.vertex_instructions.html#kivy.graphics.vertex_instructions.Mesh

What are XYUV?

4:55pm. https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/gen__canvas__fbo_canvas__py.html

I'll leave the previous question for later. I'll have to study meshes. Right now, there is not much use to Bezier curves as far as I am concerned. Since they can't be filled, what am I going to do with them.

But there are a lot of good Kivy examples, so let me go through them all. This is more interesting that the books on it.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/gen__canvas__lines__py.html

There seem to be some errors in this. Nevermind that for now.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/gen__canvas__mesh__py.html

Ok, I think I understand meshed. The UV I remember from the first part of one of talks being the opposite of the tangent and having something to do with lightning.

5:20pm. https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/gen__canvas__tesselate__py.html

This example is interesting to run. I am not sure how it works though. Let me study the code a bit more.

```py
            with self.canvas.after:
                Color(1, 1, 1, 1)
                for vertices, indices in tess.meshes:
                    Mesh(vertices=vertices, indices=indices,
                         mode="triangle_fan")
```

I do not understand. WHy does this cause the color to invert?

Ah, maybe the Tesselator cuts up the intersecting vertices?

5:35pm. https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/gen__demo__multistroke__main__py.html

This one is too large for me to study.

Ok, enough. I've barely even looked at the last parts, but I know enough that I won't need them.

5:40pm. One thing I've understood from the examples is that I should look more into meshes. Since they can't be filled, I don't have much use for Bezier curves. Instead I could cut out the table edges from ellipses.

Or I should take the easy way, do all the graphics in Processing and load them up as images in Kivy. That is the most realistic option for making progress.

Imagine I want to make chips. It makes sense to model them as tubes in Processing, and then export them as pngs. I'll have a hard time if I want to do them directly in Kivy.

5:50pm. Ok, focus me. Let me watch that Mesh talk from where I was last time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9RK6O2kOKo
Unite 2015 - A coder's guide to spline-based procedural geometry

I meant this one. AFter that I'll be done for the day. Tomorrow, I'll move forward with my plan. Technically, I could do in Kivy everything I could do in Processing, but it would take more effort.

This situation mirrors the Kivy/Spiral situation, and is a challenge I need to overcome.

https://youtu.be/o9RK6O2kOKo?t=405

Here is the UV explanation.

https://youtu.be/o9RK6O2kOKo?t=498

Ah, I see. The indices are there so old vertices can be reused.

https://youtu.be/o9RK6O2kOKo?t=1854

Let me just pause here for a bit.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.graphics.svg.html

It seems that Kivy has plans to support Svg. This is what Processing uses to save its objects. If I could make use of this, that would be the ideal solution. There is a warning that this is highly experimental though. I'll want to try this out.

https://www.coreldraw.com/en/pages/svg-file/

> SVG is short for “Scalable Vector Graphics”. It’s a XML based two-dimensional graphic file format. SVG format was developed as an open standard format by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The primary use of SVG files are for sharing graphics contents on the Internet. SVG files are suitable for that because the XML base allows SVG files to be searched, indexed, compressed, and scripted. SVG files are widely supported in Internet Browsers. Google Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, and every popular browser has the capacity to render SVG images. SVG files are also supported in basic text editors and high-end Graphics editors like CorelDRAW.

Time for lunch.

6:55pm. Let me watch the second half of that talk and then I am done.

7:10pm. Nevermind the question & answer section. I am done. Tomorrow I am going to do those cards and Spiral's logo in Processing. The same goes for the table. I'll just load it as an image.

I am going to use this general technique of using the right tool for the job even if it makes for more intermediate steps. I am not going to get good at combining languages unless I go on this direction. I should just try out going this way.

I can't allow myself to introduce friction between Python and Spiral. The same goes between Python and Processing.

I need to pick up the pace. Do the graphics, do the UI, and then move on to doing the agent. There is nothing else that I need to do.

Spiral is done. And I need to prove myself, most of all to myself. It is really killing me inside that it is almost April 2021 and I still haven't dealt with RL. I can't stand this shame any longer.

I want to give it my all."
