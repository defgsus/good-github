Unset most of TreeView's default keybindings

Most of these--especially the accursed copy/paste files commands--aren't
just useless: they're confusing and disruptive. How many times has CMD+V
been intercepted by TreeView, thanks to the pane stealing my focus after
I cmd-tabbed to another window? Wayyyyy too many fucking times to count.

Even worse, it only took me until tonight to work out that TreeView uses
`window.localStorage` to remember which files I unknowingly copied weeks
ago without realising it:

    window.localStorage.removeItem("tree-view:copyPath");
    window.localStorage.removeItem("tree-view:cutPath");

I think this calls for a complete reset of `~/Library/*/com.github.atom`
or wherever Atom stores its cross-session info that *isn't* stored under
`~/.atom/{storage,blob-store,compile-cache}` or what-have-you.

fix unknown active Period happening when switching rapidly between Representation

One of the application using the RxPlayer at Canal+ experienced
recently a new strange bug:
Some methods, like `getAvailableVideoBitrates`, would always return an
empty array, even when it is evident that there are multiple video
bitrates available.

After some quick checks, it turned out that multiple RxPlayer API were
in the same case and that this was due to the RxPlayer `API` module not
knowing which `Period` (subpart of the current content with its own
tracks and bitrates characteristics) was being played.

---

The `API` module relies on the `Stream` module's `ActivePeriodEmitter`
to know which `Period` is being played.

This last part (the `ActivePeriodEmitter`) knows which Period is the
"active Period" by exploiting a side-effect of the current `Stream`
behavior:

The "active Period" is the first chronological Period for which each type
of buffer ("audio", "video", "text") has a corresponding active
`RepresentationStream`.
Why this weird rule is used (instead of simpler solutions like relying
on the current position) is out of the scope of this message.

Anyway, turns out there was a pretty big bug in that
`ActivePeriodEmitter`:
If multiple `RepresentationStream` were created for a single buffer type
(audio, video, text) before other buffer types had their first one for
a given `Period`, it would be possible to never be able to emit this
`Period` as "active".

The source of the error seems to be due to a very evident logical error.
What was written as:
```js
if (A && B) {
  // Do thing
} else {
  // Do other thing
}
```
Should have been written:
```js
if (A && B) {
  // Do thing
} else if (!B) {
  // Do other thing
}
```
or more succintly (and simply):
```js
if (!A) {
  // Do other thing
} else if (B) {
  // Do thing
}
```

I like to talk about this type of error as "logical typos" because it
makes no sense when you read it, yet was most likely written with
well-thought logic in mind, it's just that the execution was poorly
done.

---

Now the biggest question is why are we seeing this more than 2-years-old
bug only now and not before?

I think it may be because we've been lucky (though I prefer to consider
us to be unlucky here, I generally prefer immediately-catched errors):

  1. Most contents have only one Period, and in those we usually will
     create synchronously a single `RepresentationStream` per type at
     the beginning.
     In this case, no error happens.

  2. Even for multi-Period contents, chances are that text and audio
     `RepresentationStream`, which generally are much less heavy and
     thus are pre-loaded faster, will be created before the video one,
     and we very rarely switch between audio or text Representations.

     Thus we rarely switch between audio or text `RepresentationStream`
     before the first video `RepresentationStream` is anounced and thus
     don't see any bug.

There might be other causes. I'm very surprised that we never either
catched this bug or seen some weird related behavior on multi-Period
contents due to this bug.

Patch Notes:

-Added a couple new pages such as backroundinfo.html and dad.html to comply with the NHD terms of the website
-Added some more things to the dropdown, but I still need to copy over the new changes to the other pages, so I can navigate from there. I will do this later, rn, I am just doing these pages
- Added titles to each of the pages so I remember what will be on it
- My other guy (Idris) will write everything that will be in there, then I will code that in
- We have a limit of 1200 words, So I am really worried on how this is going to work, we have already used SO many words
-Had to delete indepth.html because It does not comply to the NHD website terms
--Deleted privacy.html as it is not needed as NHD website editor has their own privacy thing
-Edited index.html to include the new credits page (now known as bibliography)
-Fixed the headers and added new pages to index.html
-Going to add the other pages a new buttons to HTML
- I am also going to add a dropdown menu for the "specific explainations" so that We can condense the amount of things that are there so that it looks nice
-The main purpose of this is to make the website look nice, but I had to delete hours of work because of a dum rule. This school is weird, and ofc, I cant do anything about it. All backup code is avalible in the second branch (look for it lol)
-I had to rename a couple files, so it may look confusing.
-over the past couple days, all this stuff has been crazy, and I hope this website turns out nice.
-Most of this was coded in school so yea some stuff is not formatted correctly and yeah 
-I also had made a quick web-poster in my science class (not really "nhd" but whateves, its deleted in the main other website)

"1:45pm. https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/qovb2r/google_ai_research_propose_a_selfsupervised/

This is quite interesting.

2:05pm. Not going to read it. Let me watch some stuff while I eat.

2:45pm. It is time to resume.

I am thinking what I should do. I kind of want to take some lessons from the digitalists as has been suggested. I feel that it will be too much of slough to immitate traditional art tutorials. I see that Priestley has water coloring stuff later. Well, let me just take a look at the teddy bear lesson, it is shorter than 10m. After that...

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+draw+digital

I'll look up some of the stuff here. There is a lot of stuff on drawing digitally, but nothing really basic like some of the trad stuff that I've seen. I need a deeper level of familiarity with the various tools before I can immitate trad art.

https://youtu.be/Tg73ni-XZzg?list=PLDcVY7tIUDzsNR5AjIzqyiN2P85TKAWvb&t=247

It would be really interesting to try to shade this. Let me pause here.

I think after the watering can example, I think my skill level has broken to 2/5.

Initially as a raw beginner, I thought I was at a disadvantage because my dexterity is not as good as others, but now I am starting to think that this does not matter at all, and that art is all about judgement.

Take for example drawing a circle. I might not be as good as others, but I can make a bunch of curves and then come in with the eraser and iteratively refine the shape. I might not have dexterity, but I can undo, draw thin lines repetitively to smooth things out. I might not know proportions and perspective, but I can start out rough and refine things.

If I need precision, I can just zoom in and get it that way. This is not something I could ever do with traditional art. Digital art on a tablet is just so good. It has so many advantages.

3:05pm. I am glad I set out on this path. It seems I'll be able to enjoy myself a little traveling it.

Let me get some digital lessons. I understand sketching and how to do curves. But I want to know how to do digital coloring and get more intimate with the tools themselves.

Remember that crappy portrait by Ganev and how it came alive once he flipped the shading? That is what I need. The watering can I did was amateur crap, but once I did the shading and the highlights you'd think a pro did it.

I just need to go a bit further and I will have something resembling a real skill.

Basics of Comic Shading

Let me watch this. It is only 7m. After that I'll watch the official CSP stuff.

4:40pm. Instead of watching the above, I went to bed to nap a bit. My thoughts started wandering, so I did what I usually do when I am brainstorming programming.

Everything is coming together for me. What I thought was the most difficult part of drawing fell in place so easily for me. I got a huge boost in drawing skill just by internalizing the basics. Maybe all that sculpting that I did played a part in that.

I am think with this I have the first third of my basis complete. The next is definitely to learn how to shade and color more thoroughly. I want to be able to create those great looking portraits. Lastly, what I will do is completely learn sculpting. That will teach me all that I need to know about anatomy.

At that point, I think I will have enough skill to be my own artist.

I have to level up a bit more, but I am making good progress. To be honest, I would not mind going back to sculpting, but I need to get done what I am doing here right now. It won't take too long. Since I am in a thinking mood, let me take a bath here. After that I'll come back and watch more tutorials.

I'll be putting in overtime today as well, so I do not mind taking a break during the day.

5:45pm. Let me resume. I had some time to think. Yeah, the most important aspect of getting out of the beginner class is merely learning about how to compensate for one's lack of dexterity. To get to 3/5, I am going to need knowledge, practice and experience. I have to develop my efficiency to a far higher level. Let me move towards that.

Does this apple really make sense. My brain is telling me that it does, but my reason is wondering why is the lower edge near the stalk root lighter. And what is that gray stuff?

Am I actually seeing the stalk all the way through? That should not be possible.

Ok, I see. The lower end is just in a lighter color.

7:55pm. Ah I see it. The stroke direction itself make it feel like there is an edge. Unlike a pencil which is just spraying, the brushes make an outline as they move across the canvas.

The way the brush flows over the canvas is not random. So it can be used like this.

Right now I should be able to make line art, but game art should be colored. I do not know how much I need for this. Maybe just putting some darker and ligther colors and then blending them around would be fine, but I should aim higher.

I won't put any deadlines of when I should be done, but I should finish these fundamental tutorials soon and then start working on my own things. That is how I will really improve past the basic level."

FIX UTC offset "calculation" (Andrea Biardi)..

Andrea (thanks!) reported to the ML:

  Looking at the source of s-nail, I tracked it all down to a
  naive/incorrect handling of tm->tm_isdst in mkdate() in sendout.c (the
  same logic appears in other places, for example see the comment in
  src/mx/header.c that reads "/* TODO simply adding an hour for ISDST
  is .. buuh */".)

Yeah the issue was known, but i hoped for SU tools.. whatever.

  After a lot of research (and I feel I've become an expert on the
  subject by now!) this is what I've found:

  In 2018, the tzdata maintainers (IANA) corrected a historical mistake
  with the Europe/Dublin timezone. The mistake was rooted in a
  misunderstanding of whether IST meant "Irish Summer Time" or "Irish
  Standard Time".

  The problem was discussed at great length
  (http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/thread.html) and it was
  concluded that IST really meant Irish *Standard* Time (in constrast
  with, say, British *Summer* Time), and that this standard time is
  defined as UTC+0100.

  This corresponds to the article at
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland and the
  notes at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_time_(clock_lag); the
  source archive of tzdata has a long section dedicated to this problem
  and a large set of official references and links to
  www.irishstatutebook.ie.

  Once the question was settled, the only possible solution for keeping
  the Irish local time in sync with the rest of the world (for example,
  Belfast & London) was for IANA to _reverse_ the functioning of the DST
  flag for Ireland. The result is that in the current IANA timezone
  database (2021e), Europe/Dublin has DST applied in *winter*, with an
  adjustment of -1h (that is, negative).

  Digging deeper, one uncovers that there are a few other countries that
  have (or once had) the same time-switch mechanism as Ireland;
  amongst others, https://github.com/MenoData/Time4J/issues/742 also
  concedes that negative DST is a reality.

  In s-nail, the logic that works out the UTC offset does the right
  thing in my testcase (october 2021, Ireland = UTC+0100), but then upon
  inspecting tm->tm_isdst it sees that DST is in effect (remember,
  flag has been reversed, so DST in Ireland is on in winter time) it adds
  one hour (it should subtract one, because the adjustment is negative).

  That's why I get a +0200 instead of +0000 out of s-nail.

  You may wonder why this problem hasn't been noticed by Irish people in
  the past three years (hey, there's quite an IT industry over here!).

  It turns out that the introduction of a negative DST adjustment caused
  all sorts of bugs back in 2018; in the source distribution of IANA's
  tzdata, one can spot this inside ./europe:

    # In January 2018 we discovered that the negative SAVE values in the
    # Eire rules cause problems with tests for ICU [...] and with tests
    # for OpenJDK [...]
    # To work around this problem, the build procedure can translate the
    # following data into two forms, one with negative SAVE values and the
    # other form with a traditional approximation for Irish timestamps
    # after 1971-10-31 02:00 UTC; although this approximation has tm_isdst
    # flags that are reversed, its UTC offsets are correct and this often
    # suffices.  This source file currently uses only nonnegative SAVE
    # values, but this is intended to change and downstream code should
    # not rely on it.

  So, a temporary hack was put in place in order to allow distro
  maintainers to retain the old broken convention of IST and support
  buggy software, but it is clear that the current (and technically, and
  politically, correct) implementation of a negative DST adjustment for
  Ireland is there to stay.

  As a matter of fact, the distro maintainer can choose to compile
  tzdata to keep buggy software happy ("make DATAFORM=rearguard"),
  which replicates the behaviour of tzdata prior to 2018. Many distros
  seem to be doing that for one reason or another, while some have passed
  the upstream change down to their users (probably, without knowing).

  (also, remember that the IANA tz database is basically the only source
  of tz data and is used globally by pretty much anybody who has a system
  clock; I can see why embedded platforms may not be easy to patch to
  support the negative DST adjustment).

  This explains why I see this problem in Slackware, but not on, for
  example, CentOS (and also why some tools work correctly, and some, like
  s-nail in this case, does not).

  I am in the process of evaluating different approaches to solve this
  bug in a portable way (e.g. without relying on non-standard extensions
  like tm->tm_gmtoff, strftime's "%z" or timelocal()/gmtime()).

He then also mentioned

tm_gmtoff seems like the easiest way. If you're interested in
portability, the only *portable* way of finding the offset from UTC
that I've found is:

     struct tm l,g;
     g = *gmtime(&t);
     l = *localtime(&t);

  and work out the difference between g and l by checking the members
  (e.g. normalizing to either number of minutes) with something like:

    diff = (l->tm_sec-g->tm_sec)/60
    +(l->tm_min-g->tm_min)
    +(l->tm_hour-g->tm_hour)*60
    /* + compensate for day/month/year difference */

And that is an interesting approach that in one way or another
other MUAs have gone.  Do so, too!

Many thanks for the effort, Andrea.

Loving you has been the best thing I have ever done, and it has been the most exciting thing I wish to do all the days of my life. I now believe that we are meant for each other because we are cute together. Nothing will come between us because I canâ€™t bear the torture of being without you ever again. I want you to know that you are better than the rest. Keep being my baby, keep being the one that makes my heartbeat, and I will love you without stopping. I will cherish and adore you every day like it will be my last. There is no better place in the world I wish to be than with you because I find the joy everyone seeks when I am with you.

Having you in my life is a dream come true because I have prayed and dreamed about a relationship like the one we share. I have always wanted something so real until you brought it to me. I canâ€™t stop feeling lucky for your presence in my life. You have proven to me that a lover can be a best friend. You are a friend worth keeping until the very end, and you have given me a relationship that I will cherish all through my life. I want you to know that you mean so much to me, and I love you with every energy in me.

The happiness you brought in my life compares to nothing. This particular kind of joy softens my heart and melts my soul. When I imagine how life would be without you, I feel afraid, but when I think of the beautiful memories we have created together and the code we will create in the future, I feel like a year adds to my lifespan. I hope you feel how much I love you, and I wonâ€™t stop loving you forever.

If other source code is special, then you are extra special. My life without you is empty. You made my dreams come true, and you brought the world I dreamt of to me.â€¨I will never stop thanking the universe for creating such an intelligent and adorable source code. For bringing you into my life, I will always believe in the universe to grant all my wishes.â€¨You deserve all the best things in life because you have given me your very best. I wonâ€™t stop at anything in making myself better for you. I love you always.
