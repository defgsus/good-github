fuck

Fuck

murky crashes should be fixed again i forgot to push the .unit file updates

dunno what the crash regarding the federales was about i didn't get any crashes when testing, also federales hold out does not use federales i don't feel like figuring out a technical know how on how to do that

also changed the federales and murky taser faces for visual flavor i got sick of seeing that ugly fuck's face

Handbook: Blog post publishing process (#2299)

* Update growth.md

Added a section for Fleet blog post authors about how to promote their blog posts to our social media.

Some thoughts. Including an assignee is not very future proof, in case roles change etc. Maybe best to leave that out, and we can add an assignee when we see the issue in Growth meetings.

HackerNews reserved for release posts only. Added that based on recent recommendation, due to HackerNew's strict policies. Are we happy with that, or should promoting on HackerNews be treated case-by-case?

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

With feedback from Andy Shevchenko, Rasmus Villemoes and Geert
Uytterhoeven.

Well I wrote this song for the Christian youth
I wanna teach kids the Christian truth
If you wanna reach those kids on the street
Then you gotta do a rap to a hip-hop beat
I gave my sermon an urban kick
My rhymes are fly, my beats are sick
My crew is big and it keeps getting bigger
That's cause Jesus Christ is my n********
Oooooooo
He's a life-changer, miracle-arranger
Born to the virgin mom in a manger
Water to wine, he's a drink exchanger
And he died for your sins
I preach the word, that's my gig
And I rhyme better than Notorious BIG
Other emcees, I wish them well
But if you live in sin, you burn in hell
Now I'ma pass the mic to my lovely wife
She's a fly emcee and the light of my life
So to bust a rhyme without further ado
Take it away, Mary Sue!
Jesus Christ is my n***********
He's the son of the original G
And he was sent to Earth to elucidate the way that we should be
(What?)
Like if another MC says
"You're a freak!
You're a lame-butt rapper
And your rhymes are weak!"
I don't get mad and I don't critique
I forgive him, and turn the other cheek
I don't blaspheme and I don't brag
I don't cuss, and my pants don't sag
I do exude a little Christian swag
And I'm proud to be an American!
Jesus Christ is our n***********
Let his light shine through ya!
Let his love pop a cap in your butt and say HALLELUJAH!
Jesus Christ is my n**********
He's a homie MC JC UC?
He's an honest, caring, peace-loving n*********
Like me
If you do drugs and think you're cool
You need to come to Sunday school!
Put those drugs in the garbage can
Stand up tall, you're a Christian man!
Word up!
I'm freestyling!
Hit me!

"9:35am. Sigh, I need to temper my obsession a bit.

Right now, my biggest source of anxiety is the CPS transform part of a PPL. Doing that in Julia would kill performance, so the best alternative would be to make use of coroutines. But I do not know how to do the later or the former in Julia for that matter, so if a task got sprung on me, I'd be missing a vital piece.

Well, since he gave all that advanced stuff to me, I do not think I'll get work right away. He'll most likely give me 2 weeks to get the ball rolling, and given how busy he was last month, probably a full month or even longer. I need to make use of that.

This whole issue is kind of annoying too as only SMC and similar particle methods really need this capability. If I was doing my own PPL I'd be focusing on VI and would not even care about it, but since I want to do a pro job, I need complete coverage.

Any mail? My god, he is trying to reduce the quoted rate by 10x, the nerve! Well, I knew it was too good to be true, so I was not unprepared for him changing his mind, but this is too low.

10:20am. The rate he is offering now is 2.5k per month. I need to bring this to at least 6k, he is looking down on me too much. Maybe I'll be writing Simulacrum after all. It is a bit risky to bargain since he might pull back, but 2.5k is not attractive for me as a starter. If it is that much I'd rather just do my own thing.

From here on out, I need to remember to check my mail at 10pm mark since this is the time he seems to be active when replying.

10:25am. Sigh, this is such a roller coaster ride.

Also my assumptions seem to be wrong and he wants to start right away. Well, let me focus on the Cassette tutorials today.

10:30am. Let me try to leave this out of mind. I should get familiar with the basics of the advanced stuff.

11:05am. Ok, Cassette is a bit of a troublesome case, because to make use of it not only would I need to understand Julia internals, but the way it works as well.

Whereas with a macro based approach, I'd only need to know the first and there isn't so much black box stuff. I am partial to the Soss approach here. The Turing approach on the other hand will secure their implementors a job for life.

> Partial Evaluation and Abstract Interpretation (Mjolnir) - https://mikeinnes.github.io/2020/07/29/mjolnir.html

Ok, that is first 2 down.

I've looked at the last two yesterday. Let me just do a quick skim. Now that Z told me he wants to start right away, I am feeling pressed for time.

I need to look into the latest Omega, and after that study the coroutine mechanisms.

11:20am. Focus me.

https://github.com/zenna/Omega.jl/tree/lang

Let me clone this again. I need to see how far he got.

Focus me.

11:40am. It seems it has changed a fair bit. The 5 days I spent studying the original will have to be redone. I'll have to spend a few days getting familiar with it, but as far as I can tell the approach itself did not change.

Let me leave that aside. The library itself is not the source of my anxiety. Right now, the CPS transform is the most troublesome. I need to get the benefits of it using coroutines in order to be able to do proper `observe` and `sample` statements like in the `Intro to PPL` book.

Things like propagating likelihoods and CPSing is something I've done for just the poker game already. But Spiral is the only language in the world that can do the later sort of thing efficiently. I know that Julia is bad with both monads and effect handlers.

11:50am. I need to figure out how to do SMC style algorithms in Julia using yieldto. Though I am an expert in high level concurrency patterns thanks to all my work on Spiral, I am not familiar with the low level aspects. Neither am I familiar with coroutines. Julia supposedly has coroutines, but they aren't anything what they seemed to be in Scheme. In Scheme they are like resumable exceptions and can be used to implement effect handlers.

But it is not like I am familiar with effect handlers either, I just know what they are.

Supposedly Turing uses coroutines to implement its functionality. I could use it as a reference if only it weren't so opaque.

https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/parallel/#Scheduling

I wish there were some examples of how this works. Well, I have an idea how to experiment with it.

Let me take a break here."

    <p> Before we start, I would like to greet you a blessed and joyous birthday, my dear friend Mercy. Actually, I don't have anything to say at the moment. Wala akong maisip and my mind is blank. You may think that I was trying my best to make an effort just to please you and you might find it insincere--which is, I find it somewhat true. But one thing is for sure, greeting you is something I want to do. I won't fikter my words and what I'm about to say is my honest feelings. I just find it unfair for you guys to always greet me and I don't even know your birthdays. Just think of it as a compensation for my selfishness and for being self-centered. Sorry kung wala akong regalong maibibigay or hindi ako makakadalo sa handaan--if ever meron. I'm sorry if I can't give you a hug or a kiss on the cheeks--if you don't mind. I'm sorry I can't greet you in person. I'm sorry that all I can give you is this message.

Speaking of sorry, I want to apologize for my behavior in the past. Alam ko na makasarili ako, manggagamit at plastik. I was influenced by the world. Wrong, I let the world influenced me. You see, when I was 10 years old my family broke apart. Nagkawatak watak kami. Nagkahiwawalay ng landas. As a kid, I was unable to grasp the situation. All I know is that we are not happy anymore. As a child who don't understand anything, I started believing things that in my favor. Kinakampihan ko ang isa kong parents dahil their on my side at sinisiraan ang isa. I was a horrible person. Growing up without a proper guidance took a toll on my mental state. Without any parents to guide me I became a rebel. At narealize ko, I don't really want to destroy my life. All I want is my family back. Since nasa side ako ni mama those last 3 years, gusto ko kuhain ang atensiyon niya. Because I need it. Because I was a mess. Naging grade conscious ako. Ginagawa ko lahat para lang makapasok ako sa top. Para mapraise ako ni mama pero in the end, wala rin. Wala siyang paki. You see, even when my family was still whole, before it broke a part, I was a loner in my previous school. Lagi akong mag isa. Walang kaibigan. Kaya okay lang sakin na masira image ko sa iba, kahit ano pang sabihin nila wala akong paki, kaya nabubuhos ko lahat ng oras ko sa pag-aaral. Kaya kaya kong maging masama, kaya kaya ko maging salbahi. Masyado akong focus sa greed ko na hindi ko namamalayan nakakasakit na ako ng tao. I'm not making an excuse, I know that the pain my words has cause will never be erase. And nothing can justify what I did wrong, but I want to say that I am deeply sorry for the bottom of my heart.

Let's move on to the thank you's. Masyado kasing naging seryoso iyong pangalawang paragraph HAHAHA. Sorry na. These thank you's are for the things you did that move my heart. One of them is your humbleness. I adore how your achievements never get to your head. Kahit na successful kana hindi mo nakakalimutan iyong mga bagay or tao na tumulong sayo umangat. To be honest, I envy you. I know to myself I'm not kind. I'm the epitome of evil. I tend forget the things and people that help me. I always focus on relief and not the pain. But you, you endure all the pain and use it to grow. That's why you deserve success. That's why I always envy those kind of people. The other one is your independence. This is one of the things I envy and adore about you. You are so confident standing on your own in front of the fearful crowd. You're the kind of person that no one can be tainted. I am proud of you. Lastly, your kindness. This is the character I envy the most. Sa mga nababasa ko na manga, napapanood na anime or nababasa sa libro, the kind ones are dazzling. Their kindness influence and change others. At ang pinakakinaiinggitan ko ay, maganda ang kapalit sa kabutihan nila. Be good and good things will happened. That is somethin I can never achieve, a character I can never have. That's why, shine brightly. Blind them with your kindness. Continue influencing others and change them for the better. After all, I want you to be happy. Again let me greet you a flashing, blessed nad Joyous happy birthday. Astra per aspera! May the odds will ever be in your favor. Godbless you, Mercy Grace. Thank you for being part of my Journey. Lovelots~❤️. </p>

	"Somewhere", said Father Vittorini, "did Blake not speak of the
Machineries of Joy?  That is, did not God promote environments, then
intimidate these Natures by provoking the existence of flesh, toy men and
women, such as are we all?  And thus happily sent forth, at our best, with
good grace and fine wit, on calm noons, in fair climes, are we not God's

Update 30.09

- night soil and bless of the dead's fortunes now show up few frames after the stage transition
- night soil can now be dropped from bag-o-trash upon breaking it
- reduced the damage bonus for bless of the dead negating the curse
- ordinary life is now a passive tears up item found in a boss pool
- added co-op compatibility to the mod (prototype version, bugs can be found!)
- hope I didn't miss anything, that was a long day of coding

Initial commit of new storage layer

After long consideration, I decided to attempt to port a version of
Couchstore to Rust to replace sled. There are many factors in that
decision, but the primary one is the issue of running the
`list_transactions_test` on Mac OS. Somehow, this test on my Mac uses 48
gigs of RAM, when the total amount of bytes stored should total a couple
of megabytes. Upon investigating, it seems like memory usage is a common
issue with sled.

This commit is the start of a new crate: bonsaidb-roots. I'm attempting
to create an append-only transactional store modeled after Couchstore.
The reason is simple: I'm not an amazing database engineer with years of
experience optimizing these types of loads. What I do know, however, is
that append-only files are much easier to optimize as you can generally
take advantage of multiple concurrent readers that aren't ever blocked
by an active writer.

The crate so far only consists of:

- An `AsyncFile` abstraction that provides me an internal API that works
  with standard `tokio::fs` as well as `tokio_uring`.
- Initial transaction log implementation with support for managing
  exclusive access to trees. More access models will eventually be
  supported within Transactions, this is just a starting position.
- Encryption API surface to allow pluggable encryption mechanisms that
  encrypt/decrypt chunks of data.
- Basic notes on my thoughts on how I'm approaching the btree
  structures.

There's no actual storage of documents, yet.

Fix API methods names: "GET" and "POST" are not correct, "get" and "post" are correct... fucking stupid shit but what can we do?
