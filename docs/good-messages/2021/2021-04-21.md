WIP: Attempt a generic PPP UDP mainloop

We ought to be able to share this between F5 and Fortinet and others.
The connect request is already in ->ppp_dtls_connect_req, and let's
use the protocol's ->udp_catch_probes() method to catch the input.

TODO: Fix up the hacks in the f5_dtls_catch_probes() and see if we
can tie them in to vaguely sane and generic HTTP header parsing.

See if we can recognise that we have a PPP frame and just assume
we dropped the 'OK' response, and go straight to PPP. For Fortinet
that should always be OK, for F5 it works only if don't need the
IPv6 address from the response (which can be either because there's
no IPv6, or because this is a reconnect). For Legacy IP, F5 will
negotiate the address in IPCP anyway. But IPV6CP only doe the
link local address.

I would have liked to do only one actual *receive*, which already
lives in ppp_mainloop(). But the TCP PPP state machine is already
up and running at the time we attempt to establish the DTLS
connection, and it all looks too painful. So I'll settle for
receiving into ->dtls_pkt which means that we can (ab)use the
proto udp_catch_probes() as discussed, but also gives us a way
to inject that packet into the PPP mainloop if it actually turns
out to be PPP.

Most recent code

Still not quite able to figure out why it is predicting the same thing consistently, I am considering abandoning this one and working on some more impactful projects. I've asked several people in the ML space and they don't know either (and thats not even includinng 50ish people on stack overflow). IDK honestly but I have some more important and impactful project ideas on a nice list that I'd rather make, and this project (along with the NNFS book ofc) served its purpose and I understand Neural Nets to some degree of competency where I feel like I could effectivly leverage pytorch or tf and plt to make some important, impactful, and useful things. If I can't figure it out by the end of the month I'm scrapping it. I have a few things I want to try like leaky ReLu or maybe a different hidden layer activation function all together, also maybe trying random data to see if the problem is my neural net or the data (probably not the data tho its MNIST lol), and maybe increasing my floating point presicion b/c I feel like that might be why the argmax of the final softmax calc is mostly the same for one batch. I though dropout would help bc I felt like it was happening becuase of a few neurons doing a bad and occasionally they would be dropped out with dropout, but that wasnt the case. I'm of course new to the field so I imagine my lack of experince is a factor in my inablitiy to solve this one alone, i dont know. I hate to scrap projects but this one is consuming more time than I would have liked. Tl;DR: I might scrap this one. Wow this was wayyyyy longer than I meant it to be but its been a while since I've updated so I thought a longer-form note was in order. Anyway this may be one of the last posts to this project so thanks for checking it out!

Provide portal creds as arguments.

Closes #17 if we are happy with this commit.
I love being able to provide my creds but I broke the option of using
the menu again. Should be fine if this lays the ground work for a GUI
though. If no creds are provided, we still prompt for them.
New usage is simply `python ctools.py <task>` or you can do
`python ctools.py -a my.portal.com -u admin -p p@ssw0rd get_status`

Why is it that motivation only exists at ridiculous hours? My mind feels cleared now after ~18 hours of conciousness than even after a good night's sleep. Tonight or perhaps this morning this project will be recompleted.

Finding more info on Shaders (resources)

GLSL has many built-in classic functions such as sin, cos, max, min, pow, exp, mod, clamp, but also very practical functions like cross, dot, mix, step, smoothstep, length, distance, reflect, refract, normalize.

Unluckily, there is no beginner-friendly documentation and, most of the time, we do naive searches on the web and usually end up on these three websites:

Shaderific documentation
https://www.shaderific.com/glsl-functions

Shaderific is an iOS application that lets you play with GLSL. The application is not something to care about, but the documentation isn't too bad.

Kronos Group OpenGL reference pages
https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/indexflat.php

This documentation deals with OpenGL, but most of the standard functions you'll see will be compatible with WebGL. Let's not forget that WebGL is just a JavaScript API to access OpenGL.

Book of shaders documentation
https://thebookofshaders.com/

The book of shaders mainly focus on fragment shaders and has nothing to do with Three.js but it is a great resource to learn and it has its own glossary.

Understanding the vertex shader
Now that we know the GLSL syntax, let's try to understand what's in our shaders.

Keep in mind that the vertex shader purpose is to position each vertex of the geometry on the render 2D space. In other words, the vertex shader will convert the 3D vertices coordinates to our 2D canvas coordinates.

Alternate ending to the Ice Queen branch if the player is an Infidel.

Kathryn the Enchantress was placed under her curse by a powerful, evil
witch in the service of Moloch. So it stands to reason that she should
not be happy about having an Infidel free her from that curse. So here's
what happens at the end of the ice queen branch if the player is an
Infidel - Kathryn stays hostile, and the message she gives to the player
after being freed has changed. The player then has 75 turns to get the
hell out of Dodge before the Enchantress ends her grace period and
starts to attack. 75 turns is ample time to free the captive pegasus and
loot enough of the chests to get all the high-end gear, and still make
it out in time.
