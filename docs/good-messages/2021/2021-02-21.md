Over the past 14 days I did a lot of stupid shit in this

Can't remember what exactly though...
Mostly bugfixing and probably some abstraction
Planning to do some vim registers-level bullshit and also a lexer

New data: 2021-02-20: See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (AB, MB, ON, QC, SK).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “14 new deaths, for a total of deaths of 10,292: 4 death in the last 24 hours, 10 deaths between February 13 and February 18.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

Update domain name

Blend-Exchange is moving to its own domain name! For all its life, it
has been on a subdomain of my Stack Exchange username's domain,
"giantcowfilms.com". This made for an unwieldy and long URLs, and
honestly looked a bit ridiculous.

nixos/console: fix console setting reloading

It's a dull and boring day, it's cold outside and I'm stuck at home: let
me tell you the story of systemd-vconsole-setup.

In the beginnings of NixOS[1], systemd-vconsole-setup was a powerful
sysinit.target unit, installed and running at boot to set up fonts
keyboard layouts and even colors of the virtual consoles. If needed, the
service would also be restarted after a configuration change, consoles
were happy and everything was good, well, almost.

Since the service had no way to specify the dependency "ttys are ready",
modesetting could sometimes happen *after* systemd-vconsole-setup had
started, leaving the console in a broken state. So abbradar worked
around that by putting a systemd-udev-settle `After=`.

In the meanwhile, probably realizing their mistake, systemd added a
shiny udev rule to start the systemd-udev-settle at the right time[2].
However, the rule bypassed systemd by directly running the binary
`systemd-udev-settle`, and the service - though still installed - fell
into disuse.

Two years would pass before a good samaritan, seeing the poor jobless
systemd-udev-settle service, decided to give it the coup de grâs[3] by
unlisting it from the installed units.
This, combined with another bug, caused quite a commotion[4] in NixOS;
to see why remember the fact that `WantedBy=` in upstream units doesn't
work[5], so it had to be added manually in cc542110, but while systemd
removed it, the NixOS unit continued to install and restart the service,
making a lot of fuss when switching configuration.

After at least thee different tentative fixes, deedrah realised[6] what
the root cause was and fpletz put the final nail[7] in the coffin of
systemd-udev-settle. The service would never see the light of a boot
again, NixOS would not restart it all the time but thanks to udev
consoles would still get their pretty fonts and playful colors.

The En..

..no, wait! You should ask what came of systemd-udev-settle, first.
And why is the service even around if udev is doing all the work?

Udev-settle, like the deceitful snake that he is, laid hidden for years.
He looks innocuous doesn't it? A little hack. Only until it leaves his
den and a poor user[8] drops dead. Obviously, it serves no purpose, as
the service is not part of the boot process anymore, so let's remove it
for good!

About the service, it may not be useful at boot, but it can be started
to pick up changes in vconsole.conf and set the consoles accordingly.
But wait, this doesn't work anymore: the service is never started at
boot (remember f76d2aa6), so switch-to-configuration.pl will not restart
it. Fortunately it can be repaired: here I install a new unit which
does *nothing* on start, but restarts the real service when reloaded.
This perfectly reproduces the original behavior, hopefully without the
original bugs too.

The End?

wip(kiss): introduce abstract schema ((1593))

Discussion: it’s perhaps amusing we want sqlite3 so badly for our
statistics pass on generating document history; when we don’t yet know
what our data model or algorithm for it is yet, exactly.

(We’ve had it in our heads pretty clearly at various points when on our
run, but those fever-dreams often evaporate where they are made. Also,
planning can only go so far without prototyping accompanying it.)

But nonetheless, we looked back over our “.stack” and saw something
absolutely insane that we had forgotten all about writing a few days
prior:

> insanely what if you store the data model *in* the dot file

Indeed, what if…

The question is not whether this is a good idea; it probably isn’t.
The justification for it is in the following sections (yes this should
be in a document):

Statement of the problem(s):

- The moment we start to touch relational databases (sqlite), we need
  some on-disk, in-version-control, not-in-the-database representation
  of our data model (“schema”) (as it changes over time); quite
  like the (rails) ActiveRecord concept of migrations (and whatever
  other means they use to represent schema).
- Keeping files of SQL with ‘CREATE TABLE’ is of limited use
  (not migration friendly, not visually friendly)
- Modeling the data model without some visual representation of it
  is painful (to us)
- Historically, we’ve used tools like OmniGraffle to model schema,
  but the problem is these get out of sync with what the “real”
  data-model is, and there’s no “poka yoke” self-perpetuating
  tendency to keep such files current. (Keeping redundant documentation
  up-to-date is not strongly self-incentivized. If the only reason to
  do it is because “you should”, it’s a vector waiting to be overlooked,
  so an ineffective safeguard)
- Such proprietary vendor files would look awful in version control,
  probably.

Quick mental survey of existing solutions:

- Data-modeling for RDBMS’s is well-trodden ground with decades of
  modeling tools and other technologies like UML (probably), BUT
- None of these tools come to mind as a good solution here. (We
  offer it as a tautological justification that there aren’t any
  good tools for this because we haven’t heard of any yet.)
- Their file formats probably won’t be pretty. We have gotten this
  far without committing much XML…
- Our requirements are thin and we want to keep them that way (KISS):
  basically all we need is two or three datatypes, primary keys,
  foreign keys.

Our experimental, hypothetical solution (for our problems):

- GraphViz is not some proprietary or specialty data modeling tool.
  Rather, it’s a widely available, open source, stable & reliable
- GraphViz is already well understood by us
- The visualization that GraphViz produces look attractive and
  meet our requirements
- The GraphViz file format is minimal, mostly readable after
  a very short learning curve, and is lenient in the sense that
  it allows the user freeform use of whitespace and comments
- The minimality and ease-of-machine-readability and
  well-documented-ness of the GraphViz (dot file) file format
  lends itself well to being consumed by a variety of clients
  beyond just GraphViz itself (compare to, say, OmniGraffle)
- having GraphViz be machine readable by use (over in the python
  hemisphere) in some more formal way will be useful to us anyway

(times)

  02-20 00:24  skimming sqlite3 docs
        02:39  OK let's sketch a really rough sqlite read-only adapter
        04:58  good progress, reading and writing tables by hand. but zz
        09:11  OK let's begin on schema.dot
        10:34  begin hand parsing graph viz yet again (did ~9 years ago)
        16:21  finished getting sexp from whole dot file.
               now clean it up to get deep values
        16:39  ok finished cleaning it up, now do something with it.
               great progress but take a break to go see john
        18:05  resume
        19:06  valid sqlite SQL with foreign key constraints is set up
               in a test, now beginning to test drive the parsing of it
        20:56  finished tokenizing the two CREATE TABLE statements
  02-21 01:26  passing test where abstract schema via sql seems ok
        01:27  j/k that was one table. 25 min later zz
        07:30  resume
        11:14  ball of code too big. make intermediate commit
        12:04  wrote this commit comment lol
