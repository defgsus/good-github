remove some paragraphs that I think may contribute to PL tribalism

Over the past several months, I've felt like PL tribalism has in some instances
gotten worse. I've felt like writing about this and the ongoing "language wars" (not
just between Rust and Zig, but also Go, C/C++, Java, Dart, and more.) but I think that
may well just stoke the fire.

I'm afraid I've already in some instances contributed to this between the Zig
and Rust communities:

* Through some statements in my articles, which I've removed here, often meant as more
  poking-fun-at type statements based on ways I've seen myself and close friends struggle
  with using Rust.
* By using titles that focus on Zig as a language, instead of the actual content I am
  writing about:
  * "Zig, parser combinators, and why they're awesome"
  * "Increasing my contribution to Zig to $200 a month" (which I later renamed to "My game development journey & why I'm increasing my contribution to Zig to $200/mo")

I've thought a lot about this and I'd rather have people find my work interesting and
find Zig as a footnote, than find my work interesting on grounds of contributing to the
ever-going "Rust vs. [Go,Zig,etc]" debate that pervades /r/programming and Hacker News.

It's cool software and users that matter, choice of technology is just an implementation
detail and always has been.

I will also be adjusting my personal verbage used elsewhere (on Twitter, in comments, etc.)
to be less anti-Rust: I don't think that helps any developers in the real world make actual
decisions about which languages to use, and just contributes to more flameware-esque
threads.

On multiple occassions in the past, I have withheld more ranting thoughts about my experience
using Rust which I believe highlight real issues in the community (namely around package
management and ecosystem development), for exactly the same reason: even if the article is
reasonably constructive and conveyed as a personal experience, the situation as a whole is not
and it only feeds tribalism. This commitment is me trying to double down on this, push myself
further away from PL tribalism, and hopefully further myself as a technical writer.

"10:10am. I finished Doom Eternal again, but it was not satisfying even if it was fun. Compared to the way the DraQu and Zero Master play my own is just so clumsy. I can't immitate them. Their accuracy and awareness is on a higher level than mine, and their control is better. I think the later is because they are not using the two button mouse with a wheel like I am, but have something better. If I had something that allow me to use my right hand better, I could increase my efficiency. For example, being able to use the right thumb to change weapons would mean I do not have to take my left hand off the movement keys to do so. They way they swap between sniper and the balista indicates that they are doing something different from me.

10:15am. At any rate I am done with Doom again. Let me chill a bit and then I will start.

10:55am. Done with the break. Let me do some programming.

```
a = torch.rand(4,5)
ix = torch.tensor([0]).unsqueeze(-1)
print(a,torch.gather(a,1,ix))
print(ix.squeeze(-1).shape)
```

The way I was using squeeze without the dimension being given is wrong. 0 dimensional tensors are a thing and I do not want to get them by accident.

```
inl policy : a u64 f32 = $"torch.gather(!policy_probs_detached,1,!sample_indices.unsqueeze(-1)).squeeze(-1).numpy()"
```

This should do it.

```
    inl policy_raw_values' : obj = $"!policy.forward(!data_value[:,!policy_size])"
    inl policy_raw_values : obj = $"torch.full_like(!policy_raw_values',float('-inf'))"
    $"!policy_raw_values.flatten()[!action_indices] = !policy_raw_values'.flatten()[!action_indices]"
```

Oh, this is not good. Usually flatten will return a view, but since I am flattening a view, there is a high chance this will result in a copy.

Instead of setting it like this, I need to use a scatter.

https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.scatter_

```py
a = torch.zeros(4,5)
b = torch.ones(4,5)
ix = torch.tensor([[1,2],[2,3]])
a.scatter_(1,ix,b)
print(a)
```

This works great. This will make things a lot more efficient.

```
rm.add action_indices (am.map schema.actions.pickle actions)
```

Why is there a type error here?

```
    inl action_indices : ra u64 (a _ _) = am.empty
    l |> am.iteri fun b (player_state, (leduc_state (p1,p2,community_card)), pid, actions) =>
        inl seq = pl2_observations player_state pid |> obs_to_array
        inl pot = if pid = p1.id then p1.pot else p2.pot
        schema.value.pickle (leduc_policy_input {pid= $"!pid"; pot= $"!pot"; seq},if pid = p1.id then p2.card else p1.card) (0, $"!data_value[!b,:]")
        rm.add action_indices (am.map schema.actions.pickle actions)
```

Because of that type annotation. This passes, but it is not right. In order to convert these lists into a tensor the dimensions have to be matching.

What a bother. If I wanted to fix this, I would not even need the scatter I could just do a mask.

11:20am. I am going to need to do the same thing for the reward on the backward pass. Then it is settled, let me do a mask.

```
    inl data_value : obj = $"torch.zeros(!len,!value_size)"
    l |> am.iteri fun b (player_state, (leduc_state (p1,p2,community_card)), pid, actions) =>
        inl seq = pl2_observations player_state pid |> obs_to_array
        inl pot = if pid = p1.id then p1.pot else p2.pot
        schema.value.pickle (leduc_policy_input {pid= $"!pid"; pot= $"!pot"; seq},if pid = p1.id then p2.card else p1.card) (0, $"!data_value[!b,:]")
    inl action_indices : a u64 (a u64 _) = l |> am.generic.map fun (_,_,_,actions) => am.map schema.actions.pickle actions
    inl policy_mask : obj = $"torch.full((!len,!actions_size),float('-inf'))"
    am.iteri (fun b => am.iter (fun a => $"!policy_mask[!b,!a] = 0")) action_indices
    inl policy_raw_values : obj = $"!policy_mask + !policy.forward(!data_value[:,!policy_size])"
    inl policy_probs : obj = $"torch.softmax(!policy_raw_values,dim=-1)"
```

Yeah, this is good.

https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.cpu

It does not do a copy if the tensor is already on the cpu. Ok.

12:30pm. Let me stop here since I've already started lurking the isekai thread on the side.

```
    inl sample_indices : a u64 _ = $"torch.distributions.Categorical(!e + (1.0 - !epsilon) * !policy_probs_detached).sample().numpy()"
    inl policy : a u64 f32 = $"torch.gather(!policy_probs_detached,1,!sample_indices.unsqueeze(-1)).squeeze(-1).numpy()"
    inl l : a _ _ =
        am.map2 (fun policy a =>
            inl policy = f64 policy
            inl sample : f64 = e + (1.0 - epsilon) * policy
            log_prob_from {policy sample}, schema.actions.unpickle a
            ) policy sample_indices
    l, fun (r : a u64 r2) =>
        inl value_raw : obj = $"!value.forward(!data_value)"
        // inl value : a u64 f32 =
        r
```

It is a huge pain in the ass for me to decide how I want to do the CFR update here.

Gather and scatter have reduce operations. But to make use of that, can I do something like zipping a tensor to be operated upon first?

I need to combine those `r`s with the policy probability.

How annoying. Let me stop here. I'll figure this out eventually."

Another GF Home theater progress

alright, I think we almost done it. right? idk. but we've went on!

also we have reserved the GF home theater in the coding yay!. we've tested the dance left right, thunder fear, trains, and uh... what else I forgot, basically it. also we've added the GF home theater ready for tutorial stage. that xml is not complete yet though.

fixed trains not coming at all in philly. hmmm, looks like the coding mistakenly thought that the train passes sound is also on week 3 special folder, nope! it's on the default folder. yeah, there should've been a fallback. since the sound fail to load, the train pass function hangs and softlocks, but not the entire game. just switch state to terminate train pass. but okay! I copied those sounds to the week3/sounds folder so now you have that too.

installed GF-ht on Week strong songs (Windfall, Rule the worls, We'll meet again) yay! now we're getting close. left the masker for boyfriend!

now the numbers of miss note can be set in assets/data/numbersOfMissSfx.txt . just add missNoteNUM.ogg into it, rename according to number like missNote4, 5 6, etc. to assets/sounds then simply edit that text file, change number to how many you have now. for source code version it's assets/shared/sounds.

proposed sTILE json file. the Music Cardtridge metadata for Hexagon Engine. now we have added special dictionary called "funkin" for all information for FNF in one go. still in development along with original sTILE json file specification in Hexagon Engine.

whoops forgot gfVersion in empty template chart! there you go.

made clarification that gameBanana is vague regarding of some common withhold reason. likely some more feature would be exclusive to Odysee permanently for safety reason. that's all your fault game managers there! no no! jk! I mean, we gotta discuss about this. I think you should expand your thinking to cover more use case scenarios like I have here.

add full screen toggle on the option menu too as well! also on the press F on TItle screen to toggle full screen will change save data variable fullscreen mode too! and not to forget the initialization when the game start which is change full screen mode wow!

sleep now we must sleep pls dont overnight idk man

Damn almost took me 3 hours 

I'm not that kind of person who stars their own repo so, yeah... give a fucking star.
