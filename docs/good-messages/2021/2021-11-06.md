Develop alpha - first working version

This version has hacks, bugs and workarounds. Besides it's ugly as hell.
But it seems like... it works.

##A Tribute To Paul Trouble Anderson##
This is a project for a pre course challenge set and supported by School of Code. 
The challenge was to host a web page tribute to anybody of our choosing.
I chose the DJ Paul Trouble Anderson as he was a big inspiration to me as a DJ and is often, in my opinion, undervalued for his contribution to dance music.

This was the first time I have used any of the tools *VS Code, Git/Git Hub* or any coding languages at all. 
I enjoyed the challenge but feel slightly overwhelmed at this stage with all the new knowledge I am having to make sense of. 
Hoping that with some hard work and dedication, it will all fall into place soon!

"11:45am. I am going to put in some overtime today given how late I woke up. I went to bed at 2am, but at least I am rested now. Though, instead of starting now, I might as well have breakfast and do the chores.

12:45pm. https://youtu.be/NMELt0J2Cno?list=PLMXbAPr21di-Ox-dmDwL2riWedei1dn9S&t=1439

Done with breakfast. I did some watching of this while eating. Let me pause so I can do the chores.

1:10pm. It is time to resume. I've been thinking and for all I know, I might end up being stuck at the drawing stage for the next few years. But if so that is fine.

I mean, what am I going to do with programming? Just get a job? There is no point in making money at random. What would have been meaningful is to train RL agents to make money for me. That would have been deeply satisfying, but there is no point in trying to ride the deep learning dog. I need something greater, something how biology does it. I need to draw out those principles, and for that I really need a hint of how things work. Let them make the tech and I will take advantage of it.

I need algorithms that actually learn rather than just move points around semi-randomly until things fit into place.

Sigh, this is exactly the thing that beat me in high school. No matter how good one is, there will be always things beyond one's grasp.

All I want is to enter the self improvement loop, but this world is doggedly denying me it.

If only I had some good idea of how to develop the intelligence algorithm. But no matter what I can think of, I have zero basis for reasoning out anything. The brain could do this or that, but at my level I can't do any better than try to immitate the form. This is a stark contrast to regular programming where I am able to reason out the plumbing of the system.

1:25pm. I am just wasting time thinking about this. If I have to practice drawing for the next few years so be it. Simulacrum can wait until I have my power. If it takes me a few years, I can only curse my own lack of talent for not being able to do it sooner.

If I am fated to lose, I have a choice to welcome it as a weakling or face it head on with a strong will. And I will choose the later.

1:30pm. https://youtu.be/NMELt0J2Cno?list=PLMXbAPr21di-Ox-dmDwL2riWedei1dn9S&t=1781

You know what, let me skip this stuff. He is just talking about really obvious stuff, while my own problem is that I can't draw properly. I do not need him to explain perspective. Playing around in Blender is enough to allow me to understand this. Let me go through the other series instead of wasting time with this.

I need a starter project, the hand is pretty hard.

https://youtu.be/OezMavBqWXc?list=PLDcVY7tIUDzsNR5AjIzqyiN2P85TKAWvb&t=26

Here he talking about holding the pencil. Yeah, that is where I need to start.

Actually, even before I go through this, since he is drawing on paper, I really should get familiar with digital art first. Illustrator I've studied, but what about CSP?

https://youtu.be/_3IwMDAxPP4?t=696
Clip Studio Paint for beginners | Clip Studio Paint Pro Tutorial (2021)

I went through this before, but it was not very interesting since I did not have a tablet. Let me go through it now.

https://youtu.be/iLIjD-5AgWU?t=189
Draw Gesture with O̲N̲E̲ shape: NEVER draw ArMs or LeGs- EVAR! [also never ever use bean shape]

Er, let me watch this first.

https://youtu.be/iLIjD-5AgWU?t=465

This particular bit of advice is pretty interesting. I have considered what I could do with people with heavy clothing and haven't figure out anything.

2pm. Er, before I do anything, just what kind of pencil so I be using. I am actually confused about this.

Hmmm, I have no idea. Let me just go with a G-pen.

2:25pm. Found the elipse tool. It is no trouble at all. But how would it be possible to do something like shading? Slight lines?

Honestly, once they are scaled I can barely see the difference between different pens and pencils.

2:50pm. Ok, that basic tutorial is good enough. And I know how to do figures like elipses and straight lines. The curve tool is amazing to use with a pen. This is not something I would be able to do with a pen. Using a traditional style when you have technology is such a shame.

I think that 2d art should really be done using vector programs rather than raster, but right now that does not matter. I'll grasp my own style eventually. Right now I'll just focus on drawing.

Start Drawing: PART 1 - Outlines, Edges, Shading

Let me start with this.

...No actually...

https://youtu.be/HNaKamtSlB0
Clip Studio Paint Tutorial: The Basics for Beginners

This caught my attention...

2:55pm. No forget that. I want to get to drawing. Forget these program tutorials.

3:10pm. Just now I drew a pretty good circle by drib and drabbing.

3:40pm. Sigh, I've just been drawing random strokes instead of watching the lecture. One thing I am realizing is that the hand is so rigid. Even if it is something like signing my own name, there is so much variation in the curves

4pm. I need to learn to work within the limitations of my body. Drawing a straight line has a large amount of variation between them, and it varies a lot based on position, length and angle.

Drawing horizontal lines near the top of the tablet for example is a lot more difficult than near the bottom.

4:50pm. It is doeable by pulling though.

Let me take a break here.

I've been supposed to be watching the lecture, but instead I've found myself drawing lines, boxes and circles all this time. I think I've mastered the trick to doing it.

I understand now the technoque the arists use drawing many thin lines to make a straight one. The same goes for circles. I just can't get it right directly, but I can subdivide it and do it out many small lines.

5:25pm. Had to leave for lunch. Let me resume. I was quite into drawing this, though I am not sure that I see the point of drawing lines and curves by myself when tools for that exist.

Let me resume the lecture.

https://youtu.be/OezMavBqWXc?list=PLDcVY7tIUDzsNR5AjIzqyiN2P85TKAWvb&t=201

I am not really sure how to make this work with a tablet pen.

5:45pm. I am actually quite impressed with myself just now. I can draw circles just fine it seems by placing down many lines. I've seen people sketch out a circle by lightly dragging many lines around and then boldening it up once the sketch is done. And now that I am actually practicing that, I see that I can immitate it perfectly. Not what I expected given how hard it is to get a single straight line down for me.

But yeah, getting the curves and the lines right is not a trivial thing given the construction of the human hand. Joints rotate which makes straight lines hard. And doing exact curves is hard for the same reason. But it is possible to essentially sample the lines and adjust them on the fly.

That way smoothes out the imprecision of any particular line.

5:50pm. This is not something I could do with a mouse, I really needed the pen tablet to learn it.

Little things like these give me hope. Maybe I can get good at this.

Now let me watch the lecture. Though I should look up shading with a pen tablet as what he is teaching me here is not directly applicable and there is bound to be an alternative I could use.

https://youtu.be/OezMavBqWXc?list=PLDcVY7tIUDzsNR5AjIzqyiN2P85TKAWvb&t=232

Ok, I'll admit, drawing a circle with long smooth curves is still beyond me. I can't do this. I am not sure I should hold out hope for getting much precision as I get practice. I mean, my hand writing plateud at some point and I never got any more precise despite years and years of practice.

But I should get better than I am now. Still, I should not rely on this. If I really need a circle or a ellipse I should just use the tool to put it down.

The same goes for curves. Putting many lines like I am doing it now is bound to mess up my hand long term.

But putting down vector lines precisely is likely to work better.

Start Drawing: PART 2 - Draw a Watering Can using Shape

Let me pause this one here. I want to look up some vids on how to use the pen tablet properly. Right now I have no idea how I would shade the way as demonstrated in the previous video.

How to Draw on a Tablet - Ultimate Drawing Tablet Tutorial

Here is a vid by Aaron Rutten.

https://youtu.be/83BRMfjJXIk?t=10

Damn he is good.

6:15pm. https://youtu.be/83BRMfjJXIk?t=556

I find it interesting to watch his draw. He is holding his hand up and not really resting it on anything in order to stabilize it.

https://youtu.be/83BRMfjJXIk?t=661

Huh, not how he lays it on the side and then it starts shading.

6:25pm. No I can't figure out that sideways trick.

6:30pm. https://youtu.be/RKRMv81VsIs
How to Hold a Drawing Tablet Pen

Let me watch this.

https://youtu.be/RKRMv81VsIs?t=80

This is how I hold it. When I tried holding it in the middle like Priestley recommended it did not feel right for me.

https://youtu.be/RKRMv81VsIs?t=226

This technique is really interesting, but one thing that occurs to me is that my tablet is pretty small. Maybe that is why I am having  trouble immitating Pristley's smooth motions.

His tablet here for exaple is twice as bit in both dimensions compared to mine. For example, just my hand take up almost half the tablet space alone while he has room to spare. Yeah, the same thing applies for Priestley.

https://youtu.be/RKRMv81VsIs?t=337

He set one of his buttons to resize his brush.

...That is actually a pretty good idea. I am not really a fan of using the middle button to navigate.

How do I do tilt shading?

https://vimeo.com/372249319

Does my own tablet not support this? Had I known this I would have gotten the Pro version.

7pm. I think I'll just ask about this on /ic/.

7:15pm. Hmm, I think my tablet is supposed to be tilt sensitive. What the heck?

https://essentialpicks.com/xp-pen-deco-01-review/

Yeah, it is supposed to be tilt sensitive. So how does that work?

https://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/pen-tracker/

Ok, I've confirmed it. My tablet does have tilt sensitivity. So the problem is in Clip Studio.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ClipStudio/comments/6eq89i/tilt_not_working_with_wacom_tablet/
> When you select the pencil go to [Tool Property] next to Brush Density there is a square button with an arrow pointing down. Click that and a wind will pop up with an opinion for tilt. See if that helps.

Let me try this.

7:30pm. Ok, I can find these settings, but they don't seem to be doing anything. I can't tell any difference at all with them turn on and off.

7:40pm. I figured it out. With the real pencil tool the differences are just so slight that I barely noticed any difference with and without tilt..

Also the way I am holding the pen usually is on a tilt anyway. I am going to have to rethink this. I'll look up some tutorials on shading in CSP specifically.

https://youtu.be/tCTm2J4lo1M?t=403

Let me watch this, I want to figure out where the extra nibs are.

https://youtu.be/tCTm2J4lo1M?t=149

Huh there was a bag like that. I did not notice it?

...Yeah, I found it. I completely missed it during the unboxing. I thought the extra nibs might be in the pen holder. Good thing I did not throw away the boxes otherwise the nibs would have gone into the trash with them.

https://youtu.be/RKRMv81VsIs?t=459
How to Hold a Drawing Tablet Pen

Let me finally finish this thing and I will call it a day. I had enough of drawing today.

https://youtu.be/iI6X41Jhm9g
When to Change Nibs - Drawing Tablet Tips

Ehh, let me also watch this.

8:20pm. Let me close here. Tomorrow, I'll look up how to shade in CSP. I've realized something while doing those boxes. If I press shift, it will connect the points using straight lines. I've played around with this and boxes that are completely straight look worse to me than my less accurate hand drawn one for some reason.

I think I am starting to see a picture here. It might not be that I am specifically bad at drawing, but that my subjective perception of my own art is playing tricks on me.

For example, that hand I worked in Blender. The first instance of it was not good at by any objective measure, but the bit of organic made it feel good to me. Hand drawn figures has some sort of charm that I am yet to understand properly.

Things like perfect lines and curves feel unnatural.

...Hmmm, though there should be a way to make Bezier curves work though. I am going to have to find it.

8:30pm. Let me close here, right now I am listening to Lobotomy Corporation OST when I should be playing Ruina."
