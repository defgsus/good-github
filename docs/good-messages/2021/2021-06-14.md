x11/plasma5-plasma: Update KDE Plasma Desktop to 5.22

Plasma 5.22 is here, and it is more reliable and stable than ever. By
cleaning up and refactoring code in the background, the Plasma desktop
gives you greater responsiveness and performance, helping you become
even more productive without hiccups or surprises. Enjoy a smoother
experience with KDE’s Plasma 5.22 desktop.

Plasma 5.22 has become more pleasurable to use through improvements to
the design and greater smoothness and consistency in transparencies,
blurs, icons, and animations. Moving things to accessible locations,
offering hints and visual cues, and creating new settings allows you to
customize your work environment to make it fit perfectly to your needs.
Following the true KDE spirit, the push for a more stable and attractive
desktop does not mean you have to renounce control over how you want it
to look or behave. Plasma 5.22, as always, packs all the flexibility and
tools for customization you have come to expect and love, and some more
to boot.

Meanwhile, the push to move Plasma in its entirety to Wayland (the
display protocol of the future) continues in full swing. So much so that
popular distros are starting to ship Plasma with Wayland by default. By
using Wayland behind the scenes, Plasma is able to include features and
bug fixes not possible to implement on X11, offering you a better
experience and more stability.

##### 2021-06-14 10:40:16 by Marko Grdinić

"9:50am. Got up late today, but I slept quite deeply even if the dreams were vivid. Let me read a bit and then I will start programming for the day. What I want to do is implement the helpers. They will be quite similar to before, but with some differences. That should free up my mind to finally deal with the Holdem game. The training itself won't be difficult, but I'll want to start work on the UI after that. After all, I won't know whether the game works until I try it out.

After I deal with that, it will just be a matter of iteratively training the agents until I have something good.

10:30am. Had early breakfast today. Let me go for another chapter or two and then I will start work on the helpers.

10:45am. Let me do something useful for the day. It is time to start.

10:50am. Let me get rid of the serialization test. After that I'll bring the rest of the files.

10:55am. Focus me. Leave entertainment for later.

```
union observation o a = Observation: o | Action: a
nominal player o a = { prob : log_prob; observations : list (observation o a) }
```

First let me start by changing this. I'll go to a single node solution.

11:05am.

```
inl sample_players_update pid (prob,x) (pl2 (chance_prob,p1,p2)) =
    pl2 (
        prob +@ chance_prob,
        match pid with
        | Some: pid =>
            inl update pid' p = if pid = pid' then apply_observation p x else p
            update 0 p1, update 1 p2
        | None =>
            inl update p = apply_observation p x
            update p1, update p2
        )

inl sample pid dist f p =
    inl i = sampling.randomInLength dist
    inl x = index dist i
    inl p = sample_players_update pid (log_prob_from_sample (1 / f32 (length dist)),x) p
    f x p

inl draw pid dist f p =
    inl i = sampling.randomInLength dist
    inl x = index dist i
    inl ar = am.removeAtIndex i dist
    inl p = sample_players_update pid (log_prob_from_sample (1 / f32 (length dist)),x) p
    f (x,ar) p

union rec node state obs act =
    | Terminal: pl2 obs act * state * r2
    | Action: pl2 obs act * state * u8 * a u64 act * (log_prob * act -> node state obs act)

inl action forall game_state obs act. (state : game_state) pid (dist : a u64 act) (f : act -> pl2 obs act -> node game_state obs act) (pl2 (chance_prob,p1,p2) as p) =
    Action: p, state, pid, dist, fun (_,a as cs) =>
        let f (b : pl2 obs act) : node game_state obs act = real real_core.unbox a (fun _ => f a b)
        if pid = 0 then f (pl2 (chance_prob,apply_changes p1 cs,apply_action p2 a))
        else f (pl2 (chance_prob,apply_action p1 a,apply_changes p2 cs))
inl terminal state r p = Terminal: p, state, r
```

This is my first challenge. It was great when I did this the first time, but now I wonder what I will do with it.

```
nominal player trace = { prob : log_prob; observations : list trace }
inl player_init forall trace. : player trace = player {prob=Log_prob_one; observations=Nil} |> dyn
nominal pl2 trace = log_prob * player trace * player trace
inl pl2_init forall trace. : pl2 trace = pl2 (Log_prob_one, player_init, player_init)
inl pl2_observations (pl2 (_,a,b)) pid = if pid = 0 then a.observations else b.observations
inl pl2_prob (pl2 (_,a,b)) pid = if pid = 0 then a.prob else b.prob
inl pl2_chance_prob (pl2 (x,_,_)) = x
inl pl2_probs (pl2 (chance,self,op)) pid =
    inl self, op = self.prob, op.prob
    inl self, op = if pid = 0 then self, op else op, self
    {chance self op}

inl prob (player {prob}) = prob
inl observations (player {observations}) = observations
inl apply_trace (player x) a = player {x with observations#=(::) a}
inl apply_changes (player x) (prob,a) = player {x with observations#=(::) a; prob#=(+@) prob}
```

I got rid of the observation/action in favor of a unified trace, but now I am losing track of how things should fit.

11:15am. No, this does not inspire me. I think I'll stick to the system I had before. I'll just do a map before serializing it to make sure everything is in the right form.

```
inl sample pid dist f p =
    inl i = sampling.randomInLength dist
    inl x = index dist i
    inl p = sample_players_update pid (log_prob_from_sample (1 / f32 (length dist)),x) p
    f x p

inl draw pid dist f p =
    inl i = sampling.randomInLength dist
    inl x = index dist i
    inl ar = am.removeAtIndex i dist
    inl p = sample_players_update pid (log_prob_from_sample (1 / f32 (length dist)),x) p
    f (x,ar) p
```

Let me just adjust this one then.

```
inl sample pid dist f p =
    inl x = index dist 0
    inl p = sample_players_update pid (log_prob_from_sample (1 / f32 (length dist)),x) p
    f x p

inl draw forall (ar : * -> * -> *) {index; length} dim {number} el. pid (dist : ar dim el) f p =
    inl x = index dist 0
    inl p = sample_players_update pid (log_prob_from_sample (1 / f32 (length dist)),x) p
    f (x, $"!dist[1:]" : el * ar dim el) p
```

Yes, now these two just take the first element. The reason why I am using that macro is because it will return a view. This would be a lot more efficient than copying the array.

12:20pm. What a stupid thing is giving me trouble.

I can do so many things more difficult than it, but for some reason I cannot decide on the way to represent betting round transitions.

12:35pm. Let me take a break here. I feel like taking a rest for a while. I already had breakfast, so let me just do the chores. Today at 5pm I have to step out of the house for a haircut.

I think I've decided upon a way to do the state transitions. It will be in the simplest way possbile."

Create Ishaan Loves Chocolates.cpp

As we know, Ishaan has a love for chocolates. He has bought a huge chocolate bar that contains N chocolate squares. Each of the squares has a tastiness level which is denoted by an array A[].
Ishaan can eat the first or the last square of the chocolate at once. Ishaan has a sister who loves chocolates too and she demands the last chocolate square. Now, Ishaan being greedy eats the more tasty square first. 
Determine the tastiness level of the square which his sister gets.

Example 1:

â€‹Input : arr[ ] = {5, 3, 1, 6, 9}
Output : 1
Explanation:
Initially: 5 3 1 6 9
In first step: 5 3 1 6
In Second step: 5 3 1
In Third step: 3 1
â€‹In Fourth step: 1
â€‹â€‹Return 1


â€‹Example 2:

Input : arr[ ] = {5, 9, 2, 6} 
Output :  2

Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function chocolates() that takes an array (arr), sizeOfArray (n) and return the tastiness level of the square which his sister gets. The driver code takes care of the printing.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

 

Constraints : 
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 109
Output Status:
Correct Answer.Correct Answer
Execution Time:0.36

Update base for Update on "add a boxed CPU fallback kernel"

This PR replaces the existing code-generated CPU fallback kernels that XLA uses with a single boxed CPU fallback.

Current state: there are a couple different design ideas that I want to point out, but the logic for the actually kernel is mostly done and passing tests.

### Design

To preface, I'm not 100% tied to the current design and I'm putting the PR up now for opinions and totally open to alternatives, some of which I listed below. Actually after writing this description, I'm leaning toward the following changes:
* Confirm whether or not we can remove all C++ logging info directly in the yaml.


**Current Design**

All of the CPU fallback codegen is deleted. In its place, XLA (and other external backends, later) can choose to opt into a CPU fallback by adding the following code in a C++ file. I have an corresponding [xla-side PR with the xla changes](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/pull/2945/files#diff-1a005c10039f0cb11130a3b740f5de716d2f10acaea121017016025861886798R1).

There's no actual requirement to split up the code into a .h and .cpp file, but that's necessary in the XLA case because they sometimes need to call the fallback directly from their handcrafted kernels.

```
// xla_cpu_fallback.h
#include <ATen/native/CPUFallback.h>
...
void xla_cpu_fallback(const c10::OperatorHandle& op, torch::jit::Stack* stack);
...
```
```
// xla_cpu_fallback.cpp
#include "torch_xla/csrc/aten_cpu_fallback.h"
...
void xla_cpu_fallback(const c10::OperatorHandle& op, torch::jit::Stack* stack) {
  // Do custom logging here
  ...
  // Call the actual boxed CPU fallback.
  at::native::cpu_fallback(op, stack);
}

TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL(_, XLA, m) {
  m.fallback(torch::CppFunction::makeFromBoxedFunction<&xla_cpu_fallback>());
}
```

Now that the fallback is exposed in the backend, they can call it directly. Doing so requires converting from an unboxed to a boxed context, which we provide a utility function before. E.g.:
```
#include <ATen/native/CPUFallback.h>

at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::native::call_fallback_fn<&xla_cpu_fallback, decltype(at::addmm)>::call("aten::addmm", self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```

That `decltype(at::addmm)` logic isn't actually used everywhere in the xla-side PR yet, since you hit issues with overloads. I could use it everywhere once #58092 lands.

**Alternatives: The API for calling the CPU fallback directly is ugly, can we make it nicer?**
We could change the api to use `at::redispatch`, which would make it look something like this:
```
at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::redispatch::addmm(c10::DispatchKeySet(c10::DispatchKey::CPUFallback), self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```
Which definitely feels cleaner, but also requires adding a new DispatchKey just for this use case. Conditionally calling the CPU fallback doesn't sound like a hugely important use case, so I don't know if giving up one of our 64 dispatch key slots is worth the API improvement. Totally open to other opinions though!


Another more mild improvement that would avoid having to pass operator string names (including overloads) around would be to codegen (yet another) namespaced API. Something like this:
```
at::Tensor addmm(const at::Tensor& self,const at::Tensor& mat1,const at::Tensor& mat2,const at::Scalar& beta,const at::Scalar& alpha) {
  ....
  if (...call_fallback...) {
    return at::fallback::addmm<&xla_cpu_fallback>(self, mat1, mat2, beta, alpha);
  }
  ...
}
```

Writing that out actually I actually like it more (I think it'll let us get rid of `decltype(...)`). Maybe that is nice enough to warrant a new codegen API - I haven't tried adding that yet, but if people like it I'm happy to try it out.

**More alternatives**
The current design also involves the backend manually writing and registering the boxed fallback themselves, but an alternative would be for us to do it in codegen too: they would just need to pass in all of the C++ logging that they want done in the fallback, directly through the yaml. The main downsides:
* Backend code that wants to call the fallback needs to abide by whatever convention our codegen uses to name the generated boxed fallback.
* Passing custom C++ logging through yaml is just more fragile: right now xla uses an `iostream` to log each tensor arg in the operator, so we'd have to either force other backends into the same convention or figure something else out later.

To be fair, we actually already do that: XLA has custom per-tensor-arg logging for all of the generated `out` wrappers in the codegen, which we do by passing their C++ logging info through the yaml. This seems unnecessary though, since `out` wrappers just call into a functional kernel, which is hand written with its own custom logging. So my take is: try to remove custom C++ logging from the yaml, and if it turns out to be really necessary, then we may as well take advantage of that to codegen the fallback.

### Performance impact

While ops that fall back to CPU aren't exactly hot path, we probably don't want to use a boxed fallback if it turns out to be an absolute perf killer.

I ran my benchmarks using callgrind, benchmarking both `at::add` and `at::add_out` run on XLA. My callgrind benchmark for `at::add` can be found here (the add_out benchmark looks basically the same): https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415418587. I created the benchmark by hacking the existing xla C++ test build scripts and throwing in a reference to callgrind.

I also attached the full callgrind output for each benchmark; the full output is actually pretty noise and hard to parse, but I focused on everything underneath the `at::add()` call in the output, which was much more stable. My guess is that it's due to some heavyweight async startup processing that xla does.

`at::add`:
before: 88,505,130 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415421001
after: 102,185,654 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415421273
delta: ~15.5% increase

`at::add_out`:
before: 63,897,395 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/intern/everpaste/?handle=GBrrKwtAPlix9wUEAOZtrFXpdO5UbsIXAAAz
after: 73,170,346 instructions. Full output: https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P415423227
delta: ~14.5% increase

High level takeaway: A framework overhead increase of 10-20% doesn't seem too horrible for the CPU fallback use case.

For structured, functional ops that requires a CPU fallback, we're actually in an unfortunate situation: we're doing even more work than necessary. Our codegen automatically creates a `CompositeExplicitAutograd` kernel which calls into the `out` operator. So the extra work that we end up doing is:
* An extra dispatcher hop: (at::add -> CompositeExplicitAutograd -> CPUFallback -> at::native::add) instead of (at::add -> CPUFallback -> at::native::add)
* An unnecessary tensor allocation (the CompositeExplicitAutograd kernel uses at::empty() to create an output tensor, which is immediately overwritten by the CPU fallback)
* An unnecessary meta() call (the CompositeExplicitAutograd kernel calls it to create the output tensor, but we call it again in the CPU kernel).
* unboxing->boxing->unboxing logic (this is the only strictly required piece)

There are definitely ways to avoid the unnecessary work explained above: one would be to give the boxed fallback higher priority than composite keys (there's [an issue for it here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/55104)), and codegen fallthroughs for all composite ops. It'll require more infra to set up, so I see it as more of a perf knob that we can apply if we need it later.

Unfortunately I couldn't dig much deeper into the differences aside from the aggregate change in instructions, since it looks like callgrind fudged some of the instruction attribution (`at::to_cpu` takes up a ton of instructions, but I don't see any attribution for the `at::native::add` kernel anywhere).

mata: Add EXPENSIVE_RENDERING hints for GPU

To start off, mata had a pretty shit kernel. This kernel neither used
efficient frequencies, nor had great battery life not to mention the
horrible performance. This was fine because most users never gave a fuck
and I (the only guy dailying mata and tinkering with this stuff) just
never had a pleasant experience with it.

Looking at the new Kawase blur implementation added to Android 11, I
couldn't help but want it ASAP. However, the kernel just wouldn't
cooperate (apparently). Anay wanted me to rebase the kernel because,
"our kernel visibly didn't respond to GPU boost hints triggered by
the surfaceflinger from rendering expensive blur."

Well after two lengthy kernel rebases (albeit useful ones as I was able
to eliminate a LOT OF JUNK), here we fucking go — it was never the kernel
my genius man xD. Power hint changes taken from [1].

* While at it, let's boost the GPU's minimum frequencies to the 515MHz
  (basically the third step from the maximum frequency step available to
  the Adreno 540), to further help this old 10nm chad render that beastly
  but gorgeous looking blur.

"2pm. Let me resume.

I've really been into Thunderbolt Fantasy. I am actually 2 eps from finishing S1. Had I known it was this good, I would have picked it up back when it was airing.

Let me focus. I think I've decided on how I am going to deal with observations. I'll just group them and map them to a token observation. I'll ignore that this would put a token at the start, it does not matter. Though I can just always filter that out.

2:05pm. It is really so hard. I keep pushing against the boulder in my mind, trying to get it to move. It is not like I can't do any of the pieces, but I keep searching for the feeling of rightness. When I feel that the idea is right, I will have no problem going forward.

Let me step away from the screen. I've been doing that a lot it seems, but I feel the need to do it for a bit more.

So I have enough to start right now?

4:50pm. Let me step out for a while.

7:30pm. Done with lunch and that haircut. It seems there will be a heat wave later in the week, so that should keep me cooler. Right now the temperatures are great. There is even a cool wind outside. But in general, during summer the weather is too damn hot. This ideal balance is way too rare.

But that is not what I wanted to talk about.

I am still trying to overcome my inertia. I know why this is, and why my regrets are flaring up so much.

My heart is telling me - at this point doing the superhuman poker agent for any kind of game, the game itself and the UIs. All of that is a month work at most.

But even if I had the superhuman agent does that mean I can just start printing money? In an ideal world that would be true. But in reality, I suspect that I would get busted by the host.

Ultimately, the real challenge is not training the agent. Now that I understand backprop completely, I know how to make neural nets work.

The real challenge is passing the Turing test. The real challenge is and was always to pretend to be a normie. The challenge is to obey the unspoken rules of society.

7:35pm. I am afraid of this. This is the wound I've been carrying for six years. This is the root of my regret.

I figured out the secrets of omnipotence, but in the end that just impressed upon me how powerful the rules of society are. Big brain, and big muscles are not enough. Just the fist is not enough to rule the world of normals.

How dreadful and demanding those people are! I can't imagine beating them even if I was literally omnipotent!

7:40pm. Ok, so the rules are what they are. What is a repeated punch in the gut for me is that I keep looking back, acknowledge my mistakes, but I can also see that given my reasoning and energy budget I could not have acted any other way! For the sake of my path, the only choice I ever had was to lose and be at the bottom.

I couldn't have run away, because I did not have the programming skills back then.

So my mind is trapped in a recurrent nightmare where I keep trying to reason out how to beat the boss of the game at lvl 1. And I can't really win or take revenge, because that is not in the rules of the game. Anything I could come up with would just be fraud and sensenless violence.

It is just so dreadful. To win I'd have to be somebody else, but if I was such a person, I would never have figured out the self improvement loop.

7:45pm. And now I have this problem with poker. I'll have the superhuman agent soon enough, but it is a complete mystery whether I can win.

I can make a superhuman agent at playing poker. Or Go or Chess. Eventually that will be Dota and Starcraft.

But can I train an agent to be a normie?

7:50pm. I'll accept it as a challenge. I won't take it as an insult that I have to do this. In return I am definitely going to drain them dry. I will show them how little the rules of righteousness mean.

7:55pm. The ultimate challenge in programming for a human is to automate away the social game. If I could do this, I can consider myself a great programmer. And I will be able to put my regrets behind me, knowing that I've beaten the game.

8pm. I need to want it. I need to seek and believe in it. I need to dream about it and hope for it. I need to trust that it is possible.

8:05pm. In games far worse things happen that in real life, but you just reload and move on. I'll forever be pressured by my failures unless I figure out the solution to the game that I could not beat. If I could beat it, I could stop being obsessed by it.

Really I can understand why some people get consumed and start moralizing about social skills being a virtue and what not rather than just being another tool in the sheed. Even I myself wrote that if I do not manage anything but 2022 I'll give into normality. But I do not really mean it.

Yes, the power of escape is awesome. But what would be better is to beat the game in the way it is intended to be beated. To win what I need to do is make a proxy so good, that gives me all the benefits of playing it, but takes none of my energy.

8:10pm. This is all about me. I could make a superhuman agent, but then have to enter the cards manually. I could go a step forward and have it scan the screen and show me the results in an overlay. The step after that is to have it take control of the keyboard and the mouse.

The client will be watching what I do. That last step will be hard. Even if I spend a full year working on it, will it be enough? I am not sure.

Neurochips would help as they would allow me to reduce the energy expenditure of visual scene parsing. They might allow me to use GANs. But ultimately, whether I can beat the normie test depends on my own ingenuity.

8:15pm. The fact that I haven't been doing much programming lately, isn't it because deep down I still don't believe I can win?

Let me close here as I am tired. I will start in earnest when I gather the courage to fight.

If needed I will spend tomorrow in bed again. I will spend my day staring into the eye of terror until I find my resolve."

Well, you were the aftermath Of every judgment So cold by the sweat that You'll waste away And you carry your enemies But they're so familiar I'm sick of the company So I cull the shame And I know you'll say how I'm a burden Yeah, do your worst, all at once I know what you want from me (from me) I know what you're thinking And it's not the voice of all the others You've only said it to yourself I know what you want from me (from me) I know what you're thinking (They come to feel like things we're saying to ourselves) An inch from my ears again "You should be sorry" A solemn man "A better song could fix my problems" I'm tired of your questioning You're cut down too easily And I don't know what's good for me I can't decide And I know you'll say how I'm a burden Yeah, do your worst, all at once I know what you want from me (from me) I know what you're thinking And though they sound like one another You've only said it to yourself I know what you want from me (from me) I know what you're thinking "Now these voices have become our own" An inch from my ears again "You should be sorry" A solemn man "A better song could fix my problems" I'm tired of your questioning You're cut down too easily And I don't know what's good for me I can't decide And I know you'll say how I'm a burden Yeah, do your worst, all at once I know what you want from me (from me) I know what you're thinking And it's not the voice of all the others You've only said it to yourself I know what you want from me (from me) I know what you're thinking, thinking Thinking, thinking, thinking, think- And I know you'll say how I'm a burden Yeah, do your worst, all at once I know what you want from me (from me) I know what you're thinking, thinking, thinking And though they sound like one another You've only said it to yourself I know what you want from me (from me) I know what you're thinking, thinking Thinking, thinking, thinking, think- Sometimes, the inner voice is encouraging Calling for you to run those final few yards You're nearly there Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going It will all be OK in the end
