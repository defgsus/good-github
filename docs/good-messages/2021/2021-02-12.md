updating inventory systems

things like adding the appropriate amount of items if you pick up beyond what you can carry work properly.
coming up with a save/load system is proving to be a bit of a bitch. right now the game attempts to load an inventory and a pouch from two resource files. inside these resource files are an array of dictionaries for each item. inside the dictionaries are keys/values for Name and quantity. the game basically loads this file as the player's starting inventory.
i think before coming up with a save/load system, i need to figure out what happens when you die. if it's done the 'classic' way, you basically get kicked back to the title screen and have to re-load your last save. despite being classic, it's not the best way - gameplay-wise - to handle things, i think.
if it's done in a more modern way, in which you automatically come back to life at the last checkpoint but with some kind of penalty (ie., used items don't come back + XP loss), then "saving" should occur upon death. the issue then becomes a balancing act of incentivising the player to use spells vs. saving ingredients.
if spell ingredients are to be a core aspect of gameplay, you should be able to re-try a failed encounter without losing those used ingredients. on the other hand, if found ingredients are plentiful enough in the level (and respawn on death, for example), permanent loss makes more sense, even if it means the player has to go out of their way slightly to recoup spent ingredients.
i think the next big project for the game should be a death system, which itself is a combination of other systems, which need to be built from the ground up.
player needs spawn points. when you die/restart, you reappear at a spawn point, instead of at your death location. your current spawn point is the last one you visit. need to come up with an interesting concept for spawn points/checkpoints/save points, whatever you want to call them. it could just be the beginning of the last map entered - that sounds like an OK start point. damn this is confusing.

Reaction rates, pH, purity and more! Brings a heavily improved, less explosive and optimised fermichem to tg. (#56019)

Brings a heavily improved, rewritten, and optimised fermichem to tg. I saw that tg seemed receptive to it, so I thought I’d do it myself. If you know of fermichem – there’s a lot changed and improved, so looking at other documents regarding it will not be accurate.

Revamps the main chemistry reaction handler to allow for over time reactions instead of instant reactions. This revamp allows for simultaneous reactions, exo/endothermic reactions and pH consuming/producing behaviours. Most of the reactions in game will now inherit an easy one size fits all reaction.

Temperature mechanics

    Temperature affects reaction rate
    The higher it is, the faster it is, but be careful, as chem reactions will perform special functions when overheated (presently it DOESN’T explode)
    Temperature will increase or decrease depending on the exo/endothermic nature of the reaction

pH mechanics

    Each reaction requires the pH of a beaker to be within a certain range.
    If you are outside of the optimal, you'll incur impurity, which has a negative effect on the resultant chem
    pH of a beaker will change during a reaction
    Reacting Impure chem effects can vary from chem to chem, but for default will reduce the purity of other reagents in the beaker
    Consuming an impure chem will either cause liver or tox damage dependant on how impure it is as well as reducing consumed volume
    Purity can (presently) only be seen with a chemical analyser
    Impure chems can purposely be made by making the reagent with a low, but not explosive, purity.
    A chem made under the PurityMin will convert into the reagent’s failed chem in the beaker.

Optional catalysts

    Reactions can use an optional catalyst to influence the reaction - at the more framework exists from tmeprature, reaction rate and pH changes as a result of a catalyst. Catalysts can be set to only work on a specific reagent subtype. It is preferable to those building upon this code that optional catalysts only affect a subsection of reagents.
    Presently the only catalyst that uses this is Palladium synthate catalyst - a catalyst that increases the reaction speed of medicines.

Reaction agents

    These are reagents that will consume themselves when added to a beaker - even a full one, and apply effects to the total solution. One example being Tempomyocin which will speed up a reaction, or the buffer reagents which change the pH.

Competitive reactions

These reactions will go towards a certain product depending on the conditions of the holder. The example one given is a little tricky and requires a lot of temperature to push it towards one end.
New and charged reactions

(see the wiki for details)

Acidic /basic buffer - These reagents will adjust the pH of a beaker/solution when added to one. If the beaker is empty it will fill it instead.

Tempomyocin - This will instantly speed up any reaction added it is added to, giving it a short burst of speed. Adding this reagent to a reaction will give it a suddent speed boost up to 3x times - with the output purity of the boost modified by the Tempomyocin's purity.5u per 100u will give you 2x, 10 u per 100u will give you 3x. IIt caps at 3x for a single addition, but there is nothing preventing you from adding multiple doses for multiple boosts.

Purit tester - this will fizzle if the solution it is added to has an inverse purity reagent present.

A few other reactions have been tweaked to make sure they work too. An example being meth - see the wikipage linked above.
A note on all reactions

    The one size fits all reaction for all chems generally won’t create impure chems – it is very forgiving. The only thing to remember is to avoid heating reactions over 900 or you’ll reduce your yield, and try to keep your pH between 5 -9.

This PR doesn’t have specific example chems included (except for the buffers) – they will be atomised out and they use the mechanics in more depth
A note on plumbing

I reached out to Time Green and we worked together to make sure plumbing was fine. Time Green did some of his own tests too, and surprisingly it doesn't look like much needs to be changed.

#### Friday 2021-02-12 02:16:53 by Jean-Paul R. Soucy

New data: 2021-02-11: See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (AB, BC, MB, ON, QC, SK); testing (NT); vaccination (NT).

National case IDs in today’s data update contain a duplicated value. Today’s case IDs will be fixed tomorrow.

Toronto (ON) experienced a “data error” and apparently removed many previous cases. They report 411 new cases today but our number may not match since the number of previous cases removed is not reported.

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “The data also report 37 new deaths, for a total of 10,149. Among these 37 deaths, 8 have occurred in the last 24 hours, 25 have occurred between February 4 and February 9 and 4 have occurred before February 4.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

INX Future Inc Employee Performance - Project
INX Future Inc , (referred as INX ) , is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider
with over 15 years of global business presence. INX is consistently rated as top 20 best employers past 5
years. INX human resource policies are considered as employee friendly and widely perceived as best
practices in the industry.
Recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this is becoming a growing
concerns among the top management. There has been increased escalations on service delivery and
client satisfaction levels came down by 8 percentage points.
CEO, Mr. Brain, knows the issues but concerned to take any actions in penalizing non-performing
employees as this would affect the employee morale of all the employees in general and may further
reduce the performance. Also, the market perception best employer and thereby attracting best talents
to join the company.
Mr. Brain decided to initiate a data science project , which analyses the current employee data and find
the core underlying causes of this performance issues. Mr. Brain, being a data scientist himself, expects
the findings of this project will help him to take right course of actions. He also expects a clear indicators
of non performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employee, if required, may
not significantly affect other employee morals.
The following insights are expected from this project.
1. Department wise performances
2. Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance
3. A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs. This
will be used to hire employees
4. Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.

v0.1.9.1-alpha

- Overhauled how heresies work, they will trigger now on a random Monk/Priest who will convert to the new heresy and spark up popular county conversion in the geographical location of the heresiarch, only the player host of the heretic Monk/Priest can decide to convert to the new heresy
- Overhauled the Martial education traits: vanilla martial education is now understood as a physical martial arts education when you learn to fight. The education martial trait thus give prowess instead of martial. Upon 16th birthday, children following a martial education can gain the Commander trait (same tier as vanilla martial education and same stats) representing his ability to lead men and armies. Barring exceptional individuals (or already proven Commander guardians), 16 year old will not get the highest martial tier but can learn to be better commanders during battles either as commanders or as knights (half of the experience). Positive Openess to Experience and Honesty Humility traits will make them progress and improve their Commander trait faster
- Removed Martial stat bonus from Berserker
- Added Martial stat (2,4,6) for the Hunter trait
- Going below 25 Popularity as the Basileus will give every Doux, Tagma commanders and high administration official a claim on the Empire
- GUI rewriting to reduce size of error log
- Going for a run (Stress Reduction Decision from Athletic trait will reduce your target weight now, no more Athletic obese characters regularly going for a run and not seeing any result)
- Added an event triggered when you become Roman Emperor through a Faction Demand to decide on what to do with your predecessor (snip snip)
- Reduced to 0 the Marriage weighting modifier based on the number of owned alliances
- Improved Legitimacy calculation weighting for the Emperor election: one Legitimacy point give you one additional vote weight up until 150 where it caps
- Increased Junior Emperor trait vote weight in Emperor election to 150 (from 100)
- Blind and Eunuch characters are barred from the Emperor election
- Born in the Purple and positive Beauty traits increase initial Popularity calculation (+20 ; +10/15/20)
- Added crutches to the AI when becoming Roman Emperor to choose one of the Basileus Lifestyle focuses
- Cannot buy land/add Family succession law to a county title under a Kourator duchy title
- Increased chances for the AI to take the Sponsor Church Renovation decision when Popularity is below 50
- Automatic government change for roman vassals using roman government when they fall outside of the empire
- Reduced weight gain from Feast Activity by half
- Increased the AI chance to take the Imperial Expedition decision if they have Martial quality traits and inversely if they are do not
- Increased Ai chance to replace/fire the Domestikos of the Scholai if he is not of your own dynasty
- Barred +55 years old characters from Strategos elections.
- Reworked Obsessed Hunter trait gfx to be more in line with vanilla style
- Added a minimum 0.1 income and 100 levies to Sparsely Populated Holdings
- Changed the 1066 De Jure setup for the Kingdom of France by including all of Aquitaine and Catalonia

EEVEE: Refactor closure_lit_lib.glsl

This refactor was needed for some reasons:
- closure_lit_lib.glsl was unreadable and could not be easily extended to use new features.
- It was generating ~5K LOC for any shader. Slowing down compilation.
- Some calculations were incorrect and BSDF/Closure code had lots of workaround/hacks.

What this refactor does:
- Add some macros to define the light object loops / eval.
- Clear separation between each closures which now have separate files. Each closure implements the eval functions.
- Make principled BSDF a bit more correct in some cases (specular coloring, mix between glass and opaque).
- The BSDF term are applied outside of the eval function and on the whole lighting (was separated for lights before).
- Make light iteration last to avoid carrying more data than needed.
- Makes sure that all inputs are within correct ranges before evaluating the closures (use `safe_normalize` on normals).
- Making each BSDF isolated means that we might carry duplicated data (normals for instance) but this should be optimized by compilers.
- Makes Translucent BSDF its own closure type to avoid having to disable raytraced shadows using hacks.
- Separate transmission roughness is now working on Principled BSDF.
- Makes principled shader variations using constants. Removing a lot of duplicated code. This needed `const` keyword detection in `gpu_material_library.c`.
- SSR/SSS masking and data loading is a bit more consistent and defined outside of closure eval. The loading functions will act as accumulator if the lighting is not to be separated.
- SSR pass now do a full deferred lighting evaluation, including lights, in order to avoid interference with the closure eval code. However, it seems that the cost of having a global SSR toggle uniform is making the surface shader more expensive (which is already the case, by the way).
- Principle fully black specular tint now returns black instead of white.
- This fixed some artifact issue on my AMD computer on normal surfaces (which might have been some uninitialized variables).
- This touched the Ambient Occlusion because it needs to be evaluated for each closure. But to avoid the cost of this, we use another approach to just pass the result of the occlusion on interpolated normals and modify it using the bent normal for each Closure. This tends to reduce shadowing. I'm still looking into improving this but this is out of the scope of this patch.
- Performance might be a bit worse with this patch since it is more oriented towards code modularity. But not by a lot.

Render tests needs to be updated after this.
