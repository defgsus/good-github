More Parrying shit BAYBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Shit Done Today:
- Bullets reflect when parried and when reflected only hurt enemies not player
- Enemy stun function created but since enemy movement is not implemented it kind of doesn't do shit. But it's there and boy do it look purty
- Cuphead-esque bounce after parry
- Yo-Yo Parry Slightly implemented but obviously needs some fucking polish man.

Glitches Fixed:
- Bullets no longer collide with grapple rope
- Danger Zone attacks weren't despawning correctly and their despawn coroutine was being called like 400 times in a row. It works now and now only calls the coroutine once

Noticed Glitches:
- Button Axis Dashing: if you press the dash button and no direction it will wait until the next direction you press then immediately dash.
- First hit doesn't take damage
- Need to make the player invulnerable while parrying or they'll sometimes hit bullets after a parry
- Player dying in ball man form makes death state unobtainable
- Sometimes player will keep zooming past enemies in a yo-yo zoom
- Parrying an enemy who shoots projectiles leads to a few problems. Preferably I would like it if one parry captured an attack and a bullet I want it to maybe destroy the bullet object? We should also have stunned enemies unable to spawn more bullets. Or even maybe stop enemies from spawning bullets during a danger zone attack? This might mean we will want to make bullet spawning part of Universal Enemy Behavior? Food for thought... This also makes me wonder what we should do if you're sandwiched between two danger zone attacks? What takes priority? What happens if you're halfway through a yo-yo zoom and you parry a Danger Zone attack? Will it cause nested Yo-Yo loops? Ehhhhh fuck it whatever I'm tired I got work in the mornin I'm gettin too old for this shit I'm a week away from retirement I can't relate to these kids no more with their tiktaks and their fuckin whatever you have it fuckin I don't know, fugehtabouteeet. Sorry, most of this post seemed too professional so I had to make sure I fucked it up at the end somehow.

player: add optional separate video decoding thread

See manpage additions. This has been a topic in MPlayer/mplayer2/mpv
since forever. But since libavcodec multi-threaded decoding was added,
I've always considered this pointless. libavcodec requires you to
"preload" it with packets, and then you can pretty much avoid blocking
on it, if decoding is fast enough.

But in some cases, a decoupled decoder thread _might_ help. Users have
for example come up with cases where decoding video in a separate
process and piping it as raw video to mpv helped. (Or my memory is
false, and it was about vapoursynth filtering, who knows.) So let's just
see whether this helps with anything.

Note that this would have been _much_ easier if libavcodec had an
asynchronous (or rather, non-blocking) API. It could probably have
easily gained that with a small change to its multi-threading code and a
small extension to its API, but I guess not.

Unfortunately, this uglifies f_decoder_wrapper quite a lot. Part of this
is due to annoying corner cases like legacy frame dropping and hardware
decoder state. These could probably be prettified later on.

There is also a change in playloop.c: this is because there is a need to
coordinate playback resets between demuxer thread, decoder thread, and
playback logic. I think this SEEK_BLOCK idea worked out reasonably well.

There are still a number of problems. For example, if the demuxer cache
is full, the decoder thread will simply block hard until the output
queue is full, which interferes with seeking. Could also be improved
later. Hardware decoding will probably die in a fire, because it will
run out of surfaces quickly. We could reduce the queue to size 1...
maybe later. We could update the queue options at runtime easily, but
currently I'm not going to bother.

I could only have put the lavc wrapper itself on a separate thread. But
there is some annoying interaction with EDL and backward playback shit,
and also you would have had to loop demuxer packets through the
playloop, so this sounded less annoying.

The food my mother made for us today was delicious.

Because audio uses the same code, also for audio (even if completely
pointless).

Fixes: #6926

"10:15am. Since I am writing, my work is essentially mining my subconscious and that is giving me trouble going asleep as I keep imagining scenes. Any mail? None.

Hmmmm, why do I feel so positive about C++ lately? It came from studying it back when I was intending to do a backend for it. I guess figuring out how shared pointers and various other things work made me feel that it is viable as a language.

In a similar vein, if I am going to do an ASP.NET kind of backend job, I need to start feeling positive about that kind of work. That is the most important thing.

10:30am. Let me chill a bit and then I will start writing.

10:45am. Ok, let me do it like this. I'll write today, but I'll spend tomorrow studying ASP.NET. Maybe I got off on the wrong foot back in 2020.

I just do not have the guts to properly face the future without money anymore.

11:10am. Ok, since I feel like it, let me take an ASP.NET crash course. The official docs are so horrible. And I have this sense of unease. At this point I even feel like asking my relative for that university job.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=asp.net

https://youtu.be/C5cnZ-gZy2I
Learn ASP.NET Core 3.1 - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]

Let me go for this. It is over 3h long, so it should take me the entire day.

The unease is what drives me. I should also consider expanding to JS. My impressions of the JS frameworks like React, while not good weren't as negative as of ASP.NET so I could swallow that.

Let me just focus on studying this today. Ingesting some of this will lessen my unease.

11:20am. For this, I should embrace C#. Forget functional programming for the time being.

https://youtu.be/C5cnZ-gZy2I?t=101

It is suggesting a SQL tutorial here. Basically this course is everything I am missing to be a pro C# programmer. I should be able to pick all of this up in a few days. Right now, I am sure to flunk the Theorem test.

https://youtu.be/C5cnZ-gZy2I?t=684

Ohhh, SQL Server.

It was hard to get rid of that. 1.5Gb. Well, let me get it.

Following the course from start to finish like this is the least I can do.

12:10pm. https://youtu.be/C5cnZ-gZy2I?t=1802

I've realized why I liked C++ once I approach it from a PL backend standpoint, but hated ASP.NET. Basically all of this shit in ASP.NET is strewn around like shit piled on shit. If I had to work with this I'd do it entirely Googling my problems without understanding what most of it does.

Maybe I should 'master' that style of programming.

But I suppose I got something like a C++ job, at least there I'd know where I stand at any given time.

12:15pm. From my current vantage point, that Groq interview invite I brushed off, and the Intel job I got an interview look appealing to me now even if it was just for programming in C++. Yes, the language is crap, but it is not like I'd be worse off relative to my competition for it. I'd have to write more, but I'd be able to make use of my usual style for it. And I do have an affinity for PL work now.

To be honest the course is putting me to sleep. Let me get breakfast here. I'll watch it for another hour and then decide which way do I want to go.

1pm. Let me resume.

I am thinking of Unity and C++ jobs. I am not suited for ASP.NET anymore than I am for data science jobs. With ASP.NET there is so much magic, that I find it off putting.

But given my background, I do have everything I need to be a first-rate game dev. I know how to manage the highs and the lows, I know concurrency, I know AI, and I know PL.

https://www.indeed.com/q-Remote-Unity-Developer-jobs.html?vjk=301f4b41cbcfc7bb

There is a bunch. Not too many.

1:05pm. Let me continue watch the ASP.NET course.

1:35pm. https://youtu.be/C5cnZ-gZy2I?t=3626

I am not even watching the video. Most of my mental energy is spent being stressed regarding what I want to do.

https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?id=548882&r=true&tl=c%2B%2B

Take a look at this. Python and C++ and ML. The requirements at these places are so damn different. This is not like being a dentist where you do mostly the same things. How could anybody be a good fit for all this shit?

Sigh, I do want to do my own thing. But I am not sure, well, I am pretty sure that Simulacrum: Heaven's Key is unlikely to sell much to make it worth the time investment put into it.

The job market lottery is really the worst.

1:45pm. Do I really need money, am I really that desperate?

If I really needed the money, what is wrong with reaching out to my local network? I have that relative, and one of my school friends who is now a CEO of some mobile app gacha making company which is supposedly successful. Even if it is something like 2k, it would keep me off the streets in the worst case.

I guess, I am having an existential crisis. Abandoning my path has badly shaken my resolve and I am trying to cope. Do I really want a 12k/month job because I need those dollars or am I trying to buff up my own ego through the job market?

Do deep down I just want somebody to recognize my skill and effort?

If I was really serious about jobs, I'd be studying these popular frameworks the first thing rather than the last. I'd completely internalize the mercenary mentality.

But instead I am now torn between competing interests.

This is a good way to program, but not a very comfortable way to live.

2pm. I could really do any of these jobs if I had just a tiny bit of ramp up time. If I had 2-4 weeks, or something like that. Looking at some of the Unity stuff they want contractors with track records. I am not sure my portfolio is good enough to compete. It is like that everywhere.

2:05pm. I'll admit it. It takes resolve to be a charlatan and bullshit your way into one of these positions. All these safeguards have that effect on me. Even the regular /g/ demoralization threads are having an effect on me.

It takes resolve to carry the burden and the shame of being a loser.

Sigh.

If I could upload and copy myself, I'd have one fork focus solely on job hunting online, the other on writing Simulacrum, and have the other reach out to the local network. I could trust that others are doing their best and I could focus on what my role is. But now I need to choose.

2:20pm. It is hard to succeed alone, without any power. Solo play is not for the weak.

2:45pm. I am completely frozen here. Some of the jobs on the C++ page seem comfy with not requiring cloud or arcane frameworks.

Take a look at this.

///

Our App Architecture:

We have a very unconventional architecture, and therefore is unlike any project you worked with. We have both iOS and Android mobile apps, but the apps are either native nor unity apps. The native code and Unity code work together, and therefore requires higher skill set, and ability to work with the iOS and Android teams to be successful.

We have hired 5 separate Unity devs in this company and only one was successful as he was the only one that thought creatively and didn’t try doing classic solutions like all other Unity projects. If you are not going to be open to a challenge, don’t have amazing problem solving skills, won’t look for creative solutions, won’t be open-minded, and try to do things the way you always have done in other projects, please do not apply, as you will almost certainly fail.

///

This is like a stay away sign - we have a shitty codebase.

///

Required Skills and Experience

If you lack some of these skills or experiences, we would require you to show us that you can learn the skill fast, or have a very similar skill or experience. The hiring process involves coding challenges to test your technical skills.

5+ years of Unity development experience
3+ years of C# or C++ experience
3+ years of game development experience
Perfect English, both writing and speaking
Shipped Unity apps to the App Stores, which we can download and play
Developed games in Unity you can show
Completed performance optimization for at least 3 Unity games
Can write clean code with excellent documentation and unit test scripts
Must have strong communication skills.
Detail-oriented, with excellent analytical and problem-solving skills.
Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, dynamic virtual environment.
Ability to work under minimal supervision while also being a great team player

///

* Developed games in Unity you can show
* Completed performance optimization for at least 3 Unity games

The real problem with this ad is this. If I applied I would not be able to push through this requirement.

3pm. Sigh, I regret it. If only...I could merge AI and game development skills. Is wanting an AI to play poker at the master level for you all that different from wanting it to generate art and music for you?

3:05pm. I do not truly care about poker itself. I just saw it as the most viable cultivation path towards AI. If I thought I could win in a different manner more efficiently, I'd have picked that.

No, I do not want jobs. I just want to have fun while cultivating my AI skills.

Really, any path would be viable. You pick a domain and you automate more and more of it, until reaching transcendence.

That is the essence of programming.

I haven't been doing it in a proper way. I should pick a domain and then program in a way that would allow me to automate it without end. With NNs all I can do pass data into them. Deep learning is a not a way of programming, but a technique.

Probabilistic programming is a lot closer to my requirements. I should cultivate probabilistic programming. Even though right now I have zero idea how I will be able to take advantage of it. But if it is to serve as the foundation for rational reasoning, then something should come of it.

Let me watch the ASP.NET video for half an hour longer. Then it might be worth looking at Unity tutorials.

https://youtu.be/C5cnZ-gZy2I?t=4150

Ok, enough. I can't watch this anymore. This is the sort of thing people would have to pay me to pick up on the job. Forget these framework related jobs.

3:25pm. Back in 2014 what was my biggest problem towards reaching commercial success? ...Well, besides going crazy?

Lack of art and sound. If I could meet those requirements my odds of success would go way up.

But it is not like I can't do art now. What about GANs, what about style transfer? Things are different compared to 7 years ago.

Haven't I just been ignoring this possibility? If it is supporting my effort to make a VN, maybe just supervised learning would be enough.

Even GAN stability has been resolved through the duality gap algorithm.

3:35pm. It is just supervised ML, that has potential.

It is really a small thing, but I can cultivate like this. Latent rand vars for the stats, deep nets for art and sound. There is room for improving my AI skills in this direction.

If I just wrote stories, I'd be a charlatan in the quest for Singularity, but like this I can reasonably present the case to future onlookers that I am doing my best here.

3:40pm. Ok, if I get paid work in PPLs by Z or that Intel autonomous driving work with AI chips sent my way, that should be acceptable. But otherwise - a year. It should be enough to write out the scenes and play with GANs to generate the art and the sound that I need.

Forget poker. Somebody with better skills than me could have succeeded in similar circumstances, but my AI aptitude is awful for some reason.

I'll try to make a small, but guaranteed victory.

Since I will be doing things on top of probabilistic programming, that will leave endless opportunity for future improvement.

With my GTX 970, the art won't be too good, but with AI chips it will get a lot better. And so on.

Anything is better than a blank screen with a pile of text. The essence of programming can be found in improving things where it is possible.

For backgrounds, I can do style transfer of real photos.

3:45pm. I meant to do this at some point, but I expected that point to be after poker. Still plans and reality are different.

Games have taught me, it does not matter what the past is. What matters is if you are leveling up now.

3:50pm. Let me take a bath here.

Today I could have been writing, or applying, or studying, but I've been doing neither. I am not even having fun. But it is important to take time to establish my goal.

Just writing a story is not enough. Just what can I do with the limit of my ability?"

"5:10pm. If it is just doing VNs, I am sure that Unity is overkill, but it is the first thing that pops to mind. I should focus on writing out 100 different scenes first and then consider how to fit them.

I should go down this path.

I feel bad that I won't be able to make the money needed to cryofreeze mom in order to save her from cancer, but that is how the dice roll. Life is pretty brutal. She is unlucky to have contacted it at this time. I treasure the time she is still here.

I might be hard working, but I am also filled with evil.

I am going to change. Just as I've changed my personality in 2014, and then revisited programming in 2015 and kept it up till today, writing is also something that has taken its hold for me. Everything that I like should be brought together.

If my luck and ability is not good enough to make it this way then so be it. I could always get some lethal disease myself, or might heart might stop out of the blue. Or I could fall behind in the race and the winner might just decide that other people should not be given a chance to self improve ever.

5:20pm. The way hiring works is like some dystopian comedy. Just why is every HR person I've gotten in contact so far some woman? It is like the very important job of evaluating potential candidates all went to people least qualified to judge them. Having Spiral on my resume counts for shit.

And my ability to bullshit is not that good since I do not have any experience at companies. I'd sure like to know how people get recruiters to hound them constantly.

I am not going to try this anymore. I am just not good at playing this game.

5:25pm. I should gather my will and focus entirely on my own work, plus the threads I am interested in. I am going to get rid of that freelancer resume. If I find something of interest on ai-jobs or compiler related work I'll use the 3 page one. I'll ignore that guy who offered me advice.

I feel that most of that advice is some kind of demoralization work. Or for all I know the people who are offering it might be morons.

There should be a way to just be honest and say that I've never worked at companies before, but I am looking forward to trying it. And that I have the relevant experience for the role anyway. After the week is done, I'll try sending the 3 page resume at Intel again.

5:30pm. A lie is only good if you know how to deliver it properly. If I was a recruiter and I read that buzzword resume, I'd be insulted. For the backend positions they would not care about the resume and like Theorem just send me to Devskiller or HackerRank anyway.

5:40pm. Let me read Gunnm. I do not feel like writing today. I barely even feel like playing. This feeling of unease is quite something. 100 scenes. Let me go 100 scener or so, and then I will look into GANs for the first time. That will be my triumphant return to ML.

I need something I can show to people. If I could have done that poker tutorial, my position would have improved significantly.

I must not make the same mistake again.

5:55pm. Let me get lunch. I'll close here for the day. I am almost done with Hollow Knight, only the extra endings and the add-on content remains. The game deserves the praise it gets. It has charm in spades."

refactor: remove foreman for easier debugging

Using `binding.pry` a docker environment gets a pain in the ass once
foreman enters the game.

@tillprochaska: As far as I can see it, there is no hot-reload feature
anymore. But I checked out your last commit and there it seems not to be
there as well. So, I guess, I didn't break anything with my refactoring.

The multiple docker-services seem to work fine. I remember that we had
an issue with shared volumes between the `assets` service and the `app`
service in the past. This does not seem to be an issue anymore (at least
on my machine).
