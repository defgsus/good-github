Big Sprite Update

First of all big shout out to those who contributed assets to this PR!!!
SPANKMAN - SpankMan#2361 - Exemplary sprites and developer consultation, can't wait to work with him again!!
GASMASKED - Gasmasked#4747 - Literally remaking STALKER 13 one sprite at a time, thank you so much dude!!
PEBBLES - Pebbles#0773 - Thank you so much for providing all of these Fortune 13 assets, and for all your wonderful conversation that opens my eyes!!
STINKY - stinky#4362 - For contributing awesome new sprites and getting outside the box - usually he does character sprites, but here is him taking a whack at some objects!! Thank you so much bro, great additions to the project!!

- Adds a ton of sprites and items, and either changed them to more appropriate sprites from Fortune 13's asset library or resprited existing assets. These sprites are for both objects and items!

- More farming, cooking, and chemistry sprites!!!

- Fixes the cleared sky/renegades, duty/freedom start text so that they are SHOOT ON SIGHT OOOH YEAH BABY

Will edit this document with pictures later, but MORE TO COME!! Some objects broken-ish, icon state things that my boy d.winters99#4343 is gonna help fix. Thank you bro!
