merge-ort: restart merge with cached renames to reduce process entry cost

The merge algorithm mostly consists of the following three functions:
   collect_merge_info()
   detect_and_process_renames()
   process_entries()
Prior to the trivial directory resolution optimization of the last half
dozen commits, process_entries() was consistently the slowest, followed
by collect_merge_info(), then detect_and_process_renames().  When the
trivial directory resolution applies, it often dramatically decreases
the amount of time spent in the two slower functions.

Looking at the performance results in the previous commit, the trivial
directory resolution optimization helps amazingly well when there are no
relevant renames.  It also helps really well when reapplying a long
series of linear commits (such as in a rebase or cherry-pick), since the
relevant renames may well be cached from the first reapplied commit.
But when there are any relevant renames that are not cached (represented
by the just-one-mega testcase), then the optimization does not help at
all.

Often, I noticed that when the optimization does not apply, it is
because there are a handful of relevant sources -- maybe even only one.
It felt frustrating to need to recurse into potentially hundreds or even
thousands of directories just for a single rename, but it was needed for
correctness.

However, staring at this list of functions and noticing that
process_entries() is the most expensive and knowing I could avoid it if
I had cached renames suggested a simple idea: change
   collect_merge_info()
   detect_and_process_renames()
   process_entries()
into
   collect_merge_info()
   detect_and_process_renames()
   <cache all the renames, and restart>
   collect_merge_info()
   detect_and_process_renames()
   process_entries()

This may seem odd and look like more work.  However, note that although
we run collect_merge_info() twice, the second time we get to employ
trivial directory resolves, which makes it much faster, so the increased
time in collect_merge_info() is small.  While we run
detect_and_process_renames() again, all renames are cached so it's
nearly a no-op (we don't call into diffcore_rename_extended() but we do
have a little bit of data structure checking and fixing up).  And the
big payoff comes from the fact that process_entries(), will be much
faster due to having far fewer entries to process.

This restarting only makes sense if we can save recursing into enough
directories to make it worth our while.  Introduce a simple heuristic to
guide this.  Note that this heuristic uses a "wanted_factor" that I have
virtually no actual real world data for, just some back-of-the-envelope
quasi-scientific calculations that I included in some comments and then
plucked a simple round number out of thin air.  It could be that
tweaking this number to make it either higher or lower improves the
optimization.  (There's slightly more here; when I first introduced this
optimization, I used a factor of 10, because I was completely confident
it was big enough to not cause slowdowns in special cases.  I was
certain it was higher than needed.  Several months later, I added the
rough calculations which make me think the optimal number is close to 2;
but instead of pushing to the limit, I just bumped it to 3 to reduce the
risk that there are special cases where this optimization can result in
slowing down the code a little.  If the ratio of path counts is below 3,
we probably will only see minor performance improvements at best
anyway.)

Also, note that while the diffstat looks kind of long (nearly 100
lines), more than half of it is in two comments explaining how things
work.

For the testcases mentioned in commit 557ac0350d ("merge-ort: begin
performance work; instrument with trace2_region_* calls", 2020-10-28),
this change improves the performance as follows:

                            Before                  After
    no-renames:      205.1  ms ±  3.8  ms   204.2  ms ±  3.0  ms
    mega-renames:      1.564 s ±  0.010 s     1.076 s ±  0.015 s
    just-one-mega:   479.5  ms ±  3.9  ms   364.1  ms ±  7.0  ms

Actually use microbundle for once.

I hate it. I would have loved for my tiny module to use requires.

But as it turns out compatibility is a thing, so yeah. Bah humbug.

mm: workingset: don't drop refault information prematurely

mainline inclusion
from mainline-4.20-rc1
commit 95f9ab2d596e8cbb388315e78c82b9a131bf2928
category: bugfix
bugzilla: 51815, https://gitee.com/openeuler/kernel/issues/I3IJ9I
CVE: NA

-------------------------------------------------
Patch series "psi: pressure stall information for CPU, memory, and IO", v4.

		Overview

PSI reports the overall wallclock time in which the tasks in a system (or
cgroup) wait for (contended) hardware resources.

This helps users understand the resource pressure their workloads are
under, which allows them to rootcause and fix throughput and latency
problems caused by overcommitting, underprovisioning, suboptimal job
placement in a grid; as well as anticipate major disruptions like OOM.

		Real-world applications

We're using the data collected by PSI (and its previous incarnation,
memdelay) quite extensively at Facebook, and with several success stories.

One usecase is avoiding OOM hangs/livelocks.  The reason these happen is
because the OOM killer is triggered by reclaim not being able to free
pages, but with fast flash devices there is *always* some clean and
uptodate cache to reclaim; the OOM killer never kicks in, even as tasks
spend 90% of the time thrashing the cache pages of their own executables.
There is no situation where this ever makes sense in practice.  We wrote a
<100 line POC python script to monitor memory pressure and kill stuff way
before such pathological thrashing leads to full system losses that would
require forcible hard resets.

We've since extended and deployed this code into other places to guarantee
latency and throughput SLAs, since they're usually violated way before the
kernel OOM killer would ever kick in.

It is available here: https://github.com/facebookincubator/oomd

Eventually we probably want to trigger the in-kernel OOM killer based on
extreme sustained pressure as well, so that Linux can avoid memory
livelocks - which technically aren't deadlocks, but to the user
indistinguishable from them - out of the box.  We'd continue using OOMD as
the first line of defense to ensure workload health and implement complex
kill policies that are beyond the scope of the kernel.

We also use PSI memory pressure for loadshedding.  Our batch job
infrastructure used to use heuristics based on various VM stats to
anticipate OOM situations, with lackluster success.  We switched it to PSI
and managed to anticipate and avoid OOM kills and lockups fairly reliably.
The reduction of OOM outages in the worker pool raised the pool's
aggregate productivity, and we were able to switch that service to smaller
machines.

Lastly, we use cgroups to isolate a machine's main workload from
maintenance crap like package upgrades, logging, configuration, as well as
to prevent multiple workloads on a machine from stepping on each others'
toes.  We were not able to configure this properly without the pressure
metrics; we would see latency or bandwidth drops, but it would often be
hard to impossible to rootcause it post-mortem.

We now log and graph pressure for the containers in our fleet and can
trivially link latency spikes and throughput drops to shortages of
specific resources after the fact, and fix the job config/scheduling.

PSI has also received testing, feedback, and feature requests from Android
and EndlessOS for the purpose of low-latency OOM killing, to intervene in
pressure situations before the UI starts hanging.

		How do you use this feature?

A kernel with CONFIG_PSI=y will create a /proc/pressure directory with 3
files: cpu, memory, and io.  If using cgroup2, cgroups will also have
cpu.pressure, memory.pressure and io.pressure files, which simply
aggregate task stalls at the cgroup level instead of system-wide.

The cpu file contains one line:

	some avg10=2.04 avg60=0.75 avg300=0.40 total=157656722

The averages give the percentage of walltime in which one or more tasks
are delayed on the runqueue while another task has the CPU.  They're
recent averages over 10s, 1m, 5m windows, so you can tell short term
trends from long term ones, similarly to the load average.

The total= value gives the absolute stall time in microseconds.  This
allows detecting latency spikes that might be too short to sway the
running averages.  It also allows custom time averaging in case the
10s/1m/5m windows aren't adequate for the usecase (or are too coarse with
future hardware).

What to make of this "some" metric?  If CPU utilization is at 100% and CPU
pressure is 0, it means the system is perfectly utilized, with one
runnable thread per CPU and nobody waiting.  At two or more runnable tasks
per CPU, the system is 100% overcommitted and the pressure average will
indicate as much.  From a utilization perspective this is a great state of
course: no CPU cycles are being wasted, even when 50% of the threads were
to go idle (as most workloads do vary).  From the perspective of the
individual job it's not great, however, and they would do better with more
resources.  Depending on what your priority and options are, raised "some"
numbers may or may not require action.

The memory file contains two lines:

some avg10=70.24 avg60=68.52 avg300=69.91 total=3559632828
full avg10=57.59 avg60=58.06 avg300=60.38 total=3300487258

The some line is the same as for cpu, the time in which at least one task
is stalled on the resource.  In the case of memory, this includes waiting
on swap-in, page cache refaults and page reclaim.

The full line, however, indicates time in which *nobody* is using the CPU
productively due to pressure: all non-idle tasks are waiting for memory in
one form or another.  Significant time spent in there is a good trigger
for killing things, moving jobs to other machines, or dropping incoming
requests, since neither the jobs nor the machine overall are making too
much headway.

The io file is similar to memory.  Because the block layer doesn't have a
concept of hardware contention right now (how much longer is my IO request
taking due to other tasks?), it reports CPU potential lost on all IO
delays, not just the potential lost due to competition.

		FAQ

Q: How is PSI's CPU component different from the load average?

A: There are several quirks in the load average that make it hard to
   impossible to tell how overcommitted the CPU really is.

   1. The load average is reported as a raw number of active tasks.
      You need to know how many CPUs there are in the system, how many
      CPUs the workload is allowed to use, then think about what the
      proportion between load and the number of CPUs mean for the
      tasks trying to run.

      PSI reports the percentage of wallclock time in which tasks are
      waiting for a CPU to run on. It doesn't matter how many CPUs are
      present or usable. The number always tells the quality of life
      of tasks in the system or in a particular cgroup.

   2. The shortest averaging window is 1m, which is extremely coarse,
      and it's sampled in 5s intervals. A *lot* can happen on a CPU in
      5 seconds. This *may* be able to identify persistent long-term
      trends and very clear and obvious overloads, but it's unusable
      for latency spikes and more subtle overutilization.

      PSI's shortest window is 10s. It also exports the cumulative
      stall times (in microseconds) of synchronously recorded events.

   3. On Linux, the load average for historical reasons includes all
      TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE tasks. This gives a broader sense of how
      busy the system is, but on the flipside it doesn't distinguish
      whether tasks are likely to contend over the CPU or IO - which
      obviously requires very different interventions from a sys admin
      or a job scheduler.

      PSI reports independent metrics for CPU and IO. You can tell
      which resource is making the tasks wait, but in conjunction
      still see how overloaded the system is overall.

Q: What's the cost / performance impact of this feature?

A: PSI's primary cost is in the scheduler, in particular task wakeups
   and sleeps.

   I benchmarked this code using Facebook's two most scheduling
   sensitive workloads: memcache and webserver. They handle a ton of
   small requests - lots of wakeups and sleeps with little actual work
   in between - so they tend to be canaries for scheduler regressions.

   In the tests, the boxes were handling live traffic over the course
   of several hours. Half the machines, the control, ran with
   CONFIG_PSI=n.

   For memcache I used eight machines total. They're 2-socket, 14
   core, 56 thread boxes. The test runs for half the test period,
   flips the test and control kernels on the hardware to rule out HW
   factors, DC location etc., then runs the other half of the test.

   For the webservers, I used 32 machines total. They're single
   socket, 16 core, 32 thread machines.

   During the memcache test, CPU load was nopsi=78.05% psi=78.98% in
   the first half and nopsi=77.52% psi=78.25%, so PSI added between
   0.7 and 0.9 percentage points to the CPU load, a difference of
   about 1%.

   UPDATE: I re-ran this test with the v3 version of this patch set
   and the CPU utilization was equivalent between test and control.

   UPDATE: v4 is on par with v3.

   As far as end-to-end request latency from the client perspective
   goes, we don't sample those finely enough to capture the requests
   going to those particular machines during the test, but we know the
   p50 turnaround time in this workload is 54us, and perf bench sched
   pipe on those machines show nopsi=5.232666 us/op and psi=5.587347
   us/op, so this doesn't add much here either.

   The profile for the pipe benchmark shows:

        0.87%  sched-pipe  [kernel.vmlinux]    [k] psi_group_change
        0.83%  perf.real   [kernel.vmlinux]    [k] psi_group_change
        0.82%  perf.real   [kernel.vmlinux]    [k] psi_task_change
        0.58%  sched-pipe  [kernel.vmlinux]    [k] psi_task_change

   The webserver load is running inside 4 nested cgroup levels. The
   CPU load with both nopsi and psi kernels was indistinguishable at
   81%.

   For comparison, we had to disable the cgroup cpu controller on the
   webservers because it added 4 percentage points to the CPU% during
   this same exact test.

   Versions of this accounting code now run on 80% of our fleet. None
   of our workloads have reported regressions during the rollout.

This patch (of 9):

If we keep just enough refault information to match the *current* page
cache during reclaim time, we could lose a lot of events when there is
only a temporary spike in non-cache memory consumption that pushes out all
the cache.  Once cache comes back, we won't see those refaults.  They
might not be actionable for LRU aging, but we want to know about them for
measuring memory pressure.

 sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Fixes: c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

Bahamut's Boon of Undectability

The ride back to Waterdeep is a long one, and Ivor falls into a deep
sleep. Wondering through a dream like Neverwinter finds himself in front
of a familiar hooded elder.

"I owe you thanks, without [the party] we would have been powerless
to prevent Tiamat's ascension - for it is only mortals who have the
luxury to defy prophecy."

Ivor glances at the sun, still fixed in endless twilight - the crops of
the Sword case are slowly dying.

"Yes - your work is not done. But the planes can be restored to their
natural order - your bigger concern should be the keeper of history you
broke out of eternal imprisonment."

Ivor's heart sank.

"Still young mortal, my thanks you have. What would you claim as your
reward?".

Ivor paused, he could feel himself getting tired - and not the sort that
could be solved by a good night's sleep. Thinking of Rakshasas that
come back to hunt you again and again after deaths, of terrifying
spiders forged of blades  that hunt from across planes - but mostly of a
world perpetually in need of aid, the answer became clear.

"When all this is over, I wish to retire in peace to a simple life
where none but my true friends may find me."

Bahmut's smiled. So shall it be, that you take the title of Ivor the
Imperceptible.

#### Thursday 2021-07-01 11:12:19 by Ethan Tuttle

Add sshpass Formula.  Don't judge! Read the commit message ->

HEY, don't use sshpass[1]!  Also, this is a private Tap, what are you
doing here?  :)

Strange but true: Homebrew[2] essentially requires that Taps are
hosted on an ssh remote (as opposed to local FS), and this repo was
the simplest solution.  I know the Ansible docs say something
contradictory. If you don't believe me, try it for your self. I've
exceeded my yak shaving / rabbit holes allowed for the task I'm on by
about 10 yaks already.

I'm pushing this at a moment when there is a higher-than-normal
probability that someone might look at my github profile.  Seeing this
commit, anyone who knows anything about ssh or sshpass would make some
conclusions.  I would, anyway.

Sshpass is EVEN WORSE than the TOFU that ssh is made of.  How did you
catch me committing this "Formula" to my "Tap"?  I have an excuse!

I agree with Homebrew's decision to not host sshpass. Homebrew has
high standards for security of the packages in their repos. I benefit
from those standards every day.  Meanwhile, sshpass intentionally
loosens security to the point of "unacceptably bad". Nevertheless,
there is one situation (I can think of) where its short-term use
could be justified.  And I'm one.

Because I am going use this ill-advised software, and I am a
responsible adult, it means I also have to read the code and make sure
the code I read is the code I compile and use.  Homebrew provides a
great system for doing that, since it remembers the source artifact by
SHA-256. This is the 2nd time in my life I've had to read the sshpass
code, so I'm going through this extra extra step to persist a code
review bookmark -- this commit --  and I should never have to read the
code a third time.

Ansible is the tool I'm using for automation, and here is what it says
if you try to automate machines using ssh passwords:  (emphasis mine)

> con3 | FAILED! => {
>     "msg": "to use the 'ssh' connection type with passwords,
>             **you must install the sshpass program**"
> }

So, my situation: I got a handful of el cheapo VPS servers from a new
provider. So cheap, hard to pass up.  However: initial access to the
servers is provided _only_ by `ssh root@<ip>`, using per-server
passwords. That were emailed to me.

F'n hot potato this sshpass thing!  You could say the blame falls on
the provider, or on Ansible, or on Homebrew, or on me for going along
with it.  But in any case, *I* have to read the sshpass source,
compile/install it, use ansible to modify the cluster to not use ssh
passwords, uninstall sshpass, on top of: commit ths Formula to my
private Tap so I can skip the 1st step next time. Oh, and write this
message to defend what I'm doing.

Update office-365-migration-best-practices.md

Hi Friends,
I have got something new for third party application about exchange migration. May be it helps more like other tools discuss here like bcchub, BitTitan, Transvault, Quest another vendor tools. It is also a third party software. I think, we should also get a chance of this software for user help, which really want to use such a tool. I have my own experience about this tool. 
Hope you all my friends agree with my views. 
Thanks

Create Bill Division

Two friends Anna and Brian, are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. Each will only pay for the items they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion. You must determine if his calculation is correct.

For example, assume the bill has the following prices: bill = [2, 4, 6] . Anna declines to eat item k = bill[2] which costs 6. If Brian calculates the bill correctly, Anna will pay (2+4)/2 = 3 . If he includes the cost of bill[2] , he will calculate (2+4+6)/2 = 6 . In the second case, he should refund 3 to Anna.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

net/tstun: remove multi-case selects from hot code

Every TUN Read went through several multi-case selects.
We know from past experience with wireguard-go that these are slow
and cause scheduler churn.

The selects served two purposes: they separated errors from data and
gracefully handled shutdown. The first is fairly easy to replace by sending
errors and data over a single channel. The second, less so.

We considered a few approaches: Intricate webs of channels,
global condition variables. They all get ugly fast.

Instead, let's embrace the ugly and handle shutdown ungracefully.
It's horrible, but the horror is simple and localized.

Added a few things to make the experience a little better

Updates Include:
---

- [X] Added a button that will use the browsers native TTS to read the prompt for you.  Sometimes you get peoples names or places you have never heard of before that you might not know how to pronounce, so this helps A LOT
- [X] Fixed a few issues with how the rendering of what you spoke on the screen works.  This still needs some love, but far better than nothing at all.
- [X] Added suggested code to audio.py that prevents incorrect clipping or recordings
