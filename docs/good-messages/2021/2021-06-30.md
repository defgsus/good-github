chore(dotfiles): make pulling a bit less annoying

I have `branch.autosetuprebase` set to "local" which means that
local branches (ie. not tracking remote branches) will automatically
get `branch.<name>.rebase` set to true.  That means that if I am on
`feature` that tracks `main` and do `git pull` or `git merge main`, I'll
get a rebase. In practice this is what I want, but I never actually do
`git merge main`... I just do `git rebase main`. Whatever...

The thing that has been annoying me is the `branch.main.rebase` and
`branch.master.rebase` setting to "true" in the top-level git config.
This means that when I am in the common case of running `git pull` on
the checked out "main" branch with a dirty worktree, the darn thing says
"can't rebase with changes", and I don't even want to do a rebase; I
want to do a `--ff-only` merge and if it can't be a fast-forward I want
Git to tell me about it so I can deal with it. (For my typical case, I
usually can do a fast-forward merge with no conflicts.)

So, remove the unwanted defaults, and set `pull.ff` to "only" so that it
knows that I want `git pull` to imply `--ff-only`, which I basically
always do (if I didn't, I would just `git fetch` and `git merge` or even
`git merge --no-ff`). Basically, just want to optimize for the common
case.

How did the unwanted defaults sneak in there? Well, the
`branch.main.rebase = true` crept in in 0eb0e95d5e527f7d2b ("refactor:
make "main" the default branch", June 6, 2021); ie. only a month ago. I
can't remember if I unthinkingly did it by hand, but I believe I
probably did, because I didn't pause to consider the implications.

The other one `branch.master.rebase = true` dates way back to
c15c96d53dd2c2 ("Git: set branch.master.rebase to true", March 9, 2012).
Preferences and workflows change, I guess ðŸ¤£ â€” and more likely, I don't
know if `pull.ff` existed back then, which is what I really would have
wanted.

ODROID N2/N2+ mainline U-boot; use common boot-meson64.cmd instead of n2-specific bootscript.
- Armbian already had all the FIP-magic needed.
- Small hack into boot-meson64.cmd to handle u-boot vs kernel: n2_plus vs n2-plus DTB/FDT naming mismatch
  - overrides the default $fdtfile based on $variant
  - armbianEnv still has final say if $fdtfile is set there (it isn't for n2/n2plus)
- remove now unneeded n2 bootscripts, since we'll be using boot-meson64.cmd
- Extra:
  - remove unused C4 bootscript (just a delete, it was unused before this commit already)
  - comments about FIP trees being identical across N2/N2Plus and C4/HC4.
  - change governor to performance; should make N2 more stable
  - none of this solves any USB3 related problems, sorry.

remove syntax arming, but protect macro-expansion operations

Syntax arming and disarming was part of a design to allow sandboxing
untrusted code without unduly constraining the sandboxed code. Unsafe
operations --- or operations that would otherwise break invariants
within a trusted library --- can be protected by not exporting them or
by using `protect-out` on an export, and such protected bindings
cannot be referenced dierctly in sandboxed programs. But it's common
for macros to expand to (suitably guarded) uses of unsafe or
unexported bindings. Sandboxed programs need to be able to use those
macros, even though expansions refer to bindings that cannot be
referenced directly by the sandboxed program.

To make that combination work, quoted syntax objects that appear in a
macro retain a right to access the same bindings that would be allowed
in the enclosing module. This system of protected bindings and
quoted-syntax access is working, as far as we can tell, EXCEPT for
some cases when untrusted code uses `expand`, `local-expand,` and
variants. Some trusted macros and tools need to force expansions and
rearrange the result, as in the `class` macro or the errortrace
library, which is why such facilties exist. The danger is that
portions of the expansion can be extracted, with permissions intact on
the extracted part, and then abused by untrusted programs.

Syntax "arming" was an attempt to close that hole by distinguishing
trusted and untrusted uses of expanded code, revoking permissions on
an identifier by tainting it when extracted from an expansion by an
untrusted party. The tricky part has been drawing the line between
trusted and untrusted uses through a mixture of inferred and explicit
boundaries. Explicit boundaries usually involve `syntax-protect`. Long
story short, experience has shown that it's difficult to remember to
use `syntax-protect` consistently enough, and we have not been able to
enlarge the role of inference enough to close the hole.

This commit tries a simpler approach, which is to discard the complex
arming system and instead just protect operations like `local-expand`
that force macro expansions. Protecting `syntax-local` makes a sandbox
less flexible: it prevents running an untrusted module in a sandbox
when the module implements its own macros with `local-expand`,
`syntax-local-value`, and some related expansion-time operations. Most
macros do not need those facilities, however, so most modules would
still work in a sandbox. Meanwhile, sandboxed modules can still use
macros that use those faciltiies and that are implemented in trusted
modules.

A slightly different approach is used for the `expand` family of
functions, which are not used by macros, but are instead for debugging
and exploration. Each of those functions now takes an additional
inspector argument that defaults to `(current-inspector)`; the that
inspector is not the original one, then the result of expansion is
preemptively tainted, so identifiers in the expansion cannot be used.
(Syntax objects that are included in syntax-error exceptions are also
tainted that way, as they were before this commit.) So, `expand` can
still be used in a sandbox to explore expansions without necessarily
accessing bindings that are referenced in the expansion.

This change does not entirely remove the burden for implementing
modules that are intended to be trusted. Instead of requiring a
careful use of `syntax-protect` on macro expansions, the problem is
narrowed to using `local-expand` and related functions correctly, as
well as protecting any exports that would expose the capabilities of
`local-expand`. Non-protected exports that expose `local-expand` are
rare, in contrast to macros that lack `syntax-protect`. Another
benefit is that tools and macros that manipulate expansions no longer
need to use `syntax-disarm` and `syntax-rearm`, which was painful and
error-prone.

The functions `syntax-protect`, `syntax-arm`, `syntax-disarm`, and
`syntax-rearm` are still available, but they now just return the given
syntax object unmodified. The 'taint-mode and 'certify-mode
syntax-object properties are no longer specifically recognized by the
expander.

adapt to new testhat

Some tests such as

  accyBurstMatlab <- c(-0.3144531, ETC
  expect_equal(d1[["accelerometery", "burst"]][1:10], accyBurstMatlab, scale=1, tolerance=1e-6)

started to fail with testthat-3.0.3, and the pattern seems to be that
the last digit is off by a value or two.  But I also notice that
expect_equal() seems to treat the 'scale' differently, and I don't
actually see it in the docs anymore, so I dropped that.

I went through all tests that started making errors and fixed them all
up, usually by changing a tolerance of, say 1e-6 to 3e-6 or so.  That
seems to work in pretty much all cases, I think.  But, the thing is:
these are just test of consistency, not real tests against theory.  And,
frankly, I don't even know what rounding rules were in place when I made
the tests.  I think in every case, the changes are down below realistic
limits in terms of data.

I did not have to change every test.  My impression is that this partly
has to do with, well, the *scale*.  In some cases, I just multiplied to
make the computed value and the reference value both be of order 1, and
then tests worked out to the digits I had used before.

None of this is interesting enough for me to worry about it.  I trust
the testthat authors are doing things reasonably, switching between the
two schemes appropriately ... because that's another new wrinkle.

However, I really like how testthat is now more stringent.  For example,
it won't convert POSIXct and POSIXlt things to be in the same subclass,
and that revealed an inconsistency, in which `met` subclass data were
using POSIXlt, in contrast to (I think) pretty much every other
subclass.

I think the new testthat found a few other consistencies, but I didn't
bother making detailed notes. Basically, I think it's good, and I hope
the CRAN machines won't (whenever we re-submit oce) be using different
versions that are inconsistent.  I guess we'll see.

NOTE: this "new" testthat is only 2 weeks old, but it *is* on CRAN, and
it must be one of the most-used packages on CRAN, so I don't think it's
a risk to rely on the new version, as oce now does.

remove syntax arming, but protect macro-expansion operations

Summary:

Syntax arming and disarming was part of a design to allow sandboxing
untrusted code without unduly constraining the sandboxed code. This
commit replaces them with a simpler approach. The trade-off is that
some advanced macro-implementation tools, such as `syntax-local-value`
and `local-expand`, cannot be referenced directly within a sandbox
(i.e., in a context where the code inspector is different than the
original ones).

Long version:

Unsafe operations --- or operations that would otherwise break
invariants within a trusted library --- can be protected by not
exporting them or by using `protect-out` on an export, and such
protected bindings cannot be referenced dierctly in sandboxed
programs. But it's common for macros to expand to (suitably guarded)
