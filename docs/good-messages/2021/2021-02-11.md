New Perks

-Humble Cleanser, a new perk for people from Aquia Fria, janitors, vectors, and primes adds 0.5 inspiration every time to clean a cleanable object, given jobs and backgrounds who would focus such things incentive to do it.
-Green Thumb, a new perk for gardeners, vectors, primes, and people from Neapolis. If you examine a plant you can learn all the information from it due to experience, as if using a plant scanner.
-New litany in the Vitae section for church jobs. Speaking it increases the growth and function of plants who hear your words. How's it work? Good question.
-Some background/origin descriptions updated to fit the new perks granted.
-Some origins granted state adjustments, primarily those who previously only granted perks.

fix this bug

This bot is awsome.but now its creating errors.when i tried to translate it showing

`Bot internal error,please contact administrators.'

then sentence i tried to translate

`My name is Angélica Summer, I am 12 years old and I am Canadian. 5 years ago my family and I moved to the south of France. My father, Frank Summer, is a mechanic; he loves vintage cars and collects miniature cars.

My mother's name is Emilie Summer; she is a nurse in a hospital not far from our house. We moved to France, because she has always loved the culture of this country.

Life in France is very different from that in Canada. It is always hot here. Every Sunday we go to the beautiful Biarritz beach and buy ice cream after swimming in the sea.

The French are very friendly and welcoming. We speak French when we are outside, at school or at the market. However, we still speak English at home as my parents don't want me to lose my native language.`



i didnt saw any specific errors in logs...can you please fix it..and open an issue tab for bug reporting.kindly close this pull request after you read.thank you

Added some features to the animator and polished the UI

yeah it's pretty cool, pretty rad if I do say to myself and it's actually really nice that you're reading this little commit-message and shows that you're a person with good karma! Hope you live long and don't become a dung-beetle or whatever due to a bad caste or whatever that Hindu cock-slammering bullwash is and if you're wondering I am totally not just writing whatever I come up with and the fact that you're insinuating that I put no effort into this message makes me actually hope now that you become a dung-beetle you hogwash piece of garbage.
