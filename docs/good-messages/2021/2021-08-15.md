update to 47182, properly fix wl0 httpd status bug

- turns out for some reason re-adding the
        nvram_set("wl0_ifname", "ra0");

 didn't really fix the issue. i learned this today as i was dealing with
 assfuck's stupid async commit "feature".

 anyways, i fixed it properly now and i tested it by restoring from
 defaults. it should now for sure be fixed. the previous attempt should
 have fixed it, but assfuck has a tendency to fuck around for fun.

- introducing the new "async_commit" fuckaround feature by mr assfuck
himself. where he forks an nvram system call to somehow compensate for
"slow flash". i'm pretty sure the benefit to the MT7621 is nil because
the SPI is more than fast enough, but no matter.

i've tested this build personally, and everything is good to go, enjoy.

again open a ticket if there's a bug or issue.

small README fix + additional note on 47182

just wanted to note that i reverted the ramcode on 47182 to what
@hanwckf is using. i noticed that it would randomly drop the download
speed when you're connected for a while. so just wnated to make mention
of that.

"Sure we'd be happy to take your money. Yup, just go to our Kickstarter
page... Okay nice idiot, Uh-huh fuck you, bye bye."

and "from one redskin to another, go fuck yourself!"

Change penalty for Infidel casting spells without the Amulet of Yendor in inventory.

As part of an incentive to have Infidels not want to drop the Amulet of
Yendor, I had made it so spells couldn't be cast at all if they didn't
have the AoY in their possession (pre Idol of Moloch being imbued). An
idea positied by aosdict was instead of suppressing spell casting
altogether, have it behave like how blood magic works in other variants
- drain hit points instead of spell power. This is a better fit with the
whole Infidel narrative - using Moloch's magic isn't good for anyone,
and having the Amulet with you prevents using Moloch's magic from
killing you. I don't refer to this as actual 'blood magic', just that
the player's life force can be drained (and can die from this if they
aren't careful).

Another thing I did in this commit, was to fix some minor details with
illithid's psychic wave ability. Even though it behaves like a spell
(casting it, energy use), it's technically not a spell and shouldn't be
considered as one. So any effects from having the Amulet in the player's
possession shouldn't affect using psychic abilities.

Update README.md

The FIS Alpine Skiing Championship is a well-loved sports tournament for athletes in skiing to compete with each other in the spirit of sports. It had brought great joy for athletes, coaches, and people all over the world.
In the past, the storing of data of each tournament season is done entirely on paper. However, as society has progressed, this method of storing data is no longer viable. The risks that come with physical text databases are simply unacceptable for such a large worldwide sports tournament.
In this assignment, we chose to develop an entirely new, computer-backed database for FIS Alpine Skiing Championship. It makes storing information such as player data or team data much easier.
New data can be easily inserted or removed without the complicity of a text-based database. Also, the database system is well-designed so we believe a lot of new things about the championship can be learned by our team.

Huge progress...Huge...YUGE...well, maybe not, I'm happy with it.
Managed to sort out the menu madness I'd been suffering, and now have
browseByCategory() returning a Restaurant. Not just *any* restaurant,
mind you - THE APPROPRIATE RESTAURANT. I bet *you* don't care... do you
even *read* these commit messages? I don't care, to hell with all of
ya's I got it returning a Restaurant and I can die happy. Assuming that
lockdown persists I may well die. If I do, I leave myself and HD in my
own will. Kinda like MakeAWish(TM). Do it. Do it for the kids.

Update README.md

This is an inspirational movie of a poor guy achieving the dream of being a football player. 
Santiago was poor and he was a illegal immigrant from Mexico to USA, He helped his father in his work. He has a dream of being a foot ball player. He saved money in his shoe to buy football kit. His grandmother is also a great football player. He was so poor that he used pair of cardboard pieces as shin guards. 
One fine day, while he was playing the game, He was noticed by Glen Foy, he is an ex football player, Glen promises Santiago that he will set up a meeting with New castle manager. Glen tells Santiago that if he can go to England he will be given a chance to play for new castle united. His grandmother sells off part of her jewellery for his ticket from US to Mexico and from Mexico to London as he was a illegal immigrant. 
In his first match at England he didn’t play well. Glen manages to convince the manager saying that he was nervous and jetlagged. Santiago passed medical test by lying about his asthma. He uses a inhaler, which was crushed by a team-mate in a match, due to this he didn’t play further matches well and he was removed from the club.
On his way to airport he meets Harris in a Taxi, Gavin Harris was a part of new castle team. Harris tries to convince team manager to allow Santiago some more time in the new castle team. He gets confident and plays well in the game . He was a substitute in the match against Fulham. He helped team to win the match by a penalty goal. His weakness was that he doesn’t pass on the ball. Santiago transferred back to the reserve and he was demotivated and he gets a call that his father got expired, His heart broken but he decided not to go back but wanted to stay back and play the match. 
In the final minute Santiago pass on the ball to Harris, He corrected his draw back. Harris decided Santiago to kick the goal. He finally kicks the goal and New castle team wins the match. He finally achieves his dream. 

Learning’s:
1.	Even if you’re poor don’t stop dreaming big, Put your efforts.
2.	Try to be strong against all the odds, Don’t lose hope
3.	Be confident about your-self 
4.	Try to work on your weaknesses don’t get demotivated 
5.	 Believe in yourself one day you will achieve the impossible

"1:45pm. Ok, that phase is done.

What I've done here will partly make up for the lack of autocomplete. Nice.

Let do some work as a part of the job hunt. I'll see whether I can track down a few recruiters and ask them to look at the resume.

https://hubblehq.com/blog/the-definitive-list-of-recruiters-for-building-your-startups-tech-team

Some of the sites they are linking seem like Turing except non scummy.

https://www.honeypot.io/

Let me give this site a try.

2:05pm. Damn, this stupid site does not allow remove. Ptu.

Let me move on to the next.

https://www.topresume.com/resume-review

Let me take advantage of this. This is exactly what I've been looking for.

2:10pm. https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/ask-amanda-resume-ats-readability

> ATS-friendly resume test 1: Save your resume in plain text

I knew this was a good idea. I am happy this article agrees.

Hmmmm...what would be the biggest problem with my resume? I am going to change it up a bit and say I spent the last six and a half years working at a startup. Why would a starup let me work on a compiler, random ML things and so on? I have no idea. But I should bullshit something to get past the initial screening.

2:15pm. https://resumeworded.com/

This is an AI powered checker. It is complaining that it can't find the work experience section.

Ok, let me add it. I see that I've won't get far without this.

2:20pm. Ok, I can't. I just can't lie about it.

2:30pm.

```
--- Work Experience

* 2015-2021: 6.5 years

At the start of this period my only skill was a rank 3 score in imperative programming owing to my programming experience in school a decade ago. Since then I’ve spent all this time training myself up. I’ve gone through courses, studied ML, worked on a ML library, worked on an innovative programming language, made a GPU based deep learning library in it and did some RL using that, studied dependently typed programming, made a better version of the programming language, worked on various RL agents using the new language. Along with an assortment of minor projects such as that game library port. I hadn’t actually done paid work during this period, but there is no chance that paid work would have been as hard as it.

--- Notable Achievements

* Champion

While I was in middle school back in 2002, I was the national programming champion of Croatia in two different categories. Looking at the wins in hindsight, I realize I won these without having much skill.

Link (Basic): https://hsin.hr/dmih02/rezultati/osnovnoskolska_skupina/basic_pascal.html
```

Let me do this like so. Let me try passing this into the review system.

2:35pm. Forget this useless AI review.

Let me take a short break. After that I'll do a LinkedIn profile.

2:55pm. Let me remove the last two sentences from both of the sections. I do not want to appear defensive or arrogant. So what if I haven't done paid work. Best if they do not know that.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ7UhxIh8JY_-PLuMqtDFQbTLo3U94EoGaY5QW1jHn7X72F3zoNuj_2hXpHlSJ0Z3__cr1EGCHnCmn0/pub

I've reread the resume and it feels fine to me. Ok.

Forget getting a recruiter to review it. What I really needed was just that small work experience section. I used to have it in the other resume, but instead of a quarter of a page, it was 15 pages long.

3:15pm. LinkedIn is such a confusing mess. Why is it so insistent at having me write down a company I work for?

3:25pm. How many damn times am I going to have to write a summary of myself.

```
Active since 2015 as a programmer. Main achievement is creating the Spiral language for the sake of making an GPU-based ML library, and then making the library. Skills in compilers, machine learning, reinforcement learning, concurrency and GPU programming, as well as making UIs.
```

Let me make this my summary.

3:40pm. The site is so annoying.

3:45pm. Ok, forget LinkedIn.

3:50pm. https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language

Oh, lol, it shows up as 90% Cython.

3:55pm. Ok, there is a point in standing out in ATS systems, but I am never going to beat out other people that way even if I go that route. I'll want to apply at companies who have people reading the applications personally.

https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/538071/back-end-developer-integrations-jibble

This is what a low end job would look like for me. The salary range is 1/3rd of what it should be, but if nobody else wants me I'll have to apply to places like this. In fact, I will for diversity.

4pm. Well, either way, if I wanted to make 40k a year, it would be faster to go this route than trying to become a good gambler even if that would not be as badass.

4:15pm. There are actually a lot of remote jobs on offer. 102 pages.

https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?tl=f%23

F# jobs are quite rare. The one open job is limited remote.

4:25pm. https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/527424/senior-c-sharp-developer-worldwide-remote-duckduckgo?so=i&pg=1&offset=0&r=true&tl=.net

This job has the ideal compensation range as far as I am concerned. It won't get any better than this.

4:55pm.

///

The VS Code plugin for the Spiral language, you can easily try it out in the editor. It comes bundled with the language compiler. It is written in F#, uses Hopac internally and uses ZeroMQ to communicate with the VS Code editor.

Moving from a single-pass compiler to a professionally done product had many challenges. The problem is that when the user edits a file, the tokenization and parsing need to be redone from that point onward, and typechecking is affected for all downstream files that depend on it. Making the plugin reactive to changes as the user types while dealing with the complexity of the language was no easy task.

I had to try out all kinds of concurrency patterns to get it to work. Trying to model the domain as communicating servers or reactive pipelines failed and the solution was to implement diffing in an immutable, concurrent manner. It took me months to figure out and then master the particular design pattern.

Making a programming language that can compile code is one challenge, but what I undertook in Spiral v2 was a tour through the concurrency landscape. The challenge of concurrency lies in the shadow of regular programming, but it is what makes the difference between a toy and a professional product.

This experience is notable because many domains require reactive updates and this exercise made me capable of dealing with them.

///

5:25pm.

///

Would you be interested in using F# alongside C#? Concurrency libraries like Rx and Hopac library work better with it.

The point on WPF knowledge makes me think you have a legacy app that needs maintenance, but that does not matter as all the reactive programming patterns I know are UI library agnostic, but are more easily expressed in a functional language.

///

I am trying to think of some other question for them.

Actually this DuckDuckGo job is a particularly good fit for my skills.

5:35pm. Ah screw it. Let me just go with this. All I am interested in is knowing whether I can use my favorite toys.

5:40pm. I see that this company has a backend engineer role as well which pays 10% better.

https://duckduckgo.com/assets/hiring/how_we_hire.pdf

Here is its hiring policy.

6:05pm. Done with lunch.

I actually forgot that I clicked the submit button.

This is a bit exciting. It is fun thinking I could get a job that would make me in a month what a regular job here would take a year.

> Growing our team is crucial to advancing our vision of raising the standard of trust online.

> We have a unique opportunity to show the world that protecting privacy is simple and drive a major change in how the Internet is used. There is so much we want to build! To accomplish this, we need to add to our team of hardworking, self-motivated people who share our vision.

> We know hiring works best when it’s a two-way street — we want you to be able to make a well-informed decision (along with us). That's why our hiring process includes touchpoints that help you get to know our company culture and envision what to expect in your future role at DuckDuckGo.

> Our hiring process generally consists of six stages, including two paid projects (or up to three for higher level roles), and usually takes anytime from several weeks to a couple of months, depending on how fast each stage is completed:

Two paid projects. That could be interesting.

6:20pm. Maybe it would not mean much to anybody else, but I've been doing unpaid projects for 6.5 years.

> For example, every engineering candidate's first test project includes sharing an example of a significant project they led or contributed to. Because all roles at DuckDuckGo require autonomous project management, no matter how impressive a candidate's engineering skills are, DuckDuckGo wouldn't be the best fit if they struggle with project management.

Surpringly, this is not a problem for me anymore. Applying to this job would have been beyond my reach in 2015. Or even before I learned my concurrency skills. But now I can take whatever they throw at me. I can manage myself in any domain imaginable.

Yeah, I am ready to be a pro. The 6.5 years of effort haven't been in vain.

6:35pm. The first challenge is to get an interview, the second is to actually pass it.

Right now though, what I've been struggling is the first, but who knows when my luck will change.

6:55pm. Let me close here for today. It is time to chill."

rough fix for linux serial clients hanging while talking to nrf52 cdc serial

Problem statement:
Sometimes characters written from the nrf52 pseudo serial device to a linux
host would stop showing up on the linux app side.  This occurred randomly
but typically within a few minutes after starting a session.

The reading from linux
would remain 'hung' until you type a character on the linux side (thus
doing a new write TOWARDS the nrf52).

Theory: it seemed like something was getting hung on the linux side waiting
on a response to a read.  This led me to this code.  If I changed the code
to always send a response to any read from ep_in (rather than opting to not
send a response at all in some circumstances), "screen" apps stopped hanging.

Notes:
* problem reproducable with 'screen /dev/ttyACM0 921600' or other serial
clients (I initially used the meshtastic-python app)
* It is a _long_ time since I've messed with USB code and my analysis is
probably pretty sloppy here.  But I wanted it report it upstream in case
it is useful for others.  If there is a better fix for this problem (likely)
I'd love to change to it.

mqueue: don't use kmalloc with KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE

KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is not a good threshold.  It is extremely high and
problematic.  Unfortunately, some silly drivers depend on this and we
can't change it.  But any new code needn't use such extreme ugly high
order allocations.  It brings us awful fragmentation issues and system
slowdown.

Game: made card decorations draggable onto card for MemoryFathersDay

Completed another memory! Woo!

This one is a creative card decoration activity inspired by Cooking Mama's pizza decoration sessions on the Nintendo. The draggable function was a pain to implement with all the card decorations I have, but I got it to work (best part).

At the beginning, I was trying to figure out whether I should just use jQuery UI for this memory to implement the draggable functions. However, if I went with this method, other issues would arise, such as the inability for the user to take a screenshot of the canvas after their card is decorated, and the difficulty of limiting movement of the draggable items within the card found inside the p5 canvas. Anyways, at the end, I think it was the right decision to use Daniel Shiffman's draggable function that can be used inside p5.

Building work

BUILDING WORK
note: Chaos Buildings could do with more work but it's acceptable for them to be overpowered in the next release. Will revise them if time permits.

*Reversed some legacy troop inflation on vanilla buildings
*Adjusted Chaos Dwarf buildings (downwards) to be closer value to vanilla
* Tweaked Imperial Castle buildings after discovering how new firearms are in the Empire (1991 IC)
* Set up new Building lines for Human Temples:
+Templar Barracks replaces Elite Barracks, because Warhammer is full of templar orders running around in heavy armour. Some of them are pikemen because Myrmidia
++ 2nd replacement chaos_barracks fits in here. ++ 2nd replacement, Djinni Treasure Trove for Ormazdic Group (they shouldn't have a lot of Heavy Infantry)
++ 2nd replacement Fenbeasts for Old Faith
++ 2nd replacement Grave Guard for Necromantic Group. Technically this is the vanilla Elite Barracks but we get to show the lore and can apply a special is_active_trigger
++ 2nd replacement Sons of Stromfels for Stromfels. Whatever.
+ Zealots replace Temple Barracks
++ 2nd replacement Crypt Ghouls for Necromantic
+ Morr's Garden replaces Library. (Note that the lore suggests education becoming less religious across the Old World, so a Temple School is pretty old hat. The Garden allows for lore on the necromantic threat.)
++ 2nd replace Apprentice Necromancers for Necromantic Group
* Converted Estalian "special buildings" to Great Works
* Added some port upgrades for Human City great work
* Threw out some obsolete Dark & High Elf building definitions. (This stuff would need reworking even in the unlikely event that we bring them back.)

+FIXES
* Saw Witch Hunters failing to burn their victims. Corrected typo in witch hunter events. Observed behavior still a bit wonky but heretics are getting burned.
* Allow construction of new Dwarf Holds. The scripts have at least seen a lot of alpha-testing at this point, and allowing somewhat free construction should make for better feedback
* Red Duke set to a plausible age for a dude who fought in the Crusades. His mortal family has been deleted because there ain't no way those ladies were around in this time frame. (Duke himself shouldn't be playing the role he does in the mod but that's a bigger change.)
*Duke Otto of Aquitaine moved to D'Aquitaine dynasty (same as Red Duke, because he's very likely one of the vampire's descendants)
*Switch Aquitaine to Primogeniture Succession to prevent Red Duke being heir (this seems to be more accurate than Seniority anyway)
*Add setup event to make the modern d'Aquitaines members of the Red Duke bloodline
* Fixed up some localisation
* Akendorf special building removed. No replacement wonder because it's a village of less than a thousand people.

remove howler spatial plugin

it fucks shit up!!! audio on chrome sounds all muffled. not actually using this functionality for my purposes anyway so this is an ez solution.
a more ideal solution would be for lime to add a way to choose between stereo and spatial panners & not make spatial the default lol, but i have no idea what the friendliest way to do this is
