New data: 2021-04-02. See data notes.

Revise historical data: cases (ON, QC, SK).

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “5 new deaths, for a total of 10,681 deaths: 1 death in the last 24 hours, 3 deaths between March 26 and March 31, 1 death before March 26.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

fix #142

So the problem was kinda deeply nested than I expected.

The first thing to notice is that there are cases when we can't find a
cache in `CthulhuInterpreter.opt`.
AFAIU this is mainly because of limited frames; the native interpreter
doesn't cache them but there are still statement infos about them and
so the problem happens if a Cthulhu user tries to inspect it.

When trying to inspect uncached frames, the next problem is how to
handle them at pre-optimization phase. The `slottypes` of them would be
`nothing` at that point, and so we need to do something like
[what the external `OptimizationState` constructor
does](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/878e1cd52ebf14e8666d8d54a54a95ccee4405d3/base/compiler/optimize.jl#L69-L71).
The another problem is the return types of those frames can be annotated
as `LimitedAccuracy` at that point, and it contains recursive frame
chain
and thus the printer can fail into infinite loop. The same issue happens
when Cthulhu tries to show `CodeInfo` object, which may also contain
`LimitedAccuracy`.

Now this commit addresses the issues outlined above:
- check if a callsite is cached or not, and wrap it into
`UncachedCallInfo` if not,
  and Cthulhu doesn't recurse into the `UncachedCallInfo` (or we can
even
  forcibly recurse into, but I decided not to do that, since it's really
  different behaviour from what the native interpreter did).
  Note that `UncachedCallInfo` won't happen when working on a
pre-optimization state,
  since Cthulhu will cache unoptimized frames by hooking into
  `finish(::InferenceState, ::CthulhuInterpreter)` in that case,
  which caches a frame no matter whether it is limited or not.
- when working on a pre-optimization state, if the return type of a
callsite
  is annotated as `LimitedAccuracy`, we widen it and wrap it into
`LimitedCallInfo`.
  When printing `LimitedCallInfo`, Cthulhu only indicates the call is
limited,
  but won't try to print the whole `LimitedAccuracy` object.
- when working on pre-optimization state, we make sure we don't print
`LimitedAccuracy`
  included in `CodeInfo`. Currently I wrote an naive hack to just copy
  the original `CodeInfo` and widen `LimitedAccuracy`s in
`ssavaluetypes` and `rettype`.

Remove LICENSE header from source files

My friends and other programming gurus on DIscord have been neagging me every
single time I shared my source code with them because of these LICENSE
headers. I thought I was clever with the little ASCII art, but they called that
stuff shit too. Now that the headers are gone, I feel much freer and the code
immediately feels less cluttered. I seriously wonder why I ever started putting
these LICENSE headers in the first place? I have a vague memory of seeing it
being done in the PocketMine-MP source code years ago, and thinking that it was
cool and "professional". I'm not sure if they still do it themselves either.
I should have known better even back then, seeing as it's written in PHP.

Incoming message audio notification implementation

A lot of work went into picking the appropriate library/API. Ideally we
would use something more rusty than OpenAL but I could not find
something better that suited our needs.

* cpal uses ALSA directly. This locks us out of providing audio settings
  on pulseaudio based systems. We could provide the controls with some
  cpal mods to extract a friendly name for our inputs/outputs but
  pulseaudio is not aware of the application anymore. I deemed this
  unacceptable as users expect to see/control application audio in their
  system controls
* SDL didn't work for us since the SDL_Mixer maxes out at 8 streams. If
  we are going to support group audio we have to support an arbitrary
  number of audio streams
* Mozilla's cubeb looked good but did not have a built in mixer. I would
  have liked to look closer at how WebRTC streams are mixed, however
  this did not seem trivial and I started to lose motiviation to look
  further
    * I investigated mixing audio myself and using cubeb, however I
      didn't want to learn different compression algorithms and
      implement in a way that would leverage SSE as well as OpenAL would
* Several other libraries were considered but all had one of the above
  problems associated with them
* OpenAL sys bindings used directly because I do not feel
  experienced/familiar enough to write a good generic OpenAL library.
  Using the C calls specifically for my use case is good enough for now.

The audio manager is modeled around the concept of
channels/sources/streams, whatever name you want to use. We open a
channel that pushes frames of arbitrary size/samplerate into OpenAL
sources. When the channel is dropped the source is closed after the
remaining data is finished playing. This should map cleanly into group
audio calls when we get there as each user can be assigned their own
channel. As users leave/join calls the channels can be added/removed as
needed.

Notification sounds are owned by UI implementations. This is because
notifications are tied to UI state and feel. The choice was made to give
UI the ability to play whatever sound it wants easily. Tocks owns
playing sounds, UI owns which sounds to play.
