Implement ARMv7 support (untested)

ARM Thumb mode is the most evil thing ever conceived from a reverse
engineering point of view. Not only do you (and your disassembler) never
have a goddamn clue when the code is in Thumb mode or not (leading to
confusion and wrongly-disassembled instructions); but then if you want
to hack around with this code and actually interface with it, good luck
with that, because probably half the stuff will be in regular ARM ISA
and the other half will be in Thumb and it's just a giant inconsistent
mess.

You have no idea how happy I am that ARM made the highly intelligent
decision to NOT support the Thumb instruction set(s) in AArch64.
Dropping that shit was the best decision they ever made.

Fuck you PNG

I hate my life and I regret owning a graduation cert at this point.

Remove LICENSE header from source files

My friends and other programming gurus on DIscord have been neagging me every
single time I shared my source code with them because of these LICENSE
headers. I thought I was clever with the little ASCII art, but they called that
stuff shit too. Now that the headers are gone, I feel much freer and the code
immediately feels less cluttered. I seriously wonder why I ever started putting
these LICENSE headers in the first place? I have a vague memory of seeing it
being done in the PocketMine-MP source code years ago, and thinking that it was
cool and "professional". I'm not sure if they still do it themselves either.
I should have known better even back then, seeing as it's written in PHP.

Incoming message audio notification implementation

A lot of work went into picking the appropriate library/API. Ideally we
would use something more rusty than OpenAL but I could not find
something better that suited our needs.

* cpal uses ALSA directly. This locks us out of providing audio settings
  on pulseaudio based systems. We could provide the controls with some
  cpal mods to extract a friendly name for our inputs/outputs but
  pulseaudio is not aware of the application anymore. I deemed this
  unacceptable as users expect to see/control application audio in their
  system controls
* SDL didn't work for us since the SDL_Mixer maxes out at 8 streams. If
  we are going to support group audio we have to support an arbitrary
  number of audio streams
* Mozilla's cubeb looked good but did not have a built in mixer. I would
  have liked to look closer at how WebRTC streams are mixed, however
  this did not seem trivial and I started to lose motiviation to look
  further
    * I investigated mixing audio myself and using cubeb, however I
      didn't want to learn different compression algorithms and
      implement in a way that would leverage SSE as well as OpenAL would
* Several other libraries were considered but all had one of the above
  problems associated with them
* OpenAL sys bindings used directly because I do not feel
  experienced/familiar enough to write a good generic OpenAL library.
  Using the C calls specifically for my use case is good enough for now.

The audio manager is modeled around the concept of
channels/sources/streams, whatever name you want to use. We open a
channel that pushes frames of arbitrary size/samplerate into OpenAL
sources. When the channel is dropped the source is closed after the
remaining data is finished playing. This should map cleanly into group
audio calls when we get there as each user can be assigned their own
channel. As users leave/join calls the channels can be added/removed as
needed.

Notification sounds are owned by UI implementations. This is because
notifications are tied to UI state and feel. The choice was made to give
UI the ability to play whatever sound it wants easily. Tocks owns
playing sounds, UI owns which sounds to play.
