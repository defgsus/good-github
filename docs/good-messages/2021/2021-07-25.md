gdb: make string-like set show commands use std::string variable

String-like settings (var_string, var_filename, var_optional_filename,
var_string_noescape) currently take a pointer to a `char *` storage
variable (typically global) that holds the setting's value.  I'd like to
"mordernize" this by changing them to use an std::string for storage.

An obvious reason is that string operations on std::string are often
easier to write than with C strings.  And they avoid having to do any
manual memory management.

Another interesting reason is that, with `char *`, nullptr and an empty
string often both have the same meaning of "no value".  String settings
are initially nullptr (unless initialized otherwise).  But when setting
them to nothing, they point to an empty string.  For example,
solib_search_path is nullptr at startup, but points to an empty string
after doing "set solib-search-path".  This leads to some code that needs
to check for both to check for "no value".  Or some code that converts
back and forth between NULL and "" when getting or setting the value.  I
find this very error-prone, because it is very easy to forget one or the
other.  With std::string, we at least know that the variable is not
"NULL".  There is only one way of representing an empty string setting,
that is with an empty string.

I was wondering whether the distinction between NULL and "" would be
important for some setting, but it doesn't seem so.  If that ever
happens, it would be more C++-y and self-descriptive to use
optional<string> anyway.

Actually, there's one spot where this distinction mattered, it's in
init_history, for the test gdb.base/gdbinit-history.exp.  init_history
sets the history filename to the default ".gdb_history" if it sees that
the setting was never set - if history_filename is nullptr.  If
history_filename is an empty string, it means the setting was explicitly
cleared, so it leaves it as-is.  With the change to std::string, this
distinction doesn't exist anymore.  This can be fixed by moving the code
that chooses a good default value for history_filename to
_initialize_top.  This is ran before -ex commands are processed, so an
-ex command can then clear that value if needed (what
gdb.base/gdbinit-history.exp tests).

Another small improvement, in my opinion is that we can now easily
give string parameters initial values, by simply initializing the global
variables, instead of xstrdup-ing it in the _initialize function.

In Python and Guile, when registering a string-like parameter, we
allocate (with new) an std::string that is owned by the param_smob (in
Guile) and the parmpy_object (in Python) objects.

This patch started by changing all relevant add_setshow_* commands to
take an `std::string *` instead of a `char **` and fixing everything
that failed to build.  That includes of course all string setting
variable and their uses.

string_option_def now uses an std::string also, because there's a
connection between options and settings (see
add_setshow_cmds_for_options).

The add_path function in source.c is really complex and twisted, I'd
rather not try to change it to work on an std::string right now.
Instead, I added an overload that copies the std:string to a `char *`
and back.  This means more copying, but this is not used in a hot path
at all, so I think it is acceptable.

PsychOpenHMDVR: Fixup for recent Linux kernels and distros.

Turns out that at least on Ubuntu 20.04-LTS with modern Linux kernels,
which are HMD aware, for at least the Oculus Rift CV1, our old approach
with PsychOpenHMDVR() does not work well anymore. The Oculus Rift CV1
and later Oculus models go into a power-saving mode at the end of a
session when our driver closes the USB connection to the HMD device and
no more USB keep-alive packets are sent anymore.

When entering power-save, the HMD's video output, e.g., HDMI, is
hot-unplugged from the system. On hot-replug (ie. when a new session
is started, our driver connects vie USB, and the Rift fully powers up),
the Rift video display does not fully turn on anymore. It seems that
the panel stays powered down due to some "stuck" DPMS power setting.
This may be a quirk of the specific Rift CV1 HMD, or it may be
because the HMD is marked as non-desktop display by Linux 4.16+, and
either the kms driver or the X-Server somehow gets confused by the
hot-unplug without proper DPMS handshaking, or some other problem of
some other component. In any case, this problem was observed on the
Rift CV1 with Ubuntu 20.04-LTS, standard distro kernel 5.8, X-Server
20.0.9. The problem does not happen as often and reproducible on a
Linux 5.13 kernel, but sometimes it still happens.

Typically the Rift works for exactly one session after reboot, then
not anymore.

I found the following workaround implemented in this commit:

During the device open sequence / driver session startup:

1. Explicitely turn off the RandR video output assigned to the HMD.
2. Wait a second.
3. Turn on the HMD RandR output again, at the correct native HMD panel
   mode and refresh rate. Also label the output as standard desktop
   display, overriding the Linux kernels classification/labelling as
   non-desktop special purpose display, which is applied to known HMD's
   since Linux 4.16.
4. Wait another second or two.

What this output-off --> output-on sequence implicitely does is, that
it first sends a DPMS standby signal to the HMD, then a DPMS on signal,
enforcing a toggle of the panels DPMS state. This gets the display unstuck.
We could also just use calls to force DPMS standby -> DPMS on, without
the need for a full modeset, but as DPMS acts globally on all X-Screens
and outputs, this causes flicker and short display blanking on all active
displays, not just the HMD, so it is more intrusive / annoying.

Note we use xrandr system() callouts for this, as our own builtin
Screen() modesetting code doesn't deal with turned off outputs yet,
and just updating Screen() for this seems a bit too much overkill
at the moment.

Another note: In order to make multi-X-Screen configurations work
at all, which is needed with our current Linux VR drivers for good
timing and performance, the xorg.conf Monitor section for the HMD's
ZaphodHeads HMD output needs an explicit...

Option        "Enable" "on"

...to force the X-Server to enable the output despite it being
marked as non-desktop by the Linux kernel. Otherwise the server
will not find any connected outputs, is left with an X-Screen
without outputs and then deletes that X-Screen, and we are left
with a single-X-Screen setup that is unusable for VR HMD's.

XOrgConfCreator will need an update to deal with this.

Another note: If one wants to use the monado-service VR compositor
for OpenXR on Linux, one needs a bug-fixed monado implementation and
Linux kernel 5.13 or later - or at least it is verifed to work with
5.13 and to not work with 5.8. Current monado master will only work
on single-X-Screen setups which are unsuitable for parallel use with
our old VR drivers.

Another note: Getting at least the Rift working under these circumstances
on a single X-Screen setup proved to be painful to the point of being
unworkable. The Rift's power-saving collaborates with the Linux 4.16
non-desktop display labelling to create a perfect shit-show of pain.
Not impossible to get working, but painful enough that i won't bother,
so i doubt any normal users will. Of course this doesn't matter much,
as the single-X-Screen config is only useful for the most basic testing,
if one is to lazy to do a logout -> Switch to dual-x-screen -> login
transition. Performance is by design so bad, it is not useful for actual
VR experiments, and setting up a dual-X-Screen setup only takes a minute,
so there...

-> This is all quite a bit of a hack, but given that i am working on a new
   VR driver anyway, which intends to supersede all our existing drivers,
   and does not suffer any of these problems, i guess patching this up a
   tiny bit more should do for the time being to bridge the time-gap between
   now and the completion of the new driver in a few months.

NCR + Legion getting some attention (#429)

There is a need for more sex appeal for these two gangs. More text will come.

TL:dr 2 ranger slots down, 1 explorer slot down, Venator slot zero. Focus on making the regular stuff work, less special forces/solo stuff. Forget any illusion of perfect balance, good enough is key, and keeping nice themes.

Split Forgemaster and Slavemaster again since their intended function are so incompatible
Forgemaster gets less advanced toolbelt (was an oversight) and a chainsaw, he is getting armor too when done spriting but it can wait.

Style: NCR gets bayonet knives and leg holsters as standard, not hunting knives and shoulder holsters.

NCR Gets service rifles, better rifles for LT, Medic. MP on steroids. Lose Trekking (rangers keep it of course). Captain made more interesting with smoke grenades and a frag, not just LT +.
Legion gets trekking for primes, one recruit, lifegiver for senior roles, explorers lose armor rating. Loadouts given a work over, theme simple guns except Frontline Cent who gets a M1919 Mg, some firebombs/molotovs/smoke grenades and melee stuff added to give more possible tactics.
Bunch of various adjustments in loadouts, police shotguns gone from NCR, tribal Legion recruit gets his spear and nothing else, put together it will provide more meaningful choices and more viable loadouts while improving their style points.

Less Rangers/Explorer because too many special scout troops encourage solo running off and playing like a waster + and not interacting with your faction uncool. Venator goes to fix the very dumb command flow for Legion where Venator is shoehorned in making even more of a command mess, and the night vision + super heavy armor/vet ranger mirror concept is just no good.

New toolbelts for Forgemaster/Medicus, Chainsaw can be used for sawing off shotguns, cleans the 2h file from some obsolete stuff and updates a bunch of 2h onmob sprites for shading etc. Parts of the melee tweaks got sucked into this, so some minor value tweaks to swords/knives and scrap sabre added. New tool : hand saw. Circular saw slightly faster now. New Event role, personal aide, NCR role to support the Colonel and carry the banner of the Republic. NCR banner sprites made by Dioclex.

audio: merge pull/push ring buffer glue code

This is preparation to further cleanups (and eventually actual
improvements) of the audio output code.

AOs are split into two classes: pull and push. Pull AOs let an audio
callback of the native audio API read from a ring buffer. Push AOs
expose a function that works similar to write(), and for which we start
a "feeder" thread. It seems making this split was beneficial, because of
the different data flow, and emulating the one or other in the AOs
directly would have created code duplication (all the "pull" AOs had
their own ring buffer implementation before it was cleaned up).
Unfortunately, both types had completely separate implementations (in
pull.c and push.c). The idea was that little can be shared anyway. But
that's very annoying now, because I want to change the API between AO
and player.

This commit attempts to merge them. I've moved everything from push.c to
pull.c, the trivial entrypoints from ao.c to pull.c, and attempted to
reconcile the differences. It's a mess, but at least there's only one
ring buffer within the AO code now. Everything should work mostly the
same. Pull AOs now always copy the audio data under a lock; before this
commit, all ring buffer access was lock-free (except for the decoder
wakeup callback, which acquired a mutex). In theory, this is "bad", and
people obsessed with lock-free stuff will hate me, but in practice
probably won't matter. The planned change will probably remove this
copying-under-lock again, but who knows when this will happen.

One change for the push AOs now makes it drop audio, where before only a
warning was logged. This is only in case of AOs or drivers which exhibit
unexpected (and now unsupported) behavior.

This is a risky change. Although it's completely trivial conceptually,
there are too many special cases. In addition, I barely tested it, and
I've messed with it in a half-motivated state over a longer time, barely
making any progress, and finishing it under a rush when I already should
have been asleep. Most things seem to work, and I made superficial tests
with alsa, sdl, and encode mode. This should cover most things, but
there are a lot of tricky things that received no coverage. All this
text means you should be prepared to roll back to an older commit and
report your problem.
