Pipeguns: Elitism Edition (#56322)

About The Pull Request

The core of the PR:

The improvised shotgun that was is dead and removed.

Now we have Pipeguns. Pipeguns are bolt action rifles that have a damage multiplier that reduces their damage to 75%, and can be modified to fit the rare 7.62mm bullets. If you want to that is.

The pipegun also slowly increases in misfire probability for every shot at a rate of 5% per shot.

Pipeguns can also be upgraded to Regal Pipeguns. These contain more bullets, don't misfire and don't have a damage multiplier. To acquire one is a maint secret, only available to lucky assistants who come across the diary of a dead assistant. The probability of finding the book is quite, quite low.

Bandoliers now fit individual 7.62mm. Because why not. Currently they're available in stripper clips that fit into most combat belts so this is mostly a style preference at the moment

Other shit

Ammo modification and misfire behaviour is now generalized to all ballistics. You can now make any gun misfire and any internal magazine gun swap ammunition.

Misfires are not a flat chance. Instead, they increment as the gun fires over time.

Ports over this PR Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13#12274 which I felt was pretty neat conceptually for making some weapons weaker.

Makes the icemoon hermit's mosin into a regal pipegun, just to get mosins out of easy access.
Why It's Good For The Game

Improvised shotguns were one of my favourite weapons to horribly abuse while they were utterly broken a nice alternative, but I fully support moving towards curbing gun power curve. Part of that should include looking at improvised weapons like this which are seeing considerable usage with the removal of buckshot and slugs.

Initially I wanted to pair this with a PR of my own to bop Mosins on the skull along with it, but #56319 is already doing that, and while it's a very lenient approach to my own (I was going to remove them entirely from cargo), I respect it.

Changelog

cl
add: Replaces improvised shotguns with Pipeguns (with a special variant for those willing to go through arbitrary bullshit to acquire it and sheer good luck).
add: Now all guns can be set to misfire and swap ammunition.
add: Misfire chance is incremental as you fire the weapon, and not a flat static chance. This can be reset by using a piece of cloth on the gun and 10 seconds of cleaning.
balance: This has been applied to the detective revolver, but it only increments while using .357 bullets.
add: Guns can have damage multipliers attached for the bullets they fire. The pipegun (but not the regal version) is the first example with a 75% damage output.
balance: The Ice Hermit now has a regal pipegun instead of a Mosin Nagant.
balance: The bandolier fits 7.62mm.
balance: You can construct receivers and rifle stocks in the crafting menu.
balance: Detaches the magical rifles from the boltaction subtype, since they are just basically not using any variables attached to that subtype and made from a series of early returns.

Friday, February 5th, 2020 - the perfect rocky Friday night getting ready show! I LOVE The Struts' new album Strange Days, and in particular the track Another Hit of Showmanship, and I'm always looking for a way to carry on that rocky, punchy, fun and funky vibe throughout a whole show. Since doing the new music shows on Tuesdays I've discovered so much new music and really caught up with what I've been missing out on over the past few years. So starting with The Struts, I began to build the playlist and to my great joy and amusement all the tracks I was picking were released in the last year, and many of the artists I've played on new music shows over the last 9 months or so. I pictured myself leaving work, heading to the local bar, loading the juke box up and sinking several strong beers to shake off the week. Cheers!

Somebody call Alanis Morissette....

It's like re-adding old code, from the other day,
It's a free repo, nobody's gonna get paid
It's the good advice, to be backwards compatbile...
And who would've thought, it figures?

Mr. Play-It-Safe, was afraid to deprecate
He packed his managed package and kissed his free time goodbye
He waited his whole damn life, to use that namespace
And as the CI/CD pipeline crashed down he thought, "Well, isn't this nice"?
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?
A little too ironic? Yeah, I really do think

tl;dr - sfdx force:auth:sfdxurl:store is now sfdx auth:sfdxurl:store. This non-backwards compatible change in sfdx happened exactly when I tried to avoid a non-backwards compatible change in Logger. Halp.

fs/sync: Make sync() satisfy many requests with one invocation

Dave Jones reported RCU stalls, overly long hrtimer interrupts, and
amazingly long NMI handlers from a trinity-induced workload involving
lots of concurrent sync() calls (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/23/369).
There are any number of things that one might do to make sync() behave
better under high levels of contention, but it is also the case that
multiple concurrent sync() system calls can be satisfied by a single
sys_sync() invocation.

Given that this situation is reminiscent of rcu_barrier(), this commit
applies the rcu_barrier() approach to sys_sync().  This approach uses
a global mutex and a sequence counter.  The mutex is held across the
sync() operation, which eliminates contention between concurrent sync()
operations.  The counter is incremented at the beginning and end of
each sync() operation, so that it is odd while a sync() operation is in
progress and even otherwise, just like sequence locks.

The code that used to be in sys_sync() is now in do_sync(), and
sys_sync()
now handles the concurrency.  The sys_sync() function first takes a
snapshot of the counter, then acquires the mutex, and then takes another
snapshot of the counter.  If the values of the two snapshots indicate
that
a full do_sync() executed during the mutex acquisition, the sys_sync()
function releases the mutex and returns ("Our work is done!").
Otherwise,
sys_sync() increments the counter, invokes do_sync(), and increments
the counter again.

This approach allows a single call to do_sync() to satisfy an
arbitrarily
large number of sync() system calls, which should eliminate issues due
to large numbers of concurrent invocations of the sync() system call.

Changes since v1 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/24/683):

o	Add a pair of memory barriers to keep the increments from
	bleeding into the do_sync() code.  (The failure probability
	is insanely low, but when you have several hundred million
	devices running Linux, you can expect several hundred instances
	of one-in-a-million failures.)

o	Actually CC some people who have experience in this area.

"10:10am. I am up. During the night I thought a lot about reference counting. As things are now the pass I just did would be 2/3rds of a ref counting system for a C backend.

This is remarkable. At this point I actually understand all that I need to do single threaded ref counting work. I could do a functional C backend in half a week!

10:15am. This is a great gain. If I get some sponsors, no doubt having a C backend will be a card in play at some point, and doing it would not be trouble at all.

10:25am. Let me chill a bit here. Let me see if I got any replies.

10:35am. I've worked like a slave for the past few days. I need to let off some stress by slacking.

The way the Cython backend is designed at the moment is inappropriate. Rather than merely annotating it, I should have an extra transformation pass for those nulls. I should also turn the relevant data to `TyV` and `TermVar` arrays. I was in a hurry to just get it done, but at some point, I'll do a redesign. Especially if I end up making the C backend.

10:45am. Today is the game library day. Nothing will stop me from this.

11:15am. Let me start. There is not much time left in the morning session, so let me just look around for the library I was talking about.

I needed a bit of slack time today.

The gains of the past few days were as huge, but so was the work strenuous. I excelled regardless. The work was complicated, but I did it as easily as snapping my fingers. 5/5 in compiler engineering is an accurate assessment indeed.

I never thought this would end up being my speciality as a programmer.

...Now, let me leave reference counting and the Cython backend out of mind. I had a really good mindset before I started work on this, and it is time to get back to it.

What was I looking forward? Training RL agents!

11:20am. The most important thing now to get my mind back on that track.

https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/openspiel

Ah yes, it was OpenSpiel. I remember now.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09453v2
OpenSpiel: A Framework for Reinforcement Learning in Games

Lanctot is the primary author for this. I do not really need to read the paper, but let me do it.

https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/docs/install.md

Linux and MacOS instructions only. Yes, this will take some time figure out.

https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/docs/windows.md

Ah, there are Windows instructions.

Tensorflow...well, Deepmind is with Google so that is not surprising.

11:30am. But I've already decided I want to use PyTorch. And am I really expected to do my work from WSL?

Ok, Tensorflow I'll accept. Though I've decided to use PyTorch, I've also decided to be broadminded when it comes to libraries. But OSs are something I will not switch lightly.

Similarly, I refuse to follow the instructions - I should sandbox my install through Anaconda.

Just why do the games have a Linux dependency? I should dive into the library and find that out.

11:35am. Studying the library and doing a port of its relevant sections to Cython should be on my agenda. I am not going to get 4 ranks in ML related skills just by installing Tensorflow and eating what is on offer. I should hunt my own. Either way, I should deeply familiarize myself with these algorithms.

Let me read the paper. I will get into it.

> OpenSpiel has been tested on Linux. We have not tested on MacOS nor Windows, but since the code
uses freely available tools, we do not anticipate any (major) problems compiling and running under
other major platforms. Patches and instructions would be appreciated.

I guess I'll be one of those contributors.

12:05pm. 17/25. NeuRD really crushes PG. And yet I was bullheaded with it back in 2018.

Yeah, this is what I needed. To change my attitude. I should in fact get it to work through WSL, at least initially. Yes, it will waste my HD space once I figure out how to get it working on Windows.

But I've freed close to 300Gb on my SSD for a reason. This is one expense I should be glad to pay. Come to think of it, that cleaning spree might have nuked my WSL install. I might have to reinstall.

12:15pm. 19/25. These guys really have me beat when it comes to ML ideas. I should just rely on them. This is the kind of attitude that I will need.

https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/docs/contributing.md

> Differentiable Games and Algorithms. For example, Symplectic Gradient Adjustment

Hmmm...

I'll leave the research stuff for later.

> PyTorch. While we officially support Tensorflow, the API is agnostic to the library that is used for learning. We would like to have some examples and support for PyTorch as well in the future.

Hmmm...

12:20pm. Done with the paper. Let me read the repo docs next.

12:30pm. https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/tree/master/docs

Next are the raw .mds here.

12:50pm. Let me stop here. I am still thinking about ref counting, but my focus will move to the task at hand.

Just like with many things I've done in the past, my focus should be on studying the OpenSpiel library. Once I graduate on this, I can move to bigger and better things.

This won't be a short affair. I have to make the library my cultivation target. It will take me a while to process it all.

And it will take me even longer to get the agents going in the real world.

12:55pm. But whatever my goals are, I won't meet them by doing standing still. I can't do anything great.

All I can do is take it one step at a time.

My next move should be to install the library and get it to run for the first time on a simplified example. Then I will be able to move from there.

I am not sure whether I strictly want the WSL install. I might want to give running it on Windows a try first. I should try building it manually from source.

Either way I will be spending time, so I should do what I want.

1pm. Spiral will take a backseat for a while, until I get to the point where I need to integrate the library code into my own pipeline.

Eventually, I'll be ripping stuff out of the library and translating it into my own. I have no doubt that I will need to do this in order to merge it together with the UI automation code that I will have to do."

slothjs: ForInStatement

ForInStatement is the ugliest corner of JavaScript I've seen so far. It
lacks any simplicity and purpose:

- *simplicity for a novice*. I remembered being utterly surprised that I
  cannot iterate over array items using `for (... in ...)`, compared to
  the nice and elegant iteration in e.g. Python.

- *simplicity for a power user*. There are very few non-cumbersome
  use-cases for this weird contraption: every time anybody uses it, one
  has to think carefully about their goal and how it interacts with this
  statement. It's easy to forget about enumerable properties in prototypes,
  non-enumerable properties can shadow enumerable properties later in
  the prototype chain, it does not visit non-string (symbolic) names, etc.

- *simplicity of purpose*. The only remotely possible use case is using
  JavaScript objects as hashmaps and iterating over user-defined keys.
  Which leaves unexplained why would one need to walk the prototype chain
  too.

- *simplicity of generality*. `for (.. in ..)` does not use the
  iteration protocol, so it is not extensible and limited to the builtin
  iteratees (objects, string, arrays).

- *simplicity for an implementer*. I tried and gave up on re-using
  ForStatement for `for (.. in ..)`, it really wants to be a separate
  kind of statement, thus requiring reimplementing and retesting
  the loop behavior and interaction with other language features like
  labelled break/continue.

  Algorithmic complexity of the property enumeration is ugly, it's
  either O(n^2) without additional memory or having O(n) memory for the
  set of visited properties. Rust further complicates this (although for
  a good reason), because an object keys must be copied: the loop body
  can change the lifetime of the object.

  So far, I left labelled continue for ForInStatement unimplemented:
  this likely requires saving the iteration state into something more
  complicated than local variables, with unclear lifetimes. Also, those
  who dare to use `label: for (.. in ..) { ..; continue label; .. }` do
  deserve suffering.

I have a dream - Merge

I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains ofdiscrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check --a check that will give us upon demandthe riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neitherrest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.
2We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. They have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.As we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civilrights, "When will you be satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied, as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating "For Whites Only". We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justicerolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.Ihave a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
3I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.This is our hope.This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.This will be the day when all of God's children will be able tosing with a new meaning, "My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring."And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"
