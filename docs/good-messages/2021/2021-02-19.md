##### 2021-02-19 08:26:06 by Misa

Refactor level dir listing to not use STL data marshalling

Note that level dir listing still uses plenty of STL (including the end
product - the `LevelMetaData` struct - which, for the purposes of 2.3,
is okay enough (2.4 should remove STL usage entirely)); it's just that
the initial act of iterating over the levels directory no longer takes
four or SIX(!!!) heap allocations (not counting reallocations and other
heap allocations this patch does not remove), and no longer does any
data marshalling.

Like text splitting, and binary blob extra indice grabbing, the current
approach that FILESYSTEM_getLevelDirFileNames() uses is a temporary
std::vector of std::strings as a middleman to store all the filenames,
and the game iterates over that std::vector to grab each level metadata.
Except, it's even worse in this case, because PHYSFS_enumerateFiles()
ALREADY does a heap allocation. Oh, and
FILESYSTEM_getLevelDirFileNames() gets called two or three times. Yeah,
let me explain:

1. FILESYSTEM_getLevelDirFileNames() calls PHYSFS_enumerateFiles().

2. PHYSFS_enumerateFiles() allocates an array of pointers to arrays of
   chars on the heap. For each filename, it will:

   a. Allocate an array of chars for the filename.

   b. Reallocate the array of pointers to add the pointer to the above
      char array.

      (In this step, it also inserts the filename in alphabetically -
      without any further allocations, as far as I know - but this is a
      COMPLETELY unnecessary step, because we are going to sort the list
      of levels by ourselves via the metadata title in the end anyways.)

3. FILESYSTEM_getLevelDirFileNames() iterates over the PhysFS list, and
   allocates an std::vector on the heap to shove the list into. Then,
   for each filename, it will:

   a. Allocate an std::string, initialized to "levels/".

   b. Append the filename to the std::string above. This will most
      likely require a re-allocation.

   c. Duplicate the std::string - which requires allocating more memory
      again - to put it into the std::vector.

      (Compared to the PhysFS list above, the std::vector does less
      reallocations; it however will still end up reallocating a certain
      amount of times in the end.)

4. FILESYSTEM_getLevelDirFileNames() will free the PhysFS list.

5. Then to get the std::vector<std::string> back to the caller, we end
   up having to reallocate the std::vector again - reallocating every
   single std::string inside it, too - to give it back to the caller.

And to top it all off, FILESYSTEM_getLevelDirFileNames() is guaranteed
to either be called two times, or three times. This is because
editorclass::getDirectoryData() will call editorclass::loadZips(), which
will unconditionally call FILESYSTEM_getLevelDirFileNames(), then call
it AGAIN if a zip was found. Then once the function returns,
getDirectoryData() will still unconditionally call
FILESYSTEM_getLevelDirFileNames(). This smells like someone bolting
something on without regard for the whole picture of the system, but
whatever; I can clean up their mess just fine.

So, what do I do about this? Well, just like I did with text splitting
and binary blob extras, make the final for-loop - the one that does the
actual metadata parsing - more immediate.

So how do I do that? Well, PhysFS has a function named
PHYSFS_enumerate(). PHYSFS_enumerateFiles(), in fact, uses this function
internally, and is basically just a wrapper with some allocation and
alphabetization.

PHYSFS_enumerate() takes in a pointer to a function, which it will call
for every single entry that it iterates over. It also lets you pass in
another arbitrary pointer that it leaves alone, which I use to pass
through a function pointer that is the actual callback.

So to clarify, there are two callbacks - one callback is passed through
into another callback that gets passed through to PHYSFS_enumerate().

The callback that gets passed to PHYSFS_enumerate() is always the same,
but the callback that gets passed through the callback can be different
(if you look at the calling code, you can see that one caller passes
through a normal level metadata callback; the other passes through a zip
file callback).

Furthermore, I've also cleaned it up so that if editorclass::loadZips()
finds a zip file, it won't iterate over all the files in the levels
directory a third time. Instead, the level directory only gets iterated
over twice - once to check for zips, and another to load every level
plus all zips; the second time is when all the heap allocations happen.

And with that, level list loading now uses less STL templated stuff and
much less heap allocations.

Also, ed.directoryList basically has no reason to exist other than being
a temporary std::vector, so I've removed it. This further decreases
memory usage, depending on how many levels you have in your levels
folder (I know that I usually have a lot and don't really ever clean it
up, lol).

Lastly, in the callback passed to PhysFS, `builtLocation` is actually no
longer hardcoded to just the `levels` directory, since instead we now
use the `origdir` variable that PhysFS passes us. So that's good, too.

chore(rds): add PG12.5 and deprecate PG9.5 and PG9.6 (#12998)

Added PostgreSQL 12.5 version.

Also, I got a friendly email from AWS that some versions of PG will be forcefully updated, and I've decided to mark PG9.5 and 9.6 as deprecated. (Feb 2021 and Nov 2021 EOLs respectfully).

> Amazon RDS is starting the end of life process for PostgreSQL major version 9.5. We are doing this because the PostgreSQL community is planning to discontinue support for PostgreSQL 9.5 on February 11, 2021 [1].
> 
> Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 will reach end of life on February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.6 will reach end of life in late 2021. Hence, we strongly encourage you to upgrade your databases running PostgreSQL major version 9.5 to 12 or greater at your convenience before February 16, 2021. PostgreSQL 12 contains major innovations including JSON path queries per SQL/JSON specifications and pluggable table storage interface [2]. PostgreSQL 13 introduced parallel processing of indexes with the VACUUM command and improved duplicate data handling by B-tree indexes [3]. Both versions contain numerous fixes to various software defects in earlier versions of the database.
> 
> If you do not upgrade your databases before February 16, 2021, RDS will upgrade your PostgreSQL 9.5 databases to PostgreSQL 12 during a scheduled maintenance window between Feb 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC and March 16, 2021 00:00:01 UTC. On March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC, any PostgreSQL 9.5 databases that remain will be upgraded to version 12 regardless of whether the instances are in a maintenance window or not.
> 
> You can initiate an upgrade of your database instance — either immediately or during your next maintenance window — to a newer major version of PostgreSQL using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface. The upgrade process will shut down the database instance, perform the upgrade, and restart the database instance. The database instance may be restarted multiple times during the upgrade process. While major version upgrades typically complete within the standard maintenance window, the duration of the upgrade depends on the number of objects within the database. To avoid any unplanned unavailability outside your maintenance window, we recommend that you first take a snapshot of your database and test the upgrade to get an estimate of the duration. To learn more about upgrading PostgreSQL major versions in RDS, review the Upgrading Database Versions page [4].
> 
> We want to make you aware of the following additional milestones associated with upgrading these databases that are reaching end of life.
> 
> Now through March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - You can initiate upgrades of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to PostgreSQL 12 or higher at any time.
> February 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - After this date and time, you cannot create new RDS instances with PostgreSQL major version 9.5 from either the AWS Console or the CLI. RDS will also automatically upgrade PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 within the earliest scheduled maintenance window that follows. Restoration of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 9.5 database snapshots will result in an automatic upgrade of the restored database to a still supported version at the time.
> March 16, 2021 00:00:01 AM UTC - RDS will automatically upgrade any remaining PostgreSQL 9.5 instances to version 12 whether or not they are in a maintenance window.
> Should you have any questions or concerns, the AWS Support Team is available on the community forums and via Premium Support [5].

Fix mounts being usable after a disk is ejected

This probably fails "responsible disclosure", but it's not an RCE and
frankly the whole bug is utterly hilarious so here we are...

It's possible to open a file on a disk drive and continue to read/write
to them after the disk has been removed:

    local disk = peripheral.find("drive")
    local input = fs.open(fs.combine(disk.getMountPath(), "stream"), "rb")
    local output = fs.open(fs.combine(disk.getMountPath(), "stream"), "wb")
    disk.ejectDisk()

    -- input/output can still be interacted with.

This is pretty amusing, as now it allows us to move the disk somewhere
else and repeat - we've now got a private tunnel which two computers can
use to communicate.

Fixing this is intuitively quite simple - just close any open files
belonging to this mount. However, this is where things get messy thanks
to the wonderful joy of how CC's streams are handled.

As things stand, the filesystem effectively does the following flow::
 - There is a function `open : String -> Channel' (file modes are
   irrelevant here).

 - Once a file is opened, we transform it into some <T extends
   Closeable>. This is, for instance, a BufferedReader.

 - We generate a "token" (i.e. FileSystemWrapper<T>), which we generate
   a week reference to and map it to a tuple of our Channel and T. If
   this token is ever garbage collected (someone forgot to call close()
   on a file), then we close our T and Channel.

 - This token and T are returned to the calling function, which then
   constructs a Lua object.

The problem here is that if we close the underlying Channel+T before the
Lua object calls .close(), then it won't know the underlying channel is
closed, and you get some pretty ugly errors (e.g. "Stream Closed"). So
we've moved the "is open" state into the FileSystemWrapper<T>.

The whole system is incredibly complex at this point, and I'd really
like to clean it up. Ideally we could treat the HandleGeneric as the
token instead - this way we could potentially also clean up
FileSystemWrapperMount.

BBut something to play with in the future, and not when it's 10:30pm.

All this wall of text, and this isn't the only bug I've found with disks
today :/.

[script] [attunement] Add "health" option to train empathy

### Background
* Deneri in the empaths lich channel [asked](https://discord.com/channels/745675889622384681/745678251250417674/794988805525471252) if there was a script to do a "health walk" with T2.
* Kiriawen [answered](https://discord.com/channels/745675889622384681/745678251250417674/795021486854242315) that there wasn't, that `crossing-training` script trains empathy via its own code.
* Further discussion insued about tweaking this script to support "health walks" in addition to "power walks".

### Changes
* Add optional `health` argument that will do a "health walk" for Empaths
* Add new setting `perceive_health_rooms` to override the base-towns.yaml rooms for a "health walk" (analogous to existing `attunement_rooms` setting)

### Sample Config
```yaml
# Used by 'attunement' script.
# These override the default rooms where magic users will visit to
# train attunement via 'perceive' command.
# If not defined then the rooms are taken from base-towns.yaml.
# This is ignored for lunar mages and instead they train in their current room.
attunement_rooms:

# Used by 'attunement' script when called with the 'health' option.
# These override the default rooms where Empaths will visit to
# train empathy via 'perceive health' command.
# If not defined then the rooms are taken from base-towns.yaml.
perceive_health_rooms:
- 100
- 200
- 300
```

### Credits
Kiriawen was very helpful in outlining how to add "health walk" to the attunement script and nuances around how to train empathy in this manner.

## Tests
