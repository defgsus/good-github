The story of Citizens United began in late 2007, as leading members of the Republican and  Democratic parties were preparing for the 2008 presidential primaries. Democrats expected a three- way contest in their party between Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, Senator (and former first lady)  Hillary Clinton of New York, and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina.1  In anticipation of the primary season, a nonprofit corporation named Citizens United made a film, Hillary: The Movie, which attacked Senator Clinton’s character, activities in Washington, and fitness for the presidency. People interviewed in the film described Clinton as “steeped in controversy [and] steeped in sleaze,” “deceitful,” “ruthless,” “vindictive,” “venal,” “sneaky,” and “intolerant.”2 Citizens United released Hillary: The Movie in cinemas and on DVD, but also wished to show the film via on-demand video. Although the group sought to promote the on-demand release with television commercials, it worried that both the on-demand release and the associated advertisements could be deemed illegal. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (United States Code, Title 2, Section 441b), building on earlier campaign finance legislation dating back to 1907 (see Exhibit 10), banned corporations and labor unions from using internal treasury funds to assist with the election or defeat of candidates for certain federal offices. Prohibited assistance included both direct monetary and in-kind donations, as well as independent expenditures on relevant materials or events. The 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) had expanded this ban to include any “electioneering communication” within 30 days of a primary election or 60 days of a general election that could reach 50,000 or more people in the relevant jurisdiction. In spite of these constraints, corporations and unions were allowed to organize political action committees (PACs) to contribute to campaigns. The money a PAC spent on electoral campaigns could not come from the general treasury of its sponsoring corporation or union. However, the PAC could raise money by soliciting donations from people affiliated with the corporation or union. Both contributions to PACs and expenditures by PACs were subject to numerous limits and restrictions.3 Citizens United pled in District Court that the laws restricting corporate speech were unconstitutional. It also targeted other clauses in the BCRA that mandated disclosure of major spenders on electioneering communications and the use of identifying disclaimers in the communications themselves. The District Court ruled against Citizens United on all of these issues, but the Supreme  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  716-039 Citizens United and Corporate Speech  2 Court soon took up the case. Lawyers representing Citizens United and the Federal Election Commission argued twice before the Court, once in May 2009 and again that September. On January 21, 2010, the Supreme Court announced its ruling.4 In a 5-4 decision, the Court declared that limiting corporations’ independent expenditures on election speech was unconstitutional. By doing so, the Court overturned two of its own precedents: Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), which had upheld a law that set special limitations on corporate speech, and part of McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003), which had permitted limitations on electioneering communications. The majority opinion in Citizens United, penned by Justice Anthony Kennedy, announced that corporations had First Amendment rights, and that existing federal law improperly infringed on these rights. The four justices in the minority joined in a spirited dissent, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, which expressed deep concern over the influence of corporate spending on elections.a The Majority Opinion Confronting Constitutional Issues The first question taken up by the majority was whether an extensive review of existing campaign finance law was in fact required. The nonprofit corporation Citizens United had offered—in addition to broad arguments about corporate speech—narrow arguments as to why §441b might not apply to Hillary. If accepted by the Court, such arguments would have obviated the need for a more extensive examination of the law. Citizens United claimed that the film was not an “electioneering communication” or “express advocacy,” that on-demand video differed from traditional television enough to merit different rules, and that nonprofit corporations funded mostly by individuals deserved exemption from §441b.5  The majority quickly dispensed with these arguments, however. On the  difference between on-demand video and regular television, Justice Kennedy wrote: Citizens United contends ... that [video on-demand] has a lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads ... On what we might call conventional television, advertising spots reach viewers who have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unrelated to the advertising ... [A]ny effort by the Judiciary to decide which means of communication are to be preferred for the particular type of message and speaker would raise questions as to the court’s own lawful authority ... The interpretive process itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable.6 Regarding the creation of an exception for corporations mostly funded by individuals, he wrote: There is no principled basis for doing this without rewriting Austin’s holding that the Government can restrict corporate independent expenditures for political speech. Though it is true that the Court should construe statutes as necessary to avoid constitutional questions, the series of steps suggested would be difficult to take in view of the language of the statute ... We decline to adopt an interpretation that requires intricate case-by-case  a The justices in the majority on the major issues were Kennedy, Chief Justice John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas. The dissenters were Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. All of the justices except Thomas concurred that the disclosure and disclaimer laws Citizens United also challenged were constitutional.

Citizens United and Corporate Speech 716-039  3 determinations to verify whether political speech is banned, especially if we are convinced that, in the end, this corporation has a constitutional right to speak on this subject.7 Having rejected narrower arguments, Kennedy explained why it was appropriate—and, in fact, necessary—for the Court to examine the constitutionality of §441b. Although Citizens United had initially issued a “facial” challenge to the law, demanding such a broad review, it later rescinded that challenge. The majority, however, insisted it was still able and obligated to rule on the constitutionality of the law: [T]he Court cannot resolve this case on a narrower ground without chilling political speech ... It is not judicial restraint to accept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can avoid another argument with broader implications. Indeed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling ... [T]hroughout the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the [Federal Election Commission (FEC)] has violated its First Amendment right to free speech. All concede that this claim is properly before us. And “‘[o]nce a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below’” ... [T]he distinction between facial and as-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has some automatic effect or that it must always control the pleadings and disposition in every case involving a constitutional challenge ... The parties cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering certain remedies if those remedies are necessary to resolve a claim that has been preserved. Citizens United has preserved its First Amendment challenge to §441b as applied to the facts of its case; and given all the circumstances, we cannot easily address that issue without assuming a premise—the permissibility of restricting corporate political speech—that is itself in doubt.8 Consideration of the facial validity of §441b is further supported by the following reasons. First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position of the Government ... [T]he Government suggests, as an alternative argument, that an as-applied challenge might have merit ... When the Government holds out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrains from adopting that position, the added uncertainty demonstrates the necessity to address the question of statutory validity. Second, substantial time would be required to bring clarity to the application of the statutory provision on these points in order to avoid any chilling effect ... A speaker’s ability to engage in political speech that could have a chance of persuading voters is stifled if the speaker must first commence a protracted lawsuit ... Third is the primary importance of speech itself to the integrity of the election process. As additional rules are created for regulating political speech, any speech arguably within their reach is chilled ... The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt protected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated.9 Corporate Speech Justice Kennedy next took up the issue of corporate speech, arguing forcefully that §441b violated the First Amendment: [T]he following acts would all be felonies under §441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  716-039 Citizens United and Corporate Speech  4 Association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports a handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presidential candidate in light of that candidate's defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic examples of censorship. Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak ... PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations ... This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the millions of corporations in this country have PACs.10 Section 441b's prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a “restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign,” that statute “necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” ... Were the Court to uphold these restrictions, the Government could repress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the various points in the speech process. ... If §441b applied to individuals, no one would believe that it is merely a time, place, or manner restriction on speech. Its purpose and effect are to silence entities whose voices the Government deems to be suspect.11 Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people ... The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it. The First Amendment “‘has its fullest and most urgent application’ to speech uttered during a campaign for political office” ... Speech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply a means to control content. Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating content, moreover, the Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers. By taking the right to speak from some and giving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker's voice. The Government may not by these means deprive the public of the right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and speakers are worthy of consideration. The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each.12 Kennedy proceeded to review the legal and judicial history of corporate speech: The Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations ... This protection has been extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech ... The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of corporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply because such associations are not “natural persons.”13 At least since the latter part of the 19th century, the laws of some States and of the United States imposed a ban on corporate direct contributions to candidates. ... For almost three decades thereafter, the Court did not reach the question whether restrictions on corporate and union expenditures are constitutional. ... The question was in the background of United States v. CIO [1948] ... There, a labor union endorsed a congressional candidate in its weekly periodical. The Court stated that “the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to [the federal expenditure prohibition's] constitutionality” if it were construed to suppress that writing ... The Court engaged in statutory interpretation and found the statute did not cover the publication ... Four Justices,  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  Citizens United and Corporate Speech 716-039  5 however, said they would reach the constitutional question and invalidate the Labor Management Relations Act's expenditure ban ... The concurrence explained that any “‘undue influence’” generated by a speaker's “large expenditures” was outweighed “by the loss for democratic processes resulting from the restrictions upon free and full public discussion” ... In United States v. Automobile Workers [1957] ... [t]hree Justices dissented, arguing that the Court should have reached the constitutional question and that the ban on independent expenditures was unconstitutional.14 In [Buckley v. Valeo (1976)] the Court addressed various challenges to ... an independent expenditure ban ... that applied to individuals as well as corporations and labor unions ... Buckley first upheld ... limits on direct contributions to candidates. The Buckley Court recognized a “sufficiently important” governmental interest in "the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption” ... The Buckley Court explained that the potential for quid pro quo corruption distinguished direct contributions to candidates from independent expenditures. The Court emphasized that “the independent expenditure ceiling . . . fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,” ... because “[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination . . . alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate” ... Buckley did not consider [an existing] separate ban on corporate and union independent expenditures ... Had [the separate ban] been challenged in the wake of Buckley, however, it could not have been squared with the reasoning and analysis of that precedent.15 [First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978)] reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the Government cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker’s corporate identity ... when it struck down a state-law prohibition on corporate independent expenditures related to referenda issues: ... “In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects about which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue” ... Bellotti did not address the constitutionality of the State's ban on corporate independent expenditures to support candidates. In our view, however, that restriction would have been unconstitutional under Bellotti's central principle: that the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker's corporate identity.16 Thus the law stood until Austin ... To bypass Buckley and Bellotti, the Austin Court identified a new governmental interest in limiting political speech: an antidistortion interest. Austin found a compelling governmental interest in preventing “the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation’s political ideas” ... The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a pre-Austin line that forbids restrictions on political speech based on the speaker’s corporate identity and a post-Austin line that permits them.17 Antidistortion As for Austin’s antidistortion rationale, the Government does little to defend it ... And with good reason, for the rationale cannot support §441b ... If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech. If the antidistortion rationale were to be accepted,  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  716-039 Citizens United and Corporate Speech  6 however, it would permit Government to ban political speech simply because the speaker is an association that has taken on the corporate form. The Government contends that Austin permits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all forms of communication stemming from a corporation. ... If Austin were correct, the Government could prohibit a corporation from expressing political views in media beyond those presented here, such as by printing books. ... Political speech is “indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.” ... The rule that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker’s wealth is a necessary consequence of the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker’s identity ... It is irrelevant for purposes of the First Amendment that corporate funds may “have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.” ... All speakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech. The First Amendment protects the resulting speech, even if it was enabled by economic transactions with persons or entities who disagree with the speaker’s ideas...18 Austin's antidistortion rationale would produce the dangerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress could ban political speech of media corporations ... Media corporations are now exempt from §441b’s ban on corporate expenditures ... Yet media corporations accumulate wealth with the help of the corporate form ... and the views expressed by media corporations often “have little or no correlation to the public’s support” for those views ... Thus, under the Government’s reasoning, wealthy media corporations could have their voices diminished ... There is no precedent supporting laws that attempt to distinguish between corporations which are deemed to be exempt as media corporations and those which are not ... The great debates between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists over our founding document were published and expressed in the most important means of mass communication of that era—newspapers owned by individuals.19 Austin interferes with the “open marketplace” of ideas protected by the First Amendment ... It permits the Government to ban the political speech of millions of associations of citizens ... Most of these are small corporations without large amounts of wealth ... (more than 75% of corporations whose income is taxed under federal law... have less than $1 million in receipts per year). This fact belies the Government’s argument that the statute is justified on the ground that it prevents the “distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth.”20 By suppressing the speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and non-profit, the Government prevents their voices and viewpoints from reaching the public and advising voters on which persons or entities are hostile to their interests. Factions will necessarily form in our Republic, but the remedy of “destroying the liberty” of some factions is “worse than the disease.” Factions should be checked by permitting them all to speak ... and by entrusting the people to judge what is true and what is false.21 Even if §441b’s expenditure ban were constitutional, wealthy corporations could still lobby elected officials, although smaller corporations may not have the resources to do so. And wealthy individuals and unincorporated associations can spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures ... Yet certain disfavored associations of citizens—those  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  Citizens United and Corporate Speech 716-039  7 that have taken on the corporate form— are penalized for engaging in the same political speech.22 Corruption For the most part relinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate political speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance ... [W]e now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption ... The fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that those officials are corrupt: ... “It is in the nature of elected representatives to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies. It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors. Democracy is premised on responsiveness” ... The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy ... The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials.23 The McConnell record was over “100,000 pages” long ... yet it “does not have any direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . expenditures” ... This confirms Buckley’s reasoning that independent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro quo corruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent expenditures even ingratiate ... The BCRA record establishes that certain donations to political parties, called “soft money,” were made to gain access to elected officials ... This case, however, is about independent expenditures, not soft money. When Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may not choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy.24 Shareholder Protection The Government contends further that corporate independent expenditures can be limited because of its interest in protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate political speech. This asserted interest, like Austin's antidistortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban the political speech even of media corporations ... There is, furthermore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders ”through the procedures of corporate democracy” ... [M]oreover, the statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive. As to the first, if Congress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders, it would not have banned corporate speech in only certain media within 30 or 60 days before an election. A dissenting shareholder's interests would be implicated by speech in any media at any time. As to the second, the  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  716-039 Citizens United and Corporate Speech  8 statute is overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including nonprofit corporations and for-profit corporations with only single shareholders.25 “Civic Discourse Belongs to the People” Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on Youtube.com might portray public officials or public policies in unflattering ways. Yet if a covered transmission during the blackout period creates the background for candidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs solely because a corporation, other than an exempt media corporation, has made the "purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value" in order to engage in political speech ... Speech would be suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue preceding a real election. Governments are often hostile to speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems stranger than fiction for our Government to make this political speech a crime. Yet this is the statute's purpose and design.26 Some members of the public might consider Hillary to be insightful and instructive; some might find it to be neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the Nation's course; still others simply might suspend judgment on these points but decide to think more about issues and candidates. Those choices and assessments, however, are not for the Government to make. “The First Amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free to use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of ideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it.”27 The Concurring Opinions of Roberts and Scalia Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia each wrote concurring opinions. Roberts’s concurrence primarily addressed stare decisis, the principle that the Court should adhere to its own precedents. Defending the majority’s decision to overturn Austin and McConnell, Roberts wrote: When considering whether to reexamine a prior erroneous holding, we must balance the importance of having constitutional questions decided against the importance of having them decided right ... In conducting this balancing, we must keep in mind that stare decisis is not an end in itself. It is instead “the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in principled and intelligible fashion” ... Its greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal—the rule of law. It follows that in the unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more damage to this constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that precedent ... Abrogating the errant precedent, rather than reaffirming or extending it, might better preserve the law’s coherence and curtail the precedent’s disruptive effects.28 Justice Scalia’s concurrence pertained to how the Framers of the Constitution viewed corporations and freedom of speech. Of course the Framers’ personal affection or disaffection for corporations is relevant only insofar as it can be thought to be reflected in the understood meaning of the text they enacted—not, as the dissent suggests, as a freestanding substitute for that text ... Despite the corporation-hating quotations the dissent has dredged up, it is far from clear that by  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  Citizens United and Corporate Speech 716-039  9 the end of the 18th century corporations were despised ... Most of the Founders’ resentment towards corporations was directed at the state-granted monopoly privileges that individually chartered corporations enjoyed. Modern corporations do not have such privileges, and would probably have been favored by most of our enterprising founders— excluding, perhaps, Thomas Jefferson and others favoring perpetuation of an agrarian society.29 All the provisions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of individual men and women—not, for example, of trees or polar bears. But the individual person’s right to speak includes the right to speak in association with other individual persons. Surely the dissent does not believe that speech by the Republican Party or the Democratic Party can be censored because it is not the speech of “an individual American.”30 The [First] Amendment is written in terms of “speech,” not speakers. Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker, from single individuals to partnerships of individuals, to unincorporated associations of individuals, to incorporated associations of individuals—and the dissent offers no evidence about the original meaning of the text to support any such exclusion. We are therefore simply left with the question whether the speech at issue in this case is “speech” covered by the First Amendment. No one says otherwise.31 The Dissent In the dissent, Justice Stevens not only disagreed strongly with the majority’s opinion regarding the constitutionality of §441b, but also objected that the majority had raised the question at all. Our colleagues’ suggestion that “we are asked to reconsider Austin and, in effect, McConnell” ... would be more accurate if rephrased to state that “we have asked ourselves” to reconsider those cases ... Essentially, the five Justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law...32 The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because anything less would chill too much protected speech ... The majority suggests that, even though it expressly dismissed its facial challenge, Citizens United nevertheless preserved it — not as a freestanding “claim,” but as a potential argument in support of “a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech.” ... By this novel logic, virtually any submission could be reconceptualized as “a claim that the Government has violated my rights,” and it would then be available to the Court to entertain any conceivable issue that might be relevant to that claim’s disposition.33 It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have manufactured a facial challenge, because the parties have advanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would facilitate electioneering by nonprofit advocacy corporations such as Citizens United, without toppling statutes and precedents. Which is to say, the majority has transgressed yet another “cardinal” principle of the judicial process: “[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more...”34 The Court's central argument for why stare decisis ought to be trumped is that it does not like Austin. The opinion "was not well reasoned," our colleagues assert, and it conflicts  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  716-039 Citizens United and Corporate Speech  10 with First Amendment principles ... I am perfectly willing to concede that if one of our precedents were dead wrong in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest of our doctrine, there would be a compelling basis for revisiting it. But neither is true of Austin, as I explain at length... The majority also contends that the Government's hesitation to rely on Austin's antidistortion rationale “diminishe[s]" "the principle of adhering to that precedent” ... Why it diminishes the value of stare decisis is left unexplained. We have never thought fit to overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken any particular tack.35 Corporate Speech Pervading the Court's analysis is the ominous image of a “categorical [ban]” on corporate speech ... This characterization is highly misleading, and needs to be corrected ... “The ability to form and administer separate segregated funds,” we observed in McConnell, “has provided corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy. That has been this Court's unanimous view” ... Administering a PAC entails some administrative burden, but so does complying with the disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements that the Court today upholds ... To the extent the majority is worried about this issue, it is important to keep in mind that we have no record to show how substantial the burden really is, just the majority’s own unsupported factfinding ... Like all other natural persons, every shareholder of every corporation remains entirely free under Austin and McConnell to do however much electioneering she pleases outside of the corporate form. The owners of a “mom & pop” store can simply place ads in their own names, rather than the store’s. If ideologically aligned individuals wish to make unlimited expenditures through the corporate form, they may utilize an MCFL organizationb  that has policies in place to avoid becoming a  conduit for business or union interests.36 So let us be clear: Neither Austin nor McConnell held or implied that corporations may be silenced; the FEC is not a “censor”; and in the years since these cases were decided, corporations have continued to play a major role in the national dialogue. Laws such as §203c target a class of communications that is especially likely to corrupt the political process, that is at least one degree removed from the views of individual citizens, and that may not even reflect the views of those who pay for it. Such laws burden political speech, and that is always a serious matter, demanding careful scrutiny. But the majority's incessant talk of a “ban” aims at a straw man.37 The second pillar of the Court's opinion is its assertion that “the Government cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker’s . . . identity.” ... [T]he authority of legislatures to enact viewpoint-neutral regulations based on content and identity is well settled. We have upheld statutes that prohibit the distribution or display of campaign materials near a polling place ... Although we have not reviewed them directly, we have never cast doubt on laws that place special restrictions on campaign spending by foreign nationals. ... And we have consistently approved laws that bar Government employees, but not others, from contributing to or participating in political activities.38  b Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life (1986) (a.k.a. MCFL) allowed independent expenditures by corporations created solely for political ends which did not accept money from for-profit sources. c 203 was §441b’s section number in the original BCRA. Stevens uses §203 to signify the rule Kennedy referred to as §441b.  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  Citizens United and Corporate Speech 716-039  11 The same logic applies to this case with additional force because it is the identity of corporations, rather than individuals, that the Legislature has taken into account ... Not only has the distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral process long been recognized, but within the area of campaign finance, corporate spending is also “furthest from the core of political expression, since corporations’ First Amendment speech and association interests are derived largely from those of their members and of the public in receiving information” ... Campaign finance distinctions based on corporate identity tend to be less worrisome, in other words, because the “speakers” are not natural persons, much less members of our political community, and the governmental interests are of the highest order.39 If taken seriously, our colleagues’ assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government's ability to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have accorded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by “Tokyo Rose” during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied commanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could “‘enhance the relative voice’” of some (i.e., humans) over others (i.e., nonhumans) ... Under the majority's view, I suppose it may be a First Amendment problem that corporations are not permitted to vote, given that voting is, among other things, a form of speech.40 History and Precedent The individualized charter mode of incorporation reflected the “cloud of disfavor under which corporations labored” in the early years of this Nation ... Thomas Jefferson famously fretted that corporations would subvert the Republic ... The Framers thus took it as a given that corporations could be comprehensively regulated in the service of the public welfare. Unlike our colleagues, they had little trouble distinguishing corporations from human beings, and when they constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind. While individuals might join together to exercise their speech rights, business corporations, at least, were plainly not seen as facilitating such associational or expressive ends. Even “the notion that business corporations could invoke the First Amendment would probably have been quite a novelty,” given that “at the time, the legitimacy of every corporate activity was thought to rest entirely in a concession of the sovereign” ... If no prominent Framer bothered to articulate that corporate speech would have lesser status than individual speech, that may well be because the contrary proposition—if not also the very notion of “corporate speech”—was inconceivable.41 [T]he Free Press Clause might be turned against Justice Scalia, for two reasons. First, we learn from it that the drafters of the First Amendment did draw distinctions—explicit distinctions—between types of “speakers,” or speech outlets or forms. Second, the Court's strongest historical evidence all relates to the Framers’ views on the press ... yet while the Court tries to sweep this evidence into the Free Speech Clause, the Free Press Clause provides a more natural textual home. The text and history highlighted by our colleagues suggests why one type of corporation, those that are part of the press, might be able to claim special First Amendment status, and therefore why some kinds of “identity”-based distinctions might be permissible after all. Once one accepts that much, the intellectual edifice of the majority opinion crumbles.42  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  716-039 Citizens United and Corporate Speech  12 A century of more recent history puts to rest any notion that today’s ruling is faithful to our First Amendment tradition. At the federal level, the express distinction between corporate and individual political spending on elections stretches back to 1907, when Congress passed the Tillman Act ... banning all corporate contributions to candidates. The Senate Report on the legislation observed that “[t]he evils of the use of [corporate] money in connection with political elections are so generally recognized that the committee deems it unnecessary to make any argument in favor of the general purpose of this measure. It is in the interest of good government and calculated to promote purity in the selection of public officials” ... Our colleagues emphasize that in two cases from the middle of the 20th century, several Justices wrote separately to criticize the expenditure restriction as applied to unions ... [T]heir position failed to command a majority. Prior to today, this was a fact we found significant in evaluating precedents.43 It is worth remembering for present purposes that the four MCFL dissenters, led by Chief Justice Rehnquist, thought the Court was carrying the First Amendment too far. They would have recognized congressional authority to bar general treasury electioneering expenditures even by this class of nonprofits; they acknowledged that “the threat from corporate political activity will vary depending on the particular characteristics of a given corporation,” but believed these “distinctions among corporations” were “distinctions in degree,” not “in kind,” and thus “more properly drawn by the Legislature than by the Judiciary.”44 In the Court's view, Buckley and Bellotti decisively rejected the possibility of distinguishing corporations from natural persons in the 1970’s; it just so happens that in every single case in which the Court has reviewed campaign finance legislation in the decades since, the majority failed to grasp this truth ... The majority emphasizes Buckley's statement that “‘[t]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.’”... But this elegant phrase cannot bear the weight that our colleagues have placed on it. For one thing, the Constitution does, in fact, permit numerous “restrictions on the speech of some in order to prevent a few from drowning out the many”... For another, the Buckley Court used this line in evaluating “the ancillary governmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.” ... It is not apparent why this is relevant to the case before us ... Indeed, we expressly ruled [in Austin] that the compelling interest was not one of “‘equaliz[ing] the relative influence of speakers on elections’” ... but rather the need to confront the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electoral advocacy financed by general treasury dollars...45 Bellotti ruled, in an explicit limitation on the scope of its holding, that “our consideration of a corporation’s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.” ... Bellotti, in other words, did not touch the question presented in Austin and McConnell, and the opinion squarely disavowed the proposition for which the majority cites it ... The majority attempts to explain away the distinction Bellotti drew—between general corporate speech and campaign speech intended to promote or prevent the election of specific candidates for office—as inconsistent with the rest of the opinion and with Buckley ... Yet the basis for this distinction is perfectly coherent: The anticorruption interests that animate regulations of corporate participation in candidate elections, the “importance” of which “has never been doubted,” ... do not  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  Citizens United and Corporate Speech 716-039  13 apply equally to regulations of corporate participation in referenda. A referendum cannot owe a political debt to a corporation, seek to curry favor with a corporation, or fear the corporation's retaliation.46 The Bellotti Court confronted a dramatically different factual situation from the one that confronts us in this case: a state statute that barred business corporations’ expenditures on some referenda but not others. Specifically, the statute barred a business corporation “from making contributions or expenditures ‘for the purpose of . . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation’” ... and it went so far as to provide that referenda related to income taxation would not “‘be deemed materially to affect the property, business or assets of the corporation....’” As might be guessed, the legislature had enacted this statute in order to limit corporate speech on a proposed state constitutional amendment to authorize a graduated income tax. The statute was a transparent attempt to prevent corporations from spending money to defeat this amendment, which was favored by a majority of legislators but had been repeatedly rejected by the voters. ... We said that “where, as here, the legislature’s suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended.”47 Bellotti thus involved a viewpoint-discriminatory statute, created to effect a particular policy outcome. Even Justice Rehnquist, in dissent, had to acknowledge that “a very persuasive argument could be made that the [Massachusetts Legislature], desiring to impose a personal income tax but more than once defeated in that desire by the combination of the Commonwealth’s referendum provision and corporate expenditures in opposition to such a tax, simply decided to muzzle corporations on this sort of issue so that it could succeed in its desire.” ... To make matters worse, the law at issue did not make any allowance for corporations to spend money through PACs. ... We acknowledged in Bellotti that numerous “interests of the highest importance” can justify campaign finance regulation. ... But we found no evidence that these interests were served by the Massachusetts law. ... We left open the possibility that our decision might have been different if there had been “record or legislative findings that corporate advocacy threatened imminently to undermine democratic processes, thereby denigrating rather than serving First Amendment interests.”48 Austin and McConnell, then, sit perfectly well with Bellotti. Indeed, all six Members of the Austin majority had been on the Court at the time of Bellotti, and none so much as hinted in Austin that they saw any tension between the decisions. The difference between the cases is not that Austin and McConnell rejected First Amendment protection for corporations whereas Bellotti accepted it. The difference is that the statute at issue in Bellotti smacked of viewpoint discrimination, targeted one class of corporations, and provided no PAC option; and the State has a greater interest in regulating independent corporate expenditures on candidate elections than on referenda, because in a functioning democracy the public must have faith that its representatives owe their positions to the people, not to the corporations with the deepest pockets.49 In sum, over the course of the past century Congress has demonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate participation in candidate elections to “‘[p]reserv[e] the integrity of the electoral process, preven[t] corruption, . . . sustai[n] the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen,’” protect the expressive interests of shareholders,  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  716-039 Citizens United and Corporate Speech  14 and “‘[p]reserv[e] . . . the individual citizen’s confidence in government.’” ... These understandings provided the combined impetus behind the Tillman Act in 1907 ... the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947... FECA in 1971 ... and BCRA in 2002.... Continuously for over 100 years, this line of “[c]ampaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries.” ... Time and again, we have recognized these realities in approving measures that Congress and the States have taken. None of the cases the majority cites is to the contrary. The only thing new about Austin was the dissent, with its stunning failure to appreciate the legitimacy of interests recognized in the name of democratic integrity since the days of the Progressives.50 Corruption On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress’ legitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent on elections from exerting an “‘undue influence on an officeholder's judgment’” and from creating “‘the appearance of such influence,’” beyond the sphere of quid pro quo relationships ... Corruption can take many forms. Bribery may be the paradigm case. But the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not kind. And selling access is not qualitatively different from giving special preference to those who spent money on one's behalf. Corruption operates along a spectrum, and the majority’s apparent belief that quid pro quo arrangements can be neatly demarcated from other improper influences does not accord with the theory or reality of politics. It certainly does not accord with the record Congress developed in passing BCRA, a record that stands as a remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with which corporations, unions, lobbyists, and politicians may go about scratching each other’s backs—and which amply supported Congress’ determination to target a limited set of especially destructive practices.51 The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge to BCRA pored over this record ... “The factual findings of the Court illustrate that corporations and labor unions routinely notify Members of Congress as soon as they air electioneering communications relevant to the Members' elections. The record also indicates that Members express appreciation to organizations for the airing of these election-related advertisements ... Political consultants testify that campaigns are quite aware of who is running advertisements on the candidate's behalf, when they are being run, and where they are being run. Likewise, a prominent lobbyist testifies that these organizations use issue advocacy as a means to influence various Members of Congress. ... After the election, these organizations often seek credit for their support. . . . Finally, a large majority of Americans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other organizations that engage in electioneering communications, which benefit specific elected officials, receive special consideration from those officials when matters arise that affect these corporations and organizations.”52 [T]his broader understanding of corruption has deep roots in the Nation’s history. “During debates on the earliest [campaign finance] reform acts, the terms ‘corruption’ and ‘undue influence’ were used nearly interchangeably”... [W]e have ample evidence to suggest that [the Framers] would have been appalled by the evidence of corruption that Congress unearthed in developing BCRA and that the Court today discounts to irrelevance. It is fair to say that “[t]he Framers were obsessed with corruption,” which they understood to encompass the dependency of public officeholders on private interests  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  Citizens United and Corporate Speech 716-039  15 ... They discussed corruption “more often in the Constitutional Convention than factions, violence, or instability.” When they brought our constitutional order into being, the Framers had their minds trained on a threat to republican self-government that this Court has lost sight of.53 Antidistortion The fact that corporations are different from human beings might seem to need no elaboration, except that the majority opinion almost completely elides it ... Unlike other interest groups, business corporations have been “effectively delegated responsibility for ensuring society's economic welfare”; they inescapably structure the life of every citizen. “‘[T]he resources in the treasury of a business corporation,’” furthermore, “‘are not an indication of popular support for the corporation’s political ideas.’” ... “‘They reflect instead the economically motivated decisions of investors and customers. The availability of these resources may make a corporation a formidable political presence, even though the power of the corporation may be no reflection of the power of its ideas.’” ... It might also be added that corporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires. Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of human beings, to be sure, and their “personhood” often serves as a useful legal fiction. But they are not themselves members of “We the People” by whom and for whom our Constitution was established.54 It is an interesting question “who” is even speaking when a business corporation places an advertisement that endorses or attacks a particular candidate. Presumably it is not the customers or employees, who typically have no say in such matters. It cannot  realistically be said to be the shareholders, who tend to be far removed from the day-to- day decisions of the firm and whose political preferences may be opaque to management.  Perhaps the officers or directors of the corporation have the best claim to be the ones speaking, except their fiduciary duties generally prohibit them from using corporate funds for personal ends. Some individuals associated with the corporation must make the  decision to place the ad, but the idea that these individuals are thereby fostering their self- expression or cultivating their critical faculties is fanciful. It is entirely possible that the  corporation's electoral message will conflict with their personal convictions. Take away the ability to use general treasury funds for some of those ads, and no one’s autonomy, dignity, or political equality has been impinged upon in the least.55 Austin recognized that there are substantial reasons why a legislature might conclude that unregulated general treasury expenditures will give corporations “unfai[r] influence” in the electoral process ... and distort public debate in ways that undermine rather than advance the interests of listeners. The legal structure of corporations allows them to amass and deploy financial resources on a scale few natural persons can match. The structure of a business corporation, furthermore, draws a line between the corporation’s economic interests and the political preferences of the individuals associated with the corporation; the corporation must engage the electoral process with the aim “to enhance the profitability of the company, no matter how persuasive the arguments for a broader or conflicting set of priorities” ... [W]hen corporations grab up the prime broadcasting slots on the eve of an election, they can flood the market with advocacy that bears “little or no correlation” to the ideas of natural persons or to any broader notion of the public good ... The opinions of real people may be marginalized.56  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  716-039 Citizens United and Corporate Speech  16 In addition to this immediate drowning out of noncorporate voices, there may be deleterious effects that follow soon thereafter. Corporate “domination” of electioneering ... can generate the impression that corporations dominate our democracy. When citizens turn on their televisions and radios before an election and hear only corporate electioneering, they may lose faith in their capacity, as citizens, to influence public policy ... To the extent that corporations are allowed to exert undue influence in electoral races, the speech of the eventual winners of those races may also be chilled. Politicians who fear that a certain corporation can make or break their reelection chances may be cowed into silence about that corporation.57 Our colleagues ridicule the idea of regulating expenditures based on “nothing more” than a fear that corporations have a special “ability to persuade,” ... as if corporations were our society’s ablest debaters and viewpoint-neutral laws such as §203 were created to suppress their best arguments ... All of the majority's theoretical arguments turn on a proposition with undeniable surface appeal but little grounding in evidence or experience, “that there is no such thing as too much speech” ... If individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to and contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no special ability to influence elections apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they make any); and if legislators always operated with nothing less than perfect virtue; then I suppose the majority's premise would be sound. In the real world, we have seen, corporate domination of the airwaves prior to an election may decrease the average listener's exposure to relevant viewpoints, and it may diminish citizens’ willingness and capacity to participate in the democratic process...58 In critiquing Austin's antidistortion rationale and campaign finance regulation more generally, our colleagues place tremendous weight on the example of media corporations ... There would be absolutely no reason to consider the issue of media corporations if the majority did not, first, transform Citizens United’s as-applied challenge into a facial challenge and, second, invent the theory that legislatures must eschew all “identity”- based distinctions and treat a local nonprofit news outlet exactly the same as General Motors.59 Shareholder Interest Interwoven with Austin's concern to protect the integrity of the electoral process is a concern to protect the rights of shareholders from a kind of coerced speech: electioneering expenditures that do not "reflec[t] [their] support” ... When corporations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a particular candidate for office, it is the shareholders, as the residual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill. Those shareholders who disagree with the corporation’s electoral message may find their financial investments being used to undermine their political convictions ... The Court dismisses this interest on the ground that abuses of shareholder money can be corrected “through the procedures of corporate democracy,” ... and, it seems, through Internet-based disclosures ... By “corporate democracy,” presumably the Court means the rights of shareholders to vote and to bring derivative suits for breach of fiduciary duty. In practice, however, many corporate lawyers will tell you that “these rights are so limited as to be almost nonexistent,” given the internal authority wielded by boards and managers and the expansive protections afforded by the business judgment rule ... Modern technology may help make it easier to track corporate activity, including electoral advocacy, but it is  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  Citizens United and Corporate Speech 716-039  17 utopian to believe that it solves the problem. Most American households that own stock do so through intermediaries such as mutual funds and pension plans ... which makes it more difficult both to monitor and to alter particular holdings. Studies show that a majority of individual investors make no trades at all during a given year.60 If and when shareholders learn that a corporation has been spending general treasury money on objectionable electioneering, they can divest. Even assuming that they reliably learn as much, however, this solution is only partial. The injury to the shareholders’ expressive rights has already occurred; they might have preferred to keep that corporation’s stock in their portfolio for any number of economic reasons; and they may incur a capital gains tax or other penalty from selling their shares, changing their pension plan, or the like. The shareholder protection rationale has been criticized as underinclusive, in that corporations also spend money on lobbying and charitable contributions in ways that any particular shareholder might disapprove. But those expenditures do not implicate the selection of public officials, an area in which “the interests of unwilling . . . corporate shareholders [in not being] forced to subsidize that speech” “are at their zenith.”61 ”Distinctive Corrupting Potential of Corporate Electioneering” In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on the need to limit corporate campaign spending should outweigh the wooden application of judge-made rules ... At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American  people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self- government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting  potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.62  For use only in Professor Moss’s High School Case Method Project – Not for further distribution – approved by HBP/HBS 2021-2022.  716-039 Citizens United and Corporate Speech  18 Exhibit 1 Sources of Presidential Campaign Funds, 1992-2008 (dollars)  Election Candidate  Federal Matching Funds  Individual Donors  Party Committees and PACs Other  Total Receipts 1992 Bill Clinton (D) 67,776,130 31,072,409 14,651 16,398,345 115,261,535 George H.

(sdl2) attempt at resize-hdpi fix XXIV

There are several issues with how SDL2 windows resize when inside
another windowing system, and depends on the level of HDPI support as
this is not something that cleanly translates between say, OSX, X11 and
Wayland because of insistance on 'Scaling' hacks.

Even if we announce HDPI support, there might be an internal scale
factor applied to the window sizes and so on by SDL itself - and there
is no function to expose the state for that. We can derive it by looking
at the ratio between logical size and window size and then use that to
figure out which dimensions we should actually switch to while retaining
density aware rasterization.

With the comes an ugly edge case in floating point precision, window
size and a possible WM feedback loop in that we pick a size that fits
then get a new hint that is rounded to fit some WM criteria (e.g. %2 ==
0) which causes a new resize and it keeps oscillating.

There are no event cookies available to detect this, so instead a
time-cap is the closest thing to a generalized solution that can be
applied. Actually testing this basically takes drag-resize interactively
on the harder platforms (Quartz, Wayland). Especially with Wayland the
behaviour across compositors is incredibly inconsistent -- perfect storm
of poorly specified behaviour, overly specified interfaces and zero test
cases.

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

"9:20am. I am up.

9:25am. https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/mif2i3/r_on_the_role_of_planning_in_modelbased_deep/

An interesting paper got posted on the RL sub.

9:30am. Let me chill and I will start. My body is starting to feel better. When bad posture starts killing your back, the thing to do is to change your habits and move often, both while being seated and in bed. This is why I often sway while in this seat.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04021
On the role of planning in model-based deep reinforcement learning

Let me read this paper. I'll chill a bit first and then move forward. Yesterday I got Umineko 5-8, but will leave them for later. I think I'll start from 5 since I forgot everything anyway. I must have been a decade since I read the fan translation.

10:20am. Let me start. But before that let me write down the intro poem for Heaven's Key. I thought about it during the night.

$$$

Through a desert a traveller walks
Even as his blood boils into vapor
As his flesh decays and rots
As his bones crumble into dust
He continues moving

As his body dies, he leaves the unneeded behind
And continues moving forward

His soul blazing, he traces out heavy steps
Seeking his goal

Far above
The Herald of the 3 Gods' voice resounds:
Break the Limits! Ignite the Singularity! Pursue Omnipotence!

- Intro to Heaven's Key

$$$

This is a scene from the life of one of the Inspired captured in a poem. The most important thing is not rhyme or cleverness, but capturing the image. It has some wonderful contrast between the harshness of life and the determination of the seeker.

10:40am. This is what the Inspired are.

Forget the Path of Conqueror. I've been destined to step on the Path Of Illusionist from the start. Of course I cannot win so easily. If just making use of some RL algorithm was enough, poker would have long been conquered.

10:50am. Let me start my drawing journey. I'll want to get to at least 2/5 in both graphics and audio before looking into GANs. The goal of the illusionist is to automate as much of his creative process as he can.

Some artists are afraid of machines taking over, but replacing my own effort with theirs is exactly the goal of this path. The less I write, the less I draw and the less I compose, the more successful I can consider myself to be.

Rather than trying to push RL to conquer games, this path aims to master generative models. There is definitely a tie into PPLs here whereas the conqueror's path only has a weak connection.

Given a goal, there are many ways to reach it, and some will be better than others. I chose incorrectly when I picked poker.

On the other hand, if I can master the generative aspects of intelligence, conquering games will be much, much easier. In humans the generative aspects underlie all of their power. The brain is certainly not doing end-to-end RL.

10:55am. Let me start. Where was I yesterday?

11am. Focus me.

https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/tutorials.html
https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/artboards-basics.html

Done with the first two. Since this is just about artboards it is easy as expected. Let me move to the last one.

11:35am. The next are images and effects.

https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/image-effects-basics.html

12pm. Had to take a break. Let me resume.

12:05pm. Done with the first lecture. Let me stop here.

The way it is shaping up in my head, Heaven's Key is going to be the best Simulacrum arc yet. In 2014 it was just a follow up to what I had before, but now I am starting to see its true potential.

Sigh though, can I really expect it to sell? Wouldn't it be nice if it got some attention instead of getting passed over on the global marketplace? That is what will probably happen. It is a tough world out there.

It is like going through a desert. I do not know when the end will come, I can only keep going forward.

When the AI chips come out for sale, I will definitely make up my mind and get a job if I haven't done that yet. The easiest route will be to get back to Z and accept his terms of 2.5k/month assuming he is not full by that time. If he raises it on his own initiative, then I'll be able to trust him. If not, I'll leave after a couple of months after having mastered Julia macrology and PPL construction.

I really do not feel like doing any other jobs than this. Everything else would require me to change my interests.

Though in a year, I will have an expanded skillset. Especially if I master the use of GANs, I might have the opportunity to do paid creative work. It depends on how it goes.

12:15pm. Sigh, I want money, but I sure do not want to work for others. Sigh. Well, I'll get over it at some point. If I did not need to cultivate, things would be easier. Ordinary people can do whatever falls into their lap, but I myself need to guide my development."

## [greghendershott/racket-mode](https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode)@[33ded285f6...](https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode/commit/33ded285f621ef1e8092d3a8be82c02ec4467dda)
#### Tuesday 2021-10-05 14:31:17 by Greg Hendershott

Many enhancements to racket-describe and racket-describe-search

This commit is a squash of a branch with many dozens of commits.

=== racket-describe ===

1. Build/massage shr dom for docs on front end

Previously the back end would read a Racket documentation HTML file,
create an xexpr, convert that to HTML text, and return it to the front
end... which would use libxml-parse-html-region to convert to a shr
"dom", and use shr-insert to add that to the Emacs buffer.

The silly part there is the extra conversion to HTML text and back
again. (It probably made sense in the early days of Racket mode, when
command responses were written into the REPL buffer, and it was more
reliable to handle a single string literal.)

In an interim commit I had the back end directly build the shr dom
needed by the front end. Better. Then I took it a step further: Emacs
is perfectly capable of reading an HTML file to a shr dom, and doing
the same kind of massaging that the back end was doing. (Although
Emacs Lisp pcase is not quite as elegant as Racket match, for the
massaging, it's capable, and the massaging is mostly a non-elegant
pile of hacks, anyway.)

In the common case where we already know the doc path and anchor from
racket-xp-mode having annotated that, this avoids needing to send a
back end command at all. In my testing so far it seems faster;
certainly not slower.

In the remaining cases, we still need to do a back end describe
command. In the case where doc is found, it can simply return the path
and anchor, and the front end loads the same way. Otherwise describe
returns a shr dom describing the signature, type, and/or contract, or
nil if none of those can be found.

2. Render entire doc pages

Previously we would try to return just an excerpt of the HTML -- given
some anchor, return the heading/bluebox for that anchor, up until
another heading/bluebox. The justification of the excerpt approach was
that it could be faster.

Although this worked well for most documentation, it wasn't ideal for
things with very brief descriptions, where the author expected users
could scroll up or down for more context.

Furthermore, racket-describe-search now supports searching any term in
the documentation index (not just exports; see below), and we are now
supporting intra-doc links and anchors (see below). As a result,
sometimes we're returning documentation for things like a techdef.
Here again, sometimes a short section is intended to be understood in
the context of a complete doc page.

As a result, this commit takes the approach of always returning
complete documentation pages. Although this can be slower for very
large doc pages, overall and on balance I think the experience is
better. Certainly it presents the documentation more closely to how
authors expect readers to be able to use it.

Related:

- Show path/anchor in header-line.

- Support extracting the navsettop (top, up, prev, next) links as a
`racket-nav` element to be used as info-mode style navigation
commands.

3. Improve rendering of Racket doc pages

Handle code block tables with single td per row, which is a weird
thing Scribble does, and which shr handles weirdly, by instead
converting them to simple divs. This avoids problems with the initial
line or two of code blocks being indented too much.

Inspect span elements for classes like RktSym, RktVal, and so on, and
use various faces like font-lock-keyword-face and so on.

4. Support intra-doc links

Back end:

- Supply custom HTML tags `racket-anchor`, `racket-doc-link`, and
`racket-ext-link` and for the front end to use.

- Handle all three flavors of local-redirect links.

Front end:

- Support visiting links to other documentation.

- Support forward/back navigation history, including restoring point.

- Add faces to let users customize internal and external links.

=== racket-describe-search ===

1. Name, keybindings

Rename from racket-search-describe to be consistent with e.g.
racket-documentation-search.

Give it a C-c C-s binding in various modes like racket-xp-mode and
racket-repl-mode, as well as racket-describe-mode and
racket-describe-search-mode themselves.

2. Use "streaming" elisp-writeln and thunk for doc index response.

Rather than converting an entire value from Racket to Elisp and
writing that, elisp-writeln now writes the value piece by piece
directly to the current output port.

Furthermore, when a value is a thunk, it calls the thunk which can
elisp-writeln one by one directly out.

Use this capability in the doc-index-names command, which responds
with a very long list of strings. This reduces peak memory use.

Also, refine the front-end UX for racket-search-describe, to wait
about 5 seconds for doc-index-names to respond, otherwise it proceeds
with an empty list of completion candidates. This is a sort of warm
bowl of porridge, in between racket--cmd/async and racket--cmd/await.
Effectively it is a bespoke variation of the latter. (I think this is
probably a good strategy for eliminating the few remaining uses of
racket--cmd/await: Use a timeout amount and default value that is
appropriate for each specific situation -- as opposed to the extremes
of waiting forever or giving a "command timeout" error.)

3. Use xref entry-words

This handles things like for example entries where
exported-index-desc-name is "drracket:unit:frame%" and where
entry-words is a class method name like "add-show-menu-items".

"1:15pm. Let me resume.

1:20pm. Focus me.

I should not get lost in daydreams.

1:30pm. Hmmm, playing with the scribble effect managed to crash Illustrator.

Well, I am done with that particular lecture. What is next?

1:45pm. I am starting to hear thunder in the distance, but it is in the distance. Maybe I won't have to run if I am lucky. Let me watch the last lecture.

1:55pm. https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/sharing-basics.html

I am going to have to run. Let me stop here.

3:30pm. It blew over. Let me resume.

3:45pm. Finally done with Getting Started course. Phew. I hope the other ones will have more hands on tasks. Just memorizing this stuff is boring.

What is next?

https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/tutorials.html

I'll skip the IPad tutorials.

What are next are the various artwork tutorials. I'll start with Beginner's drawing.

3:55pm. Focus me, stop reading Twitter.

4pm. Oh, the pen tool really is powerful. It was exactly what I was hoping for. I could create all sorts of lines with it precisely.

4:05pm. Next are paintbrush and pencil.

4:30pm. https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/use-pen-tool.html

These tutorials are more fun to me. But before I move to them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2hm544loqc
Lineart vs. Painting】 Digital Art for Beginners

Let me watch this. Should I maybe using Corel Painter instead of illustrator?

https://youtu.be/F2hm544loqc?t=39

This one is really good. I guess I do not have to fear about vector art being bad.

5pm. Let me resume the Illustrator tutorials. Laovaan is just too good. At least 4/5 and probably 5/5 in skill.

I personally would rather develop a style where I patiently put the points in all the right places as if I were programming. My main problem is that I can't get the proportions right, and that is the first challenge that I need to overcome.

Now focus me. The Pen tool.

5:20pm. Done with the first one.

https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/tutorials.html
https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/pen-tool-exercises.html

Now comes this one. How many do I have left? 3 more including this one.

5:35pm. https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/edit-paths-you-draw.html

Next is this one.

5:55pm. Let me go for lunch.

I am messing around with the example.

6:40pm. Let me resume.

https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/draw-content-behind-and-inside.html

I'll leave this one for tomorrow, let me close here for the day. Tomorrow, I'll deal with the art style videos.

I ended up starting too late today, and then I was interrupted for 1.5 hours by the weather.

6:50pm. I am too tired to continue now. I am going to get through these tutorials in the next few days if possible and then get serious about tracing some stuff. Right now, I am just getting familiar with the basic features of the Illustrator program. I haven't really been pushing my drawing ability upward.

I need to get on with it. The better my art is, the higher the chance of Heaven's Key selling well. Can I get good? I can only take a risk and give it a try."

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

sched/core: Implement new approach to scale select_idle_cpu()

Hackbench recently suffered a bunch of pain, first by commit:

  4c77b18cf8b7 ("sched/fair: Make select_idle_cpu() more aggressive")

and then by commit:

  c743f0a5c50f ("sched/fair, cpumask: Export for_each_cpu_wrap()")

which fixed a bug in the initial for_each_cpu_wrap() implementation
that made select_idle_cpu() even more expensive. The bug was that it
would skip over CPUs when bits were consequtive in the bitmask.

This however gave me an idea to fix select_idle_cpu(); where the old
scheme was a cliff-edge throttle on idle scanning, this introduces a
more gradual approach. Instead of stopping to scan entirely, we limit
how many CPUs we scan.

Initial benchmarks show that it mostly recovers hackbench while not
hurting anything else, except Mason's schbench, but not as bad as the
old thing.

It also appears to recover the tbench high-end, which also suffered like
hackbench.
