Reduce unmounts when hiding DevTool panes

This started as an investigation into
https://github.com/RecordReplay/devtools/issues/3851. Toggling the
visibility of the Editor was triggering an unmount and remount of
basically every component in the DevView. DevView had 4 different
branches, each with *slightly* different rendering trees, based on which
components (editor, video, both, neither) were open. This was a lot of
complexity *and* it actually didn't capture all of the options (because
the user can also toggle whether or not the sidebar was open).

I cleaned it up by simplifying that render tree so that it's always the
same child components inside of the `SplitBox`. There is still one place
where changing a view causes an unmount and remount which is inside of
`Viewer`. This is because in the vertical view the video is the
`startComponent` (because vertical SplitBoxes flow top-to-bottom), but
in the horizontal view the video is supposed to be the *endComponent*
(because horizontal SplitBoxes flow left-to-right). I thought I would be
clever and just add `flex-direction: row-reverse` in the horizontal case
but that caused a really horrible UI bug where trying to slide the
component to make it bigger actually made it smaller and vice versa. I
was far enough down the rabbit-hole by this point that I didn't want to
spend any more time going that route.

This change also addresses
https://github.com/RecordReplay/devtools/issues/3746. It looks like
previously viewer mode stored a panel split size in
`nonDevSidePanelWidth`, but the function that sets that was no longer
called, so I've removed that setting. Instead, both places where
`SidePanel` is rendered now pull from and write to the setting
`sidePanelSize`, in the new `prefs` file. This means that when you
navigate between DevTools and Viewer mode the width of the side panel
will remain the same.

I cannot tell if this is fully intended, but it works quite well in my
testing. Consider the following case, where the container is a SplitBox
flowing left-to-right, with component A being the controlled component
(which means component B has flex-grow on it and will take up whatever
space A leaves open):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5903784/135940611-c07e8b12-cf82-468f-9073-7a18e8f8b965.png)

Let's also say that component A might not be visible right now, in which
case we want component B to take up its space, ignoring the partition.
Rather than doing this:

```
if (!componentA) {
 return componentB;
} else {
  return <SplitBox left={componentA} right={componentB}/>
}
```

You can do something like this:

```
return <SplitBox left={componentA} right={componentB} maxWidth={componentA ? "auto" : "0px"}/>
```

This says "give me a SplitBox that contains these two components, but if
this one doesn't exist, then make sure it doesn't take up any space".
Without code like this, it's actually pretty difficult to avoid having
many different `if` checks in the render statements or having accidental
gaps in the UI where the SplitBox is making room for an element that
doesn't exist.

This gives us the following:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5903784/135941252-b0be4582-ef85-4e20-912e-0171a9a5f397.mp4

I think this is in a pretty nice state for the user interface, but I
don't love how it feels to code UI's like this with the nested
SplitBoxes. I think a future we should move towards, particularly for
layouts like DevTools, is a CSS grid, where the drag events just change
the CSS, rather than the react state, and things can be moved from panel
to panel by just changing their grid number. That's a much larger
undertaking.

Remove honeycomb. I don't know how to use it and it's expensive with my traffic.

Resources from the honeycomb folks in slack:

Kent C. Dodds Today at 12:51 PM
Hi friends :wave:  I added honeycomb to my node.js site and now that it's launched and gets over 50k page views a day I'm going way over my limit. Thing is that I don't know how to make use of honeycomb. I pretty much just want to be notified whenever there are unusual things going on (lots of 404s, long response times, etc). I've got the basic telemetry stuff set up. The dashboard seems like it's only usable by someone who knows what they're doing and that's definitely not me. Anyone got tips?

if you're going way over your limit, you may want to look into setting up a refinery server so you can do trace-level sampling to rule out "uninteresting" traces

Levi Wilson  10 minutes ago
and start with setting up specific "interesting" requests you'd like to see

re: the dashboard, you might want to go into your schema definitions to define things like what it means for a "route" so the home screen will be more useful (as well as "errors", "users", etc.)

Cool, thanks for the resources and ideas :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)

+1 for rule sampling

one concern you might have, however, with refinery is if you've that much traffic...adequately sizing it will be important

arp: Do not fill cache from random packets.

On paper this looks great, and in a sane network it should work.
However the world out there is full of horribly broken, screwed up
networks, which *of course* ruin this.

I've seen a customer's network where the router is IP 192.168.1.1,
MAC addr xx:03. However, every 1 minute the router broadcasts some
"mikrotik discovery" UDP garbage with source IP 192.168.1.1, source MAC
addr xx:02 (one less!). This accidentally poisons smoltcp's ARP cache,
which then sends all traffic for the default gateway to xx:02, which
unsurprisingly blackholes it.

And, of course, the broadcast is every 1min and the ARP cache lifetime
is 1min. This means the cache is almsot all the time poisoned, and the
smoltcp device barely works. Fantastic.

Screw you mikrotik.
