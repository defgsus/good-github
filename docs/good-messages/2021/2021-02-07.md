New data: 2021-02-06: SEE ONTARIO DATA NOTES.

Recent changes:

2021-01-27: Due to the limit on file sizes in GitHub, we implemented some changes to the datasets today, mostly impacting individual-level data (cases and mortality). Changes below:

1) Individual-level data (cases.csv and mortality.csv) have been moved to a new directory in the root directory entitled “individual_level”. These files have been split by calendar year and named as follows: cases_2020.csv, cases_2021.csv, mortality_2020.csv, mortality_2021.csv. The directories “other/cases_extra” and “other/mortality_extra” have been moved into the “individual_level” directory.
2) Redundant datasets have been removed from the root directory. These files include: recovered_cumulative.csv, testing_cumulative.csv, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv, vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv, vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv. All of these datasets are currently available as time series in the directory “timeseries_prov”.
3) The file codebook.csv has been moved to the directory “other”.

We appreciate your patience and hope these changes cause minimal disruption. We do not anticipate making any other breaking changes to the datasets in the near future. If you have any further questions, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to us by email at ccodwg [at] gmail [dot] com. Thank you for using the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets.

- 2021-01-24: The columns "additional_info" and "additional_source" in cases.csv and mortality.csv have been abbreviated similar to "case_source" and "death_source". See note in README.md from 2021-11-27 and 2021-01-08.

Vaccine datasets:

- 2021-01-19: Fully vaccinated data have been added (vaccine_completion_cumulative.csv, timeseries_prov/vaccine_completion_timeseries_prov.csv, timeseries_canada/vaccine_completion_timeseries_canada.csv). Note that this value is not currently reported by all provinces (some provinces have all 0s).
- 2021-01-11: Our Ontario vaccine dataset has changed. Previously, we used two datasets: the MoH Daily Situation Report (https://www.oha.com/news/updates-on-the-novel-coronavirus), which is released weekdays in the evenings, and the “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-data-in-ontario), which is released every day in the mornings. Because the Daily Situation Report is released later in the day, it has more up-to-date numbers. However, since it is not available on weekends, this leads to an artificial “dip” in numbers on Saturday and “jump” on Monday due to the transition between data sources. We will now exclusively use the daily “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” dataset. Although our numbers will be slightly less timely, the daily values will be consistent. We have replaced our historical dataset with “COVID-19 Vaccine Data in Ontario” as far back as they are available.
- 2020-12-17: Vaccination data have been added as time series in timeseries_prov and timeseries_hr.
- 2020-12-15: We have added two vaccine datasets to the repository, vaccine_administration_cumulative.csv and vaccine_distribution_cumulative.csv. These data should be considered preliminary and are subject to change and revision. The format of these new datasets may also change at any time as the data situation evolves.

Revise historical data: cases (AB, MB, ON, QC, SK). Vaccine distribution numbers have been updated retroactively as well.

2021-02-02: ONTARIO DATA REPORTING MAY HAVE UNUSUAL NUMBERS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. SEE BELOW. https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-ontario-is-responding-covid-19

“Toronto Public Health has now migrated all of their data to the provincial data system, CCM. This migration has impacted today’s daily counts. Most notably, TPH’s case count is negative following the identification of duplicate cases as well as data corrections to some fields (e.g., long-term care home residents and health care workers), resulting in an underestimation of today's cases. In addition, case counts for other PHUs may have been affected by system outages related to the migration. As a result, we anticipate fluctuations in case numbers over the next few days.”

Note regarding deaths added in QC today: “The data also report 27 new deaths, but the total of deaths amounts to 9,999 due to the withdrawal of 1 death that the investigation has shown not to be attributable to COVID-19. Among these 27 deaths, 9 have occurred in the last 24 hours, 16 have occurred between January 30 and February 4 and 2 have occurred at an unknown date.” We report deaths such that our cumulative regional totals match today’s values. This sometimes results in extra deaths with today’s date when older deaths are removed.

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/#c47900

Note about SK data: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon it becomes possible to do so.

Summary
This lab contains four exercises. Please write clear and well commented code. Topics covered today: More Loops and (File I/O next week). We will also continue to practice and improve on branching and keyboard input with Scanner.

In a class called Lab5, implement all of the following methods as specified.

Part 1
Suppose you find a magic $1.00 coin. Its magic power is as follows: as each day passes, you get an additional dollar plus half of what you already had (it appears by the window somehow). Write a method called getRichQuick (no input is necessary for this method) that prints the first n days while your total is less than $1,000,000 dollars. In other words, how many days does it take for you to earn $1,000,000? Your program should calculate these numbers and print the following output:


    Day 1: $1
    Day 2: $1 + ($1 + .50) = $2.50
    Day 3: $2.50 + ($1 + 1.25) = $4.75
    ...
    Day N: $X + ($1 + Y) >= $1000000
  
Part 2
Write a method called eTaylor that takes as input (i.e. argument) a double x and returns the value of LaTeX: e^xe x. This method should NOT use any Math library functions, so you will need to use Taylor Series for LaTeX: e^xe x (loop until terms become close to 0, say 10e-16):

LaTeX: e^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+...e x = 1 + x + x 2 2 ! + x 3 3 ! + x 4 4 ! + . . .

Hint: You are given a helper method in the template that finds the nth power of a number x, divided by LaTeX: n!=n\cdot\left(n-1\right)\cdot\left(n-2\right)\cdot...\cdot2\cdot1n ! = n ⋅ ( n − 1 ) ⋅ ( n − 2 ) ⋅ . . . ⋅ 2 ⋅ 1 that is, your helper method accepts an x, and n and outputs LaTeX: \frac{x^n}{n!}x n n ! Your method eTaylor will return the value of

LaTeX: \sum_{n\:=\:0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}∑ n = 0 ∞ x n n !

Part 3
Hint: User will enter certain number of random words, you need to read the input as string and evaluate based on the following instructions.

Write a void method called palindromeCheck that takes NO argument. The method should have functionality to check whether or not the word is a palindrome and print to the screen all of the palindromes, one per line. Also, the last line of the output should have the message: “There are x palindromes out of y words provided by user” (where x is the number of palindrome words detected, and y is the totalPreview the document number of words entered by user). Hint: for this lab exercise you will need the following methods on String objects: length() gives the length of a string (that is, the number of characters it contains) and charAt(i) - gives the character at position i. For example:


    String word = "bob";
    int sizeOfString = word.length() //should be 3
    char firstChar = word.charAt(0) //should be 'b'
  
Sample output (user input in blue):


    Enter any number of words separated by whitespace. 
    bob bobcat racecar taco cattaco tacocat
    bob
    racecar
    tacocat
    There are 3 palindromes out of 6 words provided by user
Part 4
In main, write a menu that allows a user of your program to select and run the programs you wrote in the methods above. The user should be able to play with your methods a many times as they want and only exit the program if they want to exit. For example:


    Welcome to Lab5!
    Enter 1 to check how long it takes to get rich on a magic dollar coin.
    Enter 2 to calculate e^x for any real x.
    Enter 3 to enter palindrome words.
    Enter 4 to re-print the menu.
    Enter 0 to exit.
    What is your choice?
    2
    Enter an x:
    1
    e^1 = 2.7182818284590452

    What is your choice?
    0
    Thanks for participating! Goodbye.
  
Note that the method from part 2 did not have you asking for keyboard input. Do NOT go back and modify your method from part, instead handle the request for keyboard input (to get the x) in main after the user has made their choice.

Part 5
Debugging

Debugging your code is a valuable time-saving and problem-solving technique, and is easy to do in both BlueJ and Eclipse. Learn how to set a breakpoint (usually in the “gutter” of the code window, a column to the left) in your software and how to execute your code in “debug mode” so that your software pauses execution at each breakpoint. Using this technique, one can pause execution and inspect the values of variables. Debug any of the previous code you have written in this lab, and determine intermediate values of loop variables as they execute.

Final Part
Remember to submit your Lab5.java code to Canvas! Also, don’t forget to comment your code and practice good spacing!

C Code formatting

Code formatting commits are annoying because they cause a giant
pain point in the history around which rebases and merges are
difficult.  Now is an opportune time to do it with so much else in
flux.

My coding style has evolved over the years, but I've generally
stuck to my years-old style for self-consistency here.  I've also
been inconsistent about style issues that matter less to me.  The
real sin here, though, is this repo not having a defined coding
style with a check/correct tool at all, which has allowed lots of
other minor issues to creep in.

With this commit, I've made some arbitrary-but-reasonable choices
that can be forced with "astyle" (using version 2.06), and added
some qa scripts for checking/correcting, applied astyle's fixups,
and then manually corrected the places where the fixes looked ugly
and/or wrong to the point where both astyle and I are
reasonably-happy with the final output.

WIP: Fix downgrades in apt_package

`apt_package` never even looks at `new_resource.version` when deciding
what version to install. That's silly.

This fixes that. It requires the version be exact (as the `yum_package`
did for most of Chef's history), and if you specify a non-existent
version, it'll raise an exception.

The unit tests for this provider are a bit of a mess, so I kinda stuck
in the tests where I could.

Don't merge yet - want to do some real-life testing, the only testing
here was with the unit tests.

Timeout getInfo after 5 seconds

This call should be very quick. It is the first all that cockpit-podman does.
Unfortunately often the first call gets stuck, see:
https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8762
https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9251

When the call is stuck, the whole page is stuck in `Loading...`. When we
just reject it, the `Loading...` state moves on and we are presented
with alert to 'Start' the service. Clicking the button does the trick.

It is kind of hacky, but I think it is more user friendly then just
being stuck on a page.

"9:10am. Right now I am chilling. But I'll get to start early today either way.

9:20am. Well, let me have some fun for a while. The papers can wait.

The truth is, I did think about doing pure Python for a while, but seeing those 500 lines models in the OpenSpiel repo is what changed my mind. I have to use Spiral if nothing else, but for top-down typing.

9:45am. A lot of my follows are out today. Why do both Ex-Arm and Crow Record have such low res scans?

10:05am. Enough slacking. It is time to get into the mood for this.

It has been ages since I read ML papers last.

Though it seems like a waste not to use the OpenSpiel library directly, as far as the algorithms themselves are concerned, I can borrow their skeleton and imitate their form in my own work. That will speed up my own work significantly. The C++ games I'll have to do on my own though - that code is too low quality to use as reference. The UI stuff will be my innovation, but I am not sure how GUIs will work on Python. I am worried the GIL lock might make a mess of everything.

I know that Python has Rx as a library, but not much more than that. I really hope Python has something better for GUIs than Gtk. That one is pure garbage and I know that it is the main GUI library.

10:15am. Focus me. Let me start this thing.

This is my usual pace when I am not waking up at 11am.

Think me. Where do I start today?

How about with Noah Brown's stuff?

https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10442
Unlocking the Potential of Deep Counterfactual Value Networks

I am looking him up on Arxiv.

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~noamb/research.html

Here is his personal page.

Let me start with the DCVN paper and then I will move from there.

> These improvements include an equilibrium-finding algorithm that achieves a far better empirical convergence rate than past algorithms, an efficient GPU-based implementation of this algorithm, more iterations resulting in much closer convergence to an equilibrium when conducting search, a larger search space, and far more training data

> an efficient GPU-based implementation of this algorithm

Yeah, this is what I need. I should just go with this. Although OpenSpiel has a lot of stuff, a lot of it is outdated despite being a year old.

> We measure the impact of each of these changes in the benchmark game of HUNL

Heads Up No Limit? Yes, exactly what I want. This is the one thing I need to master first. This paper should serve as the foothold.

> Our reimplementation of DeepStack closely follows what was described in the paper

I bet I could find a DeepStack PyTorch implementation somewhere.

> Supremus has several improvements over existing methods, including our modified CFR variant DCFR+, neural networks on all lookahead trees, and a complete end-to-end GPU implementation.

End-to-end? What does that mean?

> Specifically, we modify the DCFR algorithm so that rather than having iteration t receive a weight of t2 when computing the average policy, it instead receives a weight of max{0, t − d}

This is an interesting way of doing the weighting.

> Surprisingly, we observed faster convergence when updating both players simultaneously rather than alternating when a counterfactual value network is used at leaf nodes, while the opposite has historically been observed when not using counterfactual value networks.

> Supremus is a custom implementation written in CUDA with C++ to run entirely on a GPU. It has custom kernels optimized to achieve optimal performance and throughput. It has a single on-ramp to load the initial tree into GPU memory and an off-ramp when DCFR+ is complete. This allows the software to never move memory in and out of the GPU, greatly reducing the memory latency during run-time. When comparing the speed of the two implementations using the same action abstraction on the flop, Supremus completes 1,000 iterations in 0.8 seconds, over 6x faster than DeepStack. The faster GPU implementation combined with the use of DCFR+ results in Supremus achieving an exploitability of 3 mbb/g over 5,000x faster on the same hardware.

Maybe I will be making that Cuda backend. Though I wonder if there will be code for this paper. Noah Brown does not provide it, but maybe this group will though it is unlikely.

10:50am. Ok, I've read the paper, and where are the actual details of the methods? There are just a bunch of benchmarks here.

10:55am. Supremus uses this or that rather then the regular thing? This is not a description of the algorithm. What a crappy paper. The authors did not even leave their email for me to contact them.

Nevermind this advert for Minimal AI. Maybe I will find a way to get the author's email if I am particularly desperate.

Let me move to Brown's stuff.

DREAM - Deep Regret Minimization with Advantage Baselines and Model-free Learning
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10410.pdf

> However, in order to deploy tabular CFR in domains with very large state spaces, domain-specific abstraction techniques that bucket similar states together are needed [11, 3]. While these abstraction techniques have been successful in poker, they require extensive domain knowledge to construct and are not applicable to all games. This has motivated the development of CFR algorithms that use neural network function approximation to generalize with far less domain knowledge.

Yes, this is why I want to use NNs.

> However, the existing forms of neural CFR only perform well with an exact simulator of the game, which allows them to sample and explore multiple actions at a decision point and thereby reduce variance. We show they perform poorly if only a single action is sampled, which is necessary in a model-free setting.

And this is what I was afraid of if I just picked Deep CFR.

2/14. I'll parse this formal stuff more in depth later. I used to be familiar with this, and need to reinit myself.

> Deep CFR is a fully parameterized variant of CFR that requires no tabular sampling [4]. Deep CFR substantially outperformed NFSP (which in turn outperforms or closely matches competing algorithms [31]). Single Deep CFR (SD-CFR) [32] removed the need for an average network in Deep CFR and thereby enabled better convergence and more time- and space-efficient training. However, both Deep CFR and Single Deep CFR rely on a perfect simulator of the game to explore multiple actions at each decision point.

So it explores multiple actions, but not necessarily all of them? Something like that could be expected.

11:10am. 4/14. Here the paper mentions VR-MC-CFR. Did they manage to integrate these advancements into this NN version?

This paper is a great review. It really gives me a lot to work with. I'll make it my target then. Deep CFR already exists in the OpenSpiel repo, and this will accelerate me getting up to speed.

> In this section, we will describe DREAM, (D)eep (RE)gret minimization with (A)dvantage Baselines and (M)odel-free learning. The primary contribution of this paper is to effectively combine a deep neural network approximation of outcome sampling CFR with learned baselines.

Yes, this is what I need.

> Potential adverse applications most prominently include providing easy access to tools that aid cheating in online imperfect-information games with our open-sourced implementation of DREAM.

They provide an implementation of this? Let me see if I can find it.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10410

Ah, there is a code section here!

https://github.com/EricSteinberger/DREAM

Here it is. Since the CFR guys are Facebook, they should be using PyTorch as well.

...Nope, the previous paper I've read has no code.

https://github.com/EricSteinberger/PokerRL

Change of plans yet again. This guy has everything, from the algorithm to the environment.

I was mentally ready to do things on my own, but I swore to myself to change my attitude, so I'll use this for the time being.

https://github.com/EricSteinberger/DREAM#dream-on-your-local-machine

It supports only Linux officially.

11:35am. Ok, let me clone this repo and then I will take a break.

After that is done, I'll move to studying it. After that I'll focus on getting it to run.

I'll decide what do I want to do after that."

feat(codeWars): :sparkles: Bloody planes... Making me walk in past the business class 'suites' and back into cattle class.  As we all know, leg room is the major issue. In this kata, you will assess the level of comfort an individual will experience in their flight.  You will be given the individual's height in cms (a), and a string that represents the properties of their seat (b).  It is expected that a person's leg length accounts for 55% (use Math.floor) of their height, and that for a person to be 'comfortable' their leg room on an aeroplane must be at least 15% more than their leg length.  If the figure is more than 25% leg length they have 'super comfy' seats, and if it is less than 15% it is just classed as 'ouch'.  The amount of leg room can be calculated by the number of consonants in the provided seat string 'b'. Each counts for 2cm of room.  You should return the comfort rating as a string.  In the case that the seat string has a 00 value within it - there is a hole in the seat in front! return 'Jackpot!', relax and put your legs through! Note this value is zero zero, not the letter O.  Note the seat string will only contain lower case letters and possibly the magic "00" value.

Upgrade to wxPython 4.1

Upgrading for a few reasons:
 - Allows us to drop the PNG optimization step before running a wizard.
   Note that I kept pngcrush around - it's stuck in our history either
   way, so I'd rather put it to use by adding an option for optimizing
   PNGs to BAIN projects.
 - Allows us to add high DPI support (ref #555).
 - Keeping up with breaking wx changes is a good idea (e.g. the
   alignment flags change).
 - wx.ListCtrl (which is probably the most important widget we use) got
   a major rework in 4.1.x by becoming native. It looks quite different
   and we should get testing done to see if anything breaks with it.

Note that 4.1.0 is the last py2 version of wxPython, 4.1.1 is already
py3 only.

wx4.1 build fixes

Whew, adding yet more DLLs to this stupid field...

Fix the hideous white background on wx4.1

These came back from wx2.8 - I guess wx.NullColour was changed?

Add PyMuPDF to requirements.txt

Still completely optional, but recommended since it allows the Doc
Browser to display PDFs as well. The wxPython pdfViewer was broken on
wx4.0, but works fine on wx4.1.

Note: newer versions of PyMuPDF advertise that they are compatible with
py2 on pypi, but 1.18.0 is the last version for which wheels are
available - and manually building this lib is an absolute pain.

Note2: see ugly CI workaround in requirements.txt/setup.py

Closes #553

"12:45pm. Let me resume. Done with breakfast and chores. Let me make a tour of the DREAM repo. I need to do an evaluation of how much of the code is usable straight up.

...Ok, I do not see Tensorflow in the requirements. It uses Torch. This is good.

1pm. I am looking at `EvalAgentDeepCFR.py`. It is 470 lines long.

Honestly, if I was writing Python I don't know whether I would be able to do better than this. I just don't.

But I am going to have to pick this stuff apart and reimplement it on my own. I can only use this as reference.

1:15pm. I am looking at `_HighLevelAlgo.py`.

This stuff is so complex. It is quite amazing.

1:35pm. Let me finish the tour quickly and then I will gather my thoughts. I am not really studying this. Right now I am just seeing the sights.

1:45pm. Let me think.

People worry about AI taking over the world, but in the case of poker, can you imagine anybody just taking this and going on a rampage? I sure can't!

Life is not that easy. Reading the DREAM paper, you'd think it would be an easy thing to write, but the amount of code associated with the paper is enormous. I can't deal with this.

My only choice is to rebuild it on my own. Only then would I be able to master this.

As a kid part of the reason I did not want to become a programmer is because of this. It requires so much dedication and there are no shortcuts to success.

But at least it gives me a target.

1:50pm. With that paper, I have no reason to fail at the task of making a good poker agent apart from lack of perseverance.

Maybe I will get nowhere in 2021. But I am sure that 2021 will be the year where I pay my dues to Python. I ignored and looked down on it far too much. The language might get bashed, but none in the world opposed it as much as I did. I put so much of my time in making Spiral, so I would not need to use it.

Now is the time to open my mouth and take a bite.

1:55pm. I'll have to pay a price in the time spent doing this.

2pm. After seeing that codebase, I do not feel like starting with the agent itself after all. Instead I will start with the game.

```fs
    member t.Add(x: 'a): ConsedNode<'a> =
        let hkey = hash x &&& Int32.MaxValue
        let table = table
        let bucket = table.[hkey % Array.length table]
        let sz = bucket.Count
```

My thoughts are wondering. I started thinking about serialization.

```fs
    member t.Add(x: 'a): ConsedNode<'a> =
        let hkey = hash x
        let table = table
        let bucket = table.[(hkey &&& Int32.MaxValue) % Array.length table]
```

It would be better if I hashed it like so. No need to throw out the last bit.

```fs
open System
let x = Int32.MinValue |> abs
```

Yeah, this throws an exception.

I'll have to test this change. I'll do it later. I am decently sure it will work. The hash cons table has not changed for years, funny how improvements can come to mind.

2:10pm. I need a short break.

I should start work on Leduc, but I am actually depressed now. I started out quite eager, but whether it is DREAM or OpenSpiel, there is so much I do not understand in them.

In constrast, right now I could be working on things like the Cuda backend or a C backend which would be a lasting benefit for the language.

Instead I have to tackle this great challenge. The fact that there are game libraries changes nothing. I have to adapt it for myself.

2:35pm. There is no helping it. Let me just start. Let me test the latest change.

...It crashes.

```fs
let bucket = table'.[hash a % table_length']
```

It is probably because of this. Now it works fine. This will be a decent optimization for the `HashCons` table. Ok.

I'll hold off making this a patch. Instead let me start work on a HU poker game. I'll pick Leduc poker.

...Actually, let me just push this out. Now I don't need to think about this.

2:40pm. Who knows what kinds of compiler bugs I'll find in the future. This work on a game will be my chance to stress test Spiral further. And who knows, I might be able to use this chance to make some articles and raise my profile.

In two days I'll make some time to take a trip to the bank at around 4pm.

This is destiny. Let me get cracking.

2:45pm. Right now my mood is at the bottom, it is a complete difference to yesterday's aggressive demeanor, but I will get things back on track.

In the first place, I was not expecting that I would be able to just copy paste these things.

Of course doing this would take time. And of course I am going to do it.

2:50pm. Let me do a week of this and then I'll get back to interviewing.

2:55pm. Focus me. What are the rules for Leduc poker.

https://medium.com/ai-in-plain-english/building-a-poker-ai-part-8-leduc-holdem-and-a-more-generic-cfr-algorithm-in-python-9dd036bf9a30

What is this?

> It is played with 6 cards: 2 Jacks, 2 Queens, and 2 Kings.

It is not what I thought it was. I thought it was Holdem without 2-10 cards.

> The game we will play this time is Leduc Hold’em, which was first introduced in the 2012 paper “Bayes’ Bluff: Opponent Modelling in Poker”. It is played with 6 cards: 2 Jacks, 2 Queens, and 2 Kings. The suits don’t matter, so let us just use hearts (h) and diamonds (d). Each player gets dealt a hole card and posts a 1$ ante. There will be 2 betting rounds, each with a maximum of 2 raise actions. So the possible actions are raise or check if acting first in a betting round, re-raise/call/fold if faced with a raise, and call or fold if faced with a re-raise. The raise sizes are 2$ in the first betting round and 4$ in the second betting round. After the first betting round, a community card will be revealed.

This seems like a decent article.

3:05pm. Let me take some time to go through this series.

3:10pm. The article ended with saying that it will show how to do Hold'Em next, but did not come out, and probably won't at this rate.

Well, nevermind. It got me the rules of Leduc poker at least.

I just have to get to work on implementing it.

3:30pm. I am thinking about it. Usually, my aggression would be higher, but now my mood is low. Think about it for a bit will help me get into it.

Let me open a new file.

```
nominal card = u8

type player_hole_cards = P1: card P2: card
union state_first_round =
    | HoleCards: player_hole_cards

inl main() =
    ()
```

If I want to be able to make a function of `state * action -> state'` I need to represent the entire state using an union type.

3:50pm.

```
nominal card = u8

union response3 next = Fold | Call: next
union response2 next = Fold | Call: next | Reraise: response3 next
union response1 next = Call: next | Raise: response2 next
union action next = Check: response1 next | Raise: response2 next
type state_second_round = CommunityCard: card Action: action ()
type state_first_round = HoleCards: (P1: card P2: card ) Action: action state_second_round

inl main() =
    ()
```

I get it.

3:55pm. I need to get my aggressive demeanor and confidence back on track. I was brilliant while I was working on that Cython ref counting pass.

This on the other hand is nothing in terms of difficulty.

Let me make the transition function.

4:05pm. Now I am thinking how to sample from an array.

6:05pm. Done with lunch. It is not like I am being lazy here, but once I set my mind on the problem of doing the game and later integrating it, I went deep into thought. The screen in front of me went black twice while I was thinking.

I know what the problem is.

I am going back to my past experiences of doing CFR and ML, but those experiences aren't what I need here. Those are the wrong experiences! The right one is my work on editor support for Spiral. I spent plenty of time thinking how to chain together communicating servers and then I figured out how to reason on about the problem in terms of gradual transformations.

Up to now, once I started work on Leduc poker, just because the game is easy I started thinking that the whole task should be easy, but that is not it. The game itself is like 10% of the whole job.

It is just like working on compiler. It is easy enough to do some compiler pass, but having to deal with the residuals of that like errors and editor support, makes things a lot harder.

6:15pm. With Leduc poker, it is easy enough to imagine the state transitions in the game and even implement it.

But the game is absolutely secondary here. I want the game to produce data that NNs can use.

I need a functional architecture here. I need to go back to my experiences of implementing streams.

When I was doing those CFR games, I had an easy time because I CPS'd everything, but that is not the right thing to do here. I need to invert that.

6:20pm. The benefit of all of this will be that I will be doing things those ML library authors cannot even imagine. I can see the potential of this. Doing this is not something that would be easy without top-down typing or functional programming features.

I am going to make it so that the purpose of a game is to produce a list of observations for both of the players.

Now, compared to tabular RL there are extra requirements for NNs. When it comes to serialization I mean. And I need to think about how to batch the data. I can't do it one at a time like in 2018.

All these transformations do amount to essentially being compiler passes. And that is the ideal way to model them.

I wonder if Python has immutable maps and such. I'll need to get them from somewhere. At worst, I'll dig them out of the F# repo.

Right now, I basically have nothing of the standard library. I don't even have Python's tuples, the fact that I have my custom made ones hurts interop. For the time being though, I'll go the route of implementing my own sampling functions and such.

6:30pm. With hashing...I am going to have to put the ops back in. Or rather, I need a check to make sure they operate only on primitives. I do not want Python reference types to mix with structurals.

```
            elif prototype_has `(`a) hashable then hashable `(`a) a
            else error_type "The input must be hashable."
```

6:35pm. Yes, this is right.

...

The issues I am thinking about here are really not related to the game in front of me at all. The same architectural problems is something I would need to deal with in any future games. Leduc poker is dead simple, but that does not change the architectural challenges at all. No wonder that guy gave up on Texas Holdem. It is easy enough to do CFR on a toy. NNs on a larger game are a different ball game.

If you pick the wrong approach and just start hacking, the complexity will drown you.

This is where real skill comes into play. It allows you to abstract the unneeded.

6:40pm. Maybe I will have article material in the future. I am going to take this challenge.

Today was full of ups and downs. I was really happy in the morning when I saw that DREAM has a code repo. Than I was sad once I looked at it. Then I had to talk myself into just doing the game. But now that I am thinking about the challenges here, I see that they are worthy of me."

x86/apic: Add extra serialization for non-serializing MSRs

Jan Kiszka reported that the x2apic_wrmsr_fence() function uses a plain
MFENCE while the Intel SDM (10.12.3 MSR Access in x2APIC Mode) calls for
MFENCE; LFENCE.

Short summary: we have special MSRs that have weaker ordering than all
the rest. Add fencing consistent with current SDM recommendations.

This is not known to cause any issues in practice, only in theory.

Longer story below:

The reason the kernel uses a different semantic is that the SDM changed
(roughly in late 2017). The SDM changed because folks at Intel were
auditing all of the recommended fences in the SDM and realized that the
x2apic fences were insufficient.

Why was the pain MFENCE judged insufficient?

WRMSR itself is normally a serializing instruction. No fences are needed
because the instruction itself serializes everything.

But, there are explicit exceptions for this serializing behavior written
into the WRMSR instruction documentation for two classes of MSRs:
IA32_TSC_DEADLINE and the X2APIC MSRs.

Back to x2apic: WRMSR is *not* serializing in this specific case.
But why is MFENCE insufficient? MFENCE makes writes visible, but
only affects load/store instructions. WRMSR is unfortunately not a
load/store instruction and is unaffected by MFENCE. This means that a
non-serializing WRMSR could be reordered by the CPU to execute before
the writes made visible by the MFENCE have even occurred in the first
place.

This means that an x2apic IPI could theoretically be triggered before
there is any (visible) data to process.

Does this affect anything in practice? I honestly don't know. It seems
quite possible that by the time an interrupt gets to consume the (not
yet) MFENCE'd data, it has become visible, mostly by accident.

To be safe, add the SDM-recommended fences for all x2apic WRMSRs.

This also leaves open the question of the _other_ weakly-ordered WRMSR:
MSR_IA32_TSC_DEADLINE. While it has the same ordering architecture as
the x2APIC MSRs, it seems substantially less likely to be a problem in
practice. While writes to the in-memory Local Vector Table (LVT) might
theoretically be reordered with respect to a weakly-ordered WRMSR like
TSC_DEADLINE, the SDM has this to say:

  In x2APIC mode, the WRMSR instruction is used to write to the LVT
  entry. The processor ensures the ordering of this write and any
  subsequent WRMSR to the deadline; no fencing is required.

But, that might still leave xAPIC exposed. The safest thing to do for
now is to add the extra, recommended LFENCE.
