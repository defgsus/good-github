Update aliases.js

Listed some items that do not synch but because of next tier it has a name change. 

Check line 82 and 91, since I am not sure if you didn't mention the first tier item in case people wanted to do -refine 15 -alias. Not sure if it will matter much since some first tiers can only go up to refine level 10 but I am not sure on those two items. However, line 94 Floral Bracelet can go up to refine 15 and I have seen people get pings for it but they really are looking for a 15 Rosa Bracelet/Chain since Floral Bracelet will drop 2 refine levels. Just not sure your preference. 

Last, not sure if you will like it // POTION - EFFECT but those are the new boxes we can get from Comodo Dungeon and they are a bit annoying to spell since they have dashes, true spelling are "Military Exploit Chest - Off-hand" and "Military Exploit Chest - Armor". I don't think that the average joe remembers to not use dashes when listing a name of an item.

neovim: Replace telescope with fzf-lua

I actually didn't want to change this. Adding an external dependency
(skim in this case) is not something I'm particularly happy with.
However, telescope was underperforming for what I need to do:

- Some rg matches (that were shown in console) didn't show up in
  telescope live grep, which SUCKS
- Sometimes telescope left some artifacts in the screen. I could live
  with this, actually, but still an issue
- fzf (via skim) allows me to scroll, but telescope does not
- fzf opens my quickfix immediately. I'm sure I can do it in telescope
  but this works out of the box in fzf
- I had great trouble making telescope show hidden files but STILL
  respect gitignore. This is quite easy with rg + fzf

So, fzf via skim it is. It's not the prettiest UI (actually I think it's
a bit cluttered), but it sure as hell works, and works way better than
telescope.

This is a mega file with 100k methods in them please note that the exe files in there such as the tools and stuff are not checked and tested so there most likely have a trojan i recommend using a VM for those but the text files and others are fine.

fixes hyperspace connect_loc_behalf bug (#60231)

turns out my move_stacks var doesnt work asynchronously since this bug made things with connect_loc_behalf runtime on every movement unless you somehow moved it back to the transit turf and off without it doing the runtime special.

(The sleep and hell the whole bit of code in space/Entered was unneeded, since it just happens normally as a part of move. Life is pain) -Lemon

also does misc code improvements i found while investigating ANOTHER c_l_b bug with stacks i found while testing this one, which i did NOT manage to fix unfortunately

"8:15am. I am up. Let me check out my mail. Just random LinkedIn spam. I'll see how it goes. For all I know, all 3 of my bites could fall through. Ideally all of them would manifest in offers. I am riding the winds of luck here. All I can do is take advantage of things as they come.

8:35am. https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/pdx9mz/would_it_be_a_good_idea_to_use_the_either_the/hb3nk1k/?context=3

Doing some Reddit posting in that thread I started. Got a reject from Avery Dennison. I forgot what that company was about.

8:40am. I just need one job, not more. But having more than a single offer would make it easier to negotiate a higher salary.

I have the interview with the Intel compilers guy at 2:30pm. Let me chill a little here. After that I'll try to do some work on the C backend.

9:45am. Just a bit more and then I will start. I am almost revived. I've been stressing because of these dumb applications. If nothing really happens in the next week or two, I'll wait till the mid month till the next barrage.

10:15am. My mind feels refreshed. Yeah, forget these responsibilities. It is not like they exist yet. I'll just deal with my own things.

10:20am. Ok, I just got email from Tessian. There is a 60m JS challenge waiting for me.

I'll take it. The backend work will have to be put on hold once again. Doing these challenges IS my job now.

I need to prime my brain a bit. It has been a while since I did TS. I'll do the challenges in TS on my own end and then just paste the answers.

I am likely to fail this test though if the questions are web specific. If they are programming puzzle related I should be fine.

Ok, first let me take a look at the plugin again.

Then I'll start an empty TS project. I forgot how to actually do that. Then I'll be set.

Hmmm, this is confusing. Do I not have `tsc` installed globally? It is good thing I am not doing this during the test. I need to set up an empty project with a watcher.

10:30am. Ok, I just needed to do `tsc -init` to make the `tsconfig.json` file. Then I can just start the watcher using `tsc -watch`. Still how do I do the runner? Remember how back then I set it up so that it run the file on every change?

I'll have to look at some of the old projects from over a year ago.

10:35am. Got a reject from komoot saying I answered some of the questions on the applications incorrectly. Yeah, I remember getting the SQL question wrong. It is a pity.

That is one thing down.

```json
{
  "name": "crash-course",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node crash course",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsc-watch --onSuccess \"node out/index.js\"",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/express": "^4.17.3",
    "@types/express-handlebars": "^3.1.0",
    "@types/node": "^13.7.7",
    "@types/uuid": "^7.0.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.1.0",
    "moment": "^2.24.0",
    "uuid": "^7.0.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {}
}
```

This is how I did the runner last time. Let me replicate it. Also I should set up the linter.

Huh, what was the equivalent of `npm -init`? `npm init`.

10:40am. Had to install `tsc-watch`, but now `npm run start` works.

10:45am. Ok, let me do it. There is a good chance the test will ask me to do something over the web rather than plain programming puzzles. In such a case I will struggle and probably fail since I won't have time to learn this in the time alloted by the test. But if the test just sends regular competitive programming types of challenges I should be fine. Let me go for it.

///

Instructions
Welcome to this Tessian Javascript Challenge! Please use the email address we've been contacting you on so that we're best able to reconcile your result with your application. We're really excited to have you with us at this stage of the interview process and we wish you the very best of luck!

Please select Javascript/Node.JS as the test language

You'll have up to 120 minutes in which to complete the challenge (Although we recommend you spend about 60 minutes on it).

We recommend you to try the sample test for a couple of minutes, before taking the main test.

///

There is just a single question. So it is definitely a programming challenge then.

Done the quick test.

11am. TS will be really helpful for its typechecking and autocomplete. Let me take a short break here and then I'll dive into the test.

11:15am. Ok, I made sure that I won't have to run to the bathroom during the test. Let me start it. It is time to get this going.

Since it is just one question, it is probably some puzzler instead of some web dev thing. I should be good at those.

11:20am. It is asking me to make a prefix expression calculator. Ok, I'll knock something out.

12:15pm. Phew it took me like a full hour just to do the damn parser. I might run out of time at this rate.

12:40pm. Phew, 38m left and I am done. It would be different in F# of course, but if I had less time I would have failed this test. Let me paste the code into HR.

12:45pm. 26/30 cases work for me. Sigh, where did I go wrong?

Ok, one of them is infinity. That is probably division by zero. I did not think of that case.

12:50pm. 27/30. 28m left.

Use print or log statements to debug why your hidden test cases are failing.

What does this mean?

Oh, I see. I can actually print them all in the output.

10, null
16, 1
27, null

Here is 10. / $ %

Huh, do I also need the modulo operator? Let me also print out the object as well.

Test case 10
/ $ %
{ '$': 12, '%': 4 }

Ok, I did not expect this.

Test case 16
+ 1 0
{}

Test case 27
+ var1 var2
{ var1: 2, var2: 2, var3: 1 }

I just assumed that vars could have only letters. I am going to fix this mistake promptly. Also that 0 is invalid.

Let me back this up here.

```ts
            // const is_letter = (j : number) => ('a' <= x[j] && x[j] <= 'z') || ('A' <= x[j] && x[j] <= 'Z')
            // for (let j = 0; j < x.length; j++) {
            //     if (is_letter(j) == false) {return null}
            // }
```

1pm. Oh, it all passed with 15m left to go. Not a great performance, but I'll take it. It I had less time I would have shamefully flunked this.

1:10pm. Sigh, it took me too long to solve such an easy problem. It took me an hour just to parse the prefix. I should be able to do a problem like this in a third of the time that it took me.

Let me have breakfast here. Good work me."

A hot end to the summer

![Some Birds](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/images/AngryBirds.png)

We got a bunch of updates coming in to finish off this summer!

*New Variant*

We’re excited to announce a new variant at Pychess! This one involves taking your supply of birds (of varying colors and sizes) and throwing them at your opponent at various angles to bring their castle down as quickly and efficiently as possible! That’s right, we’re obviously talking about… Tori Shogi!

![Tori Shogi](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/images/ShogiGuide/ToriIntl.png)
Tori Shogi is a three-centuries old variant that has similar to rules of Shogi but is played on a smaller board (7x7) and starts with immediate confrontation, also unlike Shogi. We’re now bringing it to the mainstream with piece symbols that should be more accessible to everyone. Please be sure to read [the rules](https://www.pychess.org/variants/torishogi) before you play because all the pieces are new and somewhat complex. It will be *much* faster to read about the game than *winging it*.

Also, before anyone asks, no we will not add Atomic Tori Shogi. We might be in trouble with PETA if we had a game featuring exploding birds! On a similar note, there will no more planned for variants for a good while so that we can spend more attention on improving the site’s features. With nearly 40 variants available, we hope that’s enough to keep most people satisfied with a variety of selection!
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2WNrx2jq184" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*New Engine*

Fairy is upgraded now, to version 14, or at least a version very close to it depending on how testing pans out. Good luck on challenging even tougher levels of play!

*New Piece Sets*

For some older news we haven’t gotten to, CBurnett-style pieces are now available for every chess variant (including all the variants with new armies). CBurnett is the default style on Lichess, while our default is Merida. Feel free to play around the settings and try out some variation!

Additionally, all guides have been updated for clarification. Variants that are derivative of others now show enough of the rules in their own guide so that they don’t need to go to the original. For example, the Capahouse guide will also describe the new pieces rather than simply referring to the Capablanca guide.

*Upcoming additions*

As you've already seen, we've been adding arena tournaments regularly. We've already done our first shield tournament with Crazyhouse960, we'll have our first shield tournament with Shinobi on 9/2, and the second Crazyhouse960 after. With so many variants, we obviously will not be able to add tournaments for *everything*, but you can help by spreading the word to your friends and chess buddies. If you have specific requests for tournaments please let us know.

We'll also have a new addition to our lobby page very soon. Thanks a lot to VisualDennis/Tasshaq for implementing it!

That's all for now. For all those going back to school, good luck, but always feel free to spend your break time in Pychess!

#### Wednesday 2021-09-01 17:47:41 by Marko Grdinić

"1:35pm. https://www.snagajob.com/blog/post/part-time-hours-vs-full-time-hours
> Part-time employees are always paid by the hour. That’s why they are usually responsible for “clocking in” and “clocking out” at the beginning and end of their shifts.

Interesting. I had no idea that this was the case.

1:50pm. Done with breakfast. 40m till the meeting so I am not going to be starting work on the backend right now.

Since I've passed the HR test for Tessian, I have 4 active threads at the moment, so I have no more incentive to keep applying. Maybe I'll get more tests in the future that need taking care of.

2:20pm. It is almost time.

2:25pm. I just can't relax. Ok, let me join the meeting.

3:05pm. That went well. He says he will get back to me tomorrow after checking with his manager.

Ok, this job if I took it purely what he is saying is really an operations research kind of job hidding under a compiler one. The chip they have does not have memory apart from the registers, and does not allow spilling for that reason. All the registers are statically allocated ahead of time and the main problem is to optimize them. Normal compilers also optimize the artithmetic operations, but the chip has a lot of ALUs so that is not a problem there.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit

I had a moment where I forgot what ALUs were (arithmetic...linear unit?) and had to resist the urge to ask what they were.

The big problem for them is that the classical compiler algorithms are not applicable for their kind of exotic hardware.

3:15pm. He mentioned the P4 programming language. I should check it out.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P4_(programming_language)

This is what I'll be working on if I join their team. More precisely the backend for their network chip which compiles to P4. Thought there maybe a way to angle it towards working more on the front end side of things.

https://p4.org/

I suggested I could do a Spiral backend for this in my usual fashion, but now I am not sure.

3:20pm. Ok, I do not feel like programming. Applying to these companies is like an adventure, so I might as well spend some time admiring the sights. Let me study p4 for a bit.

https://github.com/p4lang/education/blob/master/GettingStarted.md

Let me watch the video tutorials here.

3:55pm. Yeah, I am exhausted. I do not have the focus to really watch the videos. This kind of hardware is far from my usual interest. Not that it would be a bad job to have.

I can't really focus on the videos, but let me just go through them anyway.

4:25pm. https://youtu.be/cvDtVobw9wE?t=369

Ok, I definitely won't be able to make a Spiral backend for P4. The languages are too different.

I am not sure I get this example. Why does this switch the ports?

5:10pm. Done with the break. I am in a daze trying to process the conversation. I watched only two videos, and did not get the programs, but I have a much clearer picture of the language is about.

I admit I was at a loss when he asked me what I could do, but now some ideas are starting to form. If I get the chance to go further I'll elaborate them. Let me watch another video.

5:35pm. I am just pacing around the room in a daze. Now that I've had the time to think about this job, it might be better than I thought at first glace.

6:15pm. Done with lunch. Let me watch the video.

7pm. Only finished the 3rd video just now. Basically, this job is actually on my current path. When I applied, I thought meh, router switches...that has nothing to do with me. But if the job is about graph optimization, that changes things completely.

I mean think about what I want to do - implement the poker game and the algorithms on an AI chip. Instead what if I introduced randomized algorithms to the P4 backend, and then implement the compiler optimizations on the AI chip that would be quite a similar thing.

I'd need to change my specialty from RL to graph optimization, but it is not like I care about current day RL that much. It just seemed like the most viable path, and graph optimization is not something I'd even considered. But I do have useful experience from the two discrete optimization courses that I've taken. I never thought that I'd ever find use for it.

Here are 3 main points that I'll suggest, assuming they want to go for another round of interviews. When I was asked what I could do, I could only mumble something about AI chips.

1) I'll propose a grand project to do the graph optimizations on AI chips. I'll take the randomized algorithms that I've implemented on CPU, port them on chip, massively parallelize them and investigate the use of NNs to guide the search. Using NNs in such a manner would be insane with just CPU+GPU as it would blow up the compile times, but these AI chips will have local memory and specialized operations that will make running them very fast. They'll also be suitable for graph optimization work. If this works and it probably will, the optimization will be very ferocious and none of their competitors will be able to match up. It won't be easy to copy this approach, since there aren't too many people with my skillset in both compilers and ML.

2) I'll open a line of research into randomized algorithms, and try them out the problems. No doubt, they've accumulated a large dataset of programs to test their optimization algorithms on, and I will take a look at giving the metaheuristic approaches a try. Ultimately, classical algorithms are heuristic approaches and only represent the upper bound on whatever measure they are using. I had really good experience replacing constraint solving with metaheuristic approaches during those courses and I'll want to lean on it. Though the viability of this depends on how much their customers would prefer for to wait for the optimizer to do a better job instead of rewriting the program so it does something that uses less registers.

3) Initially, what I will try is rewriting some of their codebase in Spiral. This will both serve to get me acclimated with their compiler and demonstrate what large cuts in the amount of lines of code are achievable using a functional language like Spiral. It will give me an opportunity to get some actual users and start weaning their imperative programmers off C++ and into something better.

I should fight the urge to be bombastic and go from last to first here.

7:25pm. Ultimately trying out optimization algorithms on novel problems is exactly what I've been doing for the last 6.5 years, so this kind of job is a good fit.

Alternatively, they could say no to functional programming and randomized algorithms, but in that case they won't get their money's worth out of me.

I really hope I get the chance to present my case, and that Viktor's manager doesn't just decide to skip. It would be too bad if that happens. I'd gotten a little hyped about this, so I'll feel dissapointment if it slips away.

7:35pm. Hmmm, if I get a reject I'll actually write out my plan and send it to him to see if that changes his mind. Getting my resume tossed into the trash bin after a 5m glance is one thing, but given that I've gotten an face-to-face interview we have some connection. I should not give up on it too easily.

7:40pm. Ugh, let me finally watch that 4th video and I will call it a day.

https://youtu.be/KlEi87XYMBE?t=7
P4 Tutorial 4 - Basic Tunneling Application

It is very rare for me to watch programming videos and not understand what is going on, but has been the case so far. I'll have to try out P4 directly."

Trying out markdown


_Congratulations! You have a new-to-you house in [INSERT FAKE NEIGHBORHOOD + TOWN NAME HERE]. Your neighbors sure are a bunch of characters too. Not everything is perfect for you and your character, though. The house is… a bit of a fixer-upper. And your character has dreams of what they like best in a home. _

_It’s up to you to turn this house into your character’s dream home, and work with neighbors to make the whole street a destination to brag about_


## Game Objective

“Best” home or block according to your character i.e. get the most victory points by the end of the game. Game ends when (everyone or first person) has fixed everything broken about their house.

# SETUP:

1. _First, you’ll want to know what kind of character you are and what kind of house you own. _

    Draw one (1) Character card and one (1) Site card. Place these on your Project Folder.

2. _Next, time to assess your house’s state of (dis)repair. Look out! Leaving this unattended for too long could cause more damage down the road._

    Roll 2 6-sided die 3 times to determine what’s broken. Refer to the table below

## Damage Table

| Roll  | Type of Damage | Damage Amount (Nega-Victory Points) | 
| ---- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 2     | Foundation         | -10 VP                                                      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- TODO: finish table -->


3. _Now it’s time to gather up your resources to start sprucing things up!_

    Draw 6 cards from the main deck - This will be your starting hand of resources and projects to play from during your turn.





# PLAYING THE GAME

**Who Goes First: **First person to share a story about their residence goes first! Some prompts below:



* What do you want to change most about your current residence?
* What do you like about your neighborhood?
* Has something broken in your home? How hard was it to fix? What did you have to do?
* Have you tried a DIY project before? How did it go?
* Did you ever go to someone’s home and think, “this is a dream home”? What was the place like?
* Would you rather build walls, tinker with electrical systems, garden, or decorate if you had to spruce up a place? Something else?


## Gameplay

Going clockwise, players take turns, making as many upgrades or repairs as they can each turn. Combine projects with their required resources to play them and improve your house. You can play multiple projects at once (see card explanations below). When a project has been played, the project card(s) and their resources are discarded into the Discard pile. Place tokens on the part of the house the project touched showing the victory points from that project.

**Projects with Permits:** A player can play up to one Construction Permit card and up to one Planning Permit card per turn. A single permit card can be used for multiple upgrades or repairs. 

**Projects with Drawings: **A player can play as many architecture or engineering drawings as they want during their turn. Each Drawing Card only counts for one project. (More stuff to change means more stuff to draw!)

**Voting: **Some projects require neighbors to vote on if a project can proceed. Other players should base their votes on how their character might vote. The player trying to make the upgrade can state their case, make deals with other players, or trade/give cards in exchange for a “yes” vote. Majority rules.



* If “yes” project proceeds. Player plays project like any other project
* If “no” the relevant in-play cards return to the player’s hand. Player can try to play a different project (or a version of that project that does not require a vote) in that same turn if they wish.
* A tie is handled the same as a “no” outcome.

**Trading:** During a player’s turn, they can make trades with other players. A player may trade cards as many times as they want.

**Exchange with Draw Pile:** A player can discard one card and draw one new card during their turn.

**Special Ability:** A player may use their character’s Special Ability once per turn. Follow instructions on your Character Card under SPECIAL ABILITY.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rolling for Damage</span>**

Roll 2 6-sided dice when rolling for damage.

If you roll a 6 or lower, you take the damage and consequences.

If you roll a 7 or higher, no damage is taken

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Other Damage Effects</span>**

During the game, you may experience other types of damage to your home as a result of neglecting to address existing damage.

POISON: Your house has become moldy and is affecting your household’s health! Place a poison icon on your house. You lose 1VP for every turn that you have the poison icon on your house.

ENERGY SINK: Something is making a huge spike in your energy bill. Place an energy sink icon on your house. You lose 1VP for every turn that you have the energy sink icon on your house.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">End Turn:</span>** At the end of a player’s turn, that player draws two cards from the main deck. If a player has more than 6 cards in their hand, they must discard after drawing until they have 6 cards.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">End of Round: Event Cards</span>**

At the end of each round, when all players have taken their turn, the group draws an Event Card. Everyone in the group is affected by this event and must follow the instructions on the card.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">End of Game: Losing (One Player)</span>**

If you reach 10 damage tokens on your house, your house has fallen into so much disrepair that it is deemed Condemned. Your character cannot keep up with repairs and must sell the house. You are out of the game. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">End of Game for Everyone</span>**

When a player has completed their repairs at the end of their turn, all players complete the current round and the game ends. Instead of drawing an event card, players tally their points. For every repair not made, dock the damage amount from your victory points.



**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">CARD MANAGEMENT</span>**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Draw Deck and Discard Pile</span>**

Main deck cards (not event cards, site cards, or character cards) are shuffled into a Draw Deck. When players discard cards, discard into a separate Discard Pile. When the Draw Deck is empty, shuffle the cards in the Discard Pile and that becomes the new Draw Deck.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">In Play Items</span>**

Cards + items that are placed on your folder. Your house, your site card, your character card, and all played upgrades and current damaged areas are your In Play items.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Your Hand</span>**

Cards in your hand are not in play. They can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand”. At the end of your turn, you may have no more than six (6) cards in your hand and must discard any extra cards.

Not-yet-ideal example of how to craft the replacement inside of the matcher.

A lot of times, when building matchers, the fact that "what to match" is separated from "what to replace it with" makes it really annoying to craft. A trivial example is anything recursive, really -- rather than building up some absurd combinator thingy, sometimes you just want to walk the AST. Architecturally, Refex actively does not want you to do this. It expects totally separated matchers and replacements. And isn't that... silly?

This change is one step towards that: it really stupidly glues in a place for the matcher to emit its desired replacement.

After this change, it should be pretty straightforward to write matchers by hand which emit their own replacements. Sure, the replacement template and the match template are still separated -- but the replacement template becomes "replace this thing with a variable that it bound to its desired replacement".

---

Future work:

* Make the syntax nicer? There's still a whole lot of gluing together random crap nobody cares about.
* Allow safety checks -- right now, this only works with ShTemplate.
* Add a good error message for what happens when you *don't* use ShTemplate.
* Document this.

---

Far future work:

The fact that "what to match" and "what to replace it with" are specified so far apart has consistently been annoying. I think, going along with this kind of change, we might be able to establish that there is fundamentally no reason they have to be separate: maybe passing `--sub=...` on the command line is actually equivalent to syntax sugar which adds some stuff to the matcher.

So maybe the whole thing should be re-architected so that replacements are *always* specified in the matcher, and there's no second templating layer.

Or maybe not -- like I said, the fact that we can do this kind of change means it really doesn't matter either way, as long as we complete the hookup.

Since I have not been as active as I'd like working on Refex, this remains a bit speculative for now.

Drifting in the ocean all alone
The darkness of night falls around my soul
And the hunter within loses control

This demon inside has ahold of me
Clenching its power - trying to break free

Ensure multiple extra_attrs without blocks work correctly

Two pieces of context needed:

First, there's a bunch of logic around serializer attributes:
subclassing resources, explicit serializers, defaults, overrides, etc.
And all of this gets dicey considering it all wraps and hacks an
external library, `jsonapi-serializable`.  So we're pretty dumb about
saying "any time we're doing something that can affect serialization,
re-configure everything".

Second, we recently accommodated the scenario where a parent resource
class guards an attribute, and a subclass removes that guard. The logic
added says "if this was previously guarded, remove the guard - as we're
adding the property again, the guard will get added again if it needs to
be".

These two scenarios conflicted. If you had two `extra_attribute` calls,
the second would cause the first to be re-applied as part of the
"reconfigure everything" approach. And when re-applied, we remove the
prior guard...expecting it to be added again as part of the idempotent
nature of the call.

This worked as expected if you passed a block, because you'd end up back
[here](https://github.com/graphiti-api/graphiti/blob/master/lib/graphiti/util/serializer_attributes.rb#L20).
But if you didn't pass a block, you'd end up [here](https://github.com/graphiti-api/graphiti/blob/master/lib/graphiti/util/serializer_attributes.rb#L24),
with the logic being "the only thing we need to do here is add the guard
back.

This was dumb! If you're going to do the "reconfigure everything"
approach, you need to ensure you're following the same codepath - not
this special codepath that was added. This had the adverse effect that
no guard was re-added (for extra attributes, the conditional [is added
in a different way](https://github.com/graphiti-api/graphiti/blob/master/lib/graphiti/extensions/extra_attribute.rb#L43) than a normal guard).

So the fix is to ensure we always follow the same codepath, which will
now correctly re-apply the guard. And added tests for the scenario where
multiple `extra_attributes` are added with and without blocks.

Finally, I'm not so sure about the wisdom of "reconfigure everything".
This was added 3 years ago as part of the major refactor that replaced
`jsonapi_suite` and became the `graphiti` we know and love today. It's
possible that the scenarios we were worried about are no longer
relevant, and this is more of a hindrance than a help. For now, simplest
fix.

Apple OS interface cleanup & refactoring

- Add a C callback interface (context_wrapper.h) between lokinet and the
  objective-C code so that:
  - we can use objective-C (rather than objective-C++), which seems more
    likely to be supported by Apple into the future;
  - we minimize the amount of code that needs to be aware of the Apple
    APIs.
  - this replaces apple logger objective c++ implementation with a plain
    c++ implementation that takes a very simple C callback (provided
    from the obj-c code) to actually make the call to NSLog.

- Add various documentation to the code of what is going on.

- Send all DNS traffic to the primary IP on the tun interface.  The
  match prefixes simply don't work as advertised, and have weird shit
  (like even if you get it working for some domains, "instagram.com"
  still doesn't because of god-knows-what Apple internal politics).

- Drop the dns proxy code as we don't need it anymore.

- Don't use 9.9.9.9 for default DNS.  (We might consider the unfiltered
  9.9.9.10 as an alternative default, but if we do it should be a global
  lokinet change rather than a Mac-specific change).

- Parse a lokinet.ini in the data directory, if it exists.  (Since we
  are sandboxed, it is an app-specific "home" directory so is probably
  buried god knows where, but at least the GUI ought to be able to get
  it to let users add things to it).

- This commit also adds a swift version of the PacketTunnelProvider
  glue, which ought to work in theory, but the *tooling* for cmake is so
  underdeveloped that I couldn't find any way to actually get the damn
  thing working.  So I'm committing it here anyway (and will revert it
  away in the next commit) in case we someday want to switch to it.

Added new runewords

- Edited the example/copy paste text to remove the info so it's a bit quicker to edit since I know how it works now.
Would still need that for other people though.
- It's being added in alphabetical order atm.

Added Runewords
- Dream There's a mistake here, not sure how to fix this. Increase Maximum Life 5% (Helms Only)+50 To Life (Shields Only) There are stats that apparently are only added based on what socketed item you use.
- Ancient's Pledge (used the command without the 's )
- Beast
- Black
- Bone
- Bramble
- Brand ( = Missile Weapon)
- Breath of The Dying (Works in all weapons, so not sure how to display that or what code to use) used the short "Botd" 
- Call To arms (Used the short "Cta") People really only put Cta in Flail or Crystal Sword but the runeword works in all Weapons, gotta decide how we want to display that
- Chains of Honor (CoH)
- Chaos (weapon = Claw)
- Death
- Delirium
- Destruction
- Doom
- Dragon (has varying stats like Dream based on which item it's in)
- Duress
- Edge
- Enigma
- Enlightenment
- Eternity (all melee weapons, not sure how to add that yet for the images)
- Exile
- Faith
- Famine
- Fortitude has a lot of varying stats based on whether it's in an Armor or Weapon and I don't know how to enter the X + life based on character level. Ofc nobody puts it in a weapon.
- Fury can be made in all melee weapons, not sure how to add that.
- Gloom

Working my way on all the conversions.

There are still some hard to express conversions to do, it's
way too late and I'm starting to lose faith in the cpp
generator. But as Scarlett O'Hara said, "after all,
tomorrow is another day".

And to you Rhett, we frankly don't give a damn
about you. Scarlett was the protagonist we seek after,
not you.

Note: I just rewatched GwtW, so bear with me.
