EMPs on robotic limbs will now disable them for 4-8 seconds rather than causing a 10-20 second full stun (#74570)

## About The Pull Request

EMPs on robotic limbs will now disable them for 10-20 seconds rather
than causing a 10-20 second full stun on the user. Additionally, they
will damage the limb for a little brute and some burn.

Arm EMPs don't do anything special as the limb being disabled already
drops items.

Leg EMPs cause a 10-20 second knockdown, only really applicable if
there's only one robotic leg as two disabled legs KD you anyways.

Chest EMPs cause a 3-6 second standing-up paralyze, visible to the
player by a quite noticeable shaking of their body.

Head EMPs break the optical transponder circuits for 7.5-15 seconds,
effectively giving the user nightmare goggles vision with green instead
of red as the only remaining color.

Tacit approval for the PR at least existing.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Robotic limbs are not so strong that a glancing EMP that may not even
have been directed at you should stun you for ten, TEN seconds, or
worse, twenty. This is basically legacy stunning from the days of
super-stuns on soap, stunbatons, etc. The code for it was last touched
six years ago.

**_The stats as shown above are not even close to final. I really don't
know or care what the right stats should be in the end. and I'm fine
with making them a 10-20 second timer again. I just put some
reasonable-seeming numbers in as a placeholder. EMPs could also still
cause a short stun if that is deemed necessary. Hell, that could be the
chest effect!_**

Fix an incorrect assumption that OSC 7 precedes the prompt, when in fact it comes after. Also fix a performance issue with PromptStateMachine - in Swift getting the length of a string is an O(N) operation, it seems. This caused performance problems when the state machine was confused (e.g., start in tcsh with shell integration then run zsh which sends OSC 7 and it gets stuck in the 'accruing' state). My dream is that some day I can enjoy the quality of life I had in Turbo Pascal where counting the length of a string could be done in constant time.

Microing var/static times (~0.015 seconds of init) (#74769)

## About The Pull Request

Moth and I came up with an affront to god and man, and used it to track
the time spent creating /static (and in theory /global) variables (this
happens right at the start of init)
They cost as a sum about 0.05 seconds btw, at least currently.

```
/datum/timer
    var/key

/datum/timer/New(file, line)
    src.key = "[file]:[line]"

/datum/timer/proc/operator*(x)
    rustg_time_reset(key)
    return x

/datum/timer/proc/operator+(x)
    var/time = rustg_time_microseconds(key)
    world.log << "TIMER: [key]: [time]"
    return x

Regex:
var/static/([\w/]+) =
-> var/static/$1 = (new /datum/timer(__FILE__, __LINE__)) * (new /datum/timer(__FILE__, __LINE__)) + 
```

Output on moth's pc looks like this, time in microseconds

[output_sorted.csv](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/files/11241900/output_sorted.csv)

Most of this is either icon_states() memes (which appears to be cached
btw, that's interesting), or a variation on typecacheof()
There is one get_asset_datum call, but that is ALREADY cached and so is
just redundant. That's a good 0.01 seconds saved.

The rest of the time here is slightly more interesting.

The majority of typecacheof() is iterating the output of typesof(), a
byond internal proc that returns a list of types that either are or are
the child of the passed in type.
A decent chunk of time here (0.005 seconds, or 10% of the proc) can be
saved by unrolling the arguments to the proc.
It takes an arbitrary amount of typepaths as input, but we can't like
use arglist() here (cause this is an internal "proc"), so instead we try
a window of args, passing in null if we start to try and take in too
much.
Window size matters, zebra fits better into 4 then 5, especially because
of how grouping needs to work to make this effect happen.
We save about 0.001 for zebra btw, which is around about 7%. It's lower
cause we need to group the paths beforehand I think.

The speedup is minor, but it DOES exist. Plus it's fun.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Microing is a hell of a drug

gpg-interface: set trust level of missing key to "undefined"

In check_signature(), we initialize the trust_level field to "-1", with
the idea that if gpg does not return a trust level at all (if there is
no signature, or if the signature is made by an unknown key), we'll
use that value. But this has two problems:

  1. Since the field is an enum, it's up to the compiler to decide what
     underlying storage to use, and it only has to fit the values we've
     declared. So we may not be able to store "-1" at all. And indeed,
     on my system (linux with gcc), the resulting enum is an unsigned
     32-bit value, and -1 becomes 4294967295.

     The difference may seem academic (and you even get "-1" if you pass
     it to printf("%d")), but it means that code like this:

       status |= sigc->trust_level < configured_min_trust_level;

     does not necessarily behave as expected. This turns out not to be a
     bug in practice, though, because we keep the "-1" only when gpg did
     not report a signature from a known key, in which case the line
     above:

       status |= sigc->result != 'G';

     would always set status to non-zero anyway. So only a 'G' signature
     with no parsed trust level would cause a problem, which doesn't
     seem likely to trigger (outside of unexpected gpg behavior).

  2. When using the "%GT" format placeholder, we pass the value to
     gpg_trust_level_to_str(), which complains that the value is out of
     range with a BUG(). This behavior was introduced by 803978da49
     (gpg-interface: add function for converting trust level to string,
     2022-07-11). Before that, we just did a switch() on the enum, and
     anything that wasn't matched would end up as the empty string.

     Curiously, solving this by naively doing:

       if (level < 0)
               return "";

     in that function isn't sufficient. Because of (1) above, the
     compiler can (and does in my case) actually remove that conditional
     as dead code!

We can solve both by representing this state as an enum value. We could
do this by adding a new "unknown" value. But this really seems to match
the existing "undefined" level well. GPG describes this as "Not enough
information for calculation".

We have tests in t7510 that trigger this case (verifying a signature
from a key that we don't have, and then checking various %G
placeholders), but they didn't notice the BUG() because we didn't look
at %GT for that case! Let's make sure we check all %G placeholders for
each case in the formatting tests.

The interesting ones here are "show unknown signature with custom
format" and "show lack of signature with custom format", both of which
would BUG() before, and now turn %GT into "undefined". Prior to
803978da49 they would have turned it into the empty string, but I think
saying "undefined" consistently is a reasonable outcome, and probably
makes life easier for anyone parsing the output (and any such parser had
to be ready to see "undefined" already).

The other modified tests produce the same output before and after this
patch, but now we're consistently checking both %G? and %GT in all of
them.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

## [ryan961/weaver](https://github.com/ryan961/weaver)@[b9eb4fc35d...](https://github.com/ryan961/weaver/commit/b9eb4fc35df080f128de5d674e2ca52d7483932a)
#### Friday 2023-05-05 02:33:00 by Michael Whittaker

Changed deployers to persist data in one spot.

Recall that deployers often have to persist various data to the file
system. The "weaver multi" deployer, for example, persists logs,
registrations, and traces to files.

Before this PR, deployers would store logs in /tmp and everything else
in ~/.local/share/serviceweaver. Different deployers would sometimes
store their data in the same directory. A "multi_perfetto.db" file would
be right next to a "single_perfetto.db" file, for example.

This made purging data files annoying. It was like a scavenger hunt
trying to track down the various places that data was stored. This PR
changes deployers to store all their data in a single directly. For
example, the "weaver multi" deployer now stores everything inside
"~/.local/share/serviceweaver/multi". The single process deployer stores
everything inside "~/.local/share/serviceweaver/single".

This makes purging much simpler. It also makes it clearer which files
are being used by which deployers.

Note that this PR moves logs out of /tmp, which persists them longer.
This means that logs won't be garbage collected automatically, but I
think that's actually a good thing. We should implement a principled way
of garbage collecting logs, rather than leaving it up to /tmp. I think
it would be surprising and frustrating if an important log file was
spuriously deleted by the OS.

icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

http: support CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR

The CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS (and matching CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS) flag was
deprecated in curl 7.85.0, and using it generate compiler warnings as of
curl 7.87.0. The path forward is to use CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR, but we
can't just do so unilaterally, as it was only introduced less than a
year ago in 7.85.0.

Until that version becomes ubiquitous, we have to either disable the
deprecation warning or conditionally use the "STR" variant on newer
versions of libcurl. This patch switches to the new variant, which is
nice for two reasons:

  - we don't have to worry that silencing curl's deprecation warnings
    might cause us to miss other more useful ones

  - we'd eventually want to move to the new variant anyway, so this gets
    us set up (albeit with some extra ugly boilerplate for the
    conditional)

There are a lot of ways to split up the two cases. One way would be to
abstract the storage type (strbuf versus a long), how to append
(strbuf_addstr vs bitwise OR), how to initialize, which CURLOPT to use,
and so on. But the resulting code looks pretty magical:

  GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE allowed = GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE_INIT;
  if (...http is allowed...)
	GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_APPEND(&allowed, "http", CURLOPT_HTTP);

and you end up with more "#define GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE" macros than
actual code.

On the other end of the spectrum, we could just implement two separate
functions, one that handles a string list and one that handles bits. But
then we end up repeating our list of protocols (http, https, ftp, ftp).

This patch takes the middle ground. The run-time code is always there to
handle both types, and we just choose which one to feed to curl.

Gunpoints now take half a second to activate, make gasp sounds, and briefly immobilize the shooter and target, other small balance changes (#74036)

## About The Pull Request
This PR messes around with gunpoints a bit, with the purpose of making
them more viable in certain scenarios without making them obnoxious. The
biggest change is that gunpoints now require a 0.5 second do_after()
where neither the shooter nor the target moves, and immobilizes both of
them for 0.75 seconds if point blank, or half that if you're 2 tiles
away. Originally you were supposed to only be able to initiate a
gunpoint from point-blank, but #56601 seems to have removed that
requirement, so we'll run with it and just leave it as advantageous to
gunpoint closer up. The do_after() reinforces that it should be used as
an ambush tactic, and so you can't use it on someone who's actively
fleeing or fighting you.

Getting held up will now make you emit a shocked gasp sound, a la Metal
Gear Solid, which combined with the short immobilize will hopefully make
it more noticeable that someone's pointing a gun at you.

Holdups will now immediately give a 25% bonus to damage and wounds,
instead of having to wait 2.5 seconds to hit the double damage stage.

Finally, right clicking someone that you're holding up will no longer
shoot them. That just feels like good consistency.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Hopefully makes gunpoints a little more viable for when you want to
stick someone who's not expecting it up without them immediately jetting
off. In the future I'd like to ape Baycode and let the gunman have an
action that toggles whether the victim is allowed to move, so you can
order them to move to a second location without instantly shooting them,
but that'll come later.
## Changelog
:cl: Ryll/Shaps
balance: Holding someone at gunpoint now requires both the shooter and
the victim to hold still for half a second before activating, so you
can't hold-up people fleeing or fighting you. After that, it will
briefly immobilize the both of you, 0.75 seconds if adjacent, or half
that if you're two tiles away. Nuke ops are immune to the
immobilization, since they're ready to die anyways.
balance: Holding someone up will immediately apply a 1.25x damage and
wound multiplier, rather than waiting 2.5 seconds to hit 2x.
soundadd: Being held up will now make the victim play a sharp gasp
sound, a la Metal Gear Solid.
qol: Trying to hold someone up that you're already holding up will no
longer shoot them.

Minor Nukie Thing: Bolt-action Sniper Rifle, balance coding, and some ammo changes (#73781)

## About The Pull Request

### The Rifle:
-The Sniper Rifle is now a bolt action. This replaces the 4 second fire
delay on the sniper rifle. This overall will improve the fire rate if
you're good at racking the bolt, but it will also feel less like you're
in a weird limbo of inaction while using the sniper rifle, since the
fire delay can be quite confusing to players not used to it. This can be
tweaked, like reducing the speed of the racking action, if it seems like
it is too much.
-The scope component now goes up to 50 tiles (or so), which allows you
to gain a significant sightline over an area. The reasoning for this is
simple. The component actually nerfed the overall range of the sniper
rifle's scope, so this should hopefully restore that somewhat. And
having such a huge sightline makes it much easier to utilize the
impressive range of the rifle. Currently, it's really only ideal for
extremely close range fighting.
-The normal sniper rifle, the one that syndicate base scientists get,
can be suppressed. I don't know why it was different.

### The Ammo:

Normal .50 BMG: Does much more object damage, and on top of that deals
additional damage to mechs, but not by much more. Now, when it
dismembers a limb, it also deals its damage to the chest. This ensures
that you didn't straight up lose out on dealing a killing blow because
you took their limb off, and makes the dismemberment property of .50 BMG
a significant upside rather than a immense detriment.

Marksman: Gains a lot of the above benefits, but has much lower range.
Why this nerf? It's actually because of some funny nonsense with how
ricochet works. Which can cause....accidents to happen. To you. Consider
that firing down a straight line and missing could be quite embarrassing
when the bullet has 400 tiles of range.

Soporific: Now called Disruptor ammo. Works as it did before, putting
humans to sleep for 40 seconds (seriously, 40 seconds). Also deals some
stamina damage, if...that's relevant. But now also causes an EMP effect
and a boatload of added damage to both mechs and borgs, allowing it to
be an excellent anti-mech and anti-borg ammo type, as well as scrambling
any pesky suit sensors, energy weapons and so on in an area around the
impact. Useful for support fire.

Incendiary (NEW!): Causes a massive firebomb to go off where it impacts
(no explosion, so this isn't a stun). Also sets the target on fire,
which is always fun. Good for shooting into groups of people with
impunity. Also deals burn damage instead, since I think nukies could use
more methods for direct fire damage.

Surplus (NEW!): It's .50 BMG but it lacks most if not all the upsides.
No armour penetration, no dismemberment, no paralysis. It still deals a
lot of damage to objects, so not a bad option for simply removing
structures from afar. So what's the point in this ammo? You can buy 7
magazines for the price of one. I want to introduce 'Surplus' as an idea
for nukies to invest in if they want to be able to keep shooting but
they're really on a budget, like most non-warop nukies tend to be. This
is definitely subject to change (like a damage decrease on top of
everything else).

Pricing and Capacity: Normal ammo and surplus costs 3 TC. Every special
ammo costs 4 TC. Every special ammo also has the same ammo capacity as
the normal magazine. It's kind of weird how most of the subtypes had 5
shots rather than 6, but then soporific had...3? I don't get it. This
would probably cause a good deal of confusion, especially if you are
swapping ammo types and weren't aware of this particular oddity.

Anyway, 6 shots.

### Minor Addition
Gets rid of the cheap suppressor. It lies to players, tricking them into
thinking this is a low quality suppressor. Newsflash, it isn't. There is
no distinct difference between that suppressor and the normal
suppressor.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The sniper rifle, unfortunately, sucks a lot except for very specific
use cases. It got a big nerf with the scope component in terms of range,
even if the functionality is way cooler. And, at a baseline, there was
some counterintuitive functions attached to it. Dismemberment was cool,
but it also caused a loss in overall damage due to how limbs contribute
to core health. On top of this, the cool ammo types were...not much
better? Penetrator was almost always the best option, even if it lost a
lot of damage as a consequence.

So, what was it good for? X-ray + Penetrator. Pretty much, that's it. It
has some other uses but if I had to be entirely honest, there wasn't
much that other weapon couldn't do as well.

Hopefully this helps things going forward, and I want to mess with this
as well down the line in case its a bit too much of a boost in power.

Absolutely please rip this PR apart.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Makes the syndicate sniper rifle a bolt-action rifle.
balance: Sniper rifles have a scope range of roughly 50 tiles.
balance: Sniper rifle ammo, if it dismembers your limbs, does damage to
the chest.
balance: All the various syndicate sniper rifle magazines have
consistent casing quantities (6 shots). They also have more consistent
pricing. 3 for normal and a box of surplus, and 4 for every other type.
balance: Reduces the range of Marksman ammo to 50 tiles. Not because it
is strong, but because you might accidentally shoot yourself if you're
not watching where you're shooting. Ricochets are no joke.
add: Replaces Soporific with Disruptor ammo. Works like soporific, but
also EMPS things it hits.
add: Adds Incendiary .50 BMG. Causes a combustion to erupt from the
struck target, as well as setting targets on fire. Great for parties.
add: Adds Surplus .50 BMG. It sucks, but you get a lot of them! Quantity
over quality, baby.
remove: The suppressors in the bundle are of standard quality. The
apparent 'cheap suppressor' that came bundled with the C-20r and sniper
rifle were found to actually be 'fine'. Trust us.

Enable Reflame for Highlight web app (#4586)

## Summary

<!--
Ideally, there is an attached Linear ticket that will describe the
"why".

If relevant, use this section to call out any additional information
you'd like to _highlight_ to the reviewer.
-->

This PR finally enables [Reflame](https://reflame.app/)
[previews](https://preview.highlight.io/~r/start-preview/?mode=production&variantId=01GY11FVTK9FMXX2DSCR6T4VRD&variantName=git%7Enew-reflame-app-1&userId=01FQZZ7XJFDA799Z1Z9DRCFXWA)
for the Highlight web app. 🥳

### What does this mean for me?

First you'll need to sign up at https://reflame.app, connect your GitHub
account, and ask @Vadman97 for an invite to the highlight organization.

Then, once this PR is merged, every time you push up a change to the web
app (in /frontend) or any of its dependencies, you'll get a Reflame
preview link on your commit immediately, usually within 3 seconds,
instead of however many minutes it used to take:
![Screenshot 2023-04-13 at 5 40 57
PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6934200/231912410-5dc2880d-353c-402e-8562-67ce4ee54137.png)

In addition, you'll have access to the Reflame [VSCode
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reflame.agent)
for development, which deploys your changes usually within ~500ms of a
file save, and then reflects your changes instantly with a full browser
refresh in production mode, or with state-preserving React fast refresh
in development mode. See development mode in action here:


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6934200/231914985-3679e955-ddcf-4ad1-9c7e-1c7451dc3ef5.mp4

It's worth noting that Reflame is actually _deploying your changes to
the internet_ every time, so you can send these links to yourself to
check your changes on another device (even multiple devices
simultaneously), or share them with teammates or customers to give them
a sneak peak of what you're working on, iterate with their feedback, and
have those changes reflected on their browsers in real time (even if
they're on the other side of the world)!

### How do I even review this? There's like 500 files here?!

I'd recommend reviewing either commit by commit and skipping the 2nd
commit, or by viewing all files changed and skipping over everything in
`__generated` folders, since they only contain files generated using the
newly added build scripts. This should leave only about 30 files to
review, and most of the changes are a only a couple of lines long.

These scripts and generated files are a temporary stop-gap to support
features that don't have first-class support in Reflame yet,
specifically:

- Reading version from package.json
- CSS/SCSS modules
- Tailwind
- SVGR
- Git Submodules
- Vanilla Extract

These are roughly ranked in order of how quickly I think they will get
first-class support in Reflame, at which point we'll be able to remove
the associated scripts and generated files. Notably, Vanilla Extract is
as far down the list as it is because it requires executing
user-supplied code as part of its build process, which is going to take
quite a bit of work to enable safely in a multitenant system like
Reflame (but I do plan on tackling this eventually as I get closer to
building features like testing and backend APIs support). Though we may
still be able to get rid of the build script sooner than that by
building it into the VSCode extension if there's enough demand.

Outside of the script and configuration changes, there are a few
additional source changes for compatibility. I left comments on the PR
for every one of these explaining the motivation behind them. I've also
split most of them out into separate PRs so they can be reviewed, tested
and shipped independently:

- https://github.com/highlight/highlight/pull/5086
- https://github.com/highlight/highlight/pull/5087
- https://github.com/highlight/highlight/pull/5088
- https://github.com/highlight/highlight/pull/5089 

## How did you test this change?

<!--
Frontend - Leave a screencast or a screenshot to visually describe the
changes.
-->

A lot of care has gone into making sure your existing local dev workflow
works exactly as you're used to (just with a few more scripts running
than before), and that the production deployment process remains
untouched as well. If you notice any material differences in any of your
day to day workflows while trying out this PR, or in the Render preview
deploys, please let me know and I'll try to address it ASAP.

I've tried following the [docker dev guide
here](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/self-host/dev-deployment-guide)
and running `yarn dev:frontend` (without the `doppler run --` part), and
both seem to be working identically as on main as far as I can tell,
though for the latter I'm missing a few env vars from doppler so
couldn't verify past the login screen, will need your help to make sure
everything works as expected there.

If you want to try out Reflame before this PR gets merged, just make a
branch off of this PR (previews are not working for this PR because it's
coming from a fork, and the appId in the config is for the
highlight/highlight repo, but it should work if you cherry pick these
commits into another branch within this repo). The VSCode extension
should also just work once you get a VSCode account.
[Here's](https://preview.highlight.io/~r/start-preview/?mode=production&variantId=01GY11FVTK9FMXX2DSCR6T4VRD&variantName=git%7Enew-reflame-app-1&userId=01FQZZ7XJFDA799Z1Z9DRCFXWA)
the preview I'm using to test my changes.

Would love to make Reflame better with your feedback! Just leave a
comment here, [shoot me an email](mailto:lewis@reflame.app), or ask for
an invite to the #highlight-reflame channel in Slack to chat there or
send me a DM.

## Are there any deployment considerations?

<!--
 Backend - Do we need to consider migrations or backfilling data?
-->

Definitely would be helpful to get a Render preview for this to poke
around in.

So, I've made more tests with a simple HTTP server and a client just download data through a simple GET. It's 100% easy to reproduce the issue if the client throttle at say 160kbits/s and a file of ~3.5MB is transferred. The HTTP server confirms (as does tcpdump) that all is transferred in a record time and using TCPview (or netstat) you can see that the connection is in FIN_WAIT_2.

It is all received because the TCPWindow quickly gets massive (a few MB) and so are the kernel's buffers. Obviously, Windows has a half-open socket timer that is started with the first FIN send and that causes the issue 100% time.

By limiting SO_RCVBUF, the TCPWindow cannot open that large as soon as the application does not get data fast enough. Of course, when we'll fill the stream and output buffers, TCPWindow will open because we absorb data super fast, but it will shrink back as soon as we stop pumping data in because we are full.

Now, 4KB is awfully low and I tried to increase it and it was still fine at 65kB, I could see TCPWindow opening and closing. The funny thing is that when you do a getsockopt, system will return 65kB. If you set what you got, the problem disappear as expected. BUT, if don't set anything, then Windows uses some much larger value (although it told you it does not) and then the issues happens.

Thanks philippe44 for tracking down the cause of this issue.

Demotes Psyker Pirates to Bounty Hunter Duty (#75031)

This PR demotes the Psyker-gang from a pirate team to a fugitive hunting
team. For more information on Psyker pirates, please refer to #71650.

Stuff this also does in the process:
- Gives fugitive hunters their own subfolder in the fugitives antagonist
folder, moves some of their stuff into hunter-specific files rather than
interlacing it with the rest of the fugitive code.
- Moves the hunter backstories to defines, to make reading things easier
while I made this change.
- Exhaustively moves everything related to psykers from being
pirate-oriented to hunter-oriented (typepaths, locations where stuff is
defined, etc. There should be nothing left behind related to psykers in
anything pirate related). (Tell me if I missed anything somehow).

They still get their ship (they even get their own custom
psyker-friendly prisoner capsule). They still have a bunch of lethally
chambered firearms. They're the same gunrunning nutcases they were
before, just as bounty hunters.

To assist with basic tasks such as "getting to the station" or "figuring
out who the fuck we're supposed to be kidnapping", the psykers have
"acquired" a Seer to assist them. They can _try_ to coordinate the
psykers and lead them through situations where their impairments put
them at too great a disadvantage. If you're one of the psykers, make
sure to keep this guy alive at all costs!

Why are they called Shikaris instead of hunters? Mariam-Webster says
it's a Hindi word for some kind of hunter/tracker, and it sounded like
something a bunch of space-junkies would call themselves because they
think it sounds cool.

They now also come with a slightly different motivation, now that they
can't directly threaten the crew for money. Psyker hunters now arrive
tasked with a dirty kidnapping job, payment rendered in GORE.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Psykers aren't up to the challenge of being pirates. They're bogged down
by a number of fundamental issues that render them unable to do anything
expected of pirates. As it currently stands, they present about as much
threat as you would expect from three blind junkies with guns.

Removing them wholesale would be kind of lame. They can function as a
bunch of chaotic-neutral gun-toting space-maniacs, but for the purposes
of gameplay, keeping them as pirates would be a waste of their talents.

Moving them to a lower-stakes role not only moves them to a niche they
are more capable of filling, but gives players a more lax environment to
get a grip on playing psyker without being overwhelmed.

Giving them a seeing-eye role should bring a more unique dynamic to how
psykers are played (that is, some semblance of organization rather than
blind flailing), and should help get over the mechanical hurdles of
being a psyker until better solutions can be made. It shouldn't be too
big of an impact on balance considering the psyker gang only has three
spawns, while most hunter packs have 4+.

`ex_act()` will work on basic mobs again (lol) + Unit Test (#74953)

basically ex_act's implementation on basic mobs would call parent and
then react to it's value, this is presumably to do the first check about
space vine mutations and whatever. the problem is that the `/mob/living`
implementation would itself also call parent, and that would always
return null because `/atom/proc/ex_act` doesn't have a set return value.
So, this simply would _always_ early return, with ex_act presumably
*never* working on basic mobs for at least four months now.

I decided to then change up the return values for pretty much all
implementations of `ex_act()` since there was no rhyme or reason to
returning null/FALSE/TRUE, and documenting why it's like that.

Just to make sure I wasn't breaking anything doing this (at least on
base implementations), I wrote a unit test for all of the three major
physical types in game (objs, mobs, turfs) because i am a paranoid
fuckar. we should be good to go now though.
## Why It's Good For The Game

i noticed this because placing c4's on sargeant araneus wouldn't
actually damage it whatsoever. now it actually does the stated 30
damage, but araneus has like 250 health so it doesn't actually matter in
the long run. whatever at least it does the damn 30 now.

also adds a unit test for this specific case as well as a range of other
cases to ensure this stuff doesn't silently break in this way anymore

[Needs TM] The Accelerataning (#1781)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Gone are the days of spam clicking buttons to move faster in a
direction, with this PR, ships now accelerate constantly (as long as you
have fuel and don't touch the throttle) in a direction you set, leading
to a much smoother flight experience. I imagine it's going to be a bit
tougher to thread gaps, but flying a spaceship *is* quite literally
rocket science. So.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29362068/220281305-12f6b796-9d8a-41ce-84a6-236bb03274da.gif)

Also actually makes the minimum and maximum speed work, and adjusts them
to a more tolerable level.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Eliminates the ability to cheese high speeds by spamming the accelerate
button, and also makes the flight experience much more pleasant as you
don't have to spam click to move a decent speed.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: A new system for ship flight, where you only point a direction and
set the throttle to change your speed, reducing the need for
spam-clicking.
fix: There's now a maximum and minimum speed, 600spm and 0.01spm,
respectively. The limits have been broken all this time.

Support for `no_std` mode (#1934)

Initial support for `no_std` mode.
This allows us to
1. Don't pass the whole standard library to compile actions that specify `no_std`
2. Conditionally select `crate_features` and `deps` based on whether `no_std` mode is used.
Currently the only supported modes are `off` and `alloc`, with a possibility to expand in the future.

The `no_std` support comes with the following caveats:
1. Targets in `exec` mode are still built with `std`; the logic here being that if a device has enough space to run bazel and rustc, std's presence would not be a problem. This also saves some additional transitions on `proc_macro`s (they need `std`), as they are built in `exec` mode.
2. Tests are still built with `std`, as `libtest` depends on `libstd`

There is quite an ugly hack to make us be able to `select` on the `no_std` flavor taking `exec` into account; I'm looking forward to the day where Bazel will expose better ways to inspect the cfg.

There is also one part I didn't manage to make work - having a `rust_test` that tests the `rust_shared_library` in `cc_common.link` mode; I got a link error for missing `__rg_alloc` & co. symbols, which should be present as we pass `--@rules_rust//rust/settings:experimental_use_global_allocator=True`. Unfortunately I could only spot this error on CI, and could not reproduce locally. I removed the test because the `rust_shared_library` is already tested via a `cc_test`. I will however give another shot at inspecting how my local setup differs from CI.

The `rust_binary` source code in `main.rs` was borrowed from https://github.com/jfarrell468/no_std_examples, big thanks to @jfarrell468 for letting me use it.

[MIRROR] Nanotrasen Budget Programme - Mothball Edition [BIRDSHOT STATION] [MDB IGNORE] (#20832)

* Nanotrasen Budget Programme - Mothball Edition [BIRDSHOT STATION] (#73502)

## About The Pull Request
---

The Space Tram is currently spaced. This is a known issue with not the
map, but Trams in general. The Space Tram is a Space Tram to encourage a
fix. Until then, the Space Tram is a maint tram that's an actual hazard
but cannot directly kill anyone, including lizards. Enjoy the commodity
as you zip from secmaint to medmaint.
-------------------------------------------------------

I... really don't know if I should be proud of myself here. This whole
process has been akin to a fever dream and it has only been little over
a month since I first created the .dmm for this. What started as a
simple yet humble reimagining of Birdboat has turned into an entirely
new station, and blown past Metastation sized proportions. This has been
my most expansive project yet, and somehow it's also been my quickest.
So without further ado, I unveil Birdshot - Successor to Birdoat.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Due to recent cost expenditures on Icemoon projects, and a growing
need for orbital research stations, Nanotrasen has decided to pull
Birdboat Station out of mothball after nearly 5 years of abandonment.**

Since then, the station has seen a variety of changes at the hands of
the various vagabond lawless scum and villains that have decided to make
the abandoned station their home. Do not fret though, a Nanotrasen
Operation has secured the companies rightful property for corporate use
once again, though you'll need to be the stewards of the remaining
cleanup operation.

------------------------------------------------------

Now, as you might have guessed by now, Birdshot is heavily based on
Birdboat station. Many of the decisions here follow the original layout,
and what had to be modified or moved still tries its best to replicate
and imitate what bird being said. At least, that was the idea initially.
This has very much grown into its own beast and as such, while the main
inspiration has been Birdboat, there are a lot of new ideas thrown into
the mix that really give this station its own unique and deserving
identity. Maybe it's not perfect, but I've been inspired by @ MMMiracles
own performance with Tramstation to keep working on Birdshot and
updating it with better and improved faculties. For now, though the
station is in a playable state, and that means I'm making a PR. If I had
to borrow the words of the good MMM, I would call this **Birdshot:
Season 0**

![BirdSHOTFULL2-26-S](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33048583/221432760-27af1889-d2d0-4861-9435-df4258525fae.png)

See the image in more detail here: https://imgur.com/iT5Vi8k

## Why It's Good For The Game

We've been with the same 5 maps for a while now. @ san7890 jokingly said
that I could sacrifice Metastation back in November if I remade Birdboat
but modern. Obviously that wasn't going to happen, yet I was spurred on
by the idea. When I began this in earnest early this January, @ EOBGames
said that a Birdboat sized map would replace Kilostation in the
rotation. Interestingly we're not a small map anymore so I honestly have
no clue where this goes. Maybe that ephemeral 6th map slot that's been
rumored.

What I can say, is that Birdshot is wholly unlike anything else that is
currently in rotation. It's got an engineering section that feels way
too small for a station of that size, almost evocative of Cere. Cargo is
blessed with a Boutique that makes use of @ Fikou's new mannequin dolls.
Command is outfitted with a Corporate Guest Suite, and Officials sent
from Nanotrasen can embark from their ferry into the safety of their own
Corporate Dock. Elements of Cerestation are present, yet not in a way
that makes traversal annoying. Furthermore we have **2 Trams** (that I
have yet to get functional but we'll get there) on Birdshot, that's
right 2. One Security Prison Tram, and then other, a Space Tram. Both
Novel in their own ways. Departments on Birdshot twist and turn, and
there's an abundance of Maintenance Tunnels to cut through everything,
for the brave and the bold that is. And there's plenty left to discover,
but I'd rather let Birdshot speak for itself. I'm proud of this one.

If you want something new, this is something that is almost the complete
opposite of Chilled Station - Explicitly Designed to send you back to
the metal death trap that is: **Space Station 13.**

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Birdshot station has been pulled out of Mothball.
add: New station areas and places to visit. A Mix of Kilo and Delta
maints with winding shortcutting paths.
add: A host of new shuttles to support this bold endeavor to reclaim
something that really shouldn't be reclaimed.
add: Two Trams, Two Trams.
add: For the last time Bob, the gaping hole is a **feature.** Use the
breach shutters or have the virologist make starlight.
add: A smiling salute to stations past...
add: Secrets.

Demotes Psyker Pirates to Bounty Hunter Duty (#75031)

This PR demotes the Psyker-gang from a pirate team to a fugitive hunting
team. For more information on Psyker pirates, please refer to #71650.

Stuff this also does in the process:
- Gives fugitive hunters their own subfolder in the fugitives antagonist
folder, moves some of their stuff into hunter-specific files rather than
interlacing it with the rest of the fugitive code.
- Moves the hunter backstories to defines, to make reading things easier
while I made this change.
- Exhaustively moves everything related to psykers from being
pirate-oriented to hunter-oriented (typepaths, locations where stuff is
defined, etc. There should be nothing left behind related to psykers in
anything pirate related). (Tell me if I missed anything somehow).

They still get their ship (they even get their own custom
psyker-friendly prisoner capsule). They still have a bunch of lethally
chambered firearms. They're the same gunrunning nutcases they were
before, just as bounty hunters.

To assist with basic tasks such as "getting to the station" or "figuring
out who the fuck we're supposed to be kidnapping", the psykers have
"acquired" a Seer to assist them. They can _try_ to coordinate the
psykers and lead them through situations where their impairments put
them at too great a disadvantage. If you're one of the psykers, make
sure to keep this guy alive at all costs!

Why are they called Shikaris instead of hunters? Mariam-Webster says
it's a Hindi word for some kind of hunter/tracker, and it sounded like
something a bunch of space-junkies would call themselves because they
think it sounds cool.

They now also come with a slightly different motivation, now that they
can't directly threaten the crew for money. Psyker hunters now arrive
tasked with a dirty kidnapping job, payment rendered in GORE.

Psykers aren't up to the challenge of being pirates. They're bogged down
by a number of fundamental issues that render them unable to do anything
expected of pirates. As it currently stands, they present about as much
threat as you would expect from three blind junkies with guns.

Removing them wholesale would be kind of lame. They can function as a
bunch of chaotic-neutral gun-toting space-maniacs, but for the purposes
of gameplay, keeping them as pirates would be a waste of their talents.

Moving them to a lower-stakes role not only moves them to a niche they
are more capable of filling, but gives players a more lax environment to
get a grip on playing psyker without being overwhelmed.

Giving them a seeing-eye role should bring a more unique dynamic to how
psykers are played (that is, some semblance of organization rather than
blind flailing), and should help get over the mechanical hurdles of
being a psyker until better solutions can be made. It shouldn't be too
big of an impact on balance considering the psyker gang only has three
spawns, while most hunter packs have 4+.

Metro: Refactor `forceTapAnimation` into `TiltIndication`

Fixes https://github.com/louis993546/Metro-Compose/issues/192.

This was a real PITA to reverse engineer and figure out thanks to the
lackluster `Indication` and `Interaction` documentation.

The API is also missing some expected features like proper rotation
so instead we have to use `android.graphics.Camera` for the actual
tilting effect.

Hopefully my pain reverse engineering `rememberRipple`& co and then
subsequent sharing of a real-world reimplementation will prevent
future generations from having to suffer the same way I have.

Y'all have been forewarned, if you choose to tread where I've tread
you'll only experience madness.

Allows Export of your Preferences JSON File (#75014)

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

This was spoken about in #70492 (specifically
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/70492#issuecomment-1278069607),
and I have been waiting for this to be implemented for some time. It
never got implemented, so I decided to code it myself.

Basically, **if the server host doesn't disable it**, you are free to
export your JSONs as a player, right from the stat-panel. It's a pretty
JSON on 515 versions, too!

It's right here:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235251447-1c977718-51fd-4025-8d89-c60bffc379ec.png)

Here's what the prettified JSON looks like on 515.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235321061-4a217e26-c082-4bba-b54a-2c780defda0a.png)

There's a cooldown (default to 10 seconds) between exporting your
preferences.

#### Why is this config?

It's because in the past, a server host could always just file-share the
.sav or .json or whatever to the player, but they would have to do the
explicit option of actually bothering to make the files accessible to
the player. In that same line of logic, the server operator will have to
explicitly make the files accessible. This is mostly because I'm not
sure how good `ftp()` is at being a player function and wanted to have
some sort of cap/control somehow in case an exploit vector is detected
or it's just plain spammed by bots, so we'll just leave it up to the
direct providers of this data to elect if they wish to provide the data
or not.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Players don't have to log into Server A to remember what hairstyle they
loved using when they want to swap to Server B! That's amazing actually.
I always forget what ponytail my character has, and it'll be nice to
have the hairstyle in a readily accessible place (after I prettify the
JSON for myself).

It's also more convenient for server hosts to make player data like this
accessible if they really want to, too.

If we ever add an _import_ feature in the future (which would have to be
done with a LOT of care), this will also be useful. I wouldn't advise it
though having taken a precursory look at how much goes into it while
trying to ascertain the scope of this PR.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: The game now supports export of your preferences into a JSON file!
The verb (export-preferences) should now be available in the OOC tab of
your stat-panel if enabled by server operators.
server: Exporting player preferences is controlled by a configuration
option, 'FORBID_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'. If you do not wish to let clients
access the ftp() function to their own preferences file (probably for
bandwidth reasons?) you should uncomment this or add it to your config
somehow.
config: Server operators are also able to set the cooldown between
requests to download the JSON Preferences file via the
'SECONDS_COOLDOWN_FOR_PREFERENCES_EXPORT' config option.

Windows Runtime support is on track.

That's cool (in all humility), that's damn cool.

I've implemented the Windows Runtime specific code (to handle a
Window creation), and I managed to do it without touching my engine.
I've added a brand new module (a separate VS project) to my solution
which use Engine/includes/platforms as includes, and then I implement
the winrt.hpp header in this module. After that, all I have to do, is
to link this new module to my Demo executable and baaam magic is done.
Now I can only change a simple #define in my Demo main.cpp to switch
between platforms. And the bonus part ? Given the fact that there's no
coupling between the module and the engine (beside the header), when
I change the #define in my Demo, it only rebuild the Demo project, not
all the solution. Fast as hell.

I remember that I didn't answer a question that's maybe you've been
asking yourself : Why the f*** did I start this project in C ?

Because I LOVE C. I mean C is a complete language, with a specification
and standard library which can be contains on a postcard, low level
mechanisms, simplicity (I mean no public/private, no template, no class
mechanisms to respect and implement...), and completely gives you the
control on what you build.

I know that most of the languages now implements security (like a memory
security). But honestly, sometime we may want to do something which is
considered as a bad code to read, but which is fast. And THAT'S
what matters for me : performance.

With C you can strictly decide how your memory bits will be arranged, how
many CPU cycles will your algorithms takes, you have control over
everything. Which means that you can fine tune your apps to really use
the full potential of a computer.

Nowdays computers have the compute power to move mountains, and still
99% of the apps on the market are as slow as sleep slugs in a blackhole
accretion disk ! Because we want to help developers create those apps.
But as a developer let me tells it : WE DON'T CARE ABOUT DEVELOPERS. We
care about users ! Do you want to eat garbage, just because it will help
the 5 Stars Chef ? No. Do you want to leave on an house with poor foundations
and walls, just because it will help the architect ? No. Same thing applies
to programs. And in my opinion, C still is the only language which can
perfectly guaranties that.
(If this subject interest you, I strongly recommand that you take a look
on https://handmade.network : a community of developers thinking the same
way and making blazing fast applications.)

Another reason why I use it, and the most important :

It's my side project. I love C. I don't plan on building a team and selling
it (yet). So I do what I want as long as I have fun.

Remove runtime out of bound check debugging util (#277)

The change in this PR is easy to understand and has low impact, but the
motivation really needs discussion and is a much more impactful thing.
And I want to use this PR to discuss it.

In https://github.com/NVIDIA/Fuser/issues/248 we agreed to add "stride
order" support to codegen, and later in today's morning meeting on
matmul, Christian talked about the idea of "allocation_domain" which is
a generalization of the idea of "stride order". Basically, we are not
married to the rFactor domain of the tensor when doing allocation and
indexing. We can pick an arbitrary vector of `IterDomain`s between root
and leaf domain, stop the indexing process on that vector, and do
allocation based on that vector. For the idea of "stride order", which
is a special case of the new idea, this vector is just the reordered
rFactor domains. This should be easily approachable with our new
indexing approach https://github.com/NVIDIA/Fuser/pull/32. This idea
does make a lot of sense, so the purpose is not to discuss whether we
want to take that idea, but how to implement that idea.

A question comes to me during implementing is, say we have a tensor
whose semantic shape is `NCHW` but stride order is `NHWC`, should the
`stride` field of the tensor be in the order of `NCHW` or `NHWC`?
Currently, we are using the same order as PyTorch, which is the semantic
order `NCHW`. I think this does make a lot of sense in terms of stride
order support. Having the stride in the semantic order is not the most
naturally way for indexing, we do need a `NHWC->NCHW` axis map to grab
the correct stride, but it is pretty simple to implement this.
Considering all factors, including consitency with PyTorch, cleanness in
the executor's code, I still think the semantics order is the best
design.

However, this design start to make no sense when we generalize the
"stride order" idea into the "allocation_domain" idea. For example, for
an `NCHW` tensor, the actual allocation can be `(H*W, N*C)`, and the
size of `contiguity` will be `2` instead of `4`. So the `Tensor::stride`
in `runtime/tensor.cu` should also be an array of size `2` instead of
`4`. The idea of "allocation_domain" requires the stride of a tensor to
be strictly one-to-one mapped to the allocation domain. As a special
case, the "stride order" idea has no choice but to follow the same
design, which is, the stride will be stored in `NHWC` order. This means,
the order of stride in our kernel is different from those in ATen, we
can not directly copy the stride. We need to permute the stride so it is
sorted descending.

But the above problem is not the biggest trouble we have, the biggest
trouble is: If we have a `NCHW` tensor allocated as `(H*W, N*C)`, is
this tensor a 4D tensor or a 2D tensor? I think the answer is "neither".
In terms of allocation and stride, it is definitely 2D, but in terms of
semantics, it is 4D. Again, in the past, we had a concept "the
dimensionality of a tensor" which is a degeneracy of two concepts "the
semantic dimensionality of a tensor" and "the allocation dimensionality
of a tensor". Now we break the symmetry, and degenerating concepts are
no longer degenerate. In codegen, we are generating a lot of tensor
shapes like `T0.shape[0]`, and I think the easiest way to handle them is
to keep `shape` in semantic dimensionality, while make `stride` in
allocation dimensionality. That said, `struct Tensor` now needs two
template arguments for dimensionalities. And unfortunately, we can no
longer do out of bound check any more.

Introduction - About the data 
Dataset: New York City Airbnb dataset
Domain: Short-term rental market in NYC
Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
          The New York City Airbnb dataset, is a comprehensive collection of information on Airbnb listings in New York City. This dataset includes data on more than 48,000 Airbnb listings in the city, spanning from 2010 to 2021. The dataset provides a wealth of information on each listing, including its location, price, availability, amenities, and reviews from guests. This data can be used by researchers, data scientists, and business analysts to gain insights into the Airbnb market in New York City, including trends in pricing, occupancy, and guest satisfaction. This dataset is an invaluable resource to analyze the short-term rental market in one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who are looking to rent their homes with people who are looking for accommodations. The platform has revolutionized the travel industry, and it is now one of the most popular ways to travel around the world. As a result, it has become essential for Airbnb hosts to optimize their listings to attract more customers and earn more money.
Problem Statement  
           The problem we are trying to solve is to help Airbnb hosts in New York City to optimize their listings to attract more customers and increase their revenue.
The primary challenge faced by Airbnb is to create a platform that offers a seamless and enjoyable experience for both hosts and guests while also maintaining trust and safety within the community.

Business Problem Statement from Airbnb NYC dataset
For Airbnb hosts located in New York City, the following are some of the specific business problems that need to be addressed:

1.	Low occupancy rates: Many Airbnb hosts struggle with low occupancy rates due to intense competition and oversupply of listings in the New York City market. They need to find ways to differentiate their properties and attract more bookings.
2.	Legal compliance: Airbnb hosts in NYC face strict regulations that limit their ability to rent out their properties, including caps on rental duration and requirements for obtaining permits and paying taxes. Hosts need to ensure that they are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
3.	Pricing optimization: Setting the right price for a property is critical to maximizing profits on Airbnb. Hosts need to be able to accurately assess market demand and adjust their pricing strategies accordingly.
4.	Safety and security: Hosts need to ensure that their properties are safe and secure for guests, which includes implementing appropriate security measures and adhering to Airbnb's safety standards.
5.	Guest experience: Airbnb hosts need to provide a positive and memorable experience for guests to encourage repeat bookings and positive reviews. This includes offering exceptional hospitality, providing amenities that meet guest needs, and maintaining a high standard of cleanliness and comfort.

Objective
•	Identify the key factors that impact the price of an Airbnb listing in New York City.
•	Analyze the most popular types of listings and the neighborhoods they are located in.
•	Identify the most important amenities that guests are looking for in an Airbnb listing in New York City.
•	Analyze the popularity of different types of listings (e.g., entire home/apt, private room, shared room) in each neighborhood of New York City to determine most effective room type to offer in each location. 
•	Determine the key factors that impact the competitive pricing strategies.


Dataset Columns

Stops station blueprints from expanding areas of non atmos adjacent turfs. [MDB IGNORE] (#20480)

* Stops station blueprints from expanding areas of non atmos adjacent turfs. (#74620)

## About The Pull Request
Fixes #74605

the problem starts with `detect_room()` proc. This proc returns turfs
even those with `atmos_adjacent_turfs` = null. This means it returns
turfs that has a wall, airlock, window etc i.e. whatever that stops air
from flowing through it. This coupled together with `create_area()`
causes some wierdness.

Let's take an example
![Screenshot

Area A is well defined i.e. it has been created via the station
blueprints and is highlighted in green, Area B however is only
theoretical i.e. we haven't created it yet or we are about to create it.
Now you might be thinking Area A is completely walled & sealed off, it
should be physically impossible to expand it unless we broke down one of
it's walls and so since we are standing in Area B it shoudn't even give
me the option to expand area A Right? right? r.i.g.h.t?
![Screenshot
(155)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110812394/230770056-169cbab3-4516-4da7-ae2c-4f40b50be9ba.png)
Well PHFUUK. The area editor completely ignores the laws of physics and
allows me expand Area A anyway. This could cause some real power gaming
shit because if you create an area next to an area having an APC you
could use that area power without even making your own apc by simply
expanding that area(like using someone else's wifi from outside their
house without them even knowing)

#73850 accidently built on top of this as it relied on this to detect
duplicate APC's but the checks became way too strict as it would check
areas of surrounding walls for apc's and throw the conflicting apc
error. You can now build room's next to each other even if they have
fuctioning apc's however you still can't build rooms in space on top of
shuttle walls because that's been the default behaviour for years and
hasn't been touched one bit.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: station blueprints no longer expands & detects areas of non atmos
adjacent turfs.
/:cl:

* Stops station blueprints from expanding areas of non atmos adjacent turfs.

[TASK] Respect the url scheme of configured api url

In a couple of places, `https` has been hardcoded enforced
as request scheme, ignoring the scheme of the configured
api url.

This may seem to be a "security" enforcement, but these
kind of overrides are not very user friendly and hidden
magic is always a pain in the ass for debugging issues.

This change now re-uses the configured api url scheme
when building api requests. One test is adopted to do
the same.

The donated methods on the `Configuration` class to
access api url parts are used for this.

Add ideology independent names for countries.

In basegame this is only used for Collab Government names, so so far only Olenia had this defined in EaW, as we don't use that puppet type anythwhere else. I was thinking of adding them regardless, my bored ass decided to finally do it.

Also grouped CHN puppet names together like SOL, NLR, and TEM ones had.

And moved PCB to basegame and EWI to griffonia file.

Merge #99174 #99624 #99699 #99759 #99813 #99839 #99865 #99878

99174: sql: fix circular dependencies in views r=rharding6373 a=rharding6373

This change fixes node crashes that could happen due to stack overflow if views were created with circular dependencies.

Fixes: #98999
Epic: none
Co-authored-by: chengxiong@cockroachlabs.com

Release note (bug fix): If views are created with circular dependencies, CRDB returns the error "cyclic view dependency for relation" instead of crashing the node. This bug is present since at least 21.1.

99624: testutils: add infrastructure for reusable test fixtures r=RaduBerinde a=RaduBerinde

Certain storage-related tests/benchmarks generate fixtures and attempt to reuse them across invocations. This is important because fixtures can be large and slow to generate; but more importantly the generation is non-deterministic and we want to use the exact same fixture when comparing benchmark data.

Currently the tests achieve this by using a `.gitignore`d subdirectory inside the source tree. This does not work with bazel (which executes the test in a sandbox).

This commit addresses the issue by adding new test infrastructure for reusable fixtures. We use the user's `.cache` directory instead of the source tree (specifically $HOME/.cache/crdb-test-fixtures/...). For bazel, we make sure the path is available (and writable) in the sandbox and we pass the path to the test through an env var.

Fixes #83599.

Release note: None
Epic: none

99699: spanconfig: integrate SpanConfigBounds with the Store and KVSubscriber r=ajwerner a=arulajmani

This patch integrates `SpanConfigBounds` with the `KVSubscriber` and
`spanconfig.Store`. The `spanconfig.Store` used by the `KVSubscriber`
now has a handle to the global tenant capability state. It uses this to
clamp any secondary tenant span configs that are not in conformance
before returning them.

By default, clamping of secondary tenant span configurations is turned
off. It can be enabled using the `spanconfig.bounds.enabled` cluster
setting. The setting is hidden.

Fixes: https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/99689
Informs #99911

Release note: None

99759: roachtest: set lower min range_max_bytes in multitenant_distsql test r=rharding6373 a=rharding6373

The multitenant_distsql roachtest relies on a smaller range size than the new default min of range_max_bytes (64MiB) due to performance and resource limitations. We set the COCKROACH_MIN_RANGE_MAX_BYTES to allow the test to use the smaller range.

Fixes: #99626
Epic: None

Release note: None

99813: spanconfig: do not fatal in NeedsSplit and ComputeSplitKey r=irfansharif a=arulajmani

See individual commits for details. 

Fixes #97336.

99839: schemachanger: Annotate all tables if ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS on non-existent table r=Xiang-Gu a=Xiang-Gu

Previously, if table `t` does not exist, `ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS t` will only mark `t` as non-existent. This is inadequate because for stmt like `ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS t ADD FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES t_other` we will not touch `t_other` and the validation logic will later complain that `t_other` is not fully resolved nor marked as non-existent. This commit fixes it by marking all tables in this ALTER TABLE stmt as non-existent if the `t` is non-existent, so we can pass the validation.

Fixes issues discovered in #99185
Epic: None

99865: roachtest: fix query used to get job status in backup/mixed-version r=srosenberg a=renatolabs

At the moment, we only query job status in mixed-version state (so we should always use `system.jobs`). However, the code added in this commit should continue to work once we start developing 23.2, as we're checking that the cluster version is at least 23.1 before using `crdb_internal.system_jobs`.

Epic: none

Release note: None

99878: jobs: change job_info.info_key to string r=dt a=dt

Release note: none.
Epic: none.

Hopefully we get this one in now before it is released and harder to change later. I think if we go with bytes, we'll spend the next several years typing convert_to over and over, or forgetting to and then typing it, when debugging.

cafe update

My name is Peter Griffin. I'm 44 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Quahog, on Spooner Street, and I am married to my wife Lois. I work as an employee at the Pawtucket Brewery, and I get home eventually. I don't smoke, but I occasionally go to the Drunken Clam with Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a cold brew with Brian and listening to about twenty minutes of “Bird Is The Word” before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up with Dr. Hartman.

I'm trying to explain that I'm a family guy. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, except for that stupid giant chicken. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Introduce Lazyplug

Other hotplugging methods including mpdecision and intelli_plug focuses
on how should we turn off CPU cores. They hotplugs the individual CPU
cores based on the current load divided by thread capacity.
Lazyplug takes a whole new approach on how we should do hotplugging
based on the foundation of the other side of the coin;
“Linux’s hotplugging is very inefficient.”

Current hotplugging code on Linux is a total waste of CPU cycles and
delays, so rather than hotplugging and hurt performance & battery life,
just leaving the CPU cores on might be a better choice. This kind of
approach is spreading out more and more.
Samsung has been using this method for a very long time with big.LITTLE
devices and recent Nexus 6 firmware also does the similar thing.

Lazyplug just leaves them on, most of the time. It also tries to solve
some problems with the “Always on” approach. On situations such as video
playback, turning on all CPU cores is not battery friendly. So Lazyplug
*does* actually turns off CPU cores, but only when idle state is long
enough(to reduce the number of CPU core switchings) and when the device
has its screen off(determination is done via earlysuspend or
powersuspend because framebuffer API causes troubles on hotplugging CPU
cores).

Basic methodology :
Lazyplug uses majority of the codes from intelli_plug by faux123 to
determine when to turn off CPU cores. If the system has been idle for
(DEF_SAMPLING_MS * DEF_IDLE_COUNT)ms, it turns off the CPU cores. And if
the next poll determines 1 core isn’t enough, it fires up all CPU cores
(instead of selective CPU cores; which is the traditional intelli_plug’s
method).
Lazyplug also takes touch-screen input events to fire up CPU cores to
minimize noticeable performance degradation.
There’s also a “lazy mode” for *not* aggressively turning on CPU cores
on scenario such as video playback. For example, if you hook up
lazyplug_enter_lazy() to the video session open function, Lazyplug won’t
aggressively turn on CPU cores and tries to handle it with 1 CPU core.

* TODO :
* Dual-core mode : YouTube video playback is mostly single-threaded.
* It usually hovers around 10% ~ 30% of total CPU usage on quad-core
* device. That means 1 CPU core might not be enough to handle it, but
* also turning on all CPU cores is unnecessarily wasting power.

Deadchat Announcement Variety Pack 1 (#75140)

## About The Pull Request

Adds announce_to_ghosts()/notify_ghosts() calls to a bunch of different
things.

**THIS INCLUDES:**
- Powersink being activated/reaching critical (explosion) heat capacity.
- His Grace being awoken.
- Hot Potatoes being armed.
- Ascension Rituals being completed.
- Eyesnatcher victims.
- Ovens exploding as a result of the Aurora Caelus event.
- Wizard Imposter spawns.
- Rock-Paper-Scissors with death as the result of Helbital consumption.
- BSA impact sites.
- Spontaneous Appendicitis.
- The purchasing of a badass syndie balloon.
- The Supermatter beginning to delaminate.

This was everything that I could think of that would be worth announcing
to deadchat. These were all chosen with consideration to questions like
"how easy would it be to spam deadchat with this?" and "will observers
actually see the interesting thing happen, or just the aftermath?".

Not gonna lie, I've really become an observer main as of recently. Maybe
that's being reflected in my recent PRs. Who's to say? Deadchat
Announcement Variety Pack 2 will probably never come out. Sorry.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Gives deadchat a better indiciation of when/where something **REALLY
FUNNY** is about to happen. Draws attention to certain things that are
likely to gather an audience anyways, but sooner (for your viewing
pleasure). In simple terms, it helps the observers observe things
better.

Some cases, such as the aurora caelus or helbitaljanken, are occurrences
so rare that they deserve the audience.
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
qol: Observers now recieve an alert when a powersink is activated/about
to explode.
qol: His Grace being awoken now alerts observers, to give you a
headstart on your murderbone ghost ring.
qol: Ascension Rituals being completed will also alert observers, for
basically the same reason.
qol: Arming a hot potato will now alert observers. Catch!
qol: Eyesnatcher victims will now notify observers, and invite them to
laugh at their state of misery and impotence.
qol: Observers will be notified of any acute references to The Simpsons
or other 20th Television America copyright properties.
qol: Wizard Imposter spawns alert observers, much like any other ghost
role event should.
qol: Playing Rock-Paper-Scissors with death will now alert the observers
and invite them to watch. Better not choke!
qol: Observers now get an orbit link for BSA impact sites. Why does it
keep teleporting me to the AI upload??
qol: Spontaneous Appendicitis now alerts deadchat. 
qol: The purchasing of a badass syndie balloon now alerts deadchat. You
might not be any more powerful, but at least you have an audience.
qol: When beginning to delaminate, the Supermatter will alert observers
and invite them to watch the fireworks.

Fix C iterop with string args, again.

- Fix segfaults when passing string args under --release
- Fix string argument duplication
- Fix bug where C returning a bool would be inverted
- Fix bug where global variables were wiped for imports

All of this in a very very small patch, unfortunately this took me hours of mindlessly tweaking and rewriting a small part of code. Pouring over libffi and Rust `Vec`, and `CString` documentation multiple times. At one point even looking at my codes LLVM IR! I tried disabling `--release` optimization for that function with everything from assembly to `black_box` but it still wouldn't work, in frustration I added a print statment and *that* fixed it! I gave up and slapped a comment and `#[cfg(profile = "release")]` on it, I was fed up with the bug and ready to give up, when I found another bug. Passing two strings would result in two copys of the first string. Now, no println macro would fix this. So I tried some other tricks to get it to work (like changing `for arg in args {` to `for i in 0..args.len() { let arg = args.get(i).unwrap()`, which managed to fix a similar error), to no avail, I was about to give up and take a break until rust started making sense, when miraculously it worked! I hesitantly tested under `--release` and it still worked, tentatively I removed the aforementioned print hack (haha, a hack for sack, someone should make an impl called hackysack) and it worked, a little bit of cleaning up later and here I am, writing a rant on a commit smaller than the average typo change commit. Well thanks for reading and have a nice day!

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Demotes Psyker Pirates to Bounty Hunter Duty (#5644)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/75031
-----
## About The Pull Request

This PR demotes the Psyker-gang from a pirate team to a fugitive hunting
team. For more information on Psyker pirates, please refer to #71650.

Stuff this also does in the process:
- Gives fugitive hunters their own subfolder in the fugitives antagonist
folder, moves some of their stuff into hunter-specific files rather than
interlacing it with the rest of the fugitive code.
- Moves the hunter backstories to defines, to make reading things easier
while I made this change.
- Exhaustively moves everything related to psykers from being
pirate-oriented to hunter-oriented (typepaths, locations where stuff is
defined, etc. There should be nothing left behind related to psykers in
anything pirate related). (Tell me if I missed anything somehow).

They still get their ship (they even get their own custom
psyker-friendly prisoner capsule). They still have a bunch of lethally
chambered firearms. They're the same gunrunning nutcases they were
before, just as bounty hunters.

To assist with basic tasks such as "getting to the station" or "figuring
out who the fuck we're supposed to be kidnapping", the psykers have
"acquired" a Seer to assist them. They can _try_ to coordinate the
psykers and lead them through situations where their impairments put
them at too great a disadvantage. If you're one of the psykers, make
sure to keep this guy alive at all costs!

Why are they called Shikaris instead of hunters? Mariam-Webster says
it's a Hindi word for some kind of hunter/tracker, and it sounded like
something a bunch of space-junkies would call themselves because they
think it sounds cool.

They now also come with a slightly different motivation, now that they
can't directly threaten the crew for money. Psyker hunters now arrive
tasked with a dirty kidnapping job, payment rendered in GORE.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Psykers aren't up to the challenge of being pirates. They're bogged down
by a number of fundamental issues that render them unable to do anything
expected of pirates. As it currently stands, they present about as much
threat as you would expect from three blind junkies with guns.

Removing them wholesale would be kind of lame. They can function as a
bunch of chaotic-neutral gun-toting space-maniacs, but for the purposes
of gameplay, keeping them as pirates would be a waste of their talents.

Moving them to a lower-stakes role not only moves them to a niche they
are more capable of filling, but gives players a more lax environment to
get a grip on playing psyker without being overwhelmed.

Giving them a seeing-eye role should bring a more unique dynamic to how
psykers are played (that is, some semblance of organization rather than
blind flailing), and should help get over the mechanical hurdles of
being a psyker until better solutions can be made. It shouldn't be too
big of an impact on balance considering the psyker gang only has three
spawns, while most hunter packs have 4+.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Psyker Pirates are now Psyker Shikari (bounty hunters).

One hot summer day Motu and his friend Patlu decided to buy a mango. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the mango was weighed, and the scales showed 
 units. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Motu and Patlu are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the mango in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of units, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the mango in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

 

Input :

The first (and the only) input line contains integer number 
 (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000) — the weight of the mango bought by the boys.

Output :

Print YES, if the boys can divide the mango into two parts, each of them weighing even number of units; and NO in the opposite case.

Vulpi games v. 1.0 | Realease

This is the biggest version yet (and probably will stay that way)

Added:
- Meta tags for better SEO
- Index.html content - Some more content about this whole website etc,
- Games.html content - For now no games so no bigger content, this will change in the future. Discord image is a url.
- About.html - Includes buttons for About, FAQ, Awards, other. Every button displays different text. The state you left on is saved in Local Storage (Cool, right :+1:)
- Added logos, images, discord logo, mail logo,
- Added footer, now you can see the disclaimer about copyright, contact methods and finally newsletter (which doesn't work for now but don't worry I will fix that later)
- Audios for dark/light onclick events,
- Gradient svg for the baner in index.html why: because it looks COOL!
- Changelog png for index.html content
- Darkmode.js for remembering chosen option (dark/light theme) and changing the theme that overrides system preference without dark theme my eyes would turn red, well that is a good thing :)
- Discord logos, for discord invites urls.
- email icons, for email stuff.
- game jpg for index.html content,
- GameC jpg - cropped version of game jpg, so the bigger resolutions is better looking.
- icon png is the icon of Vulpi Game website.
- lightOff svg is a half-moon icon for dark theme option,
- lightOn svg is a sun icon for a light theme option,
- lightOn-sunin svg is a other variation of ligth on svg.
- logoico svg is used in the icon of a websitem
- logotext svg is the 'VULPI' text in logo,
- scripts js is some weird file that just does some things, So it changes text in about.html when a button is pressed, hides and shows stuff when a picture is hovered by mouse in index.html, and finally when you click email icon in the footer it copies contact-email to clipboard, litterally nothing sketchy. You can check it bruh.
- styles css - I will be hones with you, I'm deply sorry for anyone who wants to read this, This is painfully bad, Probably should fix this. Its a lot of mess :|

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Minerals have been refactored so costs and minerals in items are now in terms of mineral defines. (#5615)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/75052
-----
## About The Pull Request

Ladies, Gentlemen, Gamers. You're probably wondering why I've called you
all here (through the automatic reviewer request system). So, mineral
balance! Mineral balance is less a balance and more of a nervous white
dude juggling spinning plates on a high-wire on his first day. The fact
it hasn't failed after going on this long is a miracle in and of itself.

This PR does not change mineral balance. What this does is moves over
every individual cost, both in crafting recipes attached to an object
over to a define based system. We have 3 defines:

`sheet_material_amount=2000` . Stock standard mineral sheet. This being
our central mineral unit, this is used for all costs 2000+.
`half_sheet_material_amount=1000` . Same as above, but using iron rods
as our inbetween for costs of 1000-1999.
`small_material_amount=100` . This hits 1-999. This covers... a
startlingly large amount of the codebase. It's feast or famine out here
in terms of mineral costs as a result, items are either sheets upon
sheets, or some fraction of small mats.

Shout out to riot darts for being the worst material cost in the game. I
will not elaborate.

Regardless, this has no functional change, but it sets the groundwork
for making future changes to material costs much, MUCH easier, and moves
over to a single, standardized set of units to help enforce coding
standards on new items, and will bring up lots of uncomfortable balance
questions down the line.

For now though, this serves as some rough boundaries on how items costs
are related, and will make adjusting these values easier going forward.

Except for foam darts.

I did round up foam darts.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Adjusting mineral balance on the macro scale will be as simple as
changing the aforementioned mineral defines, where the alternative is a
rats nest of magic number defines. ~~No seriously, 11.25 iron for a foam
dart are you kidding me what is the POINT WHY NOT JUST MAKE IT 11~~

Items individual numbers have not been adjusted yet, but we can
standardize how the conversation can be held and actually GET SOMEWHERE
on material balance as opposed to throwing our hands up or ignoring it
for another 10 years.

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Mineral costs have been reformatted to be scaled by the number
of sheets, darts, and small fractions they make up.
qol: Foam darts no longer hold a fraction of a unit of iron within
themselves.

Fix for varediting bitflags. (#2735)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

I am honestly at a loss as to what is happening here. I do not speak
HTML all too well, and at cursory reading buttons _should_ be returning
their value, which is `1`, `2` and so on. But on debugging, they
actually return their text (`Save`, `Cancel`), which does not proceed to
work with the code receiving it. Changed that code accordingly, and then
edited the values for good measure in case somebody better versed in
HTML would get a heart attack from my folly.

Also, this looks ugly to me. Which button is which flag here?

This, in my humble opinion, is easier to read (would actually look
better outside of local server messing fancy windows as is its wont):

In the process, I confess, my HTML illiteracy broke a little something
again. But we are not actually _using_ `slidecolor`, so hopefully it is
not actually important.

You got away again
You must think you're so clever
I promise you agent
Can't escape me forever
We're playing a game
You take from me, I take from you
But every game ends
And when this one is through

[Chorus]
I expect you to die
(The best of the best, you'll die like the rest)
I expect you to die
I expect you to die
When you finally see the worst side of me
We'll finally be eye to eye
I expect you to die

[Verse 2]
That voice in your ear
They've no chance to save you
A mere puppeteer
They only enslave you
You're a piece on a board
I bet with my wealth my armies and dreams
Your every success unveils still greater schemes
A lake full of acid, a drill from the sky
If you try to fight me, we'll watch your hopes die
Lasers and saw blades with sharks on standby
You're right where I want you
And this is goodbye
You might also like

We'll finally be eye to eye
I expect you to die
