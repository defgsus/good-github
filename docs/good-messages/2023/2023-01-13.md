v.2.0.0 - Negative Traits Rollout
General:
	- Asked Star to fix Sandbox Options mod, now it's working, enjoy changing your sandbox settings after game start (link in description)
	- Claustrophobic and Agoraphobic can be gained now. Existing progress is lost due splitting system into 2 different parts. New Sandbox Options included.
	- Outdoorsman can be lost now. Existing progress is lost due to system being rebuilt. New Sandbox Options included.
	- Pluviophobia can be gained now, Pluviophile can be lost now. Existing progress is saved but can be a bit weird since system was rescaled from 0% - 200% to -100% - 200%. New Sandbox Options included.
	- Asthmatic can be gained and lost now. Be aware that if you pick it on character creation, it's permanent. Sandbox options included.
	- Changed Sleep system due to impossible logic problems, now it's much simpler, and it's much easier to shift your schedule. I liked old system, but it wasn't working as intended.
	- Smoker is added and can be lost and earned. Sandbox options included.
	- Added ModOption to enable/disable notifications whenever you get the trait.
Moodles:
	- New sandbox options for Bloodlust and Sleep System moodles. Server admins can disable them for players by adjusting sandbox setting.
	- Smoker Moodle added. Shows how close you are from gaining or losing the trait. Sandbox options included.
Fixes:
	- Fixed traits showing their description twice.
	- Fixed missing initialization for fresh characters, so they get starting traits if they qualify for them.
Mod Conflicts:
	- Another shot at trying to resolve errors when ran with Superb Survivors.
	- Forage action shouldn't conflict with Snake modpack anymore.
Translations:
	- Italian translation added, courtesy of UattO

Makes dog a basic mob [MDB IGNORE] (#70799)


About The Pull Request

    Made a basic version of the pet base called /mob/living/basic/pet. It's significantly more stripped down from the old simple_animal one, because its half collar stuff and...

    Made the collar slot a component that you could theoretically remove from a pet to disable the behavior, or add to any other living mob as long as you set up the icon states for the collar (or not, the visuals are optional).
        The corgi's collar strippable slot is now generally the pet collar slot, and in theory could be used for other pet stripping screens.

    I also gutted the extra access card code from /mob/living/basic/pet as it's only being used by corgis. Having a physical ID is now just inherent to corgis, as they're the only ones that could equip it anyway.

    Ported the make_babies() function from simple_animals to a new subtree and associated behavior, called /datum/ai_planning_subtree/make_babies that uses blackboards to know the animal-specific info.
        Note that it's marginally improved, as the female walks to the male first instead of bluespace reproduction.

    Tweaked and improved the dog AI to work as a basic mob, including making /datum/idle_behavior/idle_dog fully functional.

    Made a /datum/ai_planning_subtree/random_speech/dog that pulls the dynamic speech and emotes to support dog fashion.

I've tested base collars across multiple pet types.

For dogs, I've tested general behavior, fetching, reproduction, dog fashion, and deadchat_plays, covering all the oddities I'm aware of.

Why It's Good For The Game

Very big mob converted to a basic mob.

fix Effects

some effects weren't playing properly. this has been fixed.
one of the issues was that some effects have sound effects that are longer than their animations, and vice versa. previously, effects get deleted when their animation's completed. now, when either the audio or effect finishes, we check if the other is playing; if it's not, the effect gets deleted, otherwise, if it's the animation that completed first, we set playing = false and visible = false.
there was a lot of weirdness in the various Effects scripts. i think because it was one of the first scripts written, i didn't fully understand what i was doing.
also, on the topic of pausing audio, AudioStreamPlayer has a fucking stream_paused property, which you can set to false to pause audio and to true to resume from where it was paused. i'd written my own logic to get the playback position when stopped and resume it from there if required!! turns out that was pointless, because we can just call audio.stream_paused = false & audio.stream_paused = true. i wonder if there was a reason that i'd written my own logic as opposed to using the stream_paused property, or if i was just an idiot and didn't know about stream_paused. anyway, it's fixed.

Basic mobs don't become dense upon death (#72554)

## About The Pull Request

In #72260 what was previously a var became a flag, which was a sensible
change, however this inverted the default behaviour.
In virtually all cases we want dead mobs to _stop_ being dense, this
added a requirement for the flag to be present for that to happen and
then didn't add the flag to any mobs.

Rather than add this to every mob I inverted the function of the flag.
My reasoning here is that _simple_ mobs seemingly never required this
behaviour, basic mobs are probably going to need it rarely if ever, and
including it in `basic_mob_flags` by default seems messy and easy to
leave off when setting other flags (plus #72524 implies to me we want to
avoid adding more default values).

Setting this manually on each mob seems kind of silly as a requirement
going forward and I can't think of a way we'd unit test for people
forgetting.

For the same reason I did the same thing with the
`STOP_ACTING_WHILE_DEAD` flag I added to the AI controller in a recent
PR, the flag should denote unusual behaviour not the default.

## Why It's Good For The Game

It looks really odd when you're constantly shuffling places with dead
mobs, they're not supposed to do that.
It's tedious to add `STOP_ACTING_WHILE_DEAD` to every AI controller when
that should be an obvious default assumption.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Dead basic mobs are no longer "dense" objects and can be stepped
on.

   - HE given to Demolitions has also been made a crafting option.
 - Enclave roles with grenades given the appropriate F13 item.

Improve UX for duplicate entry errors

Refactored Scheduler.pm and Model.pm so that e.g. get_row returns like
this:

    my ($event, $err) = $event_model->get_row($event_id);

where $err is a bacds::Scheduler::Util::Result all ready to call
->format on, with its own descriptive error string already in it.

Also rejiggered the error codes yet again. For them to make any sense
now they'd really have to be in a central registry, and that seemed like
busywork since we're not even using them, so I just changed them all
to the HTTP standards 404-Not Found and 409-Conflict.

There's still a potential problem in that "deleted" entries are still in
the unique index, so you could delete "Alice Caller", and then if you
went on to try to add her again you'd get a duplicate entry error but
you can't see the record causing the collision. If there's ever enough
actually deleted entries that it becomes a problem, we'll need to add a
UI to manage the deleted entries.

Also added some unique indexes for venues and parent orgs where I
thought they'd be helpful.

Also did a "make manifest" to update the MANIFEST which was long overdue
(not that it matters yet).

[cli][frameworks][fs-detectors][next] detect framework versions (#9009)

This PR:

- updates `packages/frameworks` to have most supported frameworks specify which dependency version should reflect the overall framework version
- updates `packages/fs-detectors` to allow framework detection that returns the full `Framework` record instead of just the slug
- updates `packages/next` to return the detected Next.js version in the build result
- updates `packages/cli` to leverage these changes so that `vc build` can add `framework: { version: string; }` to `config.json` output

The result is that Build Output API and supported frameworks will return their framework version in the build result of `vc build` when possible, which is used by the build container  when creating the deployment. The dashboard later retrieves this value to display in richer deployment outputs.

Supports:

- https://github.com/vercel/api/pull/15601
- https://github.com/vercel/front/pull/18319

---

With the related build container updates, we get to see Next.js version in the build output. You'll see this with BOA+Prebuilt or a normal deploy:

---

### The Path to this PR

I went through all the supported frameworks and figured out how to best determine their versions. For most of them, we can check a known dependency's installed version number. 

We can get most of the way only checking npm. For a handful, we'd have to support Go/Ruby/Rust/Whatever dependencies.

I started with a more complex method signature to allow for later expansion without changing the signature. It looked like this, in practice:

```
async getVersion(dependencies: DependencyMap) => depedencies['next']
```

However, after checking all currently supported frameworks, I don't think this will end up being necessary. It also has the constraint that all dependencies have to be gathered and presented to the function even though it only needs to check for one or two. That's not a huge deal if we have them already where we need them, but we don't. We could use a variant here where this function does its own lookups, but this seemed unnecessary and would beg for duplication and small variances that could cause bugs.

Further, if we only look at `package.json`, we're going to either see a specific version of a version range. To be precise, we have to look at the installed version of the package. That means checking one of the various types of lockfiles that can exist or poking into node_modules.

If we poke into node_modules to detect the installed version, we introduce another point where Yarn 3 (default mode) will not be supported. If we read lockfiles, we have to potentially parse `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn` lockfiles.

If we use `npm ls <package-name>`, that also fails in Yarn 3 (default mode). We could accept that and go forward anyway, which would look like:

```
const args = `ls ${packageName} --depth=0 --json`.split(' ');
const { stdout } = await execa('npm', args, { cwd });
const regex = new RegExp(String.raw`${packageName}@([\.\d]+)`);
const matches = stdout.match(regex);
if (matches) {
  return matches[1];
}
```

But it turns out there's a `--json` option! That's what I ended up using, for now.

We could explore the lockfile route more, but after some initial digging, it' non-trivial. There are 3 main lockfiles we'd want to check for (npm, pnpm, and yarn) and there are different lockfile versions that put necessary data in different places. I looked for existing tools that parse this, but I didn't find any. We could certainly go down this path, but the effort doesn't seem worth it when `npm ls` gets us really close.

---

### Follow-up Versioning

Now that we know how to determine version per framework, we can vary configuration by version. In a future PR, we could allow a given value to vary by version number:

```
name: (version) => {
  if (semver.gt(version, '9.8.7')) {
    return 'some-framework-2''
  }

  return 'some-framework';
}
```

However, it may still be easier to differentiate significant versions by adding multiple entries in the list.

lib/list_sort: optimize number of calls to comparison function

CONFIG_RETPOLINE has severely degraded indirect function call
performance, so it's worth putting some effort into reducing the number
of times cmp() is called.

This patch avoids badly unbalanced merges on unlucky input sizes.  It
slightly increases the code size, but saves an average of 0.2*n calls to
cmp().

x86-64 code size 739 -> 803 bytes (+64)

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of low-hanging fruit in a merge sort;
it already performs only n*log2(n) - K*n + O(1) compares.  The leading
coefficient is already at the theoretical limit (log2(n!) corresponds to
K=1.4427), so we're fighting over the linear term, and the best
mergesort can do is K=1.2645, achieved when n is a power of 2.

The differences between mergesort variants appear when n is *not* a
power of 2; K is a function of the fractional part of log2(n).  Top-down
mergesort does best of all, achieving a minimum K=1.2408, and an average
(over all sizes) K=1.248.  However, that requires knowing the number of
entries to be sorted ahead of time, and making a full pass over the
input to count it conflicts with a second performance goal, which is
cache blocking.

Obviously, we have to read the entire list into L1 cache at some point,
and performance is best if it fits.  But if it doesn't fit, each full
pass over the input causes a cache miss per element, which is
undesirable.

While textbooks explain bottom-up mergesort as a succession of merging
passes, practical implementations do merging in depth-first order: as
soon as two lists of the same size are available, they are merged.  This
allows as many merge passes as possible to fit into L1; only the final
few merges force cache misses.

This cache-friendly depth-first merge order depends on us merging the
beginning of the input as much as possible before we've even seen the
end of the input (and thus know its size).

The simple eager merge pattern causes bad performance when n is just
over a power of 2.  If n=1028, the final merge is between 1024- and
4-element lists, which is wasteful of comparisons.  (This is actually
worse on average than n=1025, because a 1204:1 merge will, on average,
end after 512 compares, while 1024:4 will walk 4/5 of the list.)

Because of this, bottom-up mergesort achieves K < 0.5 for such sizes,
and has an average (over all sizes) K of around 1.  (My experiments show
K=1.01, while theory predicts K=0.965.)

There are "worst-case optimal" variants of bottom-up mergesort which
avoid this bad performance, but the algorithms given in the literature,
such as queue-mergesort and boustrodephonic mergesort, depend on the
breadth-first multi-pass structure that we are trying to avoid.

This implementation is as eager as possible while ensuring that all
merge passes are at worst 1:2 unbalanced.  This achieves the same
average K=1.207 as queue-mergesort, which is 0.2*n better then
bottom-up, and only 0.04*n behind top-down mergesort.

Specifically, defers merging two lists of size 2^k until it is known
that there are 2^k additional inputs following.  This ensures that the
final uneven merges triggered by reaching the end of the input will be
at worst 2:1.  This will avoid cache misses as long as 3*2^k elements
fit into the cache.

(I confess to being more than a little bit proud of how clean this code
turned out.  It took a lot of thinking, but the resultant inner loop is
very simple and efficient.)

python: Add temporary ${libexecdir} expansion in manifests

This provides the moral equivalent of what commit 94394128e8b6 did for
the C bridge. However, we want to avoid parameterizing the py bridge
with ./configure arguments, to keep it buildable with pip. Detect the
path at runtime instead, there are only a few plausible options anyway.
This is a temporary hack until we eliminate all `${libexecdir}` from
manifests.

This fixes joining an IPA domain, as it now finds
cockpit-certificate-helper. TestIPA.testQualifiedUsers now gets much
further, unfortunately it still fails on the remote host part of the
test, as cockpit-ssh does not work yet.

It also fixes the cockpit-{ssh,pcp,askpass} paths in the manifests, but as we
don't do that routing yet, it does not fix any of the ssh/pcp tests yet.
But it is a necessary prerequisite for actually implementing these.

docs: auto-generate remaining server-side SDK docs (#2858)

This PR builds on the preceding doc auto-generation PRs and generates
documentation for the remaining server-side SDKs.

## Why

Refer to https://github.com/Unleash/unleash/pull/2809 for more context
about generating SDK docs.

## What

-   Adds generation for the remaining server-side SDKs
- Moves generated docs from the `/reference/sdks` directory to
`/generated` directory.
- Makes sure that the URLs do not change because of the move by using
the `slug` frontmatter property.
- replaces relative github links in the markdown documents so that they
become absolute github links. (refer to the next section)
- Updates some image styling so that it doesn't apply to readme badges
(we don't need them using `display: block`)

### On link replacing:

This PR adds handling of links in the generated documentation.
Specifically, it changes links in one case:

Relative links to github. Links to code and other files in the
repository. These are prefixed with the repository's URL.

While this should work in most cases, it will fail in cases where the
links to the files are not on the repository's primary branch.
(typically main, but could also be "v3", for instance). In these cases,
the links will get a double branch in the URL and will fail. However, I
see no easy way around this (though suggestions are definitely
accepted!), and think it's a fair tradeoff. It takes the links from
"definitely failing" to "will work in the vast majority of cases".

Note: I originally also wanted to handle the case where the link is an
absolute link to docs.getunleash.io. We could turn these into relative
urls to avoid full page reloads and enjoy a smoother experience.
However, the client-side redirects don't work correctly if the relative
URL goes to a redirect page, so you end up with a 404 page. As such, I
think it's better to leave the links as absolute for now.

[FIX] website: redirect to case insensitive URL if not exact match

Before this commit, if a link to a page was not correct because of a
case mismatch, it would simply land on a 404 page.
While it's correct, as URL are case sensitive, it leads to a few bad UX
flow at the admin/editor level:
- Create a link in your page (on a text or a button eg), type an URL
  which does not exists (to create it after) like /Page
- Click on the link/button you just made, you are redirected to /Page
  which display a 404 with the "Create page" option (correct)
- When you click on that button, it will actually create a page with
  /page URL, leading to a mismatch between the URL you created and the
  page URL.
  Your link/button will still lead to a 404 URL as it points to /Page.

Since it's just a fallback when an exact URL match is not found, it
should not break anything and should not have bad impact at any level
(seo/speed etc).
Indeed:
- It's done through a 302 redirect
- `_serve_page()` is already a fallback case, so it will only make
  the `website.redirect` and 404 cases a bit slower due to the extra
  search query.

The only possible scenario seems to be if the user (mind the uppercase):
- Created a /Page page
- Created a redirect from /page to /another-page

In this case, /page won't land on /another-page but on /Page.
This flow seems unlikely and is not actually wrong either way.
At least, it certainly is less important than ensuring a case
insensitive fallback.

Finally, note that another solution would have been to either:
- Force page URL to lower case.
  -> This is not stable friendly, people might be relying on this to
     create pages with different casing:
     `/Batman-VII-The-Dark-Knight-Whatevers`, while not recommended,
     doesn't sounds idiot.
     On top of not being stable friendly, we probably want to keep
     offering this possibility
- Redirect all URLs to lowercase endpoints.
  -> This is obviously not stable and not Odoo's jobs. It should be
     something decided by the sysadmin and done at nginx (etc) level.

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

Feedback

Hey Pal, 

Overall this is great work. I really liked how you were thinking about ways to clean up the code and make it more efficient.  I have some ideas which I think will push your idea about efficient code even further.

Functions: The sorting and mapping functions are great. They do a good job of simplifying the code in the fetchProjects function. However, these functions are doing more than you are suggesting in the function names. Basically, what is happening is you are taking repeating code and placing it in a function which is good because it reduces code but we want to make sure we aren’t moving code around just to have it somewhere else.  If we take the sorting function as an example, we actually already have a sorting function below (the hondleSort function). This function could be expanded to help sort the project creation date by ascending which is what your sort function does. So rather than repeat a sort function we can expand one that already exists. As for the mapping function this only solves the fact that the same block of code is repeated twice but it is kind of combining 3 bits of functionality. 1. Mapping over an array of guest codes 2. Retrieving a project based on a guest code and 3. Adding a new project to array. So in my mind what I might do is keep the mapping function so that it maps over an array of guestCodes. So you might want to call it something like mapGuestCodes instead, or just leave the mapping out of a function and put it back in the fetchProjects code. Next you could create two new more generalized functions. One which retrieves a project based on a guestCode and another which adds an object to an array. Then place the setProjects part back in the fetchProjects function.

Really what I’m trying to say is that if you decide to create a new function it should be for something more generalized if possible. Reducing repeated code is good but ideally you also set yourself up to be able to use the function for future repeated code as well and the best way to do that is make it more generalized.

Comments: You've got good coverage of your comments, meaning you've got comments in the places I'd expect them but your commenting/documentation is a bit generic at the moment. Not a bad thing! It's a good starting point. What I'd like you try is to explain what is actually happening in these functions. For example give a better explanation of what data is returned by some of the API calls, what type of actions are performed in the function and most importantly what the expected outcome of the function is. This is a bit overkill for normal documentation but this is meant to be an exercise to familiarize yourself with this codebase. Using console.log() will be your friend. If you'd like to see how I would approach this, I can walk through one as an example with you on Monday. 

Overall good start Pal. But I’m going to push you to take it even further. Generalize the functions as much as you can. Also increase detail in the documentation so that if you or I come back to this code in 2 months and look at it we can just read your documentation to understand what we were trying to achieve.

hypervisor: riscv: add SSTC support

SSTC (Supervisor-level timecmp) is an extension to bypass SBI calls to
control the platform's timer. If SSTC is available, the supervisor can
directly write the next timeout into the stimecmp CSR, instead of
conducting a SBI call. Furthermore, platform timer IRQs will directly
arrive at S-Mode resp. VS-Mode w/o M-Mode reinjection, which saves time
up on timer arrivals.

SSTC supports virtualisation: VS-Mode's stimecmp is shadowed by
vstimecmp. This means, if SSTC is available, we can save up to two
context switches for arming timers.

So we have drastically fewer exits with SSTC.

Linux (since v6.0) will discover and enable SSTC during the
initialisation of the platform timer, and from then on use the stimecmp
CSR for arming the timer instead of calling SBI. Actually pretty easy.

Some important notes of the specification [1]:

  - Discovery of SSTC is done via misa CSR, or via device tree

  - Spec says that the S-Mode hypervisor should write to vstimecmp if
    the VS_Mode guest decides to csr_write(stimecmp), as this saves a
    detour through SBI.

  - However, SBI calls are of course still supported

My thoughts:

When initialising Jailhouse, we're not allowed to query misa. Further,
we don't have the device tree available. Now we could either pass the
availability of SSTC via the driver (Linux already did discovery for
us), or hard code it in the system configuration. Ugly, both. But can we
avoid discovery?

If SSTC is available, Linux will simply make use of it.
If SSTC is not available, then Linux won't use the stimecmp CSR.

So just enable SSTC in HENVCFG, even if it is not available: It won't
affect anything, it's just ignored.

Last, spec says that if SSTC is available, an 'old-school' OpenSBI timer
set by a VS-Mode guest should take the vstimecmp fast-path in HS-Mode.
We could do this in Jailhouse, but then we must be sure, if SSTC is
*really* available.

As no guest should use the OpenSBI interface when SSTC is available,
simply take the SBI detour on those platforms. We're doomed in those
cases anyway.

Let's not implement SSTC discovery for the moment.

Re-license Pynguin to MIT license

I was considering using MIT License when starting Pynguin back in 2019.
For some reason, I cannot really remember, it happened that I chose LGPL
back then (maybe due to the reason that Pynguin's “large brother”
EvoSuite is LGPL licensed).  Personally, I do not think that LGPL is the
best fit since a more permissive license could always be useful for
future usage.  Thus, we change the license now, before even thinking
about a Pynguin version 1.0.

Hush 🤫

I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind
No doubt about it, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I ever had
Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving and I'm not to blame now

(Love, love) they got it early in the morning
(Love, love) they got it late in the evening
(Love, love) well, I want that, need it
(Love, love) oh, I gotta gotta have it

She's got loving like quicksand
Only took one touch of her hand
To blow my mind and I'm in so deep

Using the GeoCodio API (cory@geocod.io), if you don't have a credit card on file and you exceed the daily limit of 2,500 lookups, the API will respond with the following 403 Error Message:
{
  "error": "You can't make this request as it is above your daily maximum.
  You can configure billing at https://dash.geocod.io"
}
You will no longer receive successful responses until you have either updated your credit card or the next day rolls over and the limit begins again.
Similarly, in our Spreadsheet Uploader tool, you would receive an error prompt asking you to add a credit card to your account if you'd like to continue your upload.
There are multiple outbound IPs as they're shared across the whole region.
If you have Render specific questions then you can ask them in a ticket. But general comments on Discord search, Heroku or how to write code, etc. are not. Those types of conversations would be better suited to the community site. -Alan

Q & A
  If we have the county from the query can we also grab the county officials from that county as well?
Unfortunately, we do not currently provide data pertaining to state-level or local-level elected officials, so there is no option to return information about county-level officials. We only provide legislator data for Federal-level positions like the House and Senate.
  Is it possible that this library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-geocoder) is a part of the real library that we are using?
Geocodio has its own in-house geocoding library for Node (https://www.npmjs.com/package/geocodio-library-node) which as far as I'm aware is unrelated to Node Geocoder.
  Do Congressional Districts move around within each of the nth Congresses?
We are always watching and updating Congressional district boundaries, especially recently as the boundaries have shifted since the 2020 Census. As of January 3, 2023, we have updated the default district boundaries for both Congressional and State-Level districts to reflect the 118th Congress.
When using our API, the cd field append will now reference the 118th Congress and the stateleg field append will reference new state-level districts (except for state-level data in states with off-year elections - VA, MT, LA, MS and NJ - which will require stateleg-next).
For more information about these updates, check out this article:
https://www.geocod.io/updates/2022-12-21-congress-state-legislative-district-boundaries-switchover-on-january-3/
We have also updated legislator data to reflect the results of the 2022 election.
Let me know if you have any additional questions. Have a great day!

Re-implement read using iterators

Much more maintainable than the weird way I was doing it, and it
makes representing an empty iterator much more straight forward. I
was trying desparately to avoid some magic 'is_empty' state before
and was struggling to see a way through. Could be made
bi-directional, but that's not actually desireable for the serial
interface.

Double Date Initialization (#198)

* starting out with double date stuff :D

not even the background is finished
i just wanna get this on my fork so that it's safe

* double date getting more initialized

no animations, one block, nothing actually functions. but the boy is put in place, and the girl is almost put in place! just wanted to merge this with the main branch to play catchy tune

* initialization done!!!!!

gonna fix up the code, see what i can take out, see what i can standardize, see what i need to add. loving this so far, even with all of its annoyances

* ughhhh animation stuff.

this is gonna take me a day or two to even comprehend

Mirror #71906 (#18666)

[READY] DRAMATIC SHUTTLES!! You can now fly around the shuttle (#71906)

You can move around shuttles during transport now! Instead of them
teleporting you instantly into deepspace, you can move around somewhat
depending on your space-mobility and grip-strength.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7501474/206866132-3fae024c-a8a2-4f4a-b4b8-37c96a254498.png)

**Please watch the demonstration aswell, it should answer most
questions:**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os77qDOVSXE

Interactions:
- Being within armsreach of a wall or solid object means you 'cling',
where the shuttle pull is very weak and you can basically run around the
shutt;e (but dont fuck up or you're gone)
- Being in range of nothing gives you a very heavy pull, you can barely
resist if you have a decent jetpack
- Objects are instantly power-yeeted
- Being pulled or riding something excempts you from hyperspace pull
- Touching a space tile while being on hyperspace dumps you in
deepspace, you either go back to the shuttle or enjoy deepspace
- On shuttle hyperspace tiles are a lot less dangerous, and will instead
launch and freeze you instead of teleporting you into deepspace
- In-case it wasn't obvious, you can rest outside the shuttle as long as
something is blocking your path. I think it's funny but I might nerf it

:cl:
add: You can now fly around the shuttle during transit! Woohoo! You can
either cling to the side or grab a jetpack and try and keep up with the
shuttle! Carps can move around freely in hyperspace
qol: Increased shuttle hyperspace size from 8 tiles to 16
/:cl:

- [x] Find a way to detect when a shuttle arrives and do something with
the shit left in hyperspace

Things I will do in another PR:
- Engines spit fire and hurt (almost finished but I want to keep this
small)
- Random shuttle events. You might run into dust meteors or migrating
carps OR A CHANGELING INFILTRATOR
- Hyperspace turfs on the shuttle pull you under the shuttle

It's so much more immersive than being instantly teleported into
deepspace. It gives you a chance to recover if you get spaced or for
daredevils to look cool

It's also just very cool idk

Update Pb2Chts

+ Use new "anchor32k" alongside "anchor20".
+ Translate more strings.
+ shorten some comments.
+ Changed wheel height values.
+ simplified running speed hack toast.
+ improved `optimizeRange()` code-readability, and table arrangement.
+ slightly tweak `f()` to be able to use it like `f("Error: %s.","Custom Error Message")`.
+ Shorten translation texts.
+ remove weaponAmmo findEntityAnchr method, and unused `loopSearch()` dependency.
+ Fix some typos (notably: Veichle > Vehicle, that one is unspotted until GitHub desktop suggests autocorrection).
+ now vehicle speed hacks are freezed.
+ New cheats: Prevent car from stuckflipped, when stuck in upside down position, the veichle then tries to unstuck itself, it might take couple seconds to get fully unstucked though.
+ god modes cheat now separated from the wrapper to its own function (this can allow multiple entities to be modified).
PS: this changelog is made in hurry, @ABJ4403 will update the changelog in discussion tab.
