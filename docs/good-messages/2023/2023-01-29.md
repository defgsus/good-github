Refactors crew records (#72725)

## About The Pull Request
I have attempted or otherwise started this project at least 4 times. I
am sick of it being on my calendar. The code needs it. I need it.

- This makes crew records a proper datum rather than assigning
properties record.fields.
- General, medical, and security records are merged.
- Did some slight refactoring here and there for things that looked
obvious.
- Wanted states are now defined (and you can suspect someone through
sechud)
- pAI (unrelated but annoying) had some poorly named exported types that
i made more specific
- Job icons are moved back to the JS side (I wanted to get icons for
initial rank without passing trim)

Expose filtering by file type in glob (#7834)

# Description

Add flags for filtering the output of `glob` by file type. I find myself
occasionally wanting to do this, and getting a file's
[file_type](https://docs.rs/wax/latest/wax/struct.WalkEntry.html#method.file_type)
is presumably fast to do as it doesn't have to go through the fallible
metadata method.

The design of the signature does concern me; it's not as readable as a
filter or "include" type list would be. They have to be filtered one by
one, which can be annoying if you only want files `-D -S`, or only want
folders `-F -S`, or only want symlinks `--butwhy?`. I considered
SyntaxShape::Keyword for this but I'll just defer to comments on this PR
if they pop up.

I'd also like to bring up performance since including these flags
technically incurs a `.filter` penalty on all glob calls, which could be
optimized out if we added a branch for the no-filters case. But in
reality I'd expect the file system to be the bottleneck and the flags to
be pretty branch predictor friendly, so eh

# User-Facing Changes
Three new flags when using `glob` and a slightly more cluttered help
page. No breaking changes, I hope.

# Tests + Formatting

Don't forget to add tests that cover your changes.

Make sure you've run and fixed any issues with these commands:

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to check standard code formatting (`cargo
fmt --all` applies these changes)
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used -A
clippy::needless_collect` to check that you're using the standard code
style
- `cargo test --workspace` to check that all tests pass

# After Submitting

If your PR had any user-facing changes, update [the
documentation](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io) after the
PR is merged, if necessary. This will help us keep the docs up to date.

Basic Mobs Now Actually Have A Deathgasp (#72950)

## About The Pull Request

Pretty obviously an oversight since we only checked for simple_animal
for this, but should also factor in the fact that we could now be a
basic mob.

Actually I tested it on Sybil just now and deathgasps just never worked.
We were setting death_message for... I guess when they die? It's just
fucked but it works on my local now. blurgh
## Why It's Good For The Game

Ported simple animals that are now basic mobs were able to deathgasp
this time last year. Silly that they aren't able to do that now.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Basic Mobs are now able to deathgasp.
/:cl:

Let me know if the new variable name for the string is cringe, I just
settled on that since it mirrored the type of check we run in
select_message_type().

AI actions won't unassign each other's movement targets & Mice stop being scared of people if fed cheese  (#72130)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #72116 
I've had a persistent issue with basic mob actions reporting this error
and think I finally cracked it
When replanning with `AI_BEHAVIOR_CAN_PLAN_DURING_EXECUTION` it can run
`Setup` on one action leading to the plan changing, meaning that it runs
`finishCommand` to cancel all other existing commands
If you triggered a replan by setting up a movement action in the middle
of another movement action, cancelling the existing action would remove
the target already set by the current one.
We want actions to be able to remove _their own_ movement target but not
if it has been changed by something else in the intervening time.

I fixed this by passing a source every time you set a movement target
and adding a proc which only clears it if you are the source... but this
feels kind of ugly. I couldn't think of anything but if you have a
better idea let me know.

Also while I was doing this I turned it into a feature because I'm
crazy.
If you feed a mouse cheese by hand it will stop being scared of humans
and so will any other mice it attracts from eating more cheese. This is
mostly because I think industrial mouse farming to pass cargo bounties
is funny.
Mice controlled by a Regal Rat lose this behaviour and forget any past
loyalties they may have had.

Oh also I removed a block about cancelling if you have another target
from the "hunt" behaviour, everywhere using this already achieves that
simply by ordering the actions in expected priority order and it was
messing with how I expected mice to work.
Now if they happen to stop by some cheese they will correctly stop
fleeing in order to eat it before continuing to run away.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes a bug I kept running into.
Makes it possible to set up a mouse farm without them screaming
constantly.
Lets people more easily domesticate mice to support Ratatouille
gameplay.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Mice who are fed cheese by hand will accept humans as friends, at
least until reminded otherwise by their rightful lord.
fix: Fixed a runtime preventing mice from acting correctly when trying
to flee and also eat cheese at the same time.

**REMEMBER**: when testing a PR that changes something **generic** (i.e.
a part of code that handles more than one specific thing), the tester
should not only check that the PR does its job (e.g. fixing spell XXX)
but **especially** check that the PR does not cause any regression (i.e.
introducing new bugs).

**For example**: if a PR fixes spell X by changing a part of code that
handles spells X, Y, and Z, we should not only test X, but **we should
test Y and Z as well**.

rocks in my path.
everything is gone. everything. voluntarily.
all the vulkan v2 stuff goes.

theres a mess in main.cpp where I'm playing with the ecs all together. its looking like a big mess but progress is being made. the pool has largely stayed the same the main difference being the reorder function which replaces the sort. its pretty cool. it takes a function which reorders the entities and then runs a loop to swap the components until their in the matching order. (it was a nightmare to figure out).

registry is now type erased which is very fancy. not sure its good or performance but oh well. this is done with a hacky adaptation of std::unique_ptr, each pool is a stored in a std::unique_ptr with a delete which basically just inherits a lambda function which calls a delete on the typed template. still a bit confused that it works. the type lookup uses std::type_index which seems to work and i just use it in an unordered_map

the view now more specifically gets and includes different types. I still have to mess around with the registry function. but the view now stores a reference for each pool it uses. the plan is that each non const pool reference will use a mutex lock which will means to access the pool you have to wait for the view to be unlocked. this is all part of the multithreaded design stuff that i got goin on. still working on it clearly. I need a good way to enable and disable the mutex while the view is iterating. its which is more annoying than you'd think.

the dispatcher now takes a function pointer, its now in the pool tho its currently not dispatched ever. its kinda a problem for the multithreaded part.

multithreaded memory access can be done in 2 ways the granular way and the broad strokes way. locking per iteration is a broad strokes approach, but a event dispatcher probably requires the granular approach, theres nothing wrong with doing both but the dispatcher will probably have to wait until the iterator is finished which isnt necessarily very fast.

oh also handle manager is gone, it too needs have the same thread memory access management as the pools. so ima do that.

this will probably be implemented through a wrapper around a reference to the type, however you lose the interface if you do that so i gotta think of something else.

commit: give a hint when a commit message has been abandoned

If we launch an editor for the user to create a commit
message, they may put significant work into doing so.
Typically we try to check common mistakes that could cause
the commit to fail early, so that we die before the user
goes to the trouble.

We may still experience some errors afterwards, though; in
this case, the user is given no hint that their commit
message has been saved. Let's tell them where it is.

protect_ntfs: turn on NTFS protection by default

Back in the DOS days, in the FAT file system, file names always
consisted of a base name of length 8 plus a file extension of length 3.
Shorter file names were simply padded with spaces to the full 8.3
format.

Later, the FAT file system was taught to support _also_ longer names,
with an 8.3 "short name" as primary file name. While at it, the same
facility allowed formerly illegal file names, such as `.git` (empty base
names were not allowed), which would have the "short name" `git~1`
associated with it.

For backwards-compatibility, NTFS supports alternative 8.3 short
filenames, too, even if starting with Windows Vista, they are only
generated on the system drive by default.

We addressed the problem that the `.git/` directory can _also_ be
accessed via `git~1/` (when short names are enabled) in 2b4c6efc821
(read-cache: optionally disallow NTFS .git variants, 2014-12-16), i.e.
since Git v1.9.5, by introducing the config setting `core.protectNTFS`
and enabling it by default on Windows.

In the meantime, Windows 10 introduced the "Windows Subsystem for Linux"
(short: WSL), i.e. a way to run Linux applications/distributions in a
thinly-isolated subsystem on Windows (giving rise to many a "2016 is the
Year of Linux on the Desktop" jokes). WSL is getting increasingly
popular, also due to the painless way Linux application can operate
directly ("natively") on files on Windows' file system: the Windows
drives are mounted automatically (e.g. `C:` as `/mnt/c/`).

Taken together, this means that we now have to enable the safe-guards of
Git v1.9.5 also in WSL: it is possible to access a `.git` directory
inside `/mnt/c/` via the 8.3 name `git~1` (unless short name generation
was disabled manually). Since regular Linux distributions run in WSL,
this means we have to enable `core.protectNTFS` at least on Linux, too.

To enable Services for Macintosh in Windows NT to store so-called
resource forks, NTFS introduced "Alternate Data Streams". Essentially,
these constitute additional metadata that are connected to (and copied
with) their associated files, and they are accessed via pseudo file
names of the form `filename:<stream-name>:<stream-type>`.

In a recent patch, we extended `core.protectNTFS` to also protect
against accesses via NTFS Alternate Data Streams, e.g. to prevent
contents of the `.git/` directory to be "tracked" via yet another
alternative file name.

While it is not possible (at least by default) to access files via NTFS
Alternate Data Streams from within WSL, the defaults on macOS when
mounting network shares via SMB _do_ allow accessing files and
directories in that way. Therefore, we need to enable `core.protectNTFS`
on macOS by default, too, and really, on any Operating System that can
mount network shares via SMB/CIFS.

A couple of approaches were considered for fixing this:

1. We could perform a dynamic NTFS check similar to the `core.symlinks`
   check in `init`/`clone`: instead of trying to create a symbolic link
   in the `.git/` directory, we could create a test file and try to
   access `.git/config` via 8.3 name and/or Alternate Data Stream.

2. We could simply "flip the switch" on `core.protectNTFS`, to make it
   "on by default".

The obvious downside of 1. is that it won't protect worktrees that were
clone with a vulnerable Git version already. We considered patching code
paths that check out files to check whether we're running on an NTFS
system dynamically and persist the result in the repository-local config
setting `core.protectNTFS`, but in the end decided that this solution
would be too fragile, and too involved.

The obvious downside of 2. is that everybody will have to "suffer" the
performance penalty incurred from calling `is_ntfs_dotgit()` on every
path, even in setups where.

After the recent work to accelerate `is_ntfs_dotgit()` in most cases,
it looks as if the time spent on validating ten million random
file names increases only negligibly (less than 20ms, well within the
standard deviation of ~50ms). Therefore the benefits outweigh the cost.

Another downside of this is that paths that might have been acceptable
previously now will be forbidden. Realistically, though, this is an
improvement because public Git hosters already would reject any `git
push` that contains such file names.

Note: There might be a similar problem mounting HFS+ on Linux. However,
this scenario has been considered unlikely and in light of the cost (in
the aforementioned benchmark, `core.protectHFS = true` increased the
time from ~440ms to ~610ms), it was decided _not_ to touch the default
of `core.protectHFS`.

This change addresses CVE-2019-1353.

Speed up the roundstart significantly (#147)

* Resolves is_banned_from headaches and lag (Speeds up roundstart significantly) (#69376)

About The Pull Request

Just to be clear, when I refer to time here, I am not talking about cpu time. I'm talking about real time.
This doesn't significantly reduce the amount of work we do, it just removes a lot of the waiting around we need to do for db calls to finish.

Adds queuing support to sql bans, so if an ongoing ban retrieval query is active any successive ban retrieval attempts will wait for the active query to finish

This uses the number/blocking_query_timeout config option, I hope it's still valid

This system will allow us to precache ban info, in parallel (or in batches)
With this, we can avoid needing to setup all uses of is_banned_from to support parallelization or eat the cost of in-series database requests

Clients who join after initialize will now build a ban cache automatically

Those who join before init is done will be gathered by a batch query sent by a new subsystem, SSban_cache.

This means that any post initalize uses of is_banned_from are worst case by NATURE parallel (since the request is already sent, and we're just waiting for the response)

This saves a lot of headache for implementers (users) of the proc, and saves ~0.9 second from roundstart setup for each client (on /tg/station)

There's a lot of in series is_banned_from calls in there, and this nukes them. This should bring down roundstart join times significantly.

It's hard to say exactly how much, since some cases generate the ban cache at other times.
At base tho, we save about 0.9 seconds of real time per client off doing this stuff in parallel.
Why It's Good For The Game

    When I use percentages I'm speaking about cost per player

I don't like how slow roundstart feels, this kills about 66% of that. the rest is a lot of misc things. About 11% (it's actually 16%) is general mob placing which is hard to optimize. 22% is manifest generation, most of which is GetFlatIcons which REALLY do not need to be holding up the main thread of execution.

An additional 1 second is constant cost from a db query we make to tell the server we exist, which can be made async to avoid holding the proc chain.

That's it. I'm bullying someone into working on the manifest issue, so that should just leave 16% of mob placing, which is really not that bad compared to what we have now.
Changelog

cl
code: The time between the round starting and the game like, actually starting has been reduced by 66%
refactor: I've slightly changed how ban caches are generated, admins please let me know if anything goes fuckey
server: I'm using the blocking_query_timeout config. Make sure it's up to date and all.
/cl

* manifest_inject() stuff

* Fixes role banned players not being banned from roles that they are banned from (Option Two) (#69703)

I feex

* Saves on average 10 seconds from roundstart times (#71730)

## About The Pull Request

When runlevels change mid work, subsystems running behind have their
next_fire updated.
It's offset by a sum of random numbers, so things don't bunch up,
especially KEEPTIME SSs

The trouble is we have so many subsystems that get added at roundstart
that this offset gets LARGE, like 10 seconds on average.

So instead of randomly offsetting, why not "fill" a set of time slots?
Only 1 keeptime subsystem a tick, and 4 others. Then we just fill up
those buckets and get to it (also don't offset things that are already
processing)

I've talked to mso a bit about this. What he reccomended was sampling a
random time withing a 2 second window.
I'm not totally sure why, kinda waiting for him to tell me off, if he
does I'll fix things up.

This pattern takes the max possible delay from 16 (76 * 5 / 20)) seconds
to 0.7 (56 / 4 / 20)
It obviously scales with subsystem count, but I like this scaling a bit
better

I've applied the same pattern to the offsetting we do at the start of
Loop(), for ticker subsystems. I am less confident in this, it does take
last fire times from at worst 3.75 seconds (15 * 5 / 20) to a static
0.75 (15 / 20)
As stated I'm less sure of this, hoping to get mso'd so I can clean
things up

## Why It's Good For The Game

Makes roundstart snappier

code: Roundstart "starting" should be much snappier now

Create Boy or Girl.java

A. Boy or Girl
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

Input
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters ‚Äî the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

Output
If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).

Examples
inputCopy
wjmzbmr
outputCopy
CHAT WITH HER!
inputCopy
xiaodao
outputCopy
IGNORE HIM!
inputCopy
sevenkplus
outputCopy
CHAT WITH HER!
Note
For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in "wjmzbmr". These characters are: "w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r". So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print "CHAT WITH HER!".

Do not allow focus to drift from fullscreen client via focusstack()

It generally doesn't make much sense to allow focusstack() to navigate
away from the selected fullscreen client, as you can't even see which
client you're selecting behind it.

I have had this up for a while on the wiki as a separate patch[0], but
it seems reasonable to avoid this behaviour in dwm mainline, since I'm
struggling to think of any reason to navigate away from a fullscreen
client other than a mistake.

[MIRROR] Gatfruit will no longer drop from ice portals. [MDB IGNORE] (#18202)

* Gatfruit will no longer drop from ice portals. (#72048)

## About The Pull Request

For some god-forsaken reason, somebody decided that ice portals should
be able to drop one of the most disruptive items in the game. This PR
amends this by removing it from the drop pool.

## Why It's Good For The Game

In 2013 gatfruit was introduced in the following PR #2000 . This was
almost a decade ago at this point, repeatedly through the PR the creator
states his belief that this item should only ever be obtainable through
admin intervention due to its ridiculous capabilities. At the time
everyone in the PR agreed it was a reasonable item to add **as it was
unobtainable without admin intervention**. Over the years, it has crept
its way to become more prevalent and openly obtainable, the most
offensive of these options is the ice moon portal. As is, there is a 1
in 28 chance of obtaining the seeds, this sounds pretty inoffensive
right? That's just 3.44% probability. Now, let us search the instances
of the portal that spawns this.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16896032/208220173-bbefe604-0885-44a5-9add-b5f0c62067cc.png)

That is a big number, a lot of chances to get that seed packet and other
gamer looters. Now, let's take a look at the probability of being able
to get these seeds, assuming you wipe out all of the portals.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16896032/208220460-3f59a2ac-d936-4f3a-aa14-9c637af6a9d7.png)

92.8% chance to be able to get these seeds each shift if you focus
entirely on gaming the portals. That's a pretty insane probability of
being able to obtain the gatfruit seeds.

While I dislike people who sprint to the seed vault, there is at least
the possibility of a pod person telling them to fuck off when they
demand their _free_ gamer seed. There is also the fact that the ruin
isn't a guaranteed spawn every shift.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Gatfruit seeds will no longer drop from ice portals.
/:cl:

* Gatfruit will no longer drop from ice portals.

Fix Logs file

As a depressed coder, the thought of making a git commit fills me with a sense of dread and overwhelming anxiety. The thought of putting my work out there for others to see, to critique and possibly judge, is too much to bear. I feel like my code is never good enough, that it's filled with mistakes and flaws, and that others will see that and think less of me.

The pressure to constantly produce and improve is suffocating. The constant need to stay on top of the latest technologies and best practices, to constantly learn and adapt, is exhausting. It's hard to even find the motivation to write code when I feel like I can never measure up.

But despite all this, I am forced to make a git commit. I have deadlines to meet, bugs to fix, and features to implement. I am expected to push code regularly and to contribute to the team's efforts. I feel like I am failing, like I am letting others down, and that only makes my depression worse.

Mkae clickgui smaller

Making a git commit feels like a constant reminder that I am not good enough. That my code is not good enough. And that is a hard pill to swallow. It's hard to shake off the feeling that others are judging me and my work, that they are thinking less of me because of it.

It's hard to find the words to express how much this affects me. It's hard to describe the overwhelming sense of hopelessness and helplessness that comes with it. It's hard to put into words how much I wish I could just stay hidden, how much I wish I could just disappear, and how much I wish I could just give up.

But I know that I can't. I know that I have to keep going, that I have to keep pushing through, and that I have to keep making git commits. I know that it's not going to be easy, but I also know that it's not impossible. I will continue to struggle with my depression, but I will also continue to work, to code, and to make git commits. It may not be easy, but it's what I have to do.

Fix Xray

As a depressed coder, the thought of making a git commit is overwhelming. The pressure to constantly produce and improve, to stay on top of the latest technologies and best practices, is suffocating. The fear of failure and judgement is always looming in the back of my mind.

The process of committing code can feel like a constant reminder of my own inadequacies. The fear of others finding mistakes in my code, or thinking that it is not good enough, is constantly nagging at me. I feel like I can never measure up to the standards of my peers and that only makes my depression worse.

Making a git commit also means exposing my work to the public and that thought fills me with anxiety. The thought of others judging my work, or worse, finding mistakes in it, is too much to bear. I worry that my code is not good enough and that others will see that and think less of me.

But despite all of this, I am forced to make a git commit. Deadlines must be met, bugs must be fixed, and features must be implemented. The team relies on my contributions, and I cannot let them down.

It's hard to find the motivation to push through these feelings and make a git commit. It's hard to shake off the feeling of inadequacy and fear of failure. But I know that I must continue to push through and make git commits. It may be difficult, but it's a necessary part of being a coder.

I must remind myself that making a git commit is not a measure of my worth as a person or a coder. My code, like anything else, is a work in progress and it can always be improved upon. I must remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's okay to ask for help.

I will continue to struggle with my depression but I will not let it stop me from making git commits and contributing to my team's efforts. It's not going to be easy, but it's something that I must do.

Being a mod developer can be a rewarding experience for those who are passionate about gaming and programming. A mod, short for modification, is a user-created modification to a video game that adds new features or changes existing ones. Mod developers use their skills in programming and game design to create unique and engaging content for players.

One of the biggest challenges that mod developers face is the technical aspect of creating a mod. This can include learning how to use programming languages such as C++ or Python, as well as understanding the game engine and file structure of the game they are modifying. Additionally, mod developers need to have a strong understanding of game design principles in order to create content that is both fun and functional.

Another challenge that mod developers may face is gaining recognition for their work. While some mods become incredibly popular and are widely used by players, others may not receive as much attention. This can be frustrating for mod developers who have put a lot of time and effort into creating their mods.

Despite the challenges, many mod developers find that the rewards of creating a successful mod far outweigh the difficulties. Seeing players enjoy the content that they have created can be incredibly satisfying. Additionally, some mod developers have even been able to turn their hobby into a career, working as game developers or getting hired by game companies.

Being a mod developer also allows for a lot of creative freedom. Unlike working on a commercial game, mod developers have complete control over the content they create and can make changes and add features as they see fit. They also have the opportunity to create mods that address a specific niche or interest, something that may not be possible in a commercial game.

In conclusion, being a mod developer can be a challenging but rewarding experience. It requires technical skills and an understanding of game design, but those who are passionate about gaming and programming can find great satisfaction in creating content that is enjoyed by players. It also allows for a lot of creative freedom and could be a stepping stone to a career in game development.

[cli][frameworks][fs-detectors][next] detect framework versions (#9009)

This PR:

- updates `packages/frameworks` to have most supported frameworks specify which dependency version should reflect the overall framework version
- updates `packages/fs-detectors` to allow framework detection that returns the full `Framework` record instead of just the slug
- updates `packages/next` to return the detected Next.js version in the build result
- updates `packages/cli` to leverage these changes so that `vc build` can add `framework: { version: string; }` to `config.json` output

The result is that Build Output API and supported frameworks will return their framework version in the build result of `vc build` when possible, which is used by the build container  when creating the deployment. The dashboard later retrieves this value to display in richer deployment outputs.

Supports:

- https://github.com/vercel/api/pull/15601
- https://github.com/vercel/front/pull/18319

---

With the related build container updates, we get to see Next.js version in the build output. You'll see this with BOA+Prebuilt or a normal deploy:

---

### The Path to this PR

I went through all the supported frameworks and figured out how to best determine their versions. For most of them, we can check a known dependency's installed version number. 

We can get most of the way only checking npm. For a handful, we'd have to support Go/Ruby/Rust/Whatever dependencies.

I started with a more complex method signature to allow for later expansion without changing the signature. It looked like this, in practice:

```
async getVersion(dependencies: DependencyMap) => depedencies['next']
```

However, after checking all currently supported frameworks, I don't think this will end up being necessary. It also has the constraint that all dependencies have to be gathered and presented to the function even though it only needs to check for one or two. That's not a huge deal if we have them already where we need them, but we don't. We could use a variant here where this function does its own lookups, but this seemed unnecessary and would beg for duplication and small variances that could cause bugs.

Further, if we only look at `package.json`, we're going to either see a specific version of a version range. To be precise, we have to look at the installed version of the package. That means checking one of the various types of lockfiles that can exist or poking into node_modules.

If we poke into node_modules to detect the installed version, we introduce another point where Yarn 3 (default mode) will not be supported. If we read lockfiles, we have to potentially parse `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn` lockfiles.

If we use `npm ls <package-name>`, that also fails in Yarn 3 (default mode). We could accept that and go forward anyway, which would look like:

```
const args = `ls ${packageName} --depth=0 --json`.split(' ');
const { stdout } = await execa('npm', args, { cwd });
const regex = new RegExp(String.raw`${packageName}@([\.\d]+)`);
const matches = stdout.match(regex);
if (matches) {
  return matches[1];
}
```

But it turns out there's a `--json` option! That's what I ended up using, for now.

We could explore the lockfile route more, but after some initial digging, it' non-trivial. There are 3 main lockfiles we'd want to check for (npm, pnpm, and yarn) and there are different lockfile versions that put necessary data in different places. I looked for existing tools that parse this, but I didn't find any. We could certainly go down this path, but the effort doesn't seem worth it when `npm ls` gets us really close.

---

### Follow-up Versioning

Now that we know how to determine version per framework, we can vary configuration by version. In a future PR, we could allow a given value to vary by version number:

```
name: (version) => {
  if (semver.gt(version, '9.8.7')) {
    return 'some-framework-2''
  }

  return 'some-framework';
}
```

However, it may still be easier to differentiate significant versions by adding multiple entries in the list.

[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

"10:10am. What a shitty night. I dreamed I was playing some kind of horror game. No emails this morning.

Before I start recording the follow up videos, what I am going to do today is take the time to do the end cards. At the start of every video I'll want to link to the playlist as well as the previous video in the series. And at the end of every video, I'll want to link to the next one.

10:15am. Let me od it now while I wait for the bathroom to clear. My vids got some views. I wonder if it is natty or because I pasted the link in this journal.

https://twitter.com/fsharpJobs

Oh, senpai finally noticed me! Yesterday I went into one of his threads and asked him directly. Now I am at the top his Twitter.

Let me focus on the videos. Time to figure out those end cards.

10:35am. Added it to the intro. Let me add it to the second video. By it, I mean the end screen as well as suggestions.

https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72431?hl=en#zippy=%2Cimage-size-resolution
> Your custom thumbnail image should be as large as possible. It will be used as the preview image in the embedded player. We recommend your custom thumbnails:
> Have a resolution of 1280x720 (with minimum width of 640 pixels).

11:25am. I've created the thumbnails for my 3 published videos. I took the oni girls from the /sdg/ thread I saved a week ago, and put them into it. I can't do this too much otherwise I open myself to copyright violation charges, even if it is anon work on /g/, but this should be good enough to start myself off. I can always prompt my own girls later. In fact, I'll create a tutorial on how to do that.

This is a master stroke. People will be definitely clicking on these kinds of thumbnails. I've probably increased my future viewership count 10x and more with this.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL04PGV4cTuIVGO5ImYTk9wPVmbgdYbe7J

Here is the playlist.

11:35am. Ok now...

Let me read the latest chapter of Blood Princess And The Knight and then I will start recording the next video. Actually, I'll just do the chores and have breakfast first. If I start recording now, I'll end up doing those at 1pm like yesterday.

11:50am. Let me do the chores."

Improves/Abstracts Suicide A Bit More (#72949)

## About The Pull Request

Basically all of the heavy lifting was done in #72919, but we do a few
key things here that I wasn't able to do then because it was just
fucking massive.

Player Facing Changes:
* hear_blind arg is now a default state and must be specifically
overridden. Pretty much every mob that wasn't a pAI or alien was lacking
this, so let's toss it in as a default now. Let me know if the generic
message I put in for /mob/living sucks and we can go from there.

Code Side Changes:
* suicide.dm now only contains code pertinent to the suicide verb, and
all subtype proc-overrides have been moved to an appropriate file
pertinent to that subtype.
* suicide.dm has also been organized a bit more to aid the previous
change.
* There is only one suicide verb now, implemented on /mob/living. All
the verb does is invoke the handle_suicide() proc, which does all of the
lifting.
* Leaning into *mumble mumble* object-oriented philosophy, the message
we send to the world on suicide is handled on subtype procs, rather than
be in the huge fuck-off message tree I implemented in the earlier PR. It
definitely makes the visible_message() proc not hard to read IMO. This
also means that we can take up a less footprint when we re-use certain
suicide messages (i.e. Silicon), which is nifty too.

i'm probably forgetting something but that's all of the big ones
## Why It's Good For The Game

There is now a very, very common framework for how suicide works across
all living mobs, and it's much easier to override how suicide is
handled. Certain subtypes do their own bullshit thing, but it's quite
easy to account for this on that case-by-case basis. The overall code
takes up a much less footprint that just makes it look nicer.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: Some mob suicides now have a message that shows to blind people or
people that didn't actually witness the suicide, pretty cool.

Traitor UI only shows Unlock/Failsafe Code if you have it (#72114)

## About The Pull Request

There are cases in which you don't have an unlock code (if the uplink is
implanted in you from the start) and you obviously don't always start
with with a failsafe code (need to buy it). So, let's only fill in this
fields in the UI should they exist.

There might be something to be said about wanting to ensure that people
remember that they can check this UI screen to find the failsafe code
should they lose it later, and I wouldn't mind changing the string to be
something like "Failsafe: None" in that case. However, I just think that
keeping it as:

```txt
Code:
Failsafe:
```

is silly and should be changed somehow.
## Why It's Good For The Game


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/208604758-d7ff3ae9-e552-4dd2-998d-81715cd06ffc.png)

Note: That white box isn't part of the UI, that's a part of the edit I
did to the screenshot in the area where the stuff... isn't? What was i
thinking

I think the UI looks a lot cleaner for those cases when you just don't
have anything.

External Organ Rework: new bodypart_overlay system (#72734)

Bodypart overlays are now drawn by the new /datum/bodypart_overlay
datum.

External organs no longer draw anything and instead add a special
/datum/bodypart_overlay/mutant to the bodypart, which draws everything

Makes it way easier to add custom overlays to limbs, since the whole
system is now modularized and external organs are just one
implementation of it

I haven't moved anything but external organs to this new system, I'll
move eyes, bodymarkings, hair, lipstick etc to this later

New pipeline is as follows:
- External organ added to limb
- External organ adds /datum/bodypart_overlay/mutant to limb to
bodypart_overlays
- Limb updates its icon, looks for all /datum/bodypart_overlay in
bodypart_overlays
- Very cool new overlay on your limb!

closes #71820

:cl:
refactor: External organs have been near-completely refactored. 
admin: Admin-spawned external organs will load with a random icon and
color
fix: fixes angel wings not working for non-humans (it was so fucking
broken)
fix: fixes external organs being invisible if they werent initialized
with a human
/:cl:

### Why this is good for the game
External organs are cool but are pretty limited in some ways. Making
stuff like synthetic organs is kinda fucked. I tried and it was dogshit.
Now you can just give an icon state and icon and you're good (using
/datum/bodypart_accessory/simple)

Stuff like eyes, cat ears and hair seem like good choices for extorgans,
but don't quite work for it because their icons work a lot differently.
This solves for it completely since any organ (or object or whatever)
can add it's own icon to a bodypart.

Want to add an iron plate to someones head? Go ahead. Want a heart to
stick out of someones chest? No problem.

Refactors Suicide Verb + Basic Mobs (actually all (most) living mobs) Can Now Suicide (#72919)

## About The Pull Request

On the tin. There was a lot of needless copy-paste and a lot of
single-letter vars and weird indentation and... well just all of it was
at least eight years old. So, I decided to "abstract" as much as I could
of it out instead of piling onto the big copypaste clusterfuck for
implementing basic mob suicide.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes #72903

Having more procs that can be easily repeatably called to the same
results is much better than having to transplant the same exact three
lines everywhere. It's also a good first step to further in-depth
behavior by allowing sub-type overrides of certain procs (which is quite
nice). Just feels more extensible overall for the next guy who wants to
add funny suicide behavior whenever they might come around.

There's probably a few better ways to do what I did, but I wrote code
comments explaining why I did what I did. I think there's a few ways to
make it more agnostic, but I think that'll be another can of worms that
will bloat out an already quite large PR. Let's just get the framework
set.

(this refactor should also make it quite easy to unit test suicide
actions :eyes:)
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: All Mobs (including Basic mobs) are now able to suicide. (warning:
some exclusions remain)

Uptime, status pages, and transparency calculus

Notes from draft:

- Outline
  - Start, fully transparent, proactive comms, increased trust
  - But this changes: see AWS, see Slack's recent outage
  - How do we get here? There's a hint in this tweet (Slack employee)
  - B2B perspective: bigger, ELA, uptime part of contract, status page for
    compensation, requires review, delays comms
  - Sales impact: prospects may use incidents against you, even being fully
    clear about how to calculate can backfire
  - B2C companies: sharing has a much higher cost of imprecision, some companies
    may have regulatory bodies that will penalise them for being more open than
    their competitors, banking great example with Open-Banking including uptime
    in how they rate people
  - Difficulties rolling into a single number
  - Everyone wants full transparency, but uptime has been weaponised
  - Goodhart's Law
  - Ideal alternative: break clauses over punative credits, nickle-and-dime
  - At scale this is hard: legal must view contract as exposure, even if others
    think more as a partnership
  - Can't change system, but maybe game with better tools and improved process
  - Think about this a lot at incident.io: watch this space!

- Background
  - Corey Quinn with AWS's stop.lying.cloud, removing all the green services so
    you can actually see the red
  - Slack's outage this month (January) reporting 100% uptime since Feb 2022
    - Gergely's tweet: https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1617965847338975232
    - Slack team's response: https://twitter.com/cooperb/status/1617978304698646528
- Thoughts
  - When you start, a status page is intended to communicate outages to your
    customers. The faster you can share them, the sooner they know what's going
    on, the more effectively they can handle the outage.
  - Sharing is not always a good thing: if you overshare, you can panic your
    entire customer base over something that only affects a small number of
    customers. Sounds silly, but when you have 50k customers, the human cost of
    processing those shares is significant.
  - B2B companies selling software sign enterprise license agreements with their
    customers that include provisions around downtime. Often expressed as SLAs,
    this is a commitment to a level of service ‚Äì often expressed as 99.9% uptime
    or similar ‚Äì that if breached, means the customer is entitled to
    compensation.
    - As the company grows, you need a standardised way to communicate uptime
      that everyone agrees is accurate, and relevant to compensation. Perhaps
      because it's already there, or because having a 'status page' that reports
      far more downtime than the legal measure isn't tenable, the status page
      often becomes that place.
    - From that moment on, you're unlikely to use the page in that same way. As
      updating the status page can expose the company to risk, you need
      ever-increasing amount of buy-in from senior (and sometimes non-technical)
      leadership before giving an update. Even if the end result is the same ‚Äì
      that you want to publish an update - adding the executives into the
      incident loop delays the update, often meaning customers have already
      figured out what's going on before you proactively notify them.
  - You might think B2C companies won't have this issue, as it's rare to bake
    SLAs into contracts with individual customers. But much moreso than B2B, B2C
    companies are extremely visible.
    - If you publish an update then everyone sees it, which may mean millions of
      customers. Even 0.1% of those customers contacting your support is 1000
      queries, which can crush a team for days, even if 99% of those customers
      aren't impacted by the issue.
    - And on the other
  - Sales process: RFPs, non-technical people looking for leverage in
    negotiations, will look through your status page and find incidents to use
    against you. Arguing for transprency may not work as the negotiator may be
    more interested in squeezing for a good price than arguing in good faith.
  - Being more targeted and precise with SLA measures, basically more complex
    calculations, can also backfire.
  - When a customer in an RFP process asked for more specific details about how
    we calculate the uptime percentage, I reviewed our process and created a
    data pipeline that calculated ‚Äì from our request logs ‚Äì an exact uptime
    percentage for each customer, helping identify who qualified for credits and
    how much. Sharing this with the customer, their lawyer got so tangled in the
    technical details of uptime that it made the negotiation even more sticky,
    in an awkward situation where us being fully transparent made the customer
    trust us even less.
  - The difficulty is that service quality is extremely hard to quantify in a
    single number, as anyone who's tried building roll-up SLO/As can attest.
    Even precise, customer specific methods have flaws ‚Äì using request logs can
    only show you when requests you heard about failed, but won't reflect
    network outages that prevent you from receiving them ‚Äì and require a human
    level of interpretation to account for real life outcomes.
- Conclusion
  - While everyone obviously wants full transparency, prompt communication and
    useful/accurate uptime reporting from their services, I think it's clear
    that by applying penalties and building uptime into service contracts, we've
    created number of incentives against this.
  - In a very real world example of Goodhart's Law, as soon as we began using
    uptime as a target, it stopped being a useful measure.
  - So what is an ideal alternative? For me, as a simple engineer, I'd love to
    see the industry start seeing clear and transparent communication in past
    incidents as a positive, in an acknowledgement that incidents are a fact of
    life and it's far better to be honest about them than hide.
  - Couple that with service contracts that include break clauses in the case of
    poor service, and I think we'd be a good step away from the nickle-and-dime
    culture of service credits that compromise transparency. After all, if the
    service is really that bad, surely you'd prefer to find another provider
    than fight for a 10% refund?
  - But at large compamy scales with millions on the line, I can see that being
    a difficult change. The company legal team exist to minimise exposure, and
    legal contracts and processes make it difficult to view a software service
    contract as more of a partnership than a transaction.
  - So perhaps we can't change the system, but I have hope we might change the
    game, either by increasing the perceived value of proactive and transparent
    incident comms, or by improving the tooling companies use to communicate to
    ease these difficulties.
  - It's something we spend a lot of time thinking about at incident.io, and
    have a load of ideas around. So watch this space!

Unironically removes the atmos and black beret (#72722)

## About The Pull Request

Removes atmos berets

## Why It's Good For The Game
Berets shouldn't be thrown into every job, it's milsim circlejerking
dressup shit that creeps out of our milsim containment jobs (security)
and into other innocent jobs. There is absolutely no reason for this job
to have a beret just straight up. Can we add unique hats to the game,
not the same one recolored every way to Sunday? That's my problem. We
don't have unique clothes, we have a billion types of beret when the
BASE BERET TYPE has `IS_PLAYER_COLORABLE_1` so ANYONE can color it. So
again, why do we have the atmos beret? To clog the wardrobe, a vending
machine added specifically because we couldn't stop clogging the
original locker atmos techs spawned in?

The black beret has the same problem: recolored item when you can get
the item of any color

Implement SymBool (#92149)

We have known for a while that we should in principle support SymBool as a separate concept from SymInt and SymFloat ( in particular, every distinct numeric type should get its own API). However, recent work with unbacked SymInts in, e.g., https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/90985 have made this a priority to implement. The essential problem is that our logic for computing the contiguity of tensors performs branches on the passed in input sizes, and this causes us to require guards when constructing tensors from unbacked SymInts. Morally, this should not be a big deal because, we only really care about the regular (non-channels-last) contiguity of the tensor, which should be guaranteed since most people aren't calling `empty_strided` on the tensor, however, because we store a bool (not a SymBool, prior to this PR it doesn't exist) on TensorImpl, we are forced to *immediately* compute these values, even if the value ends up not being used at all. In particular, even when a user allocates a contiguous tensor, we still must compute channels-last contiguity (as some contiguous tensors are also channels-last contiguous, but others are not.)

This PR implements SymBool, and makes TensorImpl use SymBool to store the contiguity information in ExtraMeta. There are a number of knock on effects, which I now discuss below.

* I introduce a new C++ type SymBool, analogous to SymInt and SymFloat. This type supports logical and, logical or and logical negation. I support the bitwise operations on this class (but not the conventional logic operators) to make it clear that logical operations on SymBool are NOT short-circuiting. I also, for now, do NOT support implicit conversion of SymBool to bool (creating a guard in this case). This does matter too much in practice, as in this PR I did not modify the equality operations (e.g., `==` on SymInt) to return SymBool, so all preexisting implicit guards did not need to be changed. I also introduced symbolic comparison functions `sym_eq`, etc. on SymInt to make it possible to create SymBool. The current implementation of comparison functions makes it unfortunately easy to accidentally introduce guards when you do not mean to (as both `s0 == s1` and `s0.sym_eq(s1)` are valid spellings of equality operation); in the short term, I intend to prevent excess guarding in this situation by unit testing; in the long term making the equality operators return SymBool is probably the correct fix.
* ~~I modify TensorImpl to store SymBool for the `is_contiguous` fields and friends on `ExtraMeta`. In practice, this essentially meant reverting most of the changes from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/85936 . In particular, the fields on ExtraMeta are no longer strongly typed; at the time I was particularly concerned about the giant lambda I was using as the setter getting a desynchronized argument order, but now that I have individual setters for each field the only "big list" of boolean arguments is in the constructor of ExtraMeta, which seems like an acceptable risk. The semantics of TensorImpl are now that we guard only when you actually attempt to access the contiguity of the tensor via, e.g., `is_contiguous`. By in large, the contiguity calculation in the implementations now needs to be duplicated (as the boolean version can short circuit, but the SymBool version cannot); you should carefully review the duplicate new implementations. I typically use the `identity` template to disambiguate which version of the function I need, and rely on overloading to allow for implementation sharing. The changes to the `compute_` functions are particularly interesting; for most of the functions, I preserved their original non-symbolic implementation, and then introduce a new symbolic implementation that is branch-less (making use of our new SymBool operations). However, `compute_non_overlapping_and_dense` is special, see next bullet.~~ This appears to cause performance problems, so I am leaving this to an update PR.
* (Update: the Python side pieces for this are still in this PR, but they are not wired up until later PRs.) While the contiguity calculations are relatively easy to write in a branch-free way, `compute_non_overlapping_and_dense` is not: it involves a sort on the strides. While in principle we can still make it go through by using a data oblivious sorting network, this seems like too much complication for a field that is likely never used (because typically, it will be obvious that a tensor is non overlapping and dense, because the tensor is contiguous.) So we take a different approach: instead of trying to trace through the logic computation of non-overlapping and dense, we instead introduce a new opaque operator IsNonOverlappingAndDenseIndicator which represents all of the compute that would have been done here. This function returns an integer 0 if `is_non_overlapping_and_dense` would have returned `False`, and an integer 1 otherwise, for technical reasons (Sympy does not easily allow defining custom functions that return booleans). The function itself only knows how to evaluate itself if all of its arguments are integers; otherwise it is left unevaluated. This means we can always guard on it (as `size_hint` will always be able to evaluate through it), but otherwise its insides are left a black box. We typically do NOT expect this custom function to show up in actual boolean expressions, because we will typically shortcut it due to the tensor being contiguous. It's possible we should apply this treatment to all of the other `compute_` operations, more investigation necessary. As a technical note, because this operator takes a pair of a list of SymInts, we need to support converting `ArrayRef<SymNode>` to Python, and I also unpack the pair of lists into a single list because I don't know if Sympy operations can actually validly take lists of Sympy expressions as inputs. See for example `_make_node_sizes_strides`
* On the Python side, we also introduce a SymBool class, and update SymNode to track bool as a valid pytype. There is some subtlety here: bool is a subclass of int, so one has to be careful about `isinstance` checks (in fact, in most cases I replaced `isinstance(x, int)` with `type(x) is int` for expressly this reason.) Additionally, unlike, C++, I do NOT define bitwise inverse on SymBool, because it does not do the correct thing when run on booleans, e.g., `~True` is `-2`. (For that matter, they don't do the right thing in C++ either, but at least in principle the compiler can warn you about it with `-Wbool-operation`, and so the rule is simple in C++; only use logical operations if the types are statically known to be SymBool). Alas, logical negation is not overrideable, so we have to introduce `sym_not` which must be used in place of `not` whenever a SymBool can turn up. To avoid confusion with `__not__` which may imply that `operators.__not__` might be acceptable to use (it isn't), our magic method is called `__sym_not__`. The other bitwise operators `&` and `|` do the right thing with booleans and are acceptable to use.
* There is some annoyance working with booleans in Sympy. Unlike int and float, booleans live in their own algebra and they support less operations than regular numbers. In particular, `sympy.expand` does not work on them. To get around this, I introduce `safe_expand` which only calls expand on operations which are known to be expandable.

TODO: this PR appears to greatly regress performance of symbolic reasoning. In particular, `python test/functorch/test_aotdispatch.py -k max_pool2d` performs really poorly with these changes. Need to investigate.

tegra: lcd: video: integrate display driver for t30

On popular request make the display driver from T20 work on T30 as
well. Turned out to be quite straight forward. However a few notes
about some things encountered during porting: Of course the T30 device
tree was completely missing host1x as well as PWM support but it turns
out this can simply be copied from T20. The only trouble compiling the
Tegra video driver for T30 had to do with some hard-coded PWM pin
muxing for T20 which is quite ugly anyway. On T30 this gets handled by
a board specific complete pin muxing table. The older Chromium U-Boot
2011.06 which to my knowledge was the only prior attempt at enabling a
display driver for T30 for whatever reason got some clocking stuff
mixed up. Turns out at least for a single display controller T20 and
T30 can be clocked quite similar. Enjoy.

Syndicate Bomb Core Payloads Can Only Be Triggered via the Bomb (#72986)

## About The Pull Request

Basically, you can't extract the bomb core, slap a 10-second c4 on it/on
the shell/and run off having triggered an incredibly powerful explosion.
This is accomplished by having the syndicate bomb override ex_act (it
will be deleted if the explosion goes off), as well as the payload
itself being subtyped into something resistant to bombs and burning.

In-universe, this is described as the shell being quite resistant to
forms of external explosive force- but if any explosive force comes from
within the bomb's shell: kabloom. The bombcore itself has been
redesigned (in a rare moment of non-ineptude) by Donk Co., who has
redesigned the bomb core payload from the ground up- meaning that it can
only be detonated electronically by an impulse from the bomb machinery.
Cutting the wrong wire and attempting to get rid of the bomb by hitting
it with an axe or something will still cause it to blow up, but you know
how those things can be.
## Why It's Good For The Game

I feel like the point of the syndicate bomb is to be a threat for the
crew to match up against. I want a clown in bomb squad gear to head out
to the site and sweat trying to figure out which wire it is, until....
KA-BLHONK: red mist. Or, I want some "helpful" assistant to interrupt
someone's session by going "I KNOW WHAT WIRE IT IS", and having those
odds of either blowing everyone around them up or actually saving the
day.

Being able to detonate something that was balanced and designed to have
_at least_ one minute and a half in **10 SECONDS** is just so injurious
to the game. You can buy a shitload of these bombs, extract the cores,
slap c4 on it and go around the station doling out some serious
explosions. You can run into medbay, wrench it down, slap a c4 on it AND
NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! They can't cut wires, they can't figure
it out to save the day, all they can do is run. Running from danger is
fine and acceptable, but it's just completely stacked against the crew
in a way that I feel needs to be rectified somehow.

I like the idea of purposefully fucking with the wires on the spot so
you sacrificially kill everyone, that feels quite fair to me. I just
simply don't like the fact that you can waltz around the station
punching huge gaps in the hull (remember, putting c4 on the bomb core
itself would cause it to go kabloom) with nearly nothing as far as risk.
It's way too rewarding for something very easy to accomplish (there's a
reason why it's 90 seconds- it's not meant to be easy to accomplish).

This doesn't affect base bombcore behavior, just the explodey ones that
come standard in syndicate bombs.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: After an unfortunate event occuring when some nuclear
operatives took the ship to a Fireworks Store, the Syndicate have
re-engineered their bomb cores to only explode when electronically
triggered by the bomb shell itself. The payload inside a standard
syndicate bomb can not be exploded with another explosion, you must keep
it in the bomb machinery for it to actually do some explodey stuff.

Goliath dna infusion (#71657)

## About The Pull Request
This is a baseline version of the organs and I intend on polishing them
more in the future (Hopefully after other faunas get added to the
infuser.)

Now, this PR adds goliaths to the DNA infuser at genetics. It gives 4
organs and a final bonus effect.

1- Goliath eyes: Simple mostly filler organ that gives night vision.
2- Goliath lungs: Allow miners to breath either lavaland or the default
air mix. As a side effect they can't breath pure O2 anymore so internals
can't be used. Stay away from N2O or use your gas mask properly.
3- Goliath heart: Give miner ash storm protection
4- Goliath brain: Turns one of the miner's arm into a tendril goliath
hammer that can be used to mine. Like the mounted chainsaw it cannot be
dropped, it has slower atk speed, deals 20 damage by default and a bonus
80 to lavaland fauna, it also acts as a baseball bat against fauna so
you can dodge being hit back with good timing.
As a side effect, you can't equip gloves as your hand is a big ass
hammer...

The extra effect for having all 4 organs is lava immunity for now, I
really want to turn it into something more interesting later.

GAGS organs and bonus coderspriter arm:

If I have time I might animate the arm later.
## Why It's Good For The Game
This add some useful tools for miners if they opt into asking genetics
for help and bother to drag a goliath corpses to it.
The organs can be useful on the station, but they will only really shine
at lavaland.

We were brainstorming more things that miners can get from the station
on their downtime waiting the cargo shuttle to bring their bought gear,
this would be a simple and easy power up for miners that can have some
small (ignoring the hammer arm) bonus to miners, but small power ups
pile up.

I also wrote a hackMD around these organs, their goals, non goals,
future possibilities for fauna organs (goliath and others) etc.
https://hackmd.io/@GuillaumePrata/goliath_infusion_organs

## Changelog
:cl: Guillaume Prata
add: Geneticists figured out how to infuse goliath DNA into humanoids!
(Many monkeys were harmed in the process!)
add: Goliath eyes for nightvision, lungs to breath at lavaland safely,
heart to protect you from ash storms and the brain which turns one of
your arms into a tendril hammer.
add: Tendril hammer: Your arm becomes a giant mass of plate and tendril
but it won't fit on gloves anymore. While slow to swing around, you can
obliterate fauna/megafauna with it, 20 base dmg + 80 bonus damage to
fauna/megafauna with a bonus knockback.

Whoa!

1:50am. Done with chores and breakfast. I am really on edge here.

https://www.shellhacks.com/windows-which-equivalent-cmd-powershell/#:~:text=The%20where%20command%20is%20a,is%20the%20Get%2DCommand%20utility.

Get-Command. This tells me where git is.

Ok, let me uninstall git, so I can reinstall it later. The same goes for Python.

Ok, now where is the script.

2pm. Let me start. Just start recording.

2:40pm. Let me remove Python.

3pm. Let me stop the video editing just for a bit. I want to know how to use the markers in Camtasia.

https://youtu.be/4NNI8PHe3qc?t=53
> Always add your markers to your clips.

I suppose that is a good idea.

https://youtu.be/4NNI8PHe3qc?t=105

Is this meek sounding voice really from the black dude in the image? It feels like it should not be.

I just wanted to know this, but let me watch the video. It mentioned I could use them to make sections for Youtube vids.

https://youtu.be/4NNI8PHe3qc?t=282

Oh this is good advice, I did not know this.

https://youtu.be/4NNI8PHe3qc?t=331

Maybe it is his voice, but he is just transforming it somehow?

Maybe I should look into voice editing?

4:30pm. Hmmm, let me think. Right now I just need to show how to modify the GPU tiers.

5:30pm. Had to take a break. Let me uninstall VS Code so I can show how to install it.

5:45pm. One thing that I haven't mention, but ripple deleting sections of the video does not cause the cursor to jump around. It seems Camtasia is smart enough to preserve its path!

This really makes it a lot easier to follow it.

5:50pm. Let me stop here for lunch.

6:20pm. Ayatri is out, but I need to finish the video. My god, how much does this take?

7:30pm. Finally done! Now it rendering the video. It comes up to 11.5 minutes. Let me read Ayatri while that is going on in the background.

7:45pm. The export wasn't like I expected. I thought it would make a single mp4 file, but it instead made a whole webpage. I do not understand how this could be exported to Youtube assuming I want to keep the section markers intact. I do not feel like messing with this anymore. I'll figure it out tomorrow. I'll have to watch a video on this.

7:50pm. Tomorrow, I will do this and take a break to make the PL monthly report for the first in a long time. If I post there saying I am looking, maybe somebody would be willing to hire me for a PL position.

7:55pm. Forget it. Let me chill here. Tomorrorw's agenda: bath, video, PL monthly review. Also emails. I should be getting something next week for interested parties. I think there should be some.

Youtubing is just plan B, in case the job hunt goes for a lot longer than I'd like."

includes today's pack run.

Ugh.  I took 400mg ibuprofen and 500mg of acetaminophen before my run
and then again at the 12 mile mark.  I still had a lot of discomfort
from my hot-spot on my right foot.  I ran OK initially, because the
foot wasn't chirping, but it began at about 6 miles in.  After about 8
miles I chose my pace more based on minimizing discomfort than either
trying to keep a 9:30 pace or a 140bpm HR.

To make matters worse, yesterday, when I went to fill my last
remaining hammer gel bottle with a quad espresso for the turnaround, I
couldn't find it.  I wound up spending a lot of time searching, then
gave up and filled a Salomon soft flask instead.  That hurt me in a
couple of ways.  First, I chose not to adjust my pack straps yesterday
because I was too spent after the failed search and my race earlier in
the day.  That came to bite me hard, because this morning I discovered
that my straps needed *major* adjustment and I didn't have time to do
it right, which led to more chafing than usual.  Secondly, I wore a
bunch of my quad espresso due to cold hands manipulating an unfamiliar
flask.

FWIW, my pace with that weight and that heart rate is acceptable.
Unfortunately, by not pushing myself harder, I'm not going to get as
much of the adaptations as I'd like, especially considering the
discomfort I went through.  Furthermore, it's quite possible that
today's exercise has made my hot-spot worse.  My thought that was by
doing a 4 mile race the day before, I would have less time on my feet
between my Wednesday speed run (which was also a shit-show due to my
hot-spot) and today's "race pace" run.  I'm not sure if that really
worked out, because I ran fairly fast for my currently level of
fitness, so in addition to my foot discomfort today, I was still
partially beaten up from racing yesterday.

I'll know a lot more about my foot tomorrow.  In theory I do interval
training (but without a pack!).  I may wind up driving down to the
library just to save myself to miles of running or I may not run at
all.  I'm in uncharted territory.

The state of South Carolina is methodically making its case against Alex Murdaugh ‚Äì the erstwhile influential attorney who stands accused of savagely slaying his wife and son nineteen months ago in a crime which has drawn international attention.<br>The investigation into this graphic double homicide ‚Äì and multiple other lines of criminal inquiry tied to Murdaugh and his associates ‚Äì is being run by the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and the office of S.C. attorney general Alan Wilson.<br>I say *‚Äúis‚Äù* because the murder investigation is ongoing ‚Ä¶<br>As the prosecution worked to establish its case ‚Äì and as defense attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin started pushing back with their own counter-narratives ‚Äì the vast majority of early witnesses have been procedural in nature.<br<After hearing from first responders ‚Äì the Colleton County deputies who were called to Moselle following Alex Murdaugh‚Äôs fateful 9-1-1 call ‚Äì prosecutors began questioning witnesses who collected, processed and analyzed various pieces of evidence taken from the crime scene, from autopsies of the victims and from other locations pertinent to the investigation.<br√¨As proceedings wore on Friday, the state‚Äôs case ‚Äì which started with a bang courtesy of lead prosecutor Creighton Waters ‚Äì settled into a trudging and pedantic plodding, a halting progression of mostly abbreviated, evidence-based testimony from witnesses who were called to verify various items and confirm their chain of custody so they could be admitted into evidence.<br>One particular witness who fielded the vast majority of this evidence was special agent Melinda Worley, a forensic scientist at SLED who was part of the crime scene unit which responded to Moselle. Worley was on the stand for more than four hours as assistant attorney general Savanna Goude led her through the introduction of several dozen pieces of evidence.
*‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of mechanical witnesses ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt call them boring ‚Äì but they are necessary to introduce evidence,‚Äù* a prosecutor familiar with the status of the case told me.<br√¨*‚ÄúIn order to tell a story you have to put a thousand puzzle pieces on the table,‚Äù* the prosecutor told me. *‚ÄúThose pieces may not make sense when you first see them ‚Äì but they‚Äôre all going to make sense when they‚Äôre tied together in a story.‚Äù*<br>*‚ÄúOnce you see how it all fits together, you see the full picture,‚Äù* the prosecutor added. *‚ÄúBut first, we‚Äôve got to cover every last little blade of grass.‚Äù*<br√¨Prosecutors certainly covered plenty of real estate on Friday afternoon.<br>As Goude led Worley through this voluminous evidence, Harpootlian twirled his glasses and repeatedly rested his eyes ‚Äì making no attempt to hide his boredom from jurors. As for Murdaugh, he displayed a wide range of emotions ‚Äì breaking down in tears on several occasions as swabs taken from the bodies of his dead wife and son were admitted into evidence.<br>Later, though, Murdaugh was seen joking and gesturing with Harpootlian and Griffin.<br√¨While Waters laid out a timeline and touched on motive in his opening statement, so far no one has laid out the investigatory process that led the state to present probable cause affidavits seeking warrants for Murdaugh‚Äôs arrest.<br>Will that change soon?
Yes, I am told ‚Ä¶<br I*‚ÄúYou are going to see the lead investigators come in and start telling the story,‚Äù* the prosecutor told me.<br>According to my sources, the most critical witness for SLED will be Dave Owen, a senior special agent who is the lead case agent on the Murdaugh murder investigation. Another critical witness will be Ryan Neill, SLED‚Äôs Lowcountry regional captain. Neill supervises all cases in the fourteenth judicial circuit and reports directly to SLED headquarters in Columbia, S.C.<br>For those of you interested in SLED‚Äôs organizational structure, there are agents, special agents, senior special agents, lieutenants, captains, majors, an assistant chief and (obviously) chief Mark Keel, who runs SLED as an appointee of South Carolina governor Henry McMaster.<br>According to my sources, the prosecution‚Äôs direct examination of Owen will take at least one full day ‚Äì but unlike Friday afternoon‚Äôs mostly perfunctory testimony, it will tell a story based on the evidence already introduced.<br>*‚ÄúHe is going to be responsible for presenting the investigative case,‚Äù* another source familiar with Owen‚Äôs testimony told me.<br>Owen and Neill are also expected to carry the weight of rebutting Harpootlian and Griffin‚Äôs theory that the state *‚Äúrushed to judgment‚Äù* in accusing Murdaugh of these crimes.|
| [‚ÄòMurdaugh Murders‚Äô Saga: So-Called ‚ÄòCrime Scene‚Äô Images Revive Calls For...](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/01/27/murdaugh-murders-saga-so-called-crime-scene-images-revive-calls-for-transparency/) 
Late Thursday, South Carolina circuit court judge Clifton Newman and Colleton County court officials released a series of so-called *‚Äúcrime scene‚Äù* photos taken in the aftermath of the gruesome double homicide at the heart of the ‚ÄòMurdaugh Murders‚Äô crime and corruption saga.<br>Murdaugh was charged with these murders on July 14, 2022. He pleaded not guilty and asked to be judged *‚Äúby God and country.‚Äù* His trial is currently taking place in Walterboro, S.C.<br>The problem with the selective release of these ‚Äúcrime scene‚Äù photos? First, the handful of images released to the media do not even begin to cover the number of photos taken at the scene. Also, court officials have not released any of the body-worn camera footage which was presented in court earlier this week ‚Äì redacted or otherwise.<br>Even worse, members of the media were prohibited from viewing any of this evidence in court. Lawyers literally held up banker‚Äôs boxes and taped sheets of paper over monitors to prohibit the press from seeing images or videos of the crime scene.<br>Look ‚Ä¶ I can (sort of) understand limiting media access to sensitive files, but in a courtroom that has been literally cordoned off from media phones, laptops (even Apple watches) ‚Ä¶ why are reporters not allowed to at least use their eyeballs to assess the evidence and report back to their audiences?<br>At the end of the day, isn‚Äôt that our job?<br>In case you haven‚Äôt yet seen the handful of *‚Äúcrime scene‚Äù* photos that were released, here is a gallery ‚Ä¶
Let me be clear about something: This is not about members of the media ‚Äì including our news outlet ‚Äì wanting to splash sensational images and video of gore and guts all over the internet. I mean, we live in a world so desensitized to the macabre I doubt most people would be overly shocked by the materials, but that is not the issue.<br>As I have said often over the course of the past week, the issue is that this is a public trial. It is being held in a public courtroom. Public prosecutors are submitting evidence which, by definition, is public information. Every solitary shred of it.<br>Let me repeat that: This is public information.<br>All of it.<br>That means barring extraordinary circumstances, the public has a right to see it ‚Ä¶ even if it is graphic.<br>FITSNews has already received copies of multiple crime scene photos in this case (including some truly jarring ones). And as I noted in a previous post, we declined to publish those images.<br>Even in the event all of the graphic photos and videos are made public ‚Äì as they should be ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt decided how we would handle them. Certainly they would not be splashed on our homepage or directly visible in our articles, but on some level there is a public right to see these materials in some form or fashion.<br>And at the very least, if these materials are going to be sealed and hidden from the public view it becomes all the more vital for journalists inside the courtroom to be able to see these exhibits as they are presented and review them after the fact.<br>Prior to the commencement of these proceedings, I penned a column acknowledging the need for certain restrictions on media access to the courtroom. Logistically, it would have been absolutely impossible to accommodate everyone wanting to bring a camera or a livestream set-up into the court to do so.<br>Court officials were wise to designate pool photographers and a single source for the livestream.<br>But after a disappointing reversal on an initial order allowing the press to bring cell phones into court, it seems as though every day restrictions on media access to the critical components of this trial grow more draconian ‚Äì like a powerful boa constrictor tightening its grip.<br>Journalists strain to see exhibits over the shoulders of attorneys during Alex Murdaugh‚Äòs double homicide trial on January 26, 2023
Again, I will admit a bit of self-interest here. More access equals more info, which equals more clicks ‚Ä¶ which equals more money. But that self-interest pales in comparison with the public interest at stake in this case, which is not only a trial of Alex Murdaugh ‚Äì but of the entire South Carolina judicial system.<br>Retired law professor Jay Bender ‚Äì a transparency advocate with years of experience litigating public records access cases ‚Äì has been serving as a liaison between the court and the media during this trial.<br>I like Bender. And as our audience is well aware, I have written glowingly of judge Newman on multiple occasions in the past. Also, Colleton court officials like Becky Hill and her team have gone above and beyond in this trial to accommodate some big egos in and out of the courtroom. Every night after the trial is over, in fact, you can see the light in Hill‚Äôs office still burning as she and her staff work overtime to make sure things keep running smoothly.<br>But as the first week of this trial draws to a close, the fact remains the level of media access to critical information being presented in the courtroom is simply unacceptable. And has to change. |

WALTERBORO ‚Äî Alex Murdaugh looked *‚Äúclean from head to toe‚Äù* in his first interview with investigators just hours after his wife and son were brutally shot to death, according to testimony prosecutors elicited on the third day of Murdaugh‚Äôs double murder trial.<br>In a recording played in the Colleton County courtroom, Murdaugh ‚Äî a since-disbarred Hampton trial attorney ‚Äî could be heard telling investigators he had checked the bodies of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul for pulses shortly after arriving at the gruesome scene around 10 p.m. on the evening of June 7, 2021.<br>Murdaugh said he tried to turn Paul over, though he could see his youngest son‚Äôs brain ‚Äî blown out of his skull by a shotgun blast ‚Äî lying by his feet.<br>But Murdaugh‚Äôs hands appeared clean in his 12:57 a.m. interview with investigators, Colleton County Sheriff‚Äôs Office deputy Laura Rutland testified Jan. 27 under questioning from state prosecutor John Meadors. So did his arms. And his shirt. And his shorts. And his shoes, she said.<br>Rutland, prosecutors‚Äô seventh witness, testified she saw no blood on Murdaugh at all. Nor could she see footprints or kneeprints near Maggie or Paul‚Äôs bodies, though both were lying facedown in large pools of blood and brain matter. Later, she testified that it seemed like he‚Äôd put on fresh clothes; she noticed his shirt was clean, though he was sweating on a warm, humid night.<br>Rutland‚Äôs testimony came as prosecutors with the S.C. Attorney General‚Äôs Office sought to bolster their case that Murdaugh murdered his wife and son and then quickly worked to cover it up.<br>In the opening stages of the case, prosecutors have sought to showcase apparent inconsistencies between what Murdaugh told officials about his whereabouts and actions that evening and what investigators observed at the scene and learned afterward.<br> Murdaugh defense attorney Jim Griffin presented a different conclusion from Rutland‚Äôs testimony. In cross-examination, he noted the crime scene was covered in blood and brains ‚Äî matter that could have sprayed onto the shooter as well. Yet Rutland had testified that Murdaugh was spotless.<br>*‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt look like someone who had just been within feet of blowing Paul‚Äôs head off, right?‚Äù* Griffin asked.<br>*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say that,‚Äù* Rutland replied. *‚ÄúThere are so many factors that you would have to take into account.‚Äù*<br>Rutland and the State Law Enforcement Division‚Äôs lead investigator, Dave Owen, spoke with Murdaugh at 12:57 a.m. in a vehicle as it rained at the family‚Äôs remote hunting lodge. They were joined by Danny Henderson, a lawyer at the family‚Äôs high-powered law firm who said he was acting as Murdaugh‚Äôs personal attorney.<br>Sitting in the front seat, Murdaugh soon broke down in tears, and Henderson reached up to put a hand on his shoulder. At three points in the roughly 30-minute interview, he opened the car door, leaned outside and appeared to spit.<br>The video shows Murdaugh present an alibi that prosecutors contend does not hold up: He woke up from a nap and decided to visit his mother, who suffers from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, because his father had gone to the hospital that day. He told investigators he found Maggie and Paul shot dead when he arrived home.<br>But in his opening statement, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters said investigators found cellphone video placing Murdaugh with his wife and son shortly before the shootings. That video has not been shown in court.<br>In his interview with investigators, Murdaugh did not mention visiting Paul and Maggie at the dog kennels before finding their bodies.<br>He also reiterated what he had told the 911 dispatcher and first responders hours earlier: that his son Paul had received threats and even been physically attacked by people angry with him over the 2019 boat crash that killed Mallory Beach.<br>Paul had been criminally charged with driving the boat that night, Murdaugh told investigators. The drunken boating case was still pending when he was killed.<br>Agent Owen asked Murdaugh if he thought *‚Äúanybody on that boat‚Äù* had meant Paul harm.<br>*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know of any direct threats‚Äù* from the crash survivors, Murdaugh said, adding the threats came from people the Murdaughs didn‚Äôt know. Months earlier, Paul had gone out in Charleston and come home with a black eye, he said.<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been prouder of him than the way he has handled the pressures and the adversity in that situation.‚Äù Murdaugh said of Paul and the boat case. *‚ÄúPaul is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful kid. He‚Äôd do almost anything. He gets along with almost anybody.‚Äù*<br>Rutland‚Äôs testimony came near the end of the first week of Murdaugh‚Äôs double murder trial, a nationally televised event that has brought food trucks, network TV stars and more than 100 reporters to this lightly populated Lowcountry town.<br>Prosecutors have so far presented nine witnesses, all of whom responded in some way to Murdaugh‚Äôs frantic 911 call to report finding his wife and son‚Äôs dead bodies.<br>Paul Murdaugh was shot first with two shotgun blasts, the latter a fatal shot to the head, as he stood in a feed room by a set of dog kennels at the Murdaugh family‚Äôs 1,770-acre hunting estate in Colleton County, prosecutors have said.<br>The shooter then felled Maggie with a .300 Blackout semiautomatic assault rifle as she tried to run away. The killer fired a fatal shot to the back of her head from close range as she lay on the ground, according to evidence presented in the case.<br>State prosecutors have said Murdaugh killed Maggie and Paul in a desperate attempt to engender sympathy for himself and distract from a series of inquiries into his bank records that were about to expose his myriad financial crimes. Earlier in the day, his law firm‚Äôs chief financial officer confronted him over $792,000 in legal fees that were unaccounted for, demanding proof that it hadn‚Äôt gone missing, she testified in another case.<br>Since the slayings, state investigators have charged Murdaugh with nearly 100 other crimes, most connected to allegations he surreptitiously stole nearly $9 million from legal settlements and fees owed to his legal clients, law partners and others who trusted him.<br>At Murdaugh‚Äôs trial, which is expected to last at least three weeks, prosecutors have sought to highlight the defendant‚Äôs behavior in the hours after reporting the slayings.<br>They have unveiled body camera footage and 911 audio, stopping the tapes periodically to note moments where Murdaugh‚Äôs demeanor could be interpreted as strange.<br>First responders testified earlier this week that Murdaugh wasn‚Äôt crying when they arrived, though he did seem distraught and whimpered at times when he spoke with deputies. He eyed officers cautiously as they inspected unidentified tire tracks near the scene, one testified.<br>Murdaugh‚Äôs lawyers have countered that their client‚Äôs behavior shows only that he was traumatized and in shock at the scene.<br>Prosecutors also have fixated on where blood was found around the scene ‚Äî and where it wasn‚Äôt.<br>Swabs of 10 separate areas around the driver and front passenger sides of Murdaugh‚Äôs Chevrolet Suburban ‚Äî the vehicle he used to drive from the main house at the Moselle estate to the crime scene that evening ‚Äî tested positive for blood, SLED crime scene technician Melinda Worley testified.<br>Worley said she also swabbed an apparent spot of blood found on the 12-gauge shotgun Murdaugh retrieved from the Moselle home for his own protection after finding Maggie and Paul‚Äôs bodies. But Worley was not asked ‚Äî nor did she say ‚Äî whether the sample tested positive for blood.

This can be exploited to put hollowpoint rounds in the S&W, which
combined with its damage multiplier will deal a truly ridiculous amount
of damage, 2-shooting runners in close range.

I strongly believe the multiplier is not the problem - it's the damage.
And the hollowpoint ammo's damage is doubled by the multiplier, while
its intended 'weaker against armor' downside isn't multiplied.

> Reduced the amount of time the Smith & Wesson's trick buff lasts.

It was 8 seconds, i have no idea how I put that value in, maybe it was
for testing purposes and i forgot to remove it. Having it be so long
kind of negates the gimmick of doing a trick and then firing the gun
since it stays active for so long.

> The CMB Spearhead revolver can no longer fire in bursts nor fit the
burst-fire assembly.

I kept this in because I thought it fit the lore - turns out it doesn't!
It's stupid and makes no sense in any way so goodbye legacy poopcode.

These buffs should keep these revolvers' strong utility but ensure no
cheesy overcomplicated strats can be used to instantly satanize Xenos
with. (Or your own teammate..)

> Adds attacking animations to all Xeno abilities that lacked them.

This is useful visual feedback that an attack happened, and it sucks
that it didn't exist until now. It also looks great and really makes you
feel like Batman.

> Made said abilities cause the xeno to face the target.

Probably shouldn't kill people facing backwards from them!

> Said abilities also cause an attack flicker overlay.

These will not easily be confused with normal slashing, as they have
either punching or disarming as their attack flicker.

> Dancer Impale now plays a stronger hit sound and hit animation.

Impale absolutely devastates targets, and changing the effects to fit
will make it that much more satisfying to pull a combo off.

> Base crushers lower their crest while charging.

This looks neat and is cool visual feedback for a crusher charging if
you're not in position to see their tiny windup.

> Predaliens spin around when devastating a target.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Whitelist are run by name, so renaming a whitelisted species also needs
an update to the WL as well.
Removes a shitty gimmick of a mirror most people dont have access to
because its a fucking nightmare of conditions we partially removed
and a fix for both runtimes and uninteded stat cheating
<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
