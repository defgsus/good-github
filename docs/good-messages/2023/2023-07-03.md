SPECIES NUKING 2023: Head flags 3 & Knuckles: Fixes some growing pains with head flags  (#76440)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/76422
This was caused by me somehow not using the wrapper there and not
noticing it

Also fixes hair gradients and facial hair gradients. I am pretty sure
they were uhh, being hidden behind the actual hair/facial hair. Oops.

Also also fixes spawning yourself as a human as admin and getting random
hair colors. That was just a failure to update the icon after updating
everything, I think?

Additionally, to totally babyproof all of this, ensures that head_flags
involved stuff gets applied AFTER species by creating a new preference
priority, and uses two separate wrappers to apply gradient style and
color.

Here's this absolute hellspawn to prove that everything works.

[MIRROR] New planetary exclusive random event/unfavorable situation, Chasmic Earthquake [MDB IGNORE] (#21778)

* New planetary exclusive random event/unfavorable situation, Chasmic Earthquake (#75864)

## About The Pull Request

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/2451bc69-db1e-420d-9a18-2f899ca65427

This introduces a new unfavorable situation (non-antagonist random
events that dynamic triggers under certain circumstances), restricted to
planetary maps (Icebox). An earthquake occurs, felt by everyone on the
map, forming a fault that tears the a hole somewhere on the station.

The fault zone is indicated by shaking tiles, which gives a chance
(about 30 seconds) for you to move your machinery/property/crewmembers
out of the way. If you're on those tiles when the fault forms, get ready
to take a nasty fall.

Anything caught in the fault zone as it collapses inward will be
destroyed, violently, _before_ being dropped down into the z-level
below.

These can also happen as a random event, however their rarity is on-par
with that of a meteor storm.

This also adds a helper for finding a midpoint turf between two provided
turfs, thanks to ZephyrTFA.

This idea basically possessed me over the course of a few days, and I
found myself unable to work on anything else until I had it complete.
I'm glad its done.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Gives Icebox its own big "environmental disaster" event. I'm hoping it
isn't received as being too destructive, but mind that this is meant to
be an equal to the dreaded meteor storm.

Also makes it so that unfavorable events aren't a coinflip between a
portal storm/rod on planetary maps.
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
add: Chasmic Earthquake random event, exclusive to Icebox. Tears a huge
chasm in the hull of the station. Watch out for shaking tiles!
sound: Adds sounds for distant rumbling, metal creaking, and rubble
shaking.
imageadd: Achievement icon for getting sucked up in an earthquake chasm.

Sets the default compression to 0 (#5526)

**What's the problem this PR addresses?**

Cache compression doesn't seem the best option nowadays:

- It adds significant time to installs
- It adds a non-negligible runtime overhead (partially related, #1817)
- It prevents Git from diffing archives when they're modified

Its main advantage is for some amazingly large packages, where storing
them inside a Git repository would be impossible (GitHub has a 600MB
file limit). But since we changed the cache default to
`enableGlobalCache: true`, this isn't relevant by default, so the cache
compression should be set to zero.

One potential issue is how it may give the impression that Yarn became
worse for global cache users. We don't believe it's the case (Git can
delta uncompressed archives in some measure, making it less expensive to
upgrade from one package version to another), but to the average eye it
may not look as such.

**How did you fix it?**

This diff sets the new default compression setting to 0.

To avoid breaking projects' (or at least not making the migration more
difficult), I added a rule to automatically set `compressionLevel` (and
`enableGlobalCache`) to their 3.x default values when running `yarn
install` in a 3.x project. When users are ready they can remove these
settings and re-run the install.

I kept the current compression level on our repository to avoid changing
all archives again. I think we'll have to think of purging the
repository in some form to migrate it to `compressionLevel: 0`.

Fixes a good chunk of Vox sprites. Removes environmental regulator (#2092)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Oh god the pain. Oh god. The unbearable pain. Why.

Adds a ton of unused vox sprites from Drawsstuff.
Cleans up the files for sprites we don't actually have
Ensures they are pathed correctly, with flags set correctly.
I spent five hours on this in one sitting after being upset at shitty
vox mechanics/sprite support again. They're cool and unique and it was
sad.
Removes the Environmental Regulator.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
1. Vox sprites were incomplete. This completes them a little bit more.
2. The environmental regulator isn't fun. This will remove the regulator
and vox needing to use it. It was buggy, poorly made, and just not fun
even when it worked correctly. Vox aren't nearly strong enough to be
constantly crippled.

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl:
add: A metric ton of Vox sprites
del: Vox no longer need environmental regulators

<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Does what it says on the tin, porting a behavior that allows you to ping
a person in admin say by just doing @(ckey) from /tg/station in PR
[#61712](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/61712)

Oh and this PR I guess fixes a hilarious issue where **someone** wrote
'tgstation.dme' instead of 'shiptest.dme' where they shouldn't have.
Whoops!

Most cool of all, which was completely unintentional by me, ports Datum
linking (partially), as well as Ticket linking, respectively added in
PRs [#65154](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/65154) and
[#65634](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/65634)

Bumps Node requirements from 14 to 18 (#5445)

**What's the problem this PR addresses?**

We're still supporting Node 14, but it has reached end of life. Node 16
is still maintained, but will reach an early end of life in October, so
I think it's reasonable to drop it now rather than publish a major
release just for that.

**How did you fix it?**

Bumps the requirements from `14.16` to `18.12` (first LTS from the 18.x
release line).

Modernizes installs' output (#5509)

**What's the problem this PR addresses?**

I wasn't entirely happy with the Yarn output:

- When running `yarn add`, we have no way to know what packages are
actually added to the lockfile. The cache messages sometimes help, but
with zero-installs now being opt-in, in many cases the packages would
already be in the cache and thus wouldn't be displayed at all.

- The "can't be found in the cache and will be fetched from the remote
registry" messages were incredibly slow to print - the same install
would take 28s install for Gatsby on a local iTerm 2 without those logs,
vs almost 2 minutes with. They also weren't very useful: we were only
showing the last 5 of them, and with zero-installs being opt-in in many
cases they wouldn't be shown at all.

- The `node-gyp` warnings were for the most part unactionable (at best
the user would pin a fixed version in their `packageExtensions` field,
which I suspect no one ever did).

- The `deprecated` warnings were for the most part unactionable, and
only printed in very specific cases (the first time they were added to
the project).

- The "missing / invalid peer dependency" warnings were actionable, but
in practice no one really look at them except when something breaks -
and even then, it becomes unreadable when there are too many of them.

- The skipped build warnings were printed every single time you ran
`yarn install`. It's nice to know the first time, then it quickly
becomes redundant.

Fixes #4165

**How did you fix it?**

I went a little overboard and did everything in the same PR ... at first
I thought I wouldn't have to change unrelated parts, but then I finished
implementing the skipped build warnings duplicate removal and oh no ð

- Only peer dependency warnings caused by workspaces are now reporter.
They have also been moved inside the post-resolution validation step.
The resolution step is now expected to only do one of two things: either
report an error when the resolution fails, or report the packages which
got added / removed from the lockfile.

- The `node-gyp` warnings have been removed.

- The `deprecated` warnings have been removed from the install. The
`yarn npm audit` command now reports deprecated packages, although this
can be disabled using `--no-deprecations` (or any of the audit filtering
settings).

- The "can't be found in the cache" messages have been removed. Instead,
the fetch step will report the number of cache hits / cache misses once
it's finished (same behaviour as `preferAggregateCacheInfo`). The size
delta will also be reported.

- Packages whose build was skipped are now stored within
`Project#skippedBuilds`, which is stored within the install state file.
Warnings are only emitted if the install was skipped for the first time.
To see the messages again, users can run `yarn rebuild`.

- Added the Yarn version on installs. A bit because of branding when
screenshot are taken, but mostly so we easily know what version are
people using when they share screenshots to us. In a follow-up PR I'd
like to try to retrieve the latest version from the website, to let them
know once one is available.

Adds support for running native binaries without JS intermediaries (#5508)

**What's the problem this PR addresses?**

Yarn currently cannot run native binaries without going through a JS
jumper script. Other package managers don't have this restriction, and
it makes the `yarn run` overhead worse on some scripts for little
reasons - or doesn't work at all when packages don't use jumper scripts.

**How did you fix it?**

Two mechanisms are used:

- First we check for the binary extension
- Then we check its magic number

If one of the two match a predetermined list, the binary is spawned
without going through Node. This ensures that this logic is called only
when the binary is truly a native binary, and will not affect the
behaviour of other existing scripts.

Rat RP expansion (#76455)

## About The Pull Request

This fixes a vile and long-standing bug where putting a mouse inside
your hat would not allow the mouse to control your movements, as it
would pop out of the hat whenever it tried to move.
Additionally as a feature this allows a mouse sitting on your head to
convey complicated instructions such as "scream" or "do a flip", via
emoting. Through drift compatibility, the rat's living mech will also
perform this action.

I could have made this into a component but there's no fucking way any
other item is going to have this behaviour, so I didn't.

## Why It's Good For The Game

This feature was already in the game but broken and I want it not to be
broken.
The mouse should be able to control your entire life.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Placing a mouse inside your chef hat will once more allow it to
pilot you around.
add: A player-controlled mouse inside your chef hat can compel you to
perform complex actions, such as flipping and spinning. You will obey
because the mouse knows better than you do.

[MIRROR] Replaces the syndicate corpse Legions can drop with one without a MODSuit [MDB IGNORE] (#21517)

* Replaces the syndicate corpse Legions can drop with one without a MODSuit (#75700)

## About The Pull Request
This is part of a pass I'm working on doing where I go through and
remove instances of antag gear outside of their normal context. This is
mostly going to involve replacing space/Lavaland ruin gear with
something close to the same power level but not distinctly something
only antags should be able to get. I want to keep ruins rewarding but I
don't want explicit antag gear to be something you can obtain without
needing an uplink.

The first part of this is me removing the MODSuit from the syndicate
operative corpse. The new one drops a turtleneck, a syndicate gas mask,
and gripper gloves.

## Why It's Good For The Game
It's my opinion that antag gear should probably stay in antag hands
unless you manage to kill one or steal an uplink. The main impetus for
this was a discussion I had a while back about how blood red hardsuits
used to _just_ be an antag thing. I kind of miss that general feeling of
paranoia that came from seeing someone wearing it, as opposed to seeing
it these days and just thinking "Yeah, it's probably someone who got it
from space".

In this specific instance, Syndicate MODSuits are pretty strong anyway
and, regardless of the low odds of getting one, I really don't think it
should be available as loot off a fairly easy-to-kill mob.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Syndicate corpses dropped from killing a Legion no longer come
with a MODSuit.

* Replaces the syndicate corpse Legions can drop with one without a MODSuit

Minor changes to the Syndicate Battle Sphere ruin (#2045)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Various fixes for provinggrounds.dmm, mainly the server room and SMES.
Server room is no longer filled with black box recorders, but salvagable
servers. There is now one singular black box recorder in the center
where a black box on a table was. The SMES now should actually charge
the ruin. Tossed a medkit in one of the halls for players to use while
clearing the ruin. Replaced about half of the syndicate researcher mobs
with syndicate operatives who will actually fight the players. Rotated
an airlock missed in the map updates for anywalls.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
boy, i sure love functional ruins! also players should not have 25 of a
very rare potential quest item. The ruin can stay as it is otherwise,
because it provides a fun challenge for superbly well armed players (or
a rugged explorer with nothing but a lazer gun and a dream) with a
fitting reward at the end of a mounted LMG.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Syndicate Battle Dome (provinggrounds.dmm) should now have a
functional SMES and airlocks/blast doors.
fix: Syndicate Battle Dome (provinggrounds.dmm) no longer has ~20 black
box recorders and now only has one.
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

Mapgen fixes and speedups (ignore the branch name. I'm dumb) (#1637)

## About The Pull Request

Alters the structure of map/planet generation to squash some bugs and
improve performance.

Previously, planet maps were generated by placing the ruin first, and
THEN generating the turfs according to the map_generator datum. This has
been adjusted -- now, turfs are generated WITHOUT objects such as
mobs/flora, the ruin is placed, and THEN the objects are added (turfs
are "populated"). In conjunction with the addition of needed
AfterChange() calls to update the atmos adjacency of the generated
turfs, this ensures that planet atmos acts correctly surrounding ruins.

When deleting reservations (such as the deletion of planets after
undocking), all objects on the planet are rounded up in a list and
qdeleted. Although this causes a small lag spike, it SHOULD prevent
items from hanging out inside the edges of planets.

There's a feature to change the default baseturf of a virtual level,
ZTRAIT_BASETURF, that we now use. This should cut down on the instances
where a ruin on a planet is blown up and there's space underneath (might
still happen on asteroids, because the baseturf there is still space; I
didn't want space turfs without space as their baseturf).

Overmap encounter areas aren't global anymore (they no longer have the
flag UNIQUE_AREA). Don't fucking add the flag UNIQUE_AREA to anything
that should have weather in it, because if that area gets added anywhere
else that _actually respects the flag_ you'll end up with cross-planet
weather, because weather code sucks. This didn't cause bugs before,
because the flag wasn't respected; it will now.

The biome assoc list has been moved into the map generator datum, and
all encounters now generate using a map generator that either uses a
biome or replaces everything with a single turf. This prevents
duplication of cave generation code and makes dynamic overmap object
code slightly easier to understand.

Some systems have been altered to improve performance; many of these
changes are rather small, like the changes to turf population (mob
placement now uses a stack of recently-created mobs to check if there
are any nearby, instead of checking everything within 12 turfs; I've yet
to add ruin mobs to these stacks to avoid placing mobs near ruin mobs)
or lighting objects (removed a single line that changed the color of the
lighting object on init).

Starlight has been altered, so that small turf changes near space turfs
don't need to check as many nearby turfs and so that large turf changes
can be batched to prevent further recalculation. This is probably
responsible for the biggest performance increase.

Smoothing groups are cached before sorting instead of after, to prevent
sort calls on many atom inits; /tg/station uses a unit test to avoid
needing to sort at runtime ever, but I couldn't figure out how to do
that without larger changes or writing a unit test that attempted to
instance every atom once, which would be an undertaking of its own.

Gas strings have been similarly altered, and now their interpretation
defaults to copying from a cached, immutable version of the mix encoded
by the string. This avoids the significant overhead caused by repeated
calls to params2list(). Auxmos has a better solution to this,
__auxtools_parse_gas_string(), but our current custom build of Auxmos
doesn't support it.

There are a few other small changes that I'm probably forgetting about
and you should yell at me to read my own fucking code and tell you what
else I changed.

- [ ] I affirm that I have tested all of my proposed changes and that
any issues found during tested have been addressed.

I still need to manually check each planet type to make sure they aren't
fucked up, I should probably do some proper profiling comparisons.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fewer weird bugs, things generate faster, better* code.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Ruins don't sometimes start in hard vacuum anymore; planet turfs
now share atmos correctly.
fix: There hopefully shouldn't be any random stray objects sitting in
the edges of planets anymore.
fix: Planets now (hopefully) have the correct baseturfs (more or less).
When you bomb a ruin on a planet, it probably won't break through to
space anymore.
refactor: Planet generation has been refactored, improving performance
somewhat.

I18NMessageTest needs to reset I18NBundle static state. (#7101)

* Mark PauseableThread as excluded on GWT.

* Minor typo corrections.

* Fix atan2() when it should produce 0f.

Without this small change (which has essentially no performance impact that I could measure), calling atan2() with a point on the x-axis would produce a small but non-zero result, which is incorrect.

* Add atan, atan2, asin, acos for degrees.

This also includes atan2Deg360(), which in my opinion is the most useful of these because it does something differently from Math.atan2(), and can often save some effort.

* Approximations for tan() and tanDeg().

Sorry this is so long-winded, but the error isn't as straightforward to express as with sin() or cos().

* Apply formatter

* Add to MathUtilsTest.

* Apply formatter

* Stop trying to load defaults from wrong dir.

This old behavior broke Flame's effect-open dialog when any particle effect used the default billlboard or model particle. Now Flame tries to load a file given its absolute path (like before), but if it fails, it falls back to trying the default filenames as internal files.

* I18NMessageTest needs to reset I18NBundle state.

If you run I18NSimpleMessageTest and then I18NMessageTest without this PR, then the first test will have called I18NBundle.setSimpleFormatter(true), but the second test needs it to be set to false.

Because the tests are still perfectly usable if you run them on their own (or use LWJGL2, I think, because it might not share static state), this is not at all a priority to merge; it just makes running many tests in one session not throw an Exception.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

Optimizes timer insertion by 80% (W QDEL_IN micro) (#76214)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

[Reduces timer insertion cost by
80%](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/c9e5b285ed74e60108fddd3f6b45d6d3995c92a8)

Timer name generation involved a LOT of string shit, some in ways where
the string only existed for a moment.
This costs a good bit of time, and can be reduced with only minimal
impacts on the end product, so let's do that. Includes a compile flag to
flip it back if we ever have trouble in future.

This is about 0.1s off init, since we do a lot of timer stuff then too

[Removes STOPPABLE flag from QDEL_IN, moves it to a bespoke
macro](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/e7a5d7f2a78fcf0dce4742ced258c9505411b202)

Its a waste most of the time, tho I would LOVE to analyze at compile
time to work out if we care
## Why It's Good For The Game

I like it when we don't spend all of our cpu time just setting the name
var on timers. that's good and not bad.
This saves time fucking everywhere. 15% off explosions, 0.1 seconds off
init, bunch of time off foam. it's just good.

Cherry picked out of #76104 since that was too cluttered (sannnnnn)

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it

Adds border smoothing! (Look ma I'm upstreaming) (#76134)

## About The Pull Request

Ok so we currently have 1 (count em) border object that wants to smooth
with other border objects. That's the tram window.

It currently does this manually, via map edits, but that's kinda crappy
so lets be better.

This pr adds a new smoothing mode to handle border objects. 
Unlike other smoothing modes, it returns a bitfield of directions the
border object connects in.

I do this by memorizing a calculation of which dirs "connect" at init,
and reading out of a global list with border object direction, direction
between objects, and if it's a border object, the other object's dir.

I'm doing this primarily because it's become useful for wallening (a
spriter saw the tram thing and is doing the same thing to pod windows,
and I want to support that)

I do think it's potentially useful in other applications too tho, and I
like dehardcoding tram windows.

Also fun bonus (or maybe downside), it's nearly 0 cost because I pulled
the bitmask smoothing define into 2 subdefines, and am swapping the
handler one out to do what I want.
Oh also I got rid of a for loop in smoothing code, redundant and costs
time in list iteration

[Moves tram windows over to the new border object
smoothing](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/114873679c94d680788edee9665fa18dba8108c0)

Also replaces some typepath chicanery with a setDir override, for
redundancy in future
Oh and there's a update paths script too, to be nice

## Why It's Good For The Game

More visual possibility in future, fixes a hack we have currently, and
makes some spriters happy.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Dehardcodes some stuff with tram windows, they'll be easier to map
with now
refactor: Border objects can now smooth with each other. I'm sure
something cool will come of this

Auto merge of #113108 - compiler-errors:normalize-opaques-with-late-bound-vars-again, r=jackh726

Normalize opaques with late-bound vars again

We have a hack in the compiler where if an opaque has escaping late-bound vars, we skip revealing it even though we *could* reveal it from a technical perspective. First of all, this is weird, since we really should be revealing all opaques in `Reveal::All` mode. Second of all, it causes subtle bugs (linked below).

I attempted to fix this in #100980, which was unfortunately reverted due to perf regressions on codebases that used really deeply nested futures in some interesting ways. The worst of which was #103423, which caused the project to hang on build. Another one was #104842, which was just a slow-down, but not a hang. I took some time afterwards to investigate how to rework `normalize_erasing_regions` to take advantage of better caching, but that effort kinda fizzled out (#104133).

However, recently, I was made aware of more bugs whose root cause is not revealing opaques during codegen. That made me want to fix this again -- in the process, interestingly, I took the the minimized example from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103423#issuecomment-1292947043, and it doesn't seem to hang any more...

Thinking about this harder, there have been some changes to the way we lower and typecheck async futures that may have reduced the pathologically large number of outlives obligations (see description of #103423) that we were encountering when normalizing opaques with bound vars the last time around:
* #104321 (lower `async { .. }` directly as a generator that implements `Future`, removing the `from_generator` shim)
* #104833 (removing an `identity_future` fn that was wrapping desugared future generators)

... so given that I can see:
* No significant regression on rust perf bot (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107620#issuecomment-1600070317)
* No timeouts in crater run I did (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107620#issuecomment-1605428952, rechecked failing crates in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107620#issuecomment-1605973434)

... and given that this PR:
* Fixes #104601
* Fixes #107557
* Fixes #109464
* Allows us to remove a `DefiningAnchor::Bubble` from codegen (75a8f681837c70051e0200a14f58ae07dbe58e66)

I'm inclined to give this another shot at landing this. Best case, it just works -- worst case, we get more examples to study how we need to improve the compiler to make this work.

Unit Test Setup: jest (#3)

  expect(startPlaying).toBeDefined();
});
```

To run unit tests, you can use a testing library like Jest, a JavaScript
Testing Framework. It allows you to create, run and structure tests.

Here are the steps to set up Jest:

Firstly, initialize a Node.js project by creating a package.json. You
can do this by running the command npm init -y in your project root
directory. This will automatically create a package.json file with
default values.

Then, you need to install Jest. You can install it using the npm package
manager with the following command: npm install --save-dev jest.

Your package.json should then look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "banzuke-surfing-game",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^27.0.6"
  }
}
```

Next, update your game.js file to make it module-friendly (so that it
can be imported in other js files). You can do this by modifying it as
shown below:

```javascript
function startPlaying() {
    var rikishi = $('#rikishi').val();
    alert("You selected: " + rikishi);
}

// Add this line to make this function accessible in other js files
module.exports = { startPlaying };
```

Your game.test.js file seems fine, it will import the startPlaying
function and checks if it's defined.

Finally, run the test by using the following command: npm run test.

However, since you're using jQuery in the code, you might face issues
with the Jest environment because it doesn't have access to the DOM. In
that case, you would need to use something like jsdom (a JavaScript
based headless browser that can create a realistic testing environment)
and mock the jQuery syntax.

Here is a simple example of how you could test your startPlaying
function:

```javascript
global.$ = jest.fn(() => ({
    val: jest.fn(() => '1')
}));

const { startPlaying } = require('./game');

test('check if startPlaying is defined and returns expected value', () => {
    const result = startPlaying();
    expect(result).toBe("You selected: 1");
});
```

This code creates a mock for jQuery and then calls startPlaying. It then
checks if the function is working as expected and returns the correct
result.

Remember to install jest and jsdom in your project using npm:

```shell
npm install --save-dev jest jsdom
```

Please note that running a front-end unit test without a browser context
can be tricky, and the given mock example is a simplification of the
reality. In a more complex scenario, you would probably use tools such
as Jest with additional libraries (like Enzyme or Testing Library) that
help handle React components, virtual DOM and many other things to
provide a more complete testing environment.


```
npm test

> banzukesurfing@1.0.0 test

      7 | }

```
ChatGPT
The error "ReferenceError: alert is not defined" happens because the
alert function is part of the window object in a browser environment.
When running Jest, it uses a Node.js environment, which does not have a
window object or any of its methods (like alert).

In a test environment, it's best to avoid using these kinds of functions
that rely on the browser. But if you absolutely need to use something
like alert, you can mock it out for testing. However, a better approach
might be to refactor your code to not rely on such methods.

Let's refactor your code to return the string message instead of
alerting it, which will allow us to test the result.

Here's your updated game.js:

```javascript
function startPlaying() {
    var rikishi = $('#rikishi').val();
    var message = "You selected: " + rikishi;
    return message;
}

module.exports = { startPlaying };
```

And the test file game.test.js would look like this:

```javascript
global.$ = jest.fn(() => ({
    val: jest.fn(() => '1')
}));

const { startPlaying } = require('./game');

test('check if startPlaying is defined and returns expected value', () => {
    const result = startPlaying();
    expect(result).toBe("You selected: 1");
});
```

Now when you run npm run test, Jest will call the function startPlaying
and compare the return value with the expected string "You selected: 1".

Please note that such kind of changes where we change our original code
to accommodate testing are not always the best solution. In real
projects, you would want to structure your code in a way that makes it
easy to test and avoid functions that are difficult to test like alert.

Cassandra support for chat history using CassIO library (#6771)

### Overview

This PR aims at building on #4378, expanding the capabilities and
building on top of the `cassIO` library to interface with the database
(as opposed to using the core drivers directly).

Usage of `cassIO` (a library abstracting Cassandra access for
ML/GenAI-specific purposes) is already established since #6426 was
merged, so no new dependencies are introduced.

In the same spirit, we try to uniform the interface for using Cassandra
instances throughout LangChain: all our appreciation of the work by
@jj701 notwithstanding, who paved the way for this incremental work
(thank you!), we identified a few reasons for changing the way a
`CassandraChatMessageHistory` is instantiated. Advocating a syntax
change is something we don't take lighthearted way, so we add some
explanations about this below.

Additionally, this PR expands on integration testing, enables use of
Cassandra's native Time-to-Live (TTL) features and improves the phrasing
around the notebook example and the short "integrations" documentation
paragraph.

We would kindly request @hwchase to review (since this is an elaboration
and proposed improvement of #4378 who had the same reviewer).

### About the __init__ breaking changes

There are
[many](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/3.28/api/cassandra/cluster/)
options when creating the `Cluster` object, and new ones might be added
at any time. Choosing some of them and exposing them as `__init__`
parameters `CassandraChatMessageHistory` will prove to be insufficient
for at least some users.

On the other hand, working through `kwargs` or adding a long, long list
of arguments to `__init__` is not a desirable option either. For this
reason, (as done in #6426), we propose that whoever instantiates the
Chat Message History class provide a Cassandra `Session` object, ready
to use. This also enables easier injection of mocks and usage of
Cassandra-compatible connections (such as those to the cloud database
DataStax Astra DB, obtained with a different set of init parameters than
`contact_points` and `port`).

We feel that a breaking change might still be acceptable since LangChain
is at `0.*`. However, while maintaining that the approach we propose
will be more flexible in the future, room could be made for a
"compatibility layer" that respects the current init method. Honestly,
we would to that only if there are strong reasons for it, as that would
entail an additional maintenance burden.

### Other changes

We propose to remove the keyspace creation from the class code for two
reasons: first, production Cassandra instances often employ RBAC so that
the database user reading/writing from tables does not necessarily (and
generally shouldn't) have permission to create keyspaces, and second
that programmatic keyspace creation is not a best practice (it should be
done more or less manually, with extra care about schema mismatched
among nodes, etc). Removing this (usually unnecessary) operation from
the `__init__` path would also improve initialization performance
(shorter time).

We suggest, likewise, to remove the `__del__` method (which would close
the database connection), for the following reason: it is the
recommended best practice to create a single Cassandra `Session` object
throughout an application (it is a resource-heavy object capable to
handle concurrency internally), so in case Cassandra is used in other
ways by the app there is the risk of truncating the connection for all
usages when the history instance is destroyed. Moreover, the `Session`
object, in typical applications, is best left to garbage-collect itself
automatically.

As mentioned above, we defer the actual database I/O to the `cassIO`
library, which is designed to encode practices optimized for LLM
applications (among other) without the need to expose LangChain
developers to the internals of CQL (Cassandra Query Language). CassIO is
already employed by the LangChain's Vector Store support for Cassandra.

We added a few more connection options in the companion notebook example
(most notably, Astra DB) to encourage usage by anyone who cannot run
their own Cassandra cluster.

We surface the `ttl_seconds` option for automatic handling of an
expiration time to chat history messages, a likely useful feature given
that very old messages generally may lose their importance.

We elaborated a bit more on the integration testing (Time-to-live,
separation of "session ids", ...).

### Remarks from linter & co.

We reinstated `cassio` as a dependency both in the "optional" group and
in the "integration testing" group of `pyproject.toml`. This might not
be the right thing do to, in which case the author of this PR offer his
apologies (lack of confidence with Poetry - happy to be pointed in the
right direction, though!).

During linter tests, we were hit by some errors which appear unrelated
to the code in the PR. We left them here and report on them here for
awareness:

```
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:137: error: Argument 1 to "insert_many" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[Dict[str, Sequence[object]]]"; expected "Iterable[Union[MongoDBDocumentType, RawBSONDocument]]"  [arg-type]
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:186: error: Argument 1 to "aggregate" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[object]"; expected "Sequence[Mapping[str, Any]]"  [arg-type]

langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:16: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:19: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:20: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:22: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:23: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
```

In the same spirit, we observe that to even get `import langchain` run,
it seems that a `pip install bs4` is missing from the minimal package
installation path.

Thank you!

Catching File Exceptions in openpower-vpd-parser

In this commit, I have added code to handle file exceptions
more effectively. By implementing proper exception handling,
we can improve the robustness and reliability of the file
operations within our codebase.

Here are the key changes made in this commit:

 - Introduced a try-catch block around the file operations sections.
 - Within the try block, added code to perform the necessary file
   operations.
 - Implemented catch blocks to handle specific file exceptions.
 - In each catch block, included appropriate error handling logic,
   such as logging the error message or displaying a user-friendly
   error message.
 - Ensured that the catch blocks gracefully handle the exceptions
   and prevent the program from crashing or behaving unexpectedly.

By adding this exception handling code, we can anticipate and handle
potential file-related errors gracefully, providing a smoother
experience for users and preventing any unexpected crashes or data
loss. This would also aid in debugging issues.

Cosmetic changes to numerous recipes

This commit only touches recipes whose `:files' property contains an
`:exclude' element, because I had to look at all those recipes for an
only marginally related reason.

To an extend these changes only reflect my own personal preference, so
I will explain the types of changes I have made.  This should serve as
a starting point for a future discussion in case we want to encourage
a certain style or even enforce it.

- Lines should be intended as `indent-for-tab-command' would, except
  in special-cases such as in the recipe of `use-package', which is
  also a macro with special indentation rules; we override those
  because the `use-package' in use-package's recipe is not that macro,
  it is just a symbol appearing as the first element of a data list.

- I prefer it if there is a newline between the package symbol (the
  car) and the plist that follows, but usually only add it to existing
  recipes when lines would otherwise get to long.  I also do not
  change this if I am not making any other changes that affect more
  than one line.

- Either the complete list should be on a single line or each line
  should contain only one key/value pair.  The first pair may share a
  line with the package symbol (see previous point).  If the recipe
  needs more than one line, then two key/value pairs should never
  appear on one line.  Newline characters are cheap enough these days.

- `:fetcher' should come before `:url' or `:repo', not least because
  the former dictates which of the latter two is required/valid.  You
  can also think of the fetcher as the type or class of the recipe,
  which IMO should come first, like in code: (git-fetcher :url val).

- The most common keywords should be specified in this order:
  `:fetcher', `:url'/`:repo', `:files'.  Other keywords should go
  either before or after `:files' (but preferable not on both sides
  of that for any given recipe).

- A common value of `:files' is: (:defaults (:exclude "...")).
  This could be split across multiple lines, but writing everything
  on one line makes it easier to read it as 'use the defaults, except
  exclude "..."':

    :files (:defaults (:exclude "..."))

- If the value of `:files' is too long for one line, then place
  newlines "semantically", instead of trying to "save space".  For
  example any element that is a list should appear on its own line.
  Two sibling lists should never appear on the same line.  String
  siblings should also not appear on one line in many cases, though
  it might makes sense (but isn't my preference) to group them by
  "type" as in:

    (:defaults
     "foo/*.el" "bar/*.el"
     "docs/foo/*.texi" "docs/bar/*.texi"
     (:exclude "..."))

- While there may be multiple (:exclude ...) elements, I've merged
  them into one.  Mostly for future proofing.

- The position of `:exclude' elements in `:files' value is significant
  in theory.  However in most cases it already appears at the very end
  and I have moved it there in cases where the order is not
  significant.  Mostly for future proofing.

bpf: Add fd-based tcx multi-prog infra with link support

This work refactors and adds a lightweight extension ("tcx") to the tc BPF
ingress and egress data path side for allowing BPF program management based
on fds via bpf() syscall through the newly added generic multi-prog API.
The main goal behind this work which we also presented at LPC [0] last year
and a recent update at LSF/MM/BPF this year [3] is to support long-awaited
BPF link functionality for tc BPF programs, which allows for a model of safe
ownership and program detachment.

Given the rise in tc BPF users in cloud native environments, this becomes
necessary to avoid hard to debug incidents either through stale leftover
programs or 3rd party applications accidentally stepping on each others toes.
As a recap, a BPF link represents the attachment of a BPF program to a BPF
hook point. The BPF link holds a single reference to keep BPF program alive.
Moreover, hook points do not reference a BPF link, only the application's
fd or pinning does. A BPF link holds meta-data specific to attachment and
implements operations for link creation, (atomic) BPF program update,
detachment and introspection. The motivation for BPF links for tc BPF programs
is multi-fold, for example:

  - From Meta: "It's especially important for applications that are deployed
    fleet-wide and that don't "control" hosts they are deployed to. If such
    application crashes and no one notices and does anything about that, BPF
    program will keep running draining resources or even just, say, dropping
    packets. We at FB had outages due to such permanent BPF attachment
    semantics. With fd-based BPF link we are getting a framework, which allows
    safe, auto-detachable behavior by default, unless application explicitly
    opts in by pinning the BPF link." [1]

  - From Cilium-side the tc BPF programs we attach to host-facing veth devices
    and phys devices build the core datapath for Kubernetes Pods, and they
    implement forwarding, load-balancing, policy, EDT-management, etc, within
    BPF. Currently there is no concept of 'safe' ownership, e.g. we've recently
    experienced hard-to-debug issues in a user's staging environment where
    another Kubernetes application using tc BPF attached to the same prio/handle
    of cls_bpf, accidentally wiping all Cilium-based BPF programs from underneath
    it. The goal is to establish a clear/safe ownership model via links which
    cannot accidentally be overridden. [0,2]

BPF links for tc can co-exist with non-link attachments, and the semantics are
in line also with XDP links: BPF links cannot replace other BPF links, BPF
links cannot replace non-BPF links, non-BPF links cannot replace BPF links and
lastly only non-BPF links can replace non-BPF links. In case of Cilium, this
would solve mentioned issue of safe ownership model as 3rd party applications
would not be able to accidentally wipe Cilium programs, even if they are not
BPF link aware.

Earlier attempts [4] have tried to integrate BPF links into core tc machinery
to solve cls_bpf, which has been intrusive to the generic tc kernel API with
extensions only specific to cls_bpf and suboptimal/complex since cls_bpf could
be wiped from the qdisc also. Locking a tc BPF program in place this way, is
getting into layering hacks given the two object models are vastly different.

We instead implemented the tcx (tc 'express') layer which is an fd-based tc BPF
attach API, so that the BPF link implementation blends in naturally similar to
other link types which are fd-based and without the need for changing core tc
internal APIs. BPF programs for tc can then be successively migrated from classic
cls_bpf to the new tc BPF link without needing to change the program's source
code, just the BPF loader mechanics for attaching is sufficient.

For the current tc framework, there is no change in behavior with this change
and neither does this change touch on tc core kernel APIs. The gist of this
patch is that the ingress and egress hook have a lightweight, qdisc-less
extension for BPF to attach its tc BPF programs, in other words, a minimal
entry point for tc BPF. The name tcx has been suggested from discussion of
earlier revisions of this work as a good fit, and to more easily differ between
the classic cls_bpf attachment and the fd-based one.

For the ingress and egress tcx points, the device holds a cache-friendly array
with program pointers which is separated from control plane (slow-path) data.
Earlier versions of this work used priority to determine ordering and expression
of dependencies similar as with classic tc, but it was challenged that for
something more future-proof a better user experience is required. Hence this
resulted in the design and development of the generic attach/detach/query API
for multi-progs. See prior patch with its discussion on the API design. tcx is
the first user and later we plan to integrate also others, for example, one
candidate is multi-prog support for XDP which would benefit and have the same
'look and feel' from API perspective.

The goal with tcx is to have maximum compatibility to existing tc BPF programs,
so they don't need to be rewritten specifically. Compatibility to call into
classic tcf_classify() is also provided in order to allow successive migration
or both to cleanly co-exist where needed given its all one logical tc layer.
tcx supports the simplified return codes TCX_NEXT which is non-terminating (go
to next program) and terminating ones with TCX_PASS, TCX_DROP, TCX_REDIRECT.
The fd-based API is behind a static key, so that when unused the code is also
not entered. The struct tcx_entry's program array is currently static, but
could be made dynamic if necessary at a point in future. The a/b pair swap
design has been chosen so that for detachment there are no allocations which
otherwise could fail. The work has been tested with tc-testing selftest suite
which all passes, as well as the tc BPF tests from the BPF CI, and also with
Cilium's L4LB.

Kudos also to Nikolay Aleksandrov and Martin Lau for in-depth early reviews
of this work.

bpf: Add generic attach/detach/query API for multi-progs

This adds a generic layer called bpf_mprog which can be reused by different
attachment layers to enable multi-program attachment and dependency resolution.
In-kernel users of the bpf_mprog don't need to care about the dependency
resolution internals, they can just consume it with few API calls.

The initial idea of having a generic API sparked out of discussion [0] from an
earlier revision of this work where tc's priority was reused and exposed via
BPF uapi as a way to coordinate dependencies among tc BPF programs, similar
as-is for classic tc BPF. The feedback was that priority provides a bad user
experience and is hard to use [1], e.g.:

  I cannot help but feel that priority logic copy-paste from old tc, netfilter
  and friends is done because "that's how things were done in the past". [...]
  Priority gets exposed everywhere in uapi all the way to bpftool when it's
  right there for users to understand. And that's the main problem with it.

  The user don't want to and don't need to be aware of it, but uapi forces them
  to pick the priority. [...] Your cover letter [0] example proves that in
  real life different service pick the same priority. They simply don't know
  any better. Priority is an unnecessary magic that apps _have_ to pick, so
  they just copy-paste and everyone ends up using the same.

The course of the discussion showed more and more the need for a generic,
reusable API where the "same look and feel" can be applied for various other
program types beyond just tc BPF, for example XDP today does not have multi-
program support in kernel, but also there was interest around this API for
improving management of cgroup program types. Such common multi-program
management concept is useful for BPF management daemons or user space BPF
applications coordinating about their attachments.

Both from Cilium and Meta side [2], we've collected the following requirements
for a generic attach/detach/query API for multi-progs which has been implemented
as part of this work:

  - Support prog-based attach/detach and link API
  - Dependency directives (can also be combined):
    - BPF_F_{BEFORE,AFTER} with relative_{fd,id} which can be {prog,link,none}
      - BPF_F_ID flag as {fd,id} toggle
      - BPF_F_LINK flag as {prog,link} toggle
      - If relative_{fd,id} is none, then BPF_F_BEFORE will just prepend, and
        BPF_F_AFTER will just append for attaching
      - Enforced only at attach time
    - BPF_F_{FIRST,LAST}
      - Enforced throughout the bpf_mprog state's lifetime
      - Admin override possible (e.g. link detach, prog-based BPF_F_REPLACE)
    - If no flags are set, then it's default append behavior for attaching
  - Internal revision counter and optionally being able to pass expected_revision
  - User space daemon can query current state with revision, and pass it along
    for attachment to assert current state before doing updates
  - Query also gets extension for link_ids array and link_attach_flags:
    - prog_ids are always filled with program IDs
    - link_ids are filled with link IDs when link was used, otherwise 0
    - {prog,link}_attach_flags for holding {prog,link}-specific flags
  - Must be easy to integrate/reuse for in-kernel users

The uapi-side changes needed for supporting bpf_mprog are rather minimal,
consisting of the additions of the attachment flags, revision counter, and
expanding existing union with relative_{fd,id} member.

The bpf_mprog framework consists of an bpf_mprog_entry object which holds
an array of bpf_mprog_fp (fast-path structure) and bpf_mprog_cp (control-path
structure). Both have been separated, so that fast-path gets efficient packing
of bpf_prog pointers for maximum cache efficieny. Also, array has been chosen
instead of linked list or other structures to remove unnecessary indirections
for a fast point-to-entry in tc for BPF. The bpf_mprog_entry comes as a pair
via bpf_mprog_bundle so that in case of updates the peer bpf_mprog_entry
is populated and then just swapped which avoids additional allocations that
could otherwise fail, for example, in detach case. bpf_mprog_{fp,cp} arrays are
currently static, but they could be converted to dynamic allocation if necessary
at a point in future. Locking is deferred to the in-kernel user of bpf_mprog,
for example, in case of tcx which uses this API in the next patch, it piggy-
backs on rtnl. The nitty-gritty details are in the bpf_mprog_{replace,head_tail,
add,del} implementation and an extensive test suite for checking all aspects
of this API for prog-based attach/detach and link API as BPF selftests in
this series.

Kudos also to Andrii Nakryiko for API discussions wrt Meta's BPF management.

feat: allow canister imports of service constructors, silently ignoring the service arguments. (#4041)

Allow canister imports of service constructors, silently ignoring the service arguments. 

A hack that fixes #3990 (for some definition of fix) and duplicate #2319.

Really, dfx should be feeding the idl of the instantiated service, not service constructor, to dependent canisters, but until it's fixed to do so (and it hasn't been forever now), this is a reasonable and simple workaround, avoiding the error-prone and kludgy workaround of rewriting candid files described, for instance, here:

https://dfinityorg.notion.site/ckBTC-example-Encode-Hackathon-0aaf6292e3404dabb49df5d1b5abc797#08a7469beaf14d6ba35e8827e363e160

and also used here:

https://github.com/letmejustputthishere/ckbtc-payments

via npm scripting hacks (!).

Also see here for the pain this caused:

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/confusing-type-error-when-crossing-canisters-expression-of-type-mytype-cannot-produce-expected-type-mytype-1/20636

UPDATE: I turned the previous error into a warning to nag us to fix dfx.


UPDATE: Potentially obviated by https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/3138, which teaches dfx to strip the service argument.

UPDATE: @chenyan-dfinity thinks we should still merge for other scenarios (old dfx, new compiler, I guess).

Enable mousewheel when focusing on the map

Zooming with the mousewheel is useful when you want to use it, but
annoying when you don't want to.

Here we're taking an intermediary approach: by default, the mousewheel
isn't active, but it will be active after focusing on the map, so it can
be used both to scroll and to zoom.

This behavior presents usability issues, though, since we aren't making
users aware of the way the mousewheel works, and even if they were
aware, it could be confusing anyway. However, I currently think it's
better than always enabling or always disabling the mousewheel (might
change my mind, though).

Note that the "focus" event is only used on the map, so if we click on a
marker or navigate to a marker with the keyboard without focusing on the
map first, the mousewheel isn't enabled. The same would happen if we
used the "click" event.

We might use the Leaflet.GestureHandling plugin in the future to deal
with this issue and the scroll on touch screens.

performance: don't compile on hover on dev (#51830)

An annoying issue that slows down compilation times in dev for Next is
that we might trigger compilation of a page via hover on app.

We do this because we want the same experience in production and dev and
the prefetching is important for instantaneous loading states.

The alternative in this PR is that we don't prefetch at all anymore in
dev but instead, when we handle navigation, we can force a prefetch
navigation.

The slight compromise with this approach is that you can't test
prefetching anymore in dev.

Manually copy trailing attributes on a resize (#12637)

## THE WHITE WHALE

This is a fairly naive fix for this bug. It's not terribly performant,
but neither is resize in the first place.

When the buffer gets resized, typically we only copy the text up to the
`MeasureRight` point, the last printable char in the row. Then we'd just
use the last char's attributes to fill the remainder of the row.

Instead, this PR changes how reflow behaves when it gets to the end of
the row. After we finish copying text, then manually walk through the
attributes at the end of the row, and copy them over. This ensures that
cells that just have a colored space in them get copied into the new
buffer as well, and we don't just blat the last character's attributes
into the rest of the row. We'll do a similar thing once we get to the
last printable char in the buffer, copying the remaining attributes.

This could DEFINITELY be more performant. I think this current
implementation walks the attrs _on every cell_, then appends the new
attrs to the new ATTR_ROW. That could be optimized by just using the
actual iterator. The copy after the last printable char bit is also
especially bad in this regard. That could likely be a blind copy - I
just wanted to get this into the world.

Finally, we now copy the final attributes to the correct buffer: the new
one.  We used to copy them to the _old_ buffer, which we were about to
destroy.

## Validation

I'll add more gifs in the morning, not enough time to finish spinning a
release Terminal build with this tonight.

ð§¨ (revamp) NICE-43 Next RSC, Notion API, & Tailwind [b] [!] (#1621)

# â ï¸ Please Note

This is a bit bigger than I would want, but this is a complete refactor to better utilize a `Notion CMS` within a `Next 13 App` structure taking advantage of `RSC`. And then for good measure started the migration _back_ to `Tailwind` (but now I think `Stitches|Vanilla Extract` are oaky with Next 13).

â¨ NICE-43 revamp Next RSC, Notion API, & Tailwind

BREAKING CHANGE: New Notion Implementation through Next 13 RSC (App)

# Complete Refactor for Next RSC

- [x] Redis KV Cache
  - Good for quicker Vercel builds / and reducing Notion random limits
  - Next will still limit due to deduplicated requests
    - Sidenote: Need to get better at _not_ prop-drilling and just calling function again
- [x] Image Component
  - [x] Next Refactor
  - [x] Notion Refactor
- [x] Tailwind
  - [x] Move away from Stitches
  - [x] Temporary move to `@jeromefitz/ds` localized version
  - [x] Radix UI Refactor
  - [x] Use internal Component Library for now
- [x] Notion Refactor

  - [x] Image: Hosted by Notion Expiration Refresh
  - [x] Rely less on custom queries and manipulation, more on out of the box Notion API, React, and Next
    - [x] Move from `nodes` to more straight-forward components
    - [x] Refactor logic for
      - [x] `Column|ColumnList`
      - [x] `ListBulleted|ListItem|ListNumbered`
      - [x] `TextAnnotations`
    - [x] **New**: `Embed|Video`
      - [x] `Embed.Twitter` <= Twitter is self-imploding, so good timing.
      - [x] `Embed.YouTube` <= YouTube is ... no comment.

- [x] Next
  - [ ] `preload` => hold on this for now not working as expected
  - [x] `generateMetadata` => move away from `next-seo` (rip)
    - [ ] Need to re-incorporate `@vercel/og` -- or not temporarily.
  - [x] `generateStaticParams` => hack if `isDev` to stop running all the time :?
  - [x] `not-found` => Instead of customizing every route, use `notFound()`
  - [x] `robots.ts|sitemap.ts` => move away from `next-sitemap` (rip)
- [x] Package Upgrades
  - [x] Basically everything except `plaiceholder|semantic-release|syncpack`
- [x] Other refactors
  - [x] EmojiWrapper
  - [x] Config Packages
    - [x] `./packages/*` â this all needs to be ported to [`@jeromefitz/packages`](https://github.com/JeromeFitz/packages)
      - Was borderline impossible to do these in-tandem (need to get better at `pnpm linking`)
- [x] Fathom advises against custom domains now :/

## Layout

Not to be lost in the backend type stuff but this is a complete rehaul of presentation.

The eventual goal of this `Notion + Next` implementation is you can take the data in any way and display it as you would like. For now though still tightly coupled with a lot of decisions until I can abstract away further. Which -- at teh rate I am going may never happen.

## Notion

Do not "normalize" data from Notion, embrace it.

- This is the CMS why are we going through all the trouble to hack it
- Create new Block Components to match and mimic needs

### Formulas

The "big change" here is utilizing Notion Formulas in the CMS.

#### Slug

Before we had `Slug` now we populated `Slug.Preview` where we are able to have Notion mimic Routes better Server Side than figuring it all out on the fly in `next`.

**Note:** For `Events` we need to manually write the `Slug` for now. The potential clash of having multiple Headline Acts means we could have a url like:

- `../jerome-and,alex-o-jerome`

Which I think _could_ work because we could loop through but also _very_ confusing as a URL to share, haha.

To recap:

- `Slug.Preview` for example will create the matching Next Segment Route
  - Before: `jerome-and` (shows); After: `/shows/jerome-and`
  - Before: `jerome-and` (events); After: `/events/2023/06/16/jerome-and`
  - Before: `homepage` (pages); After: `/`

##### Date

Same here, instead of getting the data from Notion then running through `date-fns`, Notion uses `moment` (I think). So we can do more preparation which makes for a more straight-forward:

```bash
- Date: July 15, 2023 9:00PM
- Date.DayOfMonth: 15
- Date.DayOfMonthOrdinal: 15th
- Date.DayOfWeek: Saturday
- Date.DayOfWeekAbbr: Sat
- Date.DaysUntilEvent: 15
- Date.HoursUntilEvent: 360
- Date.ISO: 2023-07-15T21:00:00-04:00
- Date.Month: 07
- Date.MonthName: July
- Date.MonthNameAbbr: Jul
- Date.Time: 09:00 PM
- Date.Timezone: EDT
- Date.WeekNumber: 28
- Date.Year: 2023
```

## Next

### App

The gains of doing `[[...catchAll]]` for everything at **root** was not worth it. ð

Especially if we _want_ to be able to change layout, RSC data points and more based on the Segment (Notion Database Type).

So there is some duplication of code throughout but will look into better ways of lifting the "same" stuff.

### Events

Ability to see a range of events depending on Date (say for a week, or a weekend):

- `events/yyyy/mm/dd/to/yyyy/mm/dd`
- `events/2023/06/29/to/2023/07/02`

Props to Katie T. as we came up with this idea in a brainstorm session.

- `events/[from]/to/[to]`
- `events/2023/06/15/to/2023/06/18` (THU-SUN)
- `events/2023/06/29/to/2023/05/01` (Across Months)
- `events/2023/12/28/to/2025/01/07` (Across Years)

Probably need to do something for malformed dates, but I reckon `404` will do that.

Up next would be ideas for `Landing Pages`.

### In-House

`next-seo` and `next-sitemap` will eventually be absorded, or their functionality at least, within `next` itself. This gets the ball rolling on that. They were awesome, and thank you.

Depending on your use case those will still be very valid for use!

Hello the community

This is my first PR attempt.

So after reading this [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html#remove-services) and unsuccessfully trying to load my `service_test.php`, I've noticed that the `configureContainer(..)` function in the `MicroKernelTrait` file was not configured to automatically load this file.

So either we should fix the documentation, either we should fix the configuration.

Since this the [framework-bundle](https://github.com/symfony/framework-bundle) is backed by [Alximy](https://alximy.io) I figured it would be cool ð to try and fix ð the configuration.

Anyway share me your thoughts about what should be done !

And I wanted to say that php service configuration is ð¥ so shoutout to the one who did this (I think it's you `@nicolas`-grekas with this [PR](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/23834) right ? ðªð»)

Also big thanks to `@jeremyFreeAgent` for debugging this with me and `@HeahDude` for showing me the php service configuration PR.

gdb/testsuite: add test for core file with a 0 pid

This patch contains a test for this commit:

  commit c820c52a914cc9d7c63cb41ad396f4ddffff2196
  Date:   Fri Aug 6 19:45:58 2010 +0000

              * thread.c (add_thread_silent): Use null_ptid instead of
              minus_one_ptid while getting rid of stale inferior_ptid.

This is another test that has been carried in the Fedora GDB tree for
some time, and I thought that it would be worth merging to master.  I
don't believe there is any test like this currently in the testsuite.

The original issue was reported in this thread:

  https://inbox.sourceware.org/gdb-patches/AANLkTi=zuEDw6qiZ1jRatkdwHO99xF2Qu+WZ7i0EQjef@mail.gmail.com/

The problem was that when GDB was used to open a vmcore (core file)
image generated by the Linux kernel GDB would (sometimes) crash with
an assertion failure:

  thread.c:884: internal-error: switch_to_thread: Assertion `inf != NULL' failed.

To understand what's going on we need some background; a vmcore file
represents each processor core in the same way that a standard
application core file represents threads.  Thus, we might say, a
vmcore file represents cores as threads.

When writing a vmcore file, the kernel will store the pid of the
process currently running on that core as the thread's lwpid.

However, if a core is idle, with no process currently running on it,
then the lwpid for that thread is stored as 0 in the vmcore file.  If
multiple cores are idle then multiple threads will have a lwpid of 0.

Back in 2010, the original issue reported tried to change the kernel's
behaviour in this thread:

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/3/75

This change was rejected by the kernel team, the current
behaviour (lwpid of 0) was considered correct.  I've checked the
source of a recent kernel.  The code mentioned in the lkml.org posting
has moved, it's now in the function crash_save_cpu in the file
kernel/kexec_core.c, but the general behaviour is unchanged, an idle
core will have an lwpid of 0, so I think GDB still needs to be able to
handle this case.

When GDB loads a vmcore file (which is handled just like any other
core file) the sections are processed in core_open to generate the
threads for the core file.  The processing is done by calling
add_to_thread_list, a function which looks for sections named .reg/NN
where NN is the lwpid of the thread, GDB then builds a ptid_t for the
new thread and calls add_thread.

Remember, in our case the lwpid is 0.  Now for the first thread this
is fine, if a little weird, 0 isn't usually a valid lwpid, but that's
OK, GDB creates a thread with lwpid of 0 and carries on.

When we find the next thread (core) with lwpid of 0, we attempt to
create another thread with an lwpid of 0.  This of course clashes with
the previously created thread, they have the same ptid_t, so GDB tries
to delete the first thread.

And it was within this thread delete code that we triggered a bug
which would then cause GDB to assert -- when deleting we tried to
switch to a thread with minus_one_ptid, this resulted in a call to
find_inferior_pid (passing in minus_one_ptid's pid, which is -1), the
find_inferior_pid call fails and returns NULL, which then triggered an
assert in switch_to_thread.

The actual details of the why the assert triggered are really not
important.  What's important (I think) is that a vmcore file might
have this interesting lwpid of 0 characteristic, which isn't something
we see in "normal" application core files, and it is this that I think
we should be testing.

Now, you might be thinking: isn't deleting the first thread the wrong
thing to do?  If the vmcore file has two threads that represent two
cores, and both have an lwpid of 0 (indicating both cores are idle),
then surely GDB should still represent this as two threads?  You're
not wrong.  This was mentioned by Pedro in the original GDB mailing
list thread here:

  https://inbox.sourceware.org/gdb-patches/201008061057.03037.pedro@codesourcery.com/

This is indeed a problem, and this problem is still present in GDB
today.  I plan to try and address this in a later commit, however,
this first commit is about getting a test in place to confirm that GDB
at a minimum doesn't crash when loading such a vmcore file.

And so, finally, what's in this commit?

This commit contains a new test.  The test doesn't actually contain a
vmcore file.  Instead I've created a standard application core file
that contains two threads, and then manually edited the core file to
set the lwpid of each thread to 0.

To further reduce the size of the core file (as it will be stored in
git), I've zeroed all of the LOAD-able segments in the core file.
This test really doesn't care about that part of the core file, we
only really care about loading the register's, this is enough to
confirm that the GDB doesn't crash.

Obviously as the core file is pre-generated, this test is architecture
specific.  There are already a few tests in gdb.arch/ that include
pre-generate core files.  Just as those existing tests do, I've
compressed the core file with bzip2, which reduces it to just 750
bytes.  I have structured the test so that if/when this patch is
merged I can add some additional core files for other architectures,
however, these are not included in this commit.

The test simply expands the core file, and then loads it into GDB.
One interesting thing to note is that GDB reports the core file
loading like this:

  (gdb) core-file ./gdb/testsuite/outputs/gdb.arch/core-file-pid0/core-file-pid0.x86-64.core
  [New process 1]
  [New process 1]
  Failed to read a valid object file image from memory.
  Core was generated by `./segv-mt'.
  Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  The current thread has terminated
  (gdb)

There's two interesting things here: first, the repeated "New process
1" message.  This is caused because linux_core_pid_to_str reports
anything with an lwpid of 0 as a process, rather than an LWP.  And
second, the "The current thread has terminated" message.  This is
because the first thread in the core file is the current thread, but
when GDB loads the second thread (which also has lwpid 0) this causes
the first thread to be deleted, as a result GDB thinks that the
current (first) thread has terminated.

As I said previously, both of these problems are a result of the lwpid
0 aliasing, which is not being fixed in this commit -- this commit is
just confirming that GDB doesn't crash when loading this core file.

[geometry] Add Meshcat::GetRealtimeRate (#19700)

Tidy up recent Meshcat changes:
- Add missing pydrake bindings.
- Strongly prefer testing the public API (eschew test-friendship hacks).
  We want to guard against regressions in the end-user experience;
  using private API goes against that goal.
- Fix indentation, typos, and eschew abbreviation.

The Twinkleshine is a CyberSun-made Syndicate display of force, staffed
by every branch of the Syndicate. Despite the silly name, the presence
of one in a sector implies it to be of importance to the Syndicate, and
enemies within sight can only pray that the Twinkleshine crew are
incompetent enough to shoot themselves with their own weaponry (or blow
themselves up with the supermatter on-board).

It is staffed by:

- 1 Captain
- 1 Lieutenant (previously the Operative - serves as a warden/hos)
- 2 Medics
- 2 Engineers (previously the Mechanics)
- 5 Operatives (previously the Troopers)
- 1 Bartender
- 1 Miner
- 2 Deck Assistants

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is

## Why It's Good For The Game

Few days ago, an admin spawned a Twinkleshine, and I got to captain it.
The Twinkleshine is old. It sucks. This, hopefully, fixes that.

Originally, this was going to be minor fixes, but ended up becoming an
attempt at reworking the ship to a more modern state - the hull has been
redone and is mostly symmetrical, the old spacepod was replaced with a
Dark Gygax, the supermatter shouldn't be activated upon spawning the
ship, there's more turf decals and a bigger lot-of-things, added a
bartender and a miner, people can actually tell who they are and what
they do, and there is now a box moth. Rejoice.

Also, this is the first time I've ever mapped a ship. What better way to
begin with a giant battleship?

Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited (#76492)

## About The Pull Request
This is one of those "can I get away with making a change I want" PRs.

I actually didn't know this had been changed before as it's not exactly
something I mess with often, but I really think it sucks. Plasma stuff
is supposed to ignite and cause fires, not explode (unless in a TTV). I
noticed this when I was poking around and found out that apparently
Disco Inferno just explodes now instead of setting on fire which also
sucks.

I figure there's a few fixes for this problem:

1) Nerf how hard plasma stuff explodes. This is an option, but I kind of
dislike that it does it at all more than anything. The biggest issue is
that just the regular statues explode with 20 LIGHT, which is pretty
fucking massive and basically just delimbs everyone around. I'd have to
nerf it HARD for it to get anywhere near what I think is acceptable.
2) Make a snowflake version of the statue that just ignites on hit with
a torch. I also don't like this because it'll make people think the
regular statues don't explode.
3) This option, which I think is cleaner and just makes sense compared
to the others.

I don't know if @vincentiusvin still codes, but as far as I can tell
this was their doing, so it's only fair they get to speak up.

Fixes #71894

## Why It's Good For The Game
I don't like it, I think it goes against what we're used to for plasma
stuff (that it starts fires, not makes explosions) and it makes one of
my favorite shuttles boring and stupid. That being said, I'm honestly
not going to fight for this too hard if a lot of people like it, but I
am - as always - open to alternatives.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
del: Plasma objects (statues, toilets, etc.) no longer explode when
ignited. They just release plasma like everything else plasma. (This
doesn't impact injecting plasma into cells or dipping cigars in plasma,
those still explode.)

This doesn't make sense in a world where post-registration SASL is
allowed, and should fix one case of an annoying login desync that's seen
in the real world.

Specifically, when a client sends its final AUTHENTICATE and Atheme
receives it, it sends an SVSLOGIN for that client. If the client sends
us its CAP END *before* we see the SVSLOGIN, the implicit abort will try
to abort the SASL session that's already succeeded.

Atheme interprets this as an instruction to forget about the successful
SASL session; you'll connect unidentified. But it's already sent
SVSLOGIN, which will log the client in ircd-side, causing ircd and
services views to differ until the user authenticates again manually.

I think allowing a SASL session to be aborted when it has already
succeeded is an Atheme bug, and it can still be triggered without this
change. But our behaviour here seems silly anyway.

Inventory enhancement shared pointers (#8)

* Starting implementation of GameState object (#7)

* Add files via upload

* Started implementing the Game State object.

- GameState time. I started by moving the prepLoop inventories and GameObjects into the GameState object. I relearned a couple of things while doing. One I don't think I've dealt with since my first coding classes at Everett Community College, the other is something I've been kinda dreading.
- The first thing: Relearning about Constructor Initializer Lists. In my GS_Campaign class I need to have some Inventories. However, the constructor for those inventories need to be called in order to create them properly. So I couldn't simply declare it as "Inventory equipmentInv;" and start using it. It needs to call the Inventory(string name) constuructor. That simple declaration on the header file doesn't cut it. Previously, I had this done as part of the declaration in the header file.  it was "Inventory equipmentInv = Inventory("Equipment")". This would call the constructor properly. However, this is apparently not best practice. You don't want to do constructor calls as part of your declerations in your class header files. According to ChatGPT, the benefits are:
	- Improved performance: Initializing member variables in the constructor initialization list can be more efficient than initializing them in the constructor body, especially for complex objects.
	- Consistent initialization: Initialization lists ensure that member variables are always initialized to a valid state, even if an exception is thrown during construction.
	- Cleaner code: Initialization lists can make the code easier to read and understand, especially for classes with many member variables.
- I don't exactly know what it is more effecient, but I am sold none-the-less. Similar to doing the std:: namespace thing. It may feel weird at first, but I should get use to it and just make it part of how I opperate.
- Now, I will only put the declaration of the member variable in the header page Inventory equipmentInv. And then in the constructor, you would do this:
	GS_Campaign::GS_Campaign() :
	equipmentInv("Equipment")
	{};
- The other issue that came up (the thing I've been kinda dreading or at least was hoping to avoid) would be memory management involved in maintaining gameObjects. In order for my gameState to be able to create objects in its constructor and then also access those later, I need them to not be destroyed in the constructor. To do this, I have to use the "new" keyword, which allocates memory on the heap. However, that will also mean that I'm on the hook for deleting them. Now, I'm already planning on passing that object around mostly by pointer. In fact, Inventory is set up hold pointers. The easiest way to do this will be to use shared pointers. AKA smart pointers. These will maintain the object so long as the object has an existing reference pointing to it. If all of the pointers are destroyed, then the object will also be destroyed. Which is what I want. The question is going to be, how are these shared pointers going to be created?

* Converted Inventory.inv from ptrs to shared_ptrs.

- OK, today I'm going to try and change my Inventory class over from a list of regular pointers, to a list of shared_pointers or smart pointers as they are called. I had initially avoided these when I started, as I didn't quite understand why they were different. However, they have a major benefit over regular pointers, in that, when an object is created with a shared pointer, the shared pointer will keep track of how many other pointers are pointing to it. When there are no more pointers pointing to the object, the object will be destroyed. This is great, because for the GameState class to maintain objects, it needs to use the 'new' keyword and add them to the heap. The only way to get those objects off the heap is to destroy them. I could try to create some grand scheme for how this will work, but I don't actually need to, I can just let the shared pointers do that. Currently, the Inventory class keeps track of all it's objects as regular pointers, which means that I would have to handle destroying them. However, if I move them to shared pointers, then the objects will destroy themselves. So that's what we are gonna do.
- To do this, I'm going to need a new library that I have not used called <memory>.
- That was actually really easy! All I had to do was change the function declarations and definitions and the declaration of the objects themselves. I also streamlined the declaration of the objects in GS_Campaign so that I'm not declaring the obj first, then passing it. Now I declare it directly in the argument, which means I don't have an extra pointer inside of GS_Campaign.
- I would get into the techical details, but there really isn't that much difference between this and regular pointers. I just had to ask chatGPT a couple of syntax questions and now it's working.
