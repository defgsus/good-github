Loads Away Missions for Unit Testing (#76245)

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

A pretty bad bug (#76226) got through, but it was fixed pretty quickly
in #76241 (cf92862daf339e97c76b52c91f31d49ba5113bd4). I realized that if
we were testing all the away missions, that this could theoretically get
caught and not happen again. Regardless, unit testing gateway missions
has been on my to-do list for a while now, and I finally got it nailed
down.

Basically, we just have a really small "station" map with the bare bones
(_teeny_ bit of fluff, maploading is going to take 30 seconds tops
anyways let me have my kicks) with a JSON map datum flag that causes it
to load all away missions in the codebase (which are all in one folder).
Just in case some admins were planning on invoking the proc on
`SSmapping`, I also decided to gate a `tgui_alert()` behind it because
you never can be too sure of what people think is funny these days (it
really does lock up your game for a second or so at a time).

I also alphabetized the maps.txt config because that was annoying me.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Things that break on production could(?) be caught in unit testing? I
don't know if the linked issue I mentioned above would have been caught
in retrospect, but it's likely to catch more than a few upcoming bugs
(like the UO45 atmospherics thing at the very top) and ensure that these
gateway missions, which tend to be the most neglected part of mapping,
stay bug-free.

This is also helpful in case someone makes a new away mission and wants
to see if stuff's broken. Helps out maptainers a bit because very, very
technically broken mapping will throw up runtimes. Neato.
## Changelog
Nothing that players should be concerned about.

Let me know if there's a better way to approach this, but I really think
that having a super-duper light map with the bare basics to load up
gateway missions and then all nine-ish gateway missions can sequentially
load during init. I can't think of a better way to do it aside from some
really ugly `#ifdef` shit. Also also, it has the added benefit of being
a map that will always load your away mission without touching a single
shred of config (and it's not likely to break if you follow sane
practices such as making your own areas)

New space ambient track (#76547)

## About The Pull Request

Adds a new space ambient track made by me to the game, supposed to be a
bit scarier than the others that were recently added as I feel that
they're a bit too happy (not to diss I really like them), also cleaned
up a bit of ambience.dm as the medical portion of it didn't follow the
same rules as the other ones. also also this will only be used for
tgstation so license wise I think this is CC BY-SA 3.0 but I'm not sure
so correct me if I'm wrong, also this is my first PR so yeah. Here's a
link to listen to the track https://voca.ro/18WvrGORDDdR

## Why It's Good For The Game

Variety is the spice of life.

## Changelog

:cl:
sound: A new ambient track will now play in space

Various spider fixes (#76528)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #76484
Then I noticed some weird stuff which slipped through the PR and poked
at that too.

- Spiderlings and Spiders once more have names ending in (###)
- Removed an unused property on Spiderlings.
- Rewrote the descriptions for a bunch of web-abilities and web-objects
to be clearer and have better capitalisation.
- Refactored the "Web Carcass" ability to not extend from "lay web" as
it didn't need to perform most of that behaviour.
- Also I renamed it and made the description give you a hint about why
you would want to instantly spawn a statue.
- The web effigy now despawns at the same rate as the ability cools down
so you're not dumping spider statues all over the place.
- I made spiderlings move at about the same speed as humans except if
they're on webs in which case they're still pretty fast.

To be honest I am not certain an instant statue spawning button is great
to begin with and I didn't even know it was added to the game but I am
not interested in messing much with the balance for now.

This made me look at spiderlings enough that I'm going to try and make a
new sprite for them that isn't awful.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Lets you differentiate individual spiders a little bit.
Makes usage of abilities clearer.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Guard spider web statues despawn as the ability comes back off
cooldown.
balance: Spiderlings now only move at light speed if they're on webs,
stay safe little guys.
fix: Spiders once again have random numbers after their names.

Improved spider web AI (#76637)

## About The Pull Request

The AI I coded for spiders deciding where to make webs when they aren't
otherwise occupied would do so by finding the _closest_ valid tile,
which seemed like a good idea at the time. The problem with that is that
the "closest" algorithm we use has a predictable search pattern which
meant that spiders would always predictably make a diagonal line of webs
pointing South West, which looked very silly.
I've rewritten how they pick targets to introduce some randomness, which
causes them to properly spread out and make a nicer-looking structure:
which serves purely to annoy spacemen who need to pass through this
area.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/cb01828f-7653-4010-a4f5-2abc6e10b630)

I'll be honest I mostly did this while bored waiting for other PRs which
I require for my other branch to get merged.

## Why It's Good For The Game

This probably only annoyed me to be quite honest and if you left one
alone for long enough it would fill enough space that you couldn't tell
anyway, but it does look nicer now.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: AI-controlled spiders will make more web-shaped webs.

bevy_audio: ECS-based API redesign (#8424)

# Objective

Improve the `bevy_audio` API to make it more user-friendly and
ECS-idiomatic. This PR is a first-pass at addressing some of the most
obvious (to me) problems. In the interest of keeping the scope small,
further improvements can be done in future PRs.

The current `bevy_audio` API is very clunky to work with, due to how it
(ab)uses bevy assets to represent audio sinks.

The user needs to write a lot of boilerplate (accessing
`Res<Assets<AudioSink>>`) and deal with a lot of cognitive overhead
(worry about strong vs. weak handles, etc.) in order to control audio
playback.

Audio playback is initiated via a centralized `Audio` resource, which
makes it difficult to keep track of many different sounds playing in a
typical game.

Further, everything carries a generic type parameter for the sound
source type, making it difficult to mix custom sound sources (such as
procedurally generated audio or unofficial formats) with regular audio
assets.

Let's fix these issues.

## Solution

Refactor `bevy_audio` to a more idiomatic ECS API. Remove the `Audio`
resource. Do everything via entities and components instead.

Audio playback data is now stored in components:
- `PlaybackSettings`, `SpatialSettings`, `Handle<AudioSource>` are now
components. The user inserts them to tell Bevy to play a sound and
configure the initial playback parameters.
- `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of special
magical "asset" types. They are inserted by Bevy when it actually begins
playing the sound, and can be queried for by the user in order to
control the sound during playback.

Bundles: `AudioBundle` and `SpatialAudioBundle` are available to make it
easy for users to play sounds. Spawn an entity with one of these bundles
(or insert them to a complex entity alongside other stuff) to play a
sound.

Each entity represents a sound to be played.

There is also a new "auto-despawn" feature (activated using
`PlaybackSettings`), which, if enabled, tells Bevy to despawn entities
when the sink playback finishes. This allows for "fire-and-forget" sound
playback. Users can simply
spawn entities whenever they want to play sounds and not have to worry
about leaking memory.

## Unsolved Questions

I think the current design is *fine*. I'd be happy for it to be merged.
It has some possibly-surprising usability pitfalls, but I think it is
still much better than the old `bevy_audio`. Here are some discussion
questions for things that we could further improve. I'm undecided on
these questions, which is why I didn't implement them. We should decide
which of these should be addressed in this PR, and what should be left
for future PRs. Or if they should be addressed at all.

### What happens when sounds start playing?

Currently, the audio sink components are inserted and the bundle
components are kept. Should Bevy remove the bundle components? Something
else?

The current design allows an entity to be reused for playing the same
sound with the same parameters repeatedly. This is a niche use case I'd
like to be supported, but if we have to give it up for a simpler design,
I'd be fine with that.

### What happens if users remove any of the components themselves?

As described above, currently, entities can be reused. Removing the
audio sink causes it to be "detached" (I kept the old `Drop` impl), so
the sound keeps playing. However, if the audio bundle components are not
removed, Bevy will detect this entity as a "queued" sound entity again
(has the bundle compoenents, without a sink component), just like before
playing the sound the first time, and start playing the sound again.

This behavior might be surprising? Should we do something different?

### Should mutations to `PlaybackSettings` be applied to the audio sink?

We currently do not do that. `PlaybackSettings` is just for the initial
settings when the sound starts playing. This is clearly documented.

Do we want to keep this behavior, or do we want to allow users to use
`PlaybackSettings` instead of `AudioSink`/`SpatialAudioSink` to control
sounds during playback too?

I think I prefer for them to be kept separate. It is not a bad mental
model once you understand it, and it is documented.

### Should `AudioSink` and `SpatialAudioSink` be unified into a single
component type?

They provide a similar API (via the `AudioSinkPlayback` trait) and it
might be annoying for users to have to deal with both of them. The
unification could be done using an enum that is matched on internally by
the methods. Spatial audio has extra features, so this might make it
harder to access. I think we shouldn't.

### Automatic synchronization of spatial sound properties from
Transforms?

Should Bevy automatically apply changes to Transforms to spatial audio
entities? How do we distinguish between listener and emitter? Which one
does the transform represent? Where should the other one come from?

Alternatively, leave this problem for now, and address it in a future
PR. Or do nothing, and let users deal with it, as shown in the
`spatial_audio_2d` and `spatial_audio_3d` examples.

---

## Changelog

Added:
- `AudioBundle`/`SpatialAudioBundle`, add them to entities to play
sounds.

Removed:
 - The `Audio` resource.
 - `AudioOutput` is no longer `pub`.

Changed:
 - `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of assets.

## Migration Guide

// TODO: write a more detailed migration guide, after the "unsolved
questions" are answered and this PR is finalized.

Before:

```rust

/// Need to store handles somewhere
#[derive(Resource)]
struct MyMusic {
    sink: Handle<AudioSink>,
}

fn play_music(
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    audio: Res<Audio>,
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mut commands: Commands,
) {
    let weak_handle = audio.play_with_settings(
        asset_server.load("music.ogg"),
        PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5),
    );
    // upgrade to strong handle and store it
    commands.insert_resource(MyMusic {
        sink: audio_sinks.get_handle(weak_handle),
    });
}

fn toggle_pause_music(
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mymusic: Option<Res<MyMusic>>,
) {
    if let Some(mymusic) = &mymusic {
        if let Some(sink) = audio_sinks.get(&mymusic.sink) {
            sink.toggle();
        }
    }
}
```

Now:

```rust
/// Marker component for our music entity
#[derive(Component)]
struct MyMusic;

fn play_music(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
) {
    commands.spawn((
        AudioBundle::from_audio_source(asset_server.load("music.ogg"))
            .with_settings(PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5)),
        MyMusic,
    ));
}

fn toggle_pause_music(
    // `AudioSink` will be inserted by Bevy when the audio starts playing
    query_music: Query<&AudioSink, With<MyMusic>>,
) {
    if let Ok(sink) = query.get_single() {
        sink.toggle();
    }
}
```

Bots no longer require PAIs to become sapient (#76691)

## About The Pull Request

We were talking in the coder channel about what the role of a pAI is,
with a general conclusion that as the name would suggest they should be
_personal assistants_.
This means they should be sticking around their owner, not wandering
away as a holochassis or in the body of a bot.
The former is a matter for a future PR, the latter I am addressing here.

What we also discussed is that clearly some people _want_ to respawn as
a weird quasi-useless mob which wanders aimlessly around the station.
That seems like a fine thing to exist, but it shouldn't be a pAI.

Resultingly: pAI cards can no longer be placed inside bots.
However, you also no longer need to place pAI cards inside bots in order
for them to become sapient, it's a simple toggle on the bot control
menu. Enabling this option will poll ghosts
Toggling the "personality matrix" off while a bot is being controlled by
a ghost will ghost them again, so if they're annoying they're not that
hard to get rid of.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/ec14c2f2-3c0f-4f03-9dfc-22abca00a477)

Mobs which couldn't have a pAI inserted don't have this option.
Specifically securitrons, ED-209, and Hygienebots (for some reason).

Perhaps most controversially, any bots which are present on the station
when the map loads will have this setting enabled by default. We will
see if players abuse this too much and need their toys taken away, I am
hoping they can be trusted.

Additionally, as part of this change, mobs you can possess now appear in
the spawners menu.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/7c505471-43de-4e4e-89a5-877dc3086684)
Here is an unusually populated example.

Oh also in the process of doing this I turned the regal rat "click this
to become it" behaviour into a component because it seems generally
useful.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Minor stuff for dead players to do if they want to interact with living
players instead of observe.
Shift pAI back into a more intended role as a personal assistant who
hangs around with their owner, rather than just a generic respawn role.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: PAIs can no longer be inserted into Bots
add: Bots can now have their sapience toggled by anyone with access to
their settings panel
add: Bots which exist on the map at the start of the round automatically
have this setting enabled
qol: Bots, Regal Rats, and Cargorilla now appear in the Spawners menu if
you are dead
qol: Bots can be renamed from their maintenance panel

bpf: Add fd-based tcx multi-prog infra with link support

This work refactors and adds a lightweight extension ("tcx") to the tc BPF
ingress and egress data path side for allowing BPF program management based
on fds via bpf() syscall through the newly added generic multi-prog API.
The main goal behind this work which we also presented at LPC [0] last year
and a recent update at LSF/MM/BPF this year [3] is to support long-awaited
BPF link functionality for tc BPF programs, which allows for a model of safe
ownership and program detachment.

Given the rise in tc BPF users in cloud native environments, this becomes
necessary to avoid hard to debug incidents either through stale leftover
programs or 3rd party applications accidentally stepping on each others toes.
As a recap, a BPF link represents the attachment of a BPF program to a BPF
hook point. The BPF link holds a single reference to keep BPF program alive.
Moreover, hook points do not reference a BPF link, only the application's
fd or pinning does. A BPF link holds meta-data specific to attachment and
implements operations for link creation, (atomic) BPF program update,
detachment and introspection. The motivation for BPF links for tc BPF programs
is multi-fold, for example:

  - From Meta: "It's especially important for applications that are deployed
    fleet-wide and that don't "control" hosts they are deployed to. If such
    application crashes and no one notices and does anything about that, BPF
    program will keep running draining resources or even just, say, dropping
    packets. We at FB had outages due to such permanent BPF attachment
    semantics. With fd-based BPF link we are getting a framework, which allows
    safe, auto-detachable behavior by default, unless application explicitly
    opts in by pinning the BPF link." [1]

  - From Cilium-side the tc BPF programs we attach to host-facing veth devices
    and phys devices build the core datapath for Kubernetes Pods, and they
    implement forwarding, load-balancing, policy, EDT-management, etc, within
    BPF. Currently there is no concept of 'safe' ownership, e.g. we've recently
    experienced hard-to-debug issues in a user's staging environment where
    another Kubernetes application using tc BPF attached to the same prio/handle
    of cls_bpf, accidentally wiping all Cilium-based BPF programs from underneath
    it. The goal is to establish a clear/safe ownership model via links which
    cannot accidentally be overridden. [0,2]

BPF links for tc can co-exist with non-link attachments, and the semantics are
in line also with XDP links: BPF links cannot replace other BPF links, BPF
links cannot replace non-BPF links, non-BPF links cannot replace BPF links and
lastly only non-BPF links can replace non-BPF links. In case of Cilium, this
would solve mentioned issue of safe ownership model as 3rd party applications
would not be able to accidentally wipe Cilium programs, even if they are not
BPF link aware.

Earlier attempts [4] have tried to integrate BPF links into core tc machinery
to solve cls_bpf, which has been intrusive to the generic tc kernel API with
extensions only specific to cls_bpf and suboptimal/complex since cls_bpf could
be wiped from the qdisc also. Locking a tc BPF program in place this way, is
getting into layering hacks given the two object models are vastly different.

We instead implemented the tcx (tc 'express') layer which is an fd-based tc BPF
attach API, so that the BPF link implementation blends in naturally similar to
other link types which are fd-based and without the need for changing core tc
internal APIs. BPF programs for tc can then be successively migrated from classic
cls_bpf to the new tc BPF link without needing to change the program's source
code, just the BPF loader mechanics for attaching is sufficient.

For the current tc framework, there is no change in behavior with this change
and neither does this change touch on tc core kernel APIs. The gist of this
patch is that the ingress and egress hook have a lightweight, qdisc-less
extension for BPF to attach its tc BPF programs, in other words, a minimal
entry point for tc BPF. The name tcx has been suggested from discussion of
earlier revisions of this work as a good fit, and to more easily differ between
the classic cls_bpf attachment and the fd-based one.

For the ingress and egress tcx points, the device holds a cache-friendly array
with program pointers which is separated from control plane (slow-path) data.
Earlier versions of this work used priority to determine ordering and expression
of dependencies similar as with classic tc, but it was challenged that for
something more future-proof a better user experience is required. Hence this
resulted in the design and development of the generic attach/detach/query API
for multi-progs. See prior patch with its discussion on the API design. tcx is
the first user and later we plan to integrate also others, for example, one
candidate is multi-prog support for XDP which would benefit and have the same
'look and feel' from API perspective.

The goal with tcx is to have maximum compatibility to existing tc BPF programs,
so they don't need to be rewritten specifically. Compatibility to call into
classic tcf_classify() is also provided in order to allow successive migration
or both to cleanly co-exist where needed given its all one logical tc layer and
the tcx plus classic tc cls/act build one logical overall processing pipeline.

tcx supports the simplified return codes TCX_NEXT which is non-terminating (go
to next program) and terminating ones with TCX_PASS, TCX_DROP, TCX_REDIRECT.
The fd-based API is behind a static key, so that when unused the code is also
not entered. The struct tcx_entry's program array is currently static, but
could be made dynamic if necessary at a point in future. The a/b pair swap
design has been chosen so that for detachment there are no allocations which
otherwise could fail.

The work has been tested with tc-testing selftest suite which all passes, as
well as the tc BPF tests from the BPF CI, and also with Cilium's L4LB.

Kudos also to Nikolay Aleksandrov and Martin Lau for in-depth early reviews
of this work.

bpf: Add generic attach/detach/query API for multi-progs

This adds a generic layer called bpf_mprog which can be reused by different

In-kernel users of the bpf_mprog don't need to care about the dependency
resolution internals, they can just consume it with few API calls.

The initial idea of having a generic API sparked out of discussion [0] from an
earlier revision of this work where tc's priority was reused and exposed via
BPF uapi as a way to coordinate dependencies among tc BPF programs, similar
as-is for classic tc BPF. The feedback was that priority provides a bad user
experience and is hard to use [1], e.g.:

  I cannot help but feel that priority logic copy-paste from old tc, netfilter
  and friends is done because "that's how things were done in the past". [...]
  Priority gets exposed everywhere in uapi all the way to bpftool when it's
  right there for users to understand. And that's the main problem with it.

  The user don't want to and don't need to be aware of it, but uapi forces them
  to pick the priority. [...] Your cover letter [0] example proves that in
  real life different service pick the same priority. They simply don't know
  any better. Priority is an unnecessary magic that apps _have_ to pick, so
  they just copy-paste and everyone ends up using the same.

The course of the discussion showed more and more the need for a generic,
reusable API where the "same look and feel" can be applied for various other
program types beyond just tc BPF, for example XDP today does not have multi-
program support in kernel, but also there was interest around this API for
improving management of cgroup program types. Such common multi-program
management concept is useful for BPF management daemons or user space BPF
applications coordinating internally about their attachments.

Both from Cilium and Meta side [2], we've collected the following requirements
for a generic attach/detach/query API for multi-progs which has been implemented
as part of this work:

  - Support prog-based attach/detach and link API
  - Dependency directives (can also be combined):
    - BPF_F_{BEFORE,AFTER} with relative_{fd,id} which can be {prog,link,none}
      - BPF_F_ID flag as {fd,id} toggle; the rationale for id is so that user
        space application does not need CAP_SYS_ADMIN to retrieve foreign fds
        via bpf_*_get_fd_by_id()
      - BPF_F_LINK flag as {prog,link} toggle
      - If relative_{fd,id} is none, then BPF_F_BEFORE will just prepend, and
        BPF_F_AFTER will just append for attaching
      - Enforced only at attach time
    - BPF_F_REPLACE with replace_bpf_fd which can be prog, links have their
      own infra for replacing their internal prog
    - If no flags are set, then it's default append behavior for attaching
  - Internal revision counter and optionally being able to pass expected_revision
  - User space application can query current state with revision, and pass it
    along for attachment to assert current state before doing updates
  - Query also gets extension for link_ids array and link_attach_flags:
    - prog_ids are always filled with program IDs
    - link_ids are filled with link IDs when link was used, otherwise 0
    - {prog,link}_attach_flags for holding {prog,link}-specific flags
  - Must be easy to integrate/reuse for in-kernel users

The uapi-side changes needed for supporting bpf_mprog are rather minimal,
consisting of the additions of the attachment flags, revision counter, and
expanding existing union with relative_{fd,id} member.

The bpf_mprog framework consists of an bpf_mprog_entry object which holds
an array of bpf_mprog_fp (fast-path structure). The bpf_mprog_cp (control-path
structure) is part of bpf_mprog_bundle. Both have been separated, so that
fast-path gets efficient packing of bpf_prog pointers for maximum cache
efficiency. Also, array has been chosen instead of linked list or other
structures to remove unnecessary indirections for a fast point-to-entry in
tc for BPF.

The bpf_mprog_entry comes as a pair via bpf_mprog_bundle so that in case of
updates the peer bpf_mprog_entry is populated and then just swapped which
avoids additional allocations that could otherwise fail, for example, in
detach case. bpf_mprog_{fp,cp} arrays are currently static, but they could
be converted to dynamic allocation if necessary at a point in future.
Locking is deferred to the in-kernel user of bpf_mprog, for example, in case
of tcx which uses this API in the next patch, it piggybacks on rtnl.

An extensive test suite for checking all aspects of this API for prog-based
attach/detach and link API comes as BPF selftests in this series.

Kudos also to Andrii Nakryiko for API discussions wrt Meta's BPF management.

http: support CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR

The CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS (and matching CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS) flag was
deprecated in curl 7.85.0, and using it generate compiler warnings as of
curl 7.87.0. The path forward is to use CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR, but we
can't just do so unilaterally, as it was only introduced less than a
year ago in 7.85.0.

Until that version becomes ubiquitous, we have to either disable the
deprecation warning or conditionally use the "STR" variant on newer
versions of libcurl. This patch switches to the new variant, which is
nice for two reasons:

  - we don't have to worry that silencing curl's deprecation warnings
    might cause us to miss other more useful ones

  - we'd eventually want to move to the new variant anyway, so this gets
    us set up (albeit with some extra ugly boilerplate for the
    conditional)

There are a lot of ways to split up the two cases. One way would be to
abstract the storage type (strbuf versus a long), how to append
(strbuf_addstr vs bitwise OR), how to initialize, which CURLOPT to use,
and so on. But the resulting code looks pretty magical:

  GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE allowed = GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE_INIT;
  if (...http is allowed...)
	GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_APPEND(&allowed, "http", CURLOPT_HTTP);

and you end up with more "#define GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE" macros than
actual code.

On the other end of the spectrum, we could just implement two separate
functions, one that handles a string list and one that handles bits. But
then we end up repeating our list of protocols (http, https, ftp, ftp).

This patch takes the middle ground. The run-time code is always there to
handle both types, and we just choose which one to feed to curl.

levels: minor Phase 2 fixes. (#964)

* levels: minor Phase 2 fixes.

Mostly for addressing #694.

Map05
Realigned grey hex textures around soulsphere switch. Now the odd one out is the door.

Map09
Fixed up the lighting in the start room.
Reflagged some secret doors as secret rather than hidden.
Consolidated the two W1 Floor to LAC triggers around the yellow key.
The red key rocket launcher sequence could potentially mess someone up who - given the hatchling closet, quite reasonably - avoids grabbing the rocket launcher. It seems needlessly convoluted, but it is a funny prank how the switch makes the red key disappear entirely for a bit. Instead of untangling this I'm just going to add some health bonuses around the rocket launcher so the player will eventually go there.
Tried to mitigate the worst of the various crimes against texture alignment in the crate maze, adding a light source in the process. It would take a *lot* of work to make it actually look good, a lot more than can be done in a batch bugfix PR.

Map10
Lower unpegged sector 70 (red door leading outside) door tracks.
Added matching midtexes to the insides of the fences around the lights by the door leading to the final corridor.
Line 839 (south-southeast red armour behind waterfall) flagged secret and the lines on the other side flagged hidden.

Map11
Realigned grey hexes in corridor around minigunner switch room.
Added an evil eye right in front of the shootwall secret.

Map12
Change line 330 midtex to the new MIDSPCSM with no offset.
Lower-unpegged line 4787 doortrack.

Map13
Sectors 243 no longer uses mismatching TLITE6_5 flat. (Sector 170 actually looks okay ingame.)
Realigned line 260.

Map15
Line 163 W1 changed to WR to prevent a potential softlock.
Aligned COMPSPAN on sector 561 to match surroundings.
Fixed some textures in the green corridor in the west overlooking the nukage. Also set those zombies in there to ambush since that seems to be the intention based on their placement, and made that big block thingy on the east end of that corridor a more normal-looking door.
Touched up greyhex near sector 491.
Flagged linedef 5293 secret.
Sectors 145 and 116 (rock fringe around nukage around red key platform) consolidated into one sector, made non-damaging, and without the invisible blocking lines.

Map16
Changed Line 1089 to SR instead of S1. (Switch that opens the secret to the east)
Realigned all the SUPPORT3s in that little painlord corridor while shrinking the "ribs" a bit; also widened the little exit atrium so the space between the lights is as wide as the door. (After looking at the others I am not going to widen any more corridors at this time.)
Grossly simplified the twisty yellow key corridor, and lowered the ceiling of the outside of the door so the yellow door stripe would fit properly. One doortrack needed to be given the DOORTRAK texture. The remaining "ribs" are recessed further inside the wall so they do not impede movement at all.
Lowered the ceiling above the other yellow marked door as well. The corridor around the corner has been expanded slightly.

Map22
Flagged line 830 secret.

Map23
Fixed candle placement on east end of zombieman corridor.
Consolidated some identical sectors around the big "AGM" floor and lowered the torch platforms so they wouldn't clip into the ceiling.
Raised the ceilings on the techpillars right after the first long lift. The walls in front of them now match their surroundings.
Removed lower unpegged from lines 2066, 2082, 2062, 2075. ("Door"tracks for the route across those pillars in the southeast - they're actually lifts not doors)
SSG secret fixed. (And marked.)

Map28
Lines 2326, 622 lagged secret.
Realigned lines 4594 and 4671.
Realigned scrolling textures around sector 517.
Touched up monster closet around sector 399, changing to to 8 about HAF fast and making the closet a bit taller so there'd be a better natural threshold between those areas. The doortracks were fine, if a bit complex.
Raised sector 474 ceiling to match marble brick seams.
Made sector 147 (cubes hanging over hot rocks) do damage and sectors 91 and 115 (teleport pads) not.

Map29
Swapped out the textures on the sides of the big green skull pad.

* levels: fix up map23 southeast secret textures.

I messed up the texture replacement around the green torch, the extreme sudden darkness ruined the blue AGM text, the pillar lift-doors needed a better division between the tekwall and red rock, and that huge swathe of DOORTRAK hurt to look at in vanilla.

* levels: map07 aesthetic fixes.

Replaced BIGDOOR1 on sector 50 as it was giving tutti-frutti.

Fixed the textures on the lifts in the green area beyond the outdoor area.

Miscellaneous texture alignment fixes and added some more thresholds between materials.

Shuttle events (#76008)

## About The Pull Request


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7501474/a2d83ce8-eba1-42d9-a1f8-9d73f7c40b21

Adds shuttle events! Stuff can now start to happen outside the shuttle,
either benign or spicy (but usually just fun to watch)!
## Why It's Good For The Game

The shuttle escape sequence is an important part of the game, uniting
about every player surviving player. Recently, #71906 has made the
escape sequence more forgiving as well as more interesting by
conditionally doubling the playing field. The area outside the shuttle
is still mostly empty though, except for the few people being spaced,
daredevils and the occasional epic space fight.

This PR adds adds some space events to spice up the outside of the
shuttle! This both gives people something too look at, making the escape
sequence feel less static and more lively, as well as give people a
reason to go outside and get the full experience of ~being decapitated
by a meteor~ swimming with the fishes!

Spawns a group of carp that flies past the shuttle, completely friendly
unless provoked.

**Friendly meteors**
Spawns a lot of strong meteors, but they all miss the shuttle.
Completely safe as long as you don't go EVA

**Maintenance debris**
Picks random stuff from the maintenance spawn pool and throws it at the
shuttle. Completely benign, unless you get hit in the head by a toolbox.
Could get you some cool stuff though!

**Dust storm**
Spawns a bunch of dust meteors. Has a rare chance to hit the shuttle,
doing minimal damage but can damage windows and might need inflight
maintenance

**Alien queen**
One in every 250 escapes. Spawns a player controlled alien queen and a
ripley mech. RIP AND TEAR!! Really not that dangerous when you realize
the entire crew is on the shuttle and the queen is fat as fuck, but can
still be fun to throw people around a bit before being torn to shreds.

**ANGRY CARP**
Once in every 500 escapes. Spawns 12 normal carp and 3 big carps, who
may just decide to go through the shuttle or try and bust through the
window if you look at them wrong. Somewhat dangerous, you could stay
away from the windows and try to hide, or more likely shoot at them and
weld the windows

**Fake TTV**
Lol

**Italian Storm**
Once in every 2000 rounds. Throws pasta, pizza and meatballs at the
shuttle. Definitely not me going off the rails with a testing event

**Player controlled carp trio**
Once in every 100 escapes. Spawns three player controlled carp to harass
the shuttle. May rarely be a magicarp, megacarp or chaos carp. I can't
honestly see them do anything other than be annoying for 3 seconds and
die

There are some other admin only ones: a group of passive carps going
directly through the shuttle and just being little shits, and a magic
carp swarm
</details>

Events are selected seperately, there isn't a crazy weighting system,
each just has a chance to run, and multiple could run at once. They also
don't immediately trigger, so people can get settled a bit, and to make
sure just waiting out the more dangerous ones is still a valid strategy.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Adds shuttle events! If shuttle escapes weren't exciting before
(doubtful), they definitely are now! I'm joking it's mostly an
atmosphere thing.
admin: Adds an admin panel to interact with shuttle events, under the
Events tab: Change Shuttle Events
fix: Objects spawned in hyperspace will properly catch hyperspace drift
/:cl:

There's a few things I'd like to do later (another PR) (honestly anyone
can do them because I suck at follow-ups), because this is too big as
is:
- Hijack triggered shuttle events
- More events (got a lot of cool suggestions, but I'm putting most of
them on hold)
- Maybe stration announcements if some more dangerous ones get added
- Structures appearing next to the escape shuttle???

#### Tuesday 2023-07-11 03:45:00 by Harald Hope

New version, new man. Continuing the Memory info rollout started in 3.3.27.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIAL THANKS:

1. Thanks to linuxquestions.org Slackware forums for poking around a bit at the
new Memory total logic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES:

1a. MEMORY: The memory total: has to be synthesized in some cases, based on some
math and educated guessing. When these guesses fall outside of predetermined
ranges, inxi will show note: est. to let the user know the total was synthesized
and possibly incorrect. For detected virtual machines, inxi does not try to
synthesize the total because a VM can have any amount of RAM assigned.

If superuser, and -m used, shows the real total from dmidecode if any RAM was
found. Not all systems have DMI RAM data however, or have dmidecode installed.
Will fallback to sythetic method in that case, which is usually right.

1b. MEMORY: With the superuser /proc/iomem method, if on a VM and not using even
GiB sized RAM ollocation, and -M is not triggered (which usually lets inxi know
it's a VM), the total will get rounded up or down based on a set of rules. For
example, 2.5 GiB real would become 3 GiB. I don't see any solution to this,
either assume the /proc/iomem is right but needs rounding up, or assume the /sys
block counts are right, or remove the feature.

Shows note: est. in cases where the rounded total is greater than a dynamic
factor difference from the internal total amount.

2. GENERAL/GRAPHICS: The problem of users showing up, requesting a feature, then
not doing any work, research, supplying energy, interest, and dare I say,
passion - nothing, expecting 'someone else' to do the work for them, continues,
sadly, with the recent request for vulkan data for Graphics. This appears to be
a problem more with the modern generation of free software users, I don't
remember this type of attitude 20 years ago, but I did watch it as it started
getting more common. Demotivating to be honest, but maybe one day someone will
show up who actually cares enough to help get the features they want developed.

While I am leaving that up as a low priority feature request, I am not
personally interested in that feature, nor is anyone else I asked, and given how
much raw data there is, and how difficult it is to parse, I'll just leave it as
an existing issue which might get work in a few years time, or not, basically
will require someone showing up who actually actively cares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS:

1. DISK: total: used: report could have had wrong results for used:, like used
being > total: because the filter lists were missing some file systems for
exclusion. More of a fix than a bug, but users might see it as a bug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXES:

1. INFO: get_gcc_data(): was showing same GCC version as main and alternate.
Failed to filter out the discovered primary, that is. This is because usually
name is gcc-11 but sometimes it's the whole version, like gcc-11.2.0, the full
version string. This is the case in Slackware for example.

2. SHORT: MEMORY: BSD: did not show '%' for memory used percent, just the
number.

3. DRIVES/PARTITIONS: PartitionItem::set_filters() added many more exclude
types, that will help avoid both creating wrong disk used totals, and also not
show label:/uuid: fields for filesystem types that don't have uuid/labels. There
were a lot missing: encrypted, distributed, stackable, remote. Should clean up
wrong disk used values in some cases.

4a. PARTITIONS: PartitionItem::set_filters(). Added a lot of file systems, many
fuse, distributed, stackable types.

4b. PARTITIONS: Extended remote file system ID by fs, and added fuse fs for
local mounts, like gvfs, mtp, ptp and many other variants, that's things like
mounting apple partition, android, iphone, archives, etc. This should correct an
entire class of source: ERR-102 outputs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

1. BATTERY: Added 'power' to battery report. That's the amount of watts its
using at that moment, so not super useful since it's running inxi at that
moment. But the data was there, so might as well show it. Only for -Bxx since it
will be so variable. Shows after the charge/condition item.

2. SYSTEM: DistroData: added Oracle id and system base. Added Springdale/PUIAS
system base support. Note, unusually, Eurolinux, ScientificLinux 'just worked'
re id and system base even though that had never been explicitly added. This is
because their os-release file contains 'centos' string.

3. SYSTEM: DistroData: Added ubuntu mantic minotaur to ubuntu id matching table.
This only really is used by Mint, but there you have it. Also added Debian 14
codename Forky.

4a. MEMORY: Add total RAM from one of following:

* /sys/devices/system/memory (if it's available). This directory has to be
compiled into kernel, so is not always present. This source has advantage of
being user readable. If out of set bounds, shows note: est. to let user know
it's an estimate.

* If superuser and /proc/iomme, gets the total from /proc/iomem using some
tricks and synthetic methods, which in general is pretty accurate, but when out
of the bounds set, shows note: est. to let user know results are only estimates.
This overrides /sys total.

* If -m and dmidecode data found, uses the real RAM module total. For Linux and
superuser. This overrides iomem and /sys totals.

4b. MEMORY: add iGPU RAM from /proc/iomem when detected. Requires sudo/root.

4c. MEMORY: using the real -m/RAM total for memory total when available, since
that is the actual value we want, not the estimated stuff from /proc/iomem or
/sys/devices/system.

5. RAM: added a long time oversight, lack of per array RAM installed size and
occupied slots (modules). Those are now part of the Array line for each set of
modules. Since total already shows in System RAM line above, the granular per
array installed size total only shows if > 1 array is present, ie, almost never.

6. DRIVES: disk vendors, added more matches and vendors. We'll know the world is
changing in a significant way when no new vendors appear for a while, but that's
unlikely in the near term.

7. CPU: cpu_arch(), a few new ids added.

8. GRAPHICS: new amd, intel, nvidia ids, updates to driver version etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES:

1. SHORT: for Memory:, switched to using MiB/GiB/TiB, these numbers are just
getting too big to be readable. This is also dynamic, if both used and available
are the same unit, shows x/y [unit], otherwise shows x [unit]/y [unit].

2. MEMORY: changed gpu: to igpu: to avoid confusing it with standalone gpu.
Since only raspberry pi had gpu ram data before, almost nobody would have seen
this in general anyway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION:

1. MAN/OPTIONS: Updated for -Bxx, battery power now.

2. MAN: updated to better define where the System RAM: total:.. available etc
come from, and what they refer to. Also added explanation in -m section about
what the stuff is, and what the field names refer to.

2a. DOCS: docs/inxi-ram.txt added, and more info moved from inxi-data.txt and
inxi-resources.txt. Goal is to remove both those files and move all their data,
and any new data, into granular inxi-xxx.txt files. Also moved some RAM data
from inx-unit-handling.txt to inxi-ram.txt.

2b. DOCS: docs/inxi-unit-handling.txt: updated with more ram / memory units,
code, etc, to better fit with the concept of the inxi-unit-handling.txt doc.

2c. DOCS: docs/inxi-partitions.txt: updated, added more sources for partition
file system types, cleaned up, more useful as a reference now.

2d. DOCS: docs/inxi-distros.txt: NEW, merged data from inxi-data.txt,
inxi-resources.txt. Updated and added more info.

2e. DOCS: docs/inxi-tools-mapping.txt split off from inxi-tools.txt, makes it
easier to find the mapping functions and features, which are hard to remember.
Also updated and improved its usability. This is kind of a key document because
it's hard to remember all the mapping tools internally, and this also connects
those tools to their relevant granular inxi-xxx.txt docs. Not that it will help
get helpers for these tedious tasks, but one can always dream, can't one?

3. DATA: data/graphics/ added for first vulkaninfo output file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE:

1a. RAM: Fixed an irregularity, for RamItem, it used MiB as internal unit, this
was silly because inxi uses KiB everywhere else. This correction was relatively
easy to do, and allows the values to be used by other parts of inxi, like
MemoryData.

1b. RAM: Added return of ram total for memory.

2a. INFO/RAM/PROCESSES: When MEMORY active, now uses row reference to create the
fields. For INFO, now uses MemoryData::row() to generate the row fields instead
of doing the logic in the info line generator. This simplifies the processing
and allows for more granular control of output.

2b. INFO/RAM/PROCESSES: Added debugger switches --dbg 53 (show raw KiB/count
values for /sys/devices/system/memory and /proc/iomem. Added --dbg 54, which
shows per line size for iomem, in human readable units, and a final summary
report of iomem and /sys data, this speeds up debugging.

2c. INFO/RAM/PROCESSES: Added --fake iomem, --fake sys-mem for debugging and
testing.

3. MEMORY: MemoryData::short_data(): added so one tool generates output for all
sources for short data. Easier to track and make consistent, and to make more
granular and robust.

4. DRIVES/PARTITIONS: PartitionItem::partition_filters(),
PartitionItem::fs_excludes(): refactored into PartitionItem::get_filters(),
PartitionItem::set_filters(). Cleaned up, organized better, made comments much
more useful. Goes with DOCS 2c updates. Now there's just one sub that does this
filter/exclude work, which makes it easier to maintain long term.

5. GLOBAL: Used a trick I just learned, declaring variables in the bracket scope
of a class, but not inside the package/class declaration. This makes it work
like a static variable, which Perl 5.008 doesn't support. You have to use a sub
inside the bracket scope to return the data outside that scope, but that is easy
to do.

6. MACHINE: Added return of b_vm for VM detection in MEMORY.

7. SYSTEM: CompilerVersion: Failed to properly use references when passing
$compiler around, not actually sure why it worked, but now is consistent.

SPECIES NUKING 2023: Head flags 3 & Knuckles: Fixes some growing pains with head flags  (#76440)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/76422
This was caused by me somehow not using the wrapper there and not
noticing it

Also fixes hair gradients and facial hair gradients. I am pretty sure
they were uhh, being hidden behind the actual hair/facial hair. Oops.

Also also fixes spawning yourself as a human as admin and getting random
hair colors. That was just a failure to update the icon after updating
everything, I think?

Additionally, to totally babyproof all of this, ensures that head_flags
involved stuff gets applied AFTER species by creating a new preference
priority, and uses two separate wrappers to apply gradient style and
color.

Here's this absolute hellspawn to prove that everything works.

Sorry for being so damn good at breaking this codebase.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Bugs are bad they make you mad

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Hair and facial hair gradients work again now
fix: Facial hair colors apply properly again
fix: Admin spawned characters will get hair color preferences applied

Trickwines! Again! (#1914)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Trickwines are a set of new reagents aimed at improving tribal/srm style
ships
The core concept are wines crafted out of mob drops and plants that
provide a buff on drinking and a debuff on throwing with bonus effects
against fauna
To facilitate the transfer of booze to target it also adds breakaway
flasks, 50u glass bottles that shatter violently on contact providing
extra throw force as well as a 25u gulp size which forces the user to
choose between buff or debuff
I plan on adding a fair few more Trickwines and the SRM Barrel Class
Brewer Vessel (SRM could really use one then 1 original ship) in later
prs to build on this concept
This HackMD will provide descriptions for the wines as well as a place
of information for all Trickwine-related content
https://hackmd.io/eUIddN2dS3mpeU1CThFGng

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Adds a fun new option for ships that lack proper chemistry and forces
them to choose which effect they actually want.

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl: FalloutFalcon
add: Trickwines
add: Breakaway flasks!
add: Basic Trickwine brewing equipment to the SRM glaive
imageadd: Sprites for breakaway flasks along with trick wine icons for
them!
code: Breakaway_flask_icon_state = null used for the same purpose as the
glass and shot glass versions
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

I DIDNT KNOW IF YOU RENAME A BRANCH IT CLOSES PRS RELATED TO IT?? I
THOUGHT IT JUST KNEW!!
3rd times a charm!

BAU: Add spotless check to pre-commit

It can be very annoying if you forget to run Spotless, only to find out
when your PR checks fail.

This adds a `spotlessCheck` to pre-commit. It will only check, not fix
for you, so you'd still have to manually run `spotlessApply`. This can
be changed if people think it's better for it to make the changes for
you.

The plugin being used is one I wrote and is a repo in my personal
GitHub. If people thing doing this is a good idea we should transfer to
to alphagov, in case I go under a bus.

Create index.html for my-project Github Pages

This hackathon project runs a method or system:
1. e-learning from the Pi Network pioneer community so that each region can form a communication forum and friendship ties among fellow pioneers. the purpose of this learning is about the integrity of a person who must always be based on honesty, discipline, know the rules, be trustworthy or trustworthy, with these materials so that character building can be realized. in this case the dominant regarding heart or spiritual development.
2. E-commerce is a tool for each Pi Network pioneer in carrying out activities and is expected to open new jobs in their respective areas so that the core business of the pioneers will be created, which in the end the Pi Network pioneers will have an integrated independent spirit in the pi network utility ecosystem. in this case it is more dominant regarding physical development, especially market or business development rather than new activities in the Pi network ecosystem.
3. e-marketing is a strategy in a market approach where in a global system everything is online so that it requires challenges in responding to technological developments and global market demands. here it tends to be stronger in creating a utility ecosystem among the pioneers of the pi network, which will complement each other, strengthen each other, with the principles of pioneers, for pioneers and for pioneers. I hope that unity and oneness, starting from the pi network pioneers, will create a strong sense of nation and state.

I18NMessageTest needs to reset I18NBundle static state. (#7101)

* Mark PauseableThread as excluded on GWT.

* Minor typo corrections.

* Fix atan2() when it should produce 0f.

Without this small change (which has essentially no performance impact that I could measure), calling atan2() with a point on the x-axis would produce a small but non-zero result, which is incorrect.

* Add atan, atan2, asin, acos for degrees.

This also includes atan2Deg360(), which in my opinion is the most useful of these because it does something differently from Math.atan2(), and can often save some effort.

* Approximations for tan() and tanDeg().

Sorry this is so long-winded, but the error isn't as straightforward to express as with sin() or cos().

* Apply formatter

* Add to MathUtilsTest.

* Apply formatter

* Stop trying to load defaults from wrong dir.

This old behavior broke Flame's effect-open dialog when any particle effect used the default billlboard or model particle. Now Flame tries to load a file given its absolute path (like before), but if it fails, it falls back to trying the default filenames as internal files.

* I18NMessageTest needs to reset I18NBundle state.

If you run I18NSimpleMessageTest and then I18NMessageTest without this PR, then the first test will have called I18NBundle.setSimpleFormatter(true), but the second test needs it to be set to false.

Because the tests are still perfectly usable if you run them on their own (or use LWJGL2, I think, because it might not share static state), this is not at all a priority to merge; it just makes running many tests in one session not throw an Exception.

Use `camino` crate for UTF8 paths in `re_types_builder` (#2637)

### What
TLDR: camino paths are a more ergonomic, since they implement
`to_string`, `as_str` etc. I think we should use it in more places.

From [the docs of `camino`](https://crates.io/crates/camino):

#### Why camino?
`camino`'s `Utf8PathBuf` and `Utf8Path` types are like the standard
library's `PathBuf` and `Path` types, except
they are guaranteed to only contain UTF-8 encoded data. Therefore, they
expose the ability to get their
contents as strings, they implement `Display`, etc.

The `std::path` types are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. This is the
right decision for the standard library,
since it must be as general as possible. However, on all platforms,
non-Unicode paths are vanishingly uncommon for a
number of reasons:
* Unicode won. There are still some legacy codebases that store paths in
encodings like [Shift JIS], but most
  have been converted to Unicode at this point.
* Unicode is the common subset of supported paths across Windows and
Unix platforms. (On Windows, Rust stores paths
as [an extension to UTF-8](https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/), and
converts them to UTF-16 at Win32
  API boundaries.)
* There are already many systems, such as Cargo, that only support UTF-8
paths. If your own tool interacts with any such
system, you can assume that paths are valid UTF-8 without creating any
additional burdens on consumers.
* The ["makefile
problem"](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EncodingStrategy#The_.22makefile_problem.22)
asks: given a
Makefile or other metadata file (such as `Cargo.toml`) that lists the
names of other files, how should the names in
the Makefile be matched with the ones on disk? This has *no general,
cross-platform solution* in systems that support
non-UTF-8 paths. However, restricting paths to UTF-8 eliminates this
problem.

[Shift JIS]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_JIS

Therefore, many programs that want to manipulate paths *do* assume they
contain UTF-8 data, and convert them to `str`s
as necessary. However, because this invariant is not encoded in the
`Path` type, conversions such as
`path.to_str().unwrap()` need to be repeated again and again, creating a
frustrating experience.

Instead, `camino` allows you to check that your paths are UTF-8 *once*,
and then manipulate them
as valid UTF-8 from there on, avoiding repeated lossy and confusing
conversions.

-->
While exploring reasons why this role was underplayed one of the things
that came up was its speed. It is dreadfully slow - to the point where
defenders are able to force an engagement against Synthetics. There is
no chance to run from anything faster as a Colony Synthetic. Making it
have to fight often.

Lowering the resistance is something devs wanted, and for gameplay this
is good because a Synthetic shouldn't be forced into a fight unless they
have no other option. Especially not by something as slow as a defender.
Might tweak later but council generally is in agreement with this
change. Little by little!

For the CQC, a Colony Synthetic is not as advanced as a Shipside one,
but still is more than capable of outmanuevering a human. As for the
hilarious UPP Pvt being better than a Colony Synth in CQC I will make a
separate PR

For Fireman, a Synthetic can bend metal, move cars and do many other
'superhuman' feats of stength, they should not struggle at carrying
people, especially shouldn't be worse at carrying people than a Marine.
It's from 1 to 3, to represent the strength yet aging capabilities of
the Colony Synthetic. @morrowwolf forgot this one

- doesn't touch WJ
# Explain why it's good for the game
Less resistance is something devs wanted.
Allows Colony Synthetics an option to avoid certain engagements as now
they are able to outrun some types of Xenomorphs off-weeds. Defenders
should not be able to catch them offweeds.
A Synthetic should have no problem carrying something as light as a
human being - they especially should not have MORE trouble carrying
someone than your standard human doctor.

Make Hashable derivation not infinitely recurse on missing instance.

* Make Hashable derivation not infinitely recurse on missing instance.

Having the compiler indefinitely hang makes it hard to see where the
issue is - if the compiler's not giving you any output.

Also added a `Hashable` instance for `OffsetTime`.

Removed the variance annotation from `Hashable`, and removed the single
implicit parameterized over all subtypes of `Iterable`, in favor of
implicits for specific instances (implemented by that general iterable
impl), in keeping with the patterns seen in generic derivation in other
libraries. In my experience, subtyping and implicit search don't mix
well, and it's probably best to keep implicit search as specific and
constrained as possible. And it's suspicious that the prior iterable1
impl seemed to require a `Lazy` on its element `Hashable` parameter.

Also removed `iterable2` (Maps can be hashed by typing them as an
Iterable of tuples and using the existing iterable hash implementation).

Rewrote the shapeless Generic derivation for Hashable using its
`TypeClass` helper class. The benefits for this helper aren't as much if
you're just using Generic instead of LabelledGeneric - it was mainly to
make sure we were following a "known good" pattern, as the previous impl
seemed to have an issue w/ infinitely recursing at compile time if an
instance was missing.

* Switch UnitSq back to being a case class (rather than an object)

For cursed "concrete val in superclass" / shapeless reasons.

dso: guess the deflib from the shared object

According to ld.so(8):

	On some 64-bit architectures, the default paths for 64-bit
	shared objects are /lib64, and then /usr/lib64.

The default library path differs on some 64-bit architectures on the
GNU/Linux systems. This behaviour is driven by the environment variable
IAMROOT_LIBRARY_PATH.

The glibc x86_64 and aarch64 architectures use the directory lib64
instead of lib (i.e. IAMROOT_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib64:/usr/lib64).

The musl library and both FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems use directory lib
only.

Furthermore, this default library path is distro specific on the Linux
systems. Arch Linux (x86_64 only) uses lib, symlinks lib64 to lib and
uses lib32 for its multilib support. Fedora uses distinct directories
for both lib and lib64, lib for 32-bits, lib64 64-bit. It is different
in the Debian world and its multiarch[1] support; it adds a tuple[2]
directory after the lib directory for the architecture.

This makes the magical very tricky to guess the default library path on
the Linux systems; it shall support the following situations:
 1. cross-chroot libc (i.e. from GNU World to musl)
 2. cross-chroot architecture (i.e. form x86-64 to i686 or armv7-a)
 3. execve executables (i.e. shared object with an interpreter)
 4. dlopen libraries (i.e. shared object without an interpreter)

The magic is based on the ELF header to guess if the chroot is a 32-bit
or a 64-bit world and if the operating system and its ABI is a either
UNIX System V or GNU/Linux or even FreeBSD.

The name of the dynamic loader is also needed to detect a Linux world
since the GNU/Linux ELF shared objects can be either UNIX System V or
GNU/Linux (OpenBSD uses UNIX System V as well).

The dynamic loader is in the interpreter segment of the ELF executable
file. However, the none-executable files ELF shared objects (such as
libraries) does not have that segment.

Therefore, it is hard to determine if the chroot world is either a
64-bit GNU/Linux or a musl (or even OpenBSD), and if it has to use
either /lib64:/usr/lib64 or /lib:/usr/lib as default library path
though; as needed by the point 4.

The libc soname is system specific:
 - libc.so.6 for GNU/Linux since glibc 2.0
 - libc.so.5 for Linux libc (former libc based on glibc 1; see the note
   below)
 - libc.so for musl (note: the dynamic loader is a symlink to libc)
 - libc.so.5 for FreeBSD 5.0
 - libc.so.6 for FreeBSD 6.0
 - libc.so.7 for FreeBSD since since 7.0
 - libc.so.96.2 for OpenBSD 7.2
 - libc.so.97.1 for OpenBSD 7.3

It is not ideal to rely on the libc soname as it is subject to collision
between the different operating systems; for example with the libc.so.6
of FreeBSD 6.x.

Hopefully, the libc.so.6 soname is pretty stable as the glibc 2.0 was
released in the early of 1997 (i.e. 26 years ago)[3].

Even better, the GNU libc needs the dynamic loader while the FreeBSD
libc does not; a least since 2.0.7 (tested down to Debian 2.0 Hamm[4];
Debian 1.3 Bo[5] was using the former Linux libc fork, aka libc.so.5).

	 0x0000000e (SONAME)                     Library soname: [libc.so.5]

Consequently, the default library path may be guessed to dlopen the
shared objects that are not executable files but that are linked against
the GNU libc; as long as the libc.so.6 is the library soname and as long
as it is executable and contains the needed dynamic loader. This hacky
guess has to be updated after every bump of the libc soname or if the
libc ceases to be executable (i.e. no more need to the dynamic loader or
no more interpreter).

It falls back to the executable file if the shared object is not linked
against the GNU libc library.

This guesses the default library path of the chroot'ed Linux
environnement by doing the magic mentionned above.

Note: According to libc(7):

	Linux libc

	In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while Linux libc, a
	fork of glibc 1.x created by Linux developers who felt that
	glibc development at the time was not sufficing for the needs of
	Linux. Often, this library was referred to (ambiguously) as just
	“libc”. Linux libc released major versions 2, 3, 4, and 5, as
	well as many minor versions of those releases. Linux libc4 was
	the last version to use the a.out binary format, and the first
	version to provide (primitive) shared library support. Linux
	libc 5 was the first version to support the ELF binary format;
	this version used the shared library soname libc.so.5. For a
	while, Linux libc was the standard C library in many Linux
	distributions.

	However, notwithstanding the original motivations of the Linux
	libc effort, by the time glibc 2.0 was released (in 1997), it
	was clearly superior to Linux libc, and all major Linux
	distributions that had been using Linux libc soon switched back
	to glibc. To avoid any confusion with Linux libc versions, glibc
	2.0 and later used the shared library soname libc.so.6.

	Since the switch from Linux libc to glibc 2.0 occurred long ago,
	man-pages no longer takes care to document Linux libc details.
	Nevertheless, the history is vis‐ ible in vestiges of
	information about Linux libc that remain in a few manual pages,
	in particular, references to libc4 and libc5.

Coroner additions and tweaks (#76534)

## About The Pull Request

Serrated bone shovels can be created with any kind of shovel now, not
just a spade (???)

Serrated bone shovels can be used in place of circular saw in most
surgeries.

Added a duller (still deadly) variant of the serrated bone shovel as
coroner mail.

Autopsy scanners now act as advanced health analyzers on dead and
seemingly-dead people.

Increased the force, throwforce, and wound bonus of inert ritual knives
and scythes.

Coroner gloves can quickly apply medicine like nitrile gloves.
## Why It's Good For The Game

> Serrated bone shovels can be created with any kind of shovel now, not
just a spade (???)

Weird ass bug.

> Serrated bone shovels can be used in place of circular saw in most
surgeries.

It's serrated, it's cool, it's rare, it has a fast toolspeed.

> Added a duller (still deadly) variant of the serrated bone shovel as
coroner mail.

Very thematic for the coroner, should probably also be a heirloom item
but whatevs. Weaker so there's still a reason to seek out the OG.

> Autopsy scanners now act as advanced health analyzers on dead and
seemingly-dead people.

Scanning corpses is pretty important during surgery - it tells you how
much blood they have, organ damage, diseases... these things don't
appear in the surgical computer readout, which means the coroner has to
go out of his cave to pick up a boring light blue meatbag wound scanner.
This also incentivizes coroners to do their job by giving them something
cool that only works on dead bodies.

> Increased the force, throwforce, and wound bonus of inert ritual
knives and scythes.

These two options in the MortiDrobe are pretty frickin' badass,
especially with how SICK the Coroner looks with them, double especially
in combat.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53100513/98c6f8a5-3e5a-41a9-8a9c-cb6b82ecc0b8)

However, there's the large issue that as actual weapons they're really,
really weak. Not enough damage, when I use them in combat I both feel
badass but also get a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I'm
intentionally gimping myself, and with only 10 damage I can *really*
feel it. I find it unfair that these are objectively worse than a
welding tool or even a Butcher's Cleaver when they're a lot more
involved to find, and scarce besides. These arguments apply equally to
the Wizard's ritual knife, and the scythe.

Additionally on the scythe, the crew really needs more good ghetto
weaponry that isn't the boring same ol' of baseball bats, spears,
cleavers... and making scythes useful is a great way to help bridge that
gap. They deal a satisfying amount of damage now, with the clear
downside, of course, being that they're bulky and hard to lug around.

> Coroner gloves can quickly apply medicine like nitrile gloves.

'Fast medicine' doesn't just cover sutures, it also covers medical gel.
Specifically, sterilizer gel. I find it annoying that the Coroner is
encouraged to give up his drip for the boring life-saver nitrile gloves,
because the difference in applying time really does make a difference -
it makes gel applying go from annoying to smooth, which is important
considering the whole purpose of sterilizer gel is to make surgeries go
faster. The Coroner has surgery and thus medical locker access to begin
with, so this isn't a balance problem, (and nitrile gloves are found by
the dozen anyways) especially with how rare the coroner gloves are.

Heavily reworks and resprites first aid analyzers. (#76533)

## About The Pull Request

Heavily reworks and resprites first aid analyzers. They now display if
they're happy, sad, angry, or warning you! Also a 'pricking' animation.

First aid analyzers are now found in all basic and specialized medkits.
Toxin medkits get a new* disease analyzer. Miners get a miner-colored
one in their box.

Scanning yourself with a first aid analyzer will 'create a holo-image
with treatment instructions next to your wounds', doubling the speed of
treatment of scanned wounds!

Health analyzers now have a scanning sound, courtesy of CM.

Refactored some wound code to make treatment duration changes and
changes in the description of wounds easier.

Fixed a dummy parent feature of the health analyzer (Verbose mode)
showing up, uselessly, on the disease and first aid subtypes.

Surgical processors and slime scanners have recieved a similar resprite.
## Why It's Good For The Game

> Heavily reworks and resprites first aid analyzers. They now display if
they're happy, sad, angry, or warning you! Also a 'pricking' animation.

These things have long, long needed some sprite love. Displaying emotion
will make them have a lot more 'weight' to them, same with the prick.
The old, shitty spectrometer sprites have gone directly into the
dumpster.

> First aid analyzers are now found in all basic and specialized
medkits. Toxin medkits get a new* disease analyzer. Miners get a
miner-colored one in their box.

They have also needed some gameplay love! Placing them in these kits is
not going to be a massive game-changer when they were already easily
found around the station in emergency medkits, but it will fill up that
awkward empty slot.

> Scanning yourself with a first aid analyzer will 'create a holo-image
with treatment instructions next to your wounds', doubling the speed of
treatment of scanned wounds!

The biggest gameplay-impacting change in this PR, I *sincerely* believe
this is the perfect solution to first aid analyzers being completely
redundant with eyesight. This lets you/someone else scan your wounds to
speed up treatment, with a neat in-character reason for it -
'holo-images' appearing on your body, like penlights.

This will speed up wound treatment, but I believe that is for the best,
as currently treating wounds is so slow that half the time it's not
worth it (or more accurately, it doesn't feel worth it in comparison to
the effort you're putting in) and you're better off shrugging off minor
wounds. It will do so in a way that requires a modicum of effort, so
it's not just a flat buff across the land.

It's a neat sound that will make medbay feel more alive. First aid
analyzers get a beeboop instead.

> Surgical processors and slime scanners have recieved a similar
resprite.

IT'S SPRITE MANIA IN HERE
## Changelog
:cl:
Carlarc, Weird Orb
image: Heavily reworks and resprites first aid analyzers. They now
display if they're happy, sad, angry, or warning you! Also a 'pricking'
animation.
add: First aid analyzers are now found in all basic and specialized
medkits. Toxin medkits get a new* disease analyzer. Miners get a
miner-colored one in their box.
balance: Scanning yourself with a first aid analyzer will 'create a
holo-image with treatment instructions next to your wounds', doubling
the speed of treatment of scanned wounds!
sound: Health analyzers and gene scanners now have a scanning sound,
courtesy of CM.
refactor: Refactored some wound code to make treatment duration changes
and changes in the description of wounds easier.
fix: Fixed a dummy parent feature of the health analyzer (Verbose mode)
showing up, uselessly, on the disease and first aid subtypes.
image: Surgical processors and slime scanners have recieved a similar
resprite.

Bilingual can now choose their language (#76609)

## About The Pull Request

This was one of the tradeoffs for removing other, more consistent
sources of languages, and was requested by Melbert among many others.
This does go against my wanted goal of decreasing the risk of
eavesdropping by other players through just magically knowing a
language, but it is an expensive quirk and it is in their medical
records, which makes it better than language encryption keys or silicon
just innately knowing them.

This also limits Bilingual to only roundstart languages (+Uncommon),
rather than being randomly selected from a list (that had very useless
ones like monkey, podpeople, and beachbum). This is mostly just for
modularity, I didn't want to make it look terrible code-wise and thought
this may be the optimal way to handle it.

This is also me going back on
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/71773 - which I had closed
myself.

## Why It's Good For The Game

If we're gonna keep the Bilingual quirk, it might as well be something
players can choose the language of, it's their character and they should
be allowed to decide how their character is, and it is my fault that
this stupid compromise of "getting a random language" was made in the
first place. It never should've happened.
It now actually limits it to roundstart-only languages, so there's no
way you can spy on people who prepare in advance through becoming
podpeople, or monkeys, etc.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Bilingual quirk now lets you choose your language between ones
given to roundstart species.
balance: Foreigner and Bilingual are now mutually exclusive languages.

[IMP] zen: add verse about code ambiguity

A verse about how to deal with code ambiguity was missing to the zen poem.

Computers have made humans superstitious: To exorcise the demons in our
computers we perform the sacred ritual of turning them off and then on.
Supposedly this will fix any mysterious problem. However, computers are
not magic. If your code is not working, there is a reason and only
careful, critical thinking will solve it. Refuse the temptation to
blindly try solutions until something seems to work; often you have
merely masked the problem rather than solved it.

[FIX] website, *: allow to re-edit company team snippet images

*: web_editor

Since [1], it was not possible to edit a company team snippet image
anymore as soon as the page was saved once. Indeed that commit added
o_not_editable/contenteditable="false" on the parent column to make sure
no text can be added in that column and contenteditable="true" on the
images so that they are still editable (even though HTML-specs-wise
adding contenteditable="true" on images probably does not mean much as
images are self-closing tags, our editor understand that as the ability
to edit the image anyway). That contenteditable="true" part is however
removed when leaving edit mode... and was not restored upon entering
edit mode again.

This fixes the problems with an ugly patch. We'll review what to do in
master.

Funny enough, that bug was actually gone in 15.0... by mistake. A recent
bug fix actually reintroduced that isolated bug at [2] (by reintroducing
the fact that images in a non-editable environment are not possible to
edit). The 3 opened tickets this commit mentions were actually reported
for 15.0 immediately after that, while the 14.0 being broken about this
since the beginning apparently did not bother anyone.

Removed Final Fantasy from HOF

I never really had the chance to enjoy FF as much as I probably should
have... If I can get someone to seriously persuade me to sit down and
give a FF game the time they think it deserves, then my opinion may very
well change. For now, it'll have to sit in my other list of games I've
enjoyed in the past, but haven't awarded my personal HOF honor.

Merge pull request #336 from SiverDX/fixes

> Set up the mod, will do the Curse Forge stuff once this is merged (since it depends on the harvest changes)
> 
> This PR now affects the following:
> 
> ### Fixed some issues regarding abilities (GUI)
> * Tooltip coloring for increasing levels
> * Experience gained from decreasing was 1 level lower than intended
> * There were 2 additional SkillProgressButtons being rendered (but overlayed by other buttons)
> * Right side of the experience cost for abilities had the wrong start location
> * When increasing or decreasing ability levels all were shown as obtainable (until screen was re-opened)
> 
> ### Other
> * Removed bad omen application when you kill a knight (only occurred as a non-dragon)
> * Fixed some issue with water cauldron block (sea dragon gained no good mana condition from it)
> 
> ### Fixed a bug with the Claws and Teeth description
> * The harvest level text was not accurate (starting from gold? it was 1 level too high)
> 
> ### Fixed issues with harvesting
> * Modded ore support for drops when only using paws (most modded ores should already work but this fixes certain other instances, mostly MCreator related)
> * Config for bonusUnlockedAt is now respected
> * ServerConfig.baseHarvestLevel is now actually used
> * Minimum level for base and bonus level is now 0 (wood)
> * When the tool in the claw inventory breaks block-breaking will no longer desync
> * Block breaking speed is only applied if the dragon is effective against the block (e.g. cave dragon can mine pickaxe-blocks faster but not shovel-blocks)
> 
> ### Removed Better Combat animation compatibility
> (This will not cause Better Combat to now crash with Dragon Survival - that was a separate issue)
> 
> * Removed config

Larva Queue Late Joiner Nerf (#3803)

# About the pull request

This PR makes it so players who haven't played yet have their join time
recorded, and that is used for their initial sorting value rather than
0. This means late joiners will be at the back of the line as if they
had just died.

This PR also fixes an oversight where ghosting as a facehugger would
count as death. Even though they really shouldn't be ghosting when
alive, they still shouldn't be penalized as far as the queue is
concerned.

# Explain why it's good for the game

Its not; its a bad experience for everyone that hasn't even gotten one
life in the round. However it seems I'm in the minority thinking that a
xeno shouldn't squander their first life and that death shouldn't bear
more consequences.

# Testing Photographs and Procedure

Tweak connector menu

A mix of the previous versions:
* Display the connector as the description, so "MSX Joystick Port A"
  instead of "joyporta".
* Display the pluggable as the name, so "magic-key" instead of "Dongle
  used by some Japanese games to enable cheat mode".
* Show the pluggable description as a tooltip.

Disadvantage of this version is that all 4 joytap / ninjatap ports are now
shown as "Joy Tap port" / "Ninja Tap port" (this used to be
"joytap_port_1" etc). Maybe we should fix this in the implementation of
the joytap/ninjatap code instead of in the GUI?

Cassandra support for chat history using CassIO library (#6771)

### Overview

This PR aims at building on #4378, expanding the capabilities and
building on top of the `cassIO` library to interface with the database
(as opposed to using the core drivers directly).

Usage of `cassIO` (a library abstracting Cassandra access for
ML/GenAI-specific purposes) is already established since #6426 was
merged, so no new dependencies are introduced.

In the same spirit, we try to uniform the interface for using Cassandra
instances throughout LangChain: all our appreciation of the work by
@jj701 notwithstanding, who paved the way for this incremental work
(thank you!), we identified a few reasons for changing the way a
`CassandraChatMessageHistory` is instantiated. Advocating a syntax
change is something we don't take lighthearted way, so we add some
explanations about this below.

Additionally, this PR expands on integration testing, enables use of
Cassandra's native Time-to-Live (TTL) features and improves the phrasing
around the notebook example and the short "integrations" documentation
paragraph.

We would kindly request @hwchase to review (since this is an elaboration
and proposed improvement of #4378 who had the same reviewer).

### About the __init__ breaking changes

There are
[many](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/3.28/api/cassandra/cluster/)
options when creating the `Cluster` object, and new ones might be added
at any time. Choosing some of them and exposing them as `__init__`
parameters `CassandraChatMessageHistory` will prove to be insufficient
for at least some users.

On the other hand, working through `kwargs` or adding a long, long list
of arguments to `__init__` is not a desirable option either. For this
reason, (as done in #6426), we propose that whoever instantiates the
Chat Message History class provide a Cassandra `Session` object, ready
to use. This also enables easier injection of mocks and usage of
Cassandra-compatible connections (such as those to the cloud database
DataStax Astra DB, obtained with a different set of init parameters than
`contact_points` and `port`).

We feel that a breaking change might still be acceptable since LangChain
is at `0.*`. However, while maintaining that the approach we propose
will be more flexible in the future, room could be made for a
"compatibility layer" that respects the current init method. Honestly,
we would to that only if there are strong reasons for it, as that would
entail an additional maintenance burden.

### Other changes

We propose to remove the keyspace creation from the class code for two
reasons: first, production Cassandra instances often employ RBAC so that
the database user reading/writing from tables does not necessarily (and
generally shouldn't) have permission to create keyspaces, and second
that programmatic keyspace creation is not a best practice (it should be
done more or less manually, with extra care about schema mismatched
among nodes, etc). Removing this (usually unnecessary) operation from
the `__init__` path would also improve initialization performance
(shorter time).

We suggest, likewise, to remove the `__del__` method (which would close
the database connection), for the following reason: it is the
recommended best practice to create a single Cassandra `Session` object
throughout an application (it is a resource-heavy object capable to
handle concurrency internally), so in case Cassandra is used in other
ways by the app there is the risk of truncating the connection for all
usages when the history instance is destroyed. Moreover, the `Session`
object, in typical applications, is best left to garbage-collect itself
automatically.

As mentioned above, we defer the actual database I/O to the `cassIO`
library, which is designed to encode practices optimized for LLM
applications (among other) without the need to expose LangChain
developers to the internals of CQL (Cassandra Query Language). CassIO is
already employed by the LangChain's Vector Store support for Cassandra.

We added a few more connection options in the companion notebook example
(most notably, Astra DB) to encourage usage by anyone who cannot run
their own Cassandra cluster.

We surface the `ttl_seconds` option for automatic handling of an
expiration time to chat history messages, a likely useful feature given
that very old messages generally may lose their importance.

We elaborated a bit more on the integration testing (Time-to-live,
separation of "session ids", ...).

### Remarks from linter & co.

We reinstated `cassio` as a dependency both in the "optional" group and
in the "integration testing" group of `pyproject.toml`. This might not
be the right thing do to, in which case the author of this PR offer his
apologies (lack of confidence with Poetry - happy to be pointed in the
right direction, though!).

During linter tests, we were hit by some errors which appear unrelated
to the code in the PR. We left them here and report on them here for
awareness:

```
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:137: error: Argument 1 to "insert_many" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[Dict[str, Sequence[object]]]"; expected "Iterable[Union[MongoDBDocumentType, RawBSONDocument]]"  [arg-type]
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:186: error: Argument 1 to "aggregate" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[object]"; expected "Sequence[Mapping[str, Any]]"  [arg-type]

langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:16: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:19: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:20: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:22: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:23: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
```

In the same spirit, we observe that to even get `import langchain` run,
it seems that a `pip install bs4` is missing from the minimal package
installation path.

Thank you!

Message against the war, in Russian and English

🇷🇺 Русским гражданам

Мы, участники Laminas, родились и живем в разных странах. У многих из нас есть друзья, родственники и коллеги как в России, так и в Украине. Некоторые из нас родились в России. Некоторые из нас живут в России. У некоторых бабушки и дедушки сражались с фашистами во Второй мировой войне. Здесь никто не поддерживает фашизм.

У одного из нас есть украинская родственница, которая спаслась из дома вместе с сыном. Поезд задержался из-за бомбежки на дороге впереди. У нас есть друзья, которые прячутся в бомбоубежищах. Мы с тревогой ждем весточки от них после воздушных налетов, которые беспорядочно наносят удары и попадают по больницам, школам, детским садам и домам. Мы не берем это из каких-либо СМИ. Мы наблюдаем это напрямую.

Вы доверяете нам достаточно, чтоб использовать наши программы, и мы просим вас довериться нам вновь. Мы нуждаемся в помощи. Выходите и протестуйте против этой бесполезной войны. Остановите кровопролитие. Скажите "Нет войне!"

🇺🇸 To Citizens of Russia

We at Laminas come from all over the world. Many of us have friends, family and colleagues in both Russia and Ukraine. Some of us were born in Russia. Some of us currently live in Russia. Some have grandparents who fought Nazis in World War II. Nobody here supports fascism.

One team member has a Ukrainian relative who fled her home with her son. The train was delayed due to bombing on the road ahead. We have friends who are hiding in bomb shelters. We anxiously follow up on them after the air raids, which indiscriminately fire at hospitals, schools, kindergartens and houses. Were not taking this from any media. These are our actual experiences.

You trust us enough to use our software. We ask that you trust us to say the truth on this. We need your help. Go out and protest this unnecessary war. Stop the bloodshed. Say "stop the war!"

Update README.md, added malicious packets to interests

Generally, my interest lies in low-level exploitation in general, and the lowest level (outside of pure hardware) in host-based exploitation is the kernel and in network-based exploitation is packet injection.

For me, these low-level exploits feel ineffably intimate. Higher levels of abstraction feel like they're distancing themselves too much from the processes that are actually occurring. Low-level hacking feels like I understand the machines better than their own users and I'm gaining their allegiance through that mutual understanding.

On top of that, while hacks that take place in userspace like web hacking and application hacking are rather glamorous, I like the idea of climbing down into the metaphorical crawlspace of machine code to sneak underneath userspace entirely by navigating code that is much less human-readable. It's a romantic notion of stealthily attacking through an often-overlooked undercroft.

Plus, when you chain malicious packet injection with kernel exploitation, you have a remote exploit that doesn't rely on the user at all. It requires no social engineering to install trojans and, often, can be done without exploiting misconfigurations in applications, too. In a way, it feels like a "pure" hack, since it deals directly in exploiting the foundational low-level code everything runs on, which makes it all the more satisfying to pull off.

Not that this matters too much, since I'm still a noob, but it is a topic that I find absolutely fascinating. I want to learn as much as I can about these topics and this specific attack chain of malicious packet + kernel exploit. While I didn't know enough to put a name to it, this sort of attack is what's drawn my interest towards hacking since I was in elementary school.

That's probably partially inspired by legends about 1x1x1x1 from ROBLOX, honestly, lol. That's what got me into Lua scripting, which ultimately lead to me doing shell exploitation on school computers in middle school, and so on. While the ROBLOX gray hat wasn't a low-level hacker, it did introduce me to the idea of delving into a deeper layer than ordinary userspace in order to modify a system.

That obviously includes finding vulnerabilities on those lower levels and exploiting them, but I like to think of them less like vulnerabilities and more like doors the machines leave open for those who care enough to find them. Weird metaphor, but nobody actually reads these updates so I can pour my heart out into them without judgment.

I guess these updates function kind of like a blog, huh?

Update README.md, added more projects

These projects are getting a little out of hand. I'm not sure they function as a straightforward to-do list anymore, because I have half a mind to skip down Linux From Scratch and go from there.

I've been so focused on eJPT and I've been so sick that I haven't had the time or mental resources to work on these other projects. I can still work from when I wake up to when I sleep, but my progress is a lot slower than it used to be. I just spent two weeks out of commission due to starting immunotherapy, which put me more behind schedule than I was hoping for.

I am frustrated by these constant setbacks and the growing list of what I want to accomplish. The upside is that I know exactly what I want to focus on, what I want to achieve, and how to go about doing it. This is a level of clarity and passion that I think most people can only dream of, and I'm basically certain that I won't ever experience a mid-life crisis or anything that will dramatically alter my life trajectory later on, either.

I'm trying to remember that the pandemic severely hindered most people my age. I'm not the only one that had my college life destroyed by those events, even though many people my age were still somehow able to continue mostly unaffected.

I was impacted to a greater degree, and it's not like I was on the right course before the pandemic, either, but I think I can pull all of this off. It only feels overwhelming when I look at this list as a whole instead of focusing on each element step-by-step, because this list will probably take at least a couple of years to finish, if not more.

I just have to pace myself and remember that it's a marathon, not a race. I'll be able to accomplish larger workloads as I get back into the swing of things, because hopefully the days of chronic illness are finally behind me now.

I've been reading up on how people in East Asian countries cope with higher workloads and are able to work essentially from waking to sleeping, and I think I can do that, too. It's going to be a little exhausting at first, but as long as I pace myself and focus on just doing what I can to stay on course, I should adapt to the workload.

I don't know how much of an advantage that will give me in the offensive security scene. I know it's a hyper-competitive field as it is. I'm trying to not worry about it and just focus on the work in front of me. Everywhere I turn online, people are highly pessimistic and negative about getting a pentesting job with no experience, but the actual people in the industry that I've connected to have told me that I can do it, which is more encouraging.

It sometimes feels like a futile struggle, still, but I'm not going to give up. This is what I want from life. I would never forgive myself if I didn't put 110% into achieving it. So I'll add more projects, knowing that I WILL get to them some day, even if they feel out of reach right now. I will look at this list every few days to remember what I'm striving towards.

You hear that, DEFCON and Jack Rhysider? I'm a nobody now, but one day it will be impossible to ignore what I've accomplished. It's only a matter of time.

...I hope.

Tweak forms

This change is intended to allow more opportunities for players to shift
into or out of a 'transmuter' playstyle, to improve the UI of forms, and to
improve some miscellaneous issues, e.g. Lichform being useless in 3-rune games.
For more context, see https://github.com/crawl/crawl/wiki/Transmutations-Reform.

Throughout, balance is a very rough sketch. I expect many things will need to
be buffed, others will need to be nerfed, and some will need to be replaced
entirely. This is a grand experiment, not a final state.

Talismans
---------

The largest change is that forms are no longer entered via spells. Instead,
special items called 'talismans' must be found and evoked. Once entered,
these 'talisman forms' last indefinitely.

Further notes on talismans:
- Talismans scale only on Shapeshifting skill (more on this later). They
  do not care about Int, Spellcasting, other spell schools, wizardry, or
  encumbrance. (That is, they aren't spells.)
- Talisman forms have a 'minimum skill'. Below that skill, entering the
  talisman form will reduce the user's maximum HP (while in the form).
  This is intended to roughly mimic the inability to effectively cast
  spells at low skills/high fail% - it provides a space in which an 'early'
  form can be better than a 'later' one, even if you've found both.
- Talisman forms have a 'maximum skill'. Above that skill, no further
  scaling applies. This is intended to roughly mimic max spellpower - it
  makes it more obvious that later-game forms will end up outscaling
  earlier ones.
- It takes 5 turns to enter or leave a talisman form, exactly as with
  armour or amulets. Use of a talisman form is intended to be a strategic
  decision, again like wearing armour, rather than something swapped in
  each fight.
- Talismans don't need to be held after they're used. You can evoke them
  from the floor and leave them there. This avoids inventory pressure.
- Talismans can be used with Sacrifice Artifice, since they don't use Evo.
- Zin instantly excommunicates users of a talisman. Take that, nerds!
- Trog is A-OK with talismans, just as with wands, magic swords, etc.

Art for talismans is pending.

Skills
------

Transmutations skill has been split in two. Talismans use a new skill,
Shapeshifting, and remaining Transmutations spells (of which there are
still nine, more than one other school!) continue to use Transmutations
skill. There was very little synergy or overlap between forms and Tmut
spells, and this makes it easier to make skilling decisions. Some argue
that Transmutations should be abolished entirely and its spells punted
into other schools; we'll see.

Shapeshifting aptitudes look broadly like Transmutations aptitudes,
with a -2 penalty applied so that forms are costly enough now that
they're all "single-school" and don't require Int. (That is, Humans
have a Shapeshifting apt of -2, etc.) A few species have had their
apts adjusted to account for the new role of Shapeshifting, but more
could be done here.

Background
----------

The Transmuter background has been replaced with a Shapeshifter, who
starts with a beast talisman and no spells. Their stats have been
adjusted accordingly.

Forms
-----

The following forms exist:

*Beast*: This is the starting form for the Shapeshifter background. It
melds all aux armours in exchange for a Slaying bonus (ala Wereblood) -
+2 at 0 skill, +8 at 13 skill (max).

This is intended to provide a bonus which is compelling early game (when no
or few aux armours have been found) but more tenuous later, especially for
non-transmuters. It's also intended to provide a bridge between Tmut and
weapon use, since a transmuter who finds a great weapon can switch from UC
to that weapon without giving up their form and Tmut training.

Beast form allows use of body armour so that it can present a reasonable
slay-for-AC tradeoff without becoming overly strong for 'dex-based' characters,
who wouldn't mind losing body armour nearly as much.

*Anaconda*: This is a tier 2 form. Anaconda form turns you into a giant
anaconda. All your items meld, you can constrict, you get some AC and an HP
bonus...

This is intended to replace Ice Form, a form to help transmuters transition
into the mid-game. The rF- of Ice Form is less appropriate for early-game
characters who can no longer switch between forms, and Ice Form is not
evocative - no one gets Ice Beasts. On the other hand, turning into a snake...
everyone gets that. That's the dream. Limbs are for dorks. Ssssss

*Maw*: This is a tier 2 form. Maw form melds the body slot, transforming it
into a giant mouth, ala the Brazilian Mapinguari. The maw provides an aux
attack with damage that scales on Shapeshifting skill. It also has the old
Hydra form devour-on-kill-for-hp gimmick, since everyone loved that.

This is intended to be a way that Shapeshifters can transition into the mid-game,
especially transmuters who use weapons. It's probably a bit too strong for
quick blade users at present - perhaps I'll give it +str -dex, or something.
(It may also just be too strong in general - numbers are WIP!)

*Blade*: This is a tier 2 form. It's blade hands. To compensate for it
being easier to enter, its UC damage has gone down slightly (22 -> 18).

It also now gives a deformed body-like AC penalty based on base body armour AC,
scaling from a 100% penalty at min Shapeshifting skill to 0% at max skill.
(That is, at min skill, +2 plate armour will just give you +2 AC, plus whatever
you get from Armour skill.) This is intended to model the dynamic of old Blade
Hands - pure glass cannon when you can only cast it in robes, later on more
usable in actual armour. Your body is deformed because there are blades inside.
Aaiiii!

This is intended to be another way that Shapeshifters can transition into the
mid-game.

*Statue*: This is a tier 3 form. It's statue form. Intended to be a way
for transmuters to head into late-game while still being able to use weapons,
if desired. Might need to be a bit stronger for weapon users.

*Dragon*: This is a tier 3 form. It's dragon form. AC and UC damage now
scale slightly with Tmut skill. Intended to be a way for transmuters to
head into late-game. Possible this should be tier 4 and Storm should be tier
3 - dragons are cool! Dragons should be the best!

*Storm*: This is a tier 4 form. It's storm form. Intended for players who
want to dump ludicrous amount of skill XP into tmut. Top end has been
adjusted somewhat downward.

*Death*: This is a tier 4 form. Replacing Necromutation/Lich Form, Death
Form makes you dead (no drinking potions, holy wrath/dispel undead vuln,
rC, rTorm, rPois, etc) and also gives you an assortment of spicy powers.
On hit (with melee/UC), victims get slowed, weakened, and heavily drained.
There's also a new active, Siphon Essence, which costs 20 (!) MP, halves
the HP of all enemies in radius 2, and heals you based on damage dealt and
Tmut skill. (That works on all non-MH_NONLIVING enemies, as do the debuffs.)

It no longer provides innate AC or Will, nor does it give a necro enhancer.
Its UC damage is now significantly higher, comparable to blade hands,
though still much lower than Statue, Dragon or Storm.

This is intended to be a way for players who want to spend huge skill XP
on tmut to do so, including those who use tmuts + weapons. It's intended
to feel a bit different from other forms while still being competitive in
melee. Other forms have huge base damage - Death Form has lower damage but
very strong debuffs. Other forms have AC (Statue), HP (Dragon) or EV (Storm) -
Death Form gives Siphon Essence as a very powerful survival tool.

Other Notes
-----------

Various books have been merged and consolidated to make up for the
removal of eight spells. It *might* make sense to drop the book generation
rate slightly, but I haven't done this yet.

Some uniques now spawn with talismans. More could be done with this, e.g.
placing talismans of death in Crypt.

Later changes
-------------

Talisman acquirement is a must. TODO.

In the future, artefact talismans (i.e. randarts) could be interesting -
to provide more excitement for rare finds. The randarts would have
the usual panoply of properties (rF+, Dex-2, etc), which would apply
while the player was in the relevant form.

It'd be fun to add more form types, e.g. ones that work well for
'casters'.

Might be interesting to have talismans start unidentified (like staves),
for a frisson of excitement in gauntlets etc.

Possibly Wanderers should get a chance to start with beast talisman?

Update README.md, added quantum programming to list

Quantum computing is almost inevitable at this rate, so I should prepare for it.

I honestly prefer the machine code of traditional binary, because it has Boolean logic baked into it. It's more black-and-white than quantum programming is.

Nonetheless, there are low-level quantum programming languages that are comparable to Assembly, and they will likely become more common over the next couple of decades. They might not enter mainstream use until 2040, and civilization might collapse by 2050, so they're not as important to be familiarized with. Despite that, it would be smart to prepare when I have the time, while I'm learning traditional Assembly, anyway.

The existence of quantum computers will make low-level hacking more complex than it already is, which is honestly pretty scary to me, and just the idea of a "quantum" computer already sounds esoteric enough to avoid dark alleys that one might be lurking in. I won't get anywhere by avoiding the topic in the hope that it will go away, though.

Hopefully, by the time I get into quantum exploitation, I will already be experienced enough in low-level hacking that it will feel more like another tool in my belt than a complete reinvention of the wheel from scratch. I might end up being too late on that bandwagon, though, because I still have to catch up on traditional low-level hacking.

Agh! Tech moves so fast. It's hard to stay oriented. I hate it. I also love it, because it means there's always more to learn, but I hate it because it means I have to constantly adapt to stay relevant in the job market. I have to foresee where the industry will be in half a decade because it will take me half a decade to learn the skills I need to enter it, and by the time I gain those skills they might no longer be relevant anymore.

It feels like a huge game of chance. And that's on top of the fact that offensive cybersecurity is an extremely competitive field to begin with. You know, I don't like risk, I hate conflict, and I'm not a masochist. Why am I doing this to myself??

Well, I'll tell you why. I like hacking. If I have to learn low-level quantum programming, prove myself to HR, defy the gatekeeping elitists, and beat out my competitors then that's what I have to do to keep hacking. I don't like it. I'd rather avoid that hassle entirely. But to keep doing what I love, the sacrifice is worth it.

It hurts my feelings to have to fight everyone. It's stressful and worrying to have to constantly keep up with a field that's rapidly developing in multiple directions. It makes me feel worthless and inadequate to see so many people who know way more than me and are so much further ahead than I am.

But I'm not going to give up. That would be pathetic. I'm in this for the long haul, for better or worse.

Fixes colossus possessor crystal cockroaches/animals not dumping the user's body upon death/gibbing (#75843)

## About The Pull Request
Hooks the stasis closet thingamajing into `COMSIG_LIVING_DEATH` instead
of checking the animal's stat on `process()`, which makes possessed
animals properly dump the stasis closet's contents upon death or gibbing
(which is death but cooler).
yeah uh this method is hilarious but it does protect the user's body
quite reliably at least lol

## Why It's Good For The Game
Fixes #75829
also probably makes cockroach death saner in some unreported way, this
`. = ..()` vs `..()` is above my non-existent paygrade but it keeps
popping up from time to time

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: gibbing colossus possessor crystal possessed animals will no longer
stick the user's body and their stuff into the shadow realm. the animals
will properly drop your corpse when killed or gibbed
/:cl:

Add wofi example that handles quotes correctly

The example for removing the id number of history items for wofi doesn't handle quotes correctly. I added a snippet that does (I hope).

It's *very* cursed. I am sorry.

A short explanation taken from my dotfiles I wrote for myself so I don't forget:

"I'm sorry for this abomination of cursed shell code.
    The gist is: the %q in printf quotes the string in a shell-compatible way.
    Thanks to that, we can put in --pre-display-cmd with %s in wofi, and the string will
    be correctly interpreted there, even if it contains quotes or stuff itself.

    The pre-display-cmd is there for removing the leading ID number (separated by tab)
    in the history item string so it isn't displayed, but not removed from the actual
    string passed back to cliphist. See https://github.com/sentriz/cliphist#faq

    Using xargs, we give the quoted string to bash, which then interprets the quotes,
    and echo out the unquoted string, which we can then finally pass back to cliphist."

Jupiter Notebook 

Task 3 - Experience Analytics
The Telecommunication industry has experienced a great revolution in the last decade. Mobile devices have become the new fashion trend and play a vital role in everyone's life. The success of the mobile industry is largely dependent on its consumers. Therefore, it is necessary for the vendors to focus on their target audience i.e. what are the needs and requirements of their consumers and how they feel and perceive their products. Tracking & evaluating customers’ experience can help organizations to optimize their products and services so that it meets evolving user expectations, needs, and acceptance.

In the telecommunication industry, the user experience is related, most of the time, to network parameter performances or the customers’ device characteristics.  

In this section, you’re expected to focus on network parameters like TCP retransmission, Round Trip Time (RTT), Throughput, and the customers’ device characteristics like the handset type to conduct a deep user experience analysis. The network parameters are all columns in the dataset. The following questions are your guidance to complete the task. For this task, you need a Python script that includes all solutions to tasks.

Task 3. 1 - Aggregate, per customer, the following information (treat missing & outliers by replacing with the mean or the mode of the corresponding variable):
Average TCP retransmission
Average RTT
Handset type
Average throughput
Task 3.2 - Compute & list 10 of the top, bottom and most frequent:
TCP values in the dataset. 
RTT values in the dataset.
Throughput values in the dataset.
Task 3.3 - Compute & report:
The distribution of the average throughput per handset type and provide interpretation for your findings.
The average TCP retransmission view per handset type and provide interpretation for your findings.
Task 3.4 - Using the experience metrics above, perform a k-means clustering (where k = 3) to segment users into groups of experiences and provide a brief description of each cluster. (The description must define each group based on your understanding of the data)

#### Tuesday 2023-07-11 18:57:07 by Joe Chrisman

aider: Added a custom MUI theme with a background color of `#131f33` for the header and footer components.

# Context:
USER: I added these *read-write* files: requirements.txt
ASSISTANT: Great! Now that you have added the `requirements.txt` file, we can modify it to include the necessary packages for your Vite project. However, since Vite is a JavaScript tool, it doesn't have any Python dependencies that would be listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

If you want to add Python dependencies to your project, you can list them in the `requirements.txt` file. If you want to add JavaScript dependencies, you would typically add them to a `package.json` file in your project.

Could you please clarify what changes you want to make to the `requirements.txt` file?
USER: React, React Router, MUI
ASSISTANT: To add React, React Router, and MUI (Material-UI) to your project, you'll need to modify your `package.json` file, not the `requirements.txt` file. The `requirements.txt` file is for Python dependencies, while the `package.json` file is for JavaScript dependencies.

If you don't have a `package.json` file yet, you can create one by running `npm init -y` in your project directory. This will create a `package.json` file with default values.

Once you have a `package.json` file, you can add React, React Router, and MUI by running the following commands:

```bash
npm install react react-dom
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

These commands will add the packages to your `package.json` file and install them in your project.

If you need to modify the `package.json` file directly, please provide it as a *read-write* file.
USER: could I you evaluate my package.json and suggest changes to avoid vulnerablilities?
ASSISTANT: Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. However, I'll need you to provide the `package.json` file as a *read-write* file so I can evaluate it and suggest changes. Could you please add the `package.json` file to the list of *read-write* files?
USER: Assist me with building my existing application
ASSISTANT: Sure, I'd be happy to help you build your existing application. However, I'll need more information to provide accurate assistance. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What is the programming language and framework of your application?
2. What is the current state of your application? Is it complete and you're trying to build it for production, or are you facing issues during development?
3. Are there any specific areas or issues you need help with?
4. Please provide any relevant files or code snippets that you're working with. If there are any error messages, please provide those as well.

The more details you provide, the better I can assist you.
USER: the programming language is TypeScript and React. I am using the latest Vite tool. I am in the process of planning the structre of the site and will be working on this on localhost. I must create a single-page-application that leverages the latest @MUI react framework. There will be a consistent header and footer that won't change. The header will feature a navigation list, positioned horizontally for desktop and converts to the horizontal MUI drawer navigation. The footer will contating the @copyright and the dynamic insertion of the year. Between the Header and Footer will be the stage, where react-router will dynamically pull the "pages" listed in the navigation. The homepage main heading is "Gift Transmittal Forms", followed by the following paragraph: "Gifts/non-gifts are to be submitted promptly once received in your department. The form should be mailed or hand-delivered (cash) to the address noted on the form. Forward any unsigned checks, address changes, deceased notices, or replies without checks, etc. to the GPSSO with a memo explaining the nature of the change or problem. The GPSSO will coordinate the appropriate changes in CRM." and "If you have any questions when filling out your gift transmittal please contact Gift Administration at 217-333-0675." Below that, a secondary heading called "Cash, Check, Gift in Kind" is shown, all the subheaders should have a background color of '#cccccc'. Leverage MUI's typography for all presentational/frontend code.
ASSISTANT: To create your single-page application (SPA) with TypeScript, React, Vite, and MUI, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Project Setup**: Initialize your project with Vite and the desired template. Since you're using TypeScript and React, you can use the `react-ts` template:

```bash
npm init vite@latest my-app --template react-ts
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate into your new project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install react-router-dom @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

3. **Project Structure**: Create the necessary components for your application. Here's a basic structure:

- `src/App.tsx`: This is your main application component. It should include your router and main layout (header, footer, and main content area).
- `src/components/Header.tsx`: This component will contain your header and navigation.
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`: This component will contain your footer.
- `src/pages/Home.tsx`: This component will be your homepage.

4. **Routing**: In your `App.tsx` file, set up your routes using `react-router-dom`. For now, you can just have a route for your homepage.

5. **Header and Footer**: In your `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` files, use MUI components to create your header and footer. For the header, you can use the `AppBar` component for the navigation bar, and the `Drawer` component for the mobile navigation. For the footer, you can use the `Typography` component to display the copyright notice.

6. **Homepage**: In your `Home.tsx` file, use MUI's `Typography` component to display your headings and text. You can use the `Box` component with a background color to display your subheaders.

7. **Styling**: Use MUI's styling solution, Emotion, to style your components. You can define your styles in a separate file and import them in your components, or define them directly in your components using the `sx` prop.

Please note that this is a high-level overview and might not cover all the specific needs for your project. If you have more specific requirements or need help with a specific part of your project, please provide more details.
USER: This is my project structure at this time. Please use this for futute context.
ASSISTANT: I'm sorry, but I can't see your project structure. Could you please provide more details or clarify your request?
USER: |-- Dockerfile
|-- index.html
|-- package-lock.json
|-- package.json
|-- public
|   `-- vite.svg
|-- src
|   |-- App.css
|   |-- App.tsx
|   |-- assets
|   |   `-- react.svg
|   |-- index.css
|   |-- main.tsx
|   `-- vite-env.d.ts
|-- tsconfig.json
|-- tsconfig.node.json
`-- vite.config.ts

ASSISTANT: Thank you for providing the project structure. It seems like you have a standard Vite project setup with TypeScript and React. Here's a brief description of the important files and directories:

- `Dockerfile`: This file is used by Docker to build a Docker image of your application.
- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file for your application. It's the entry point for your app and usually contains a root div where your React app is injected.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: These files are used by npm to manage your project's dependencies.
- `public`: This directory usually contains static assets that aren't processed by Webpack (Vite's underlying bundler).
- `src`: This directory contains your TypeScript and React source code.
  - `App.tsx`: This is the main React component for your app.
  - `main.tsx`: This is the entry point for your React app. It renders your `App` component into the root div in `index.html`.
- `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`: These files are used by TypeScript to configure the TypeScript compiler.
- `vite.config.ts`: This file is used by Vite to configure the build process.

Based on your previous message, you'll likely need to create additional directories and files in the `src` directory for your components and pages. For example, you might have a `components` directory for your `Header` and `Footer` components, and a `pages` directory for your `Home` page.

If you have any specific questions or need help with a specific part of your project, please let me know!
USER: please give me the bash command to create all the necessary files that will live in the src.
ASSISTANT: Sure, here are the bash commands to create the necessary directories and files in your `src` directory:

```bash
cd src
mkdir components pages
touch components/Header.tsx components/Footer.tsx pages/Home.tsx
```

These commands will create a `components` directory and a `pages` directory inside your `src` directory. It will also create `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` files in the `components` directory, and a `Home.tsx` file in the `pages` directory.

Please note that these commands assume that you're currently in the root directory of your project. If you're in a different directory, you'll need to adjust the `cd src` command accordingly.
USER: The header and footer both have the background color of #131f33. This should be part of a theme modification that should be done with MUIs framework. Explain the best way to do this.
ASSISTANT: Material-UI (MUI) provides a theming solution that allows you to define a custom theme and use it across your application. You can define a custom theme and provide it to your application using the `ThemeProvider` component.

Here's how you can define a custom theme with a background color of `#131f33` for the header and footer:

1. First, install the necessary MUI packages:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @mui/system
```

2. Create a new file `src/theme.ts`:

```typescript
src/theme.ts
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
=======
import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#131f33',
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

3. Then, in your `src/App.tsx` file, import the `ThemeProvider` component and your custom theme, and wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider`:

```typescript
src/App.tsx
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      // Your app content here
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
=======
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import theme from './theme';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <div className="App">
        // Your app content here
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

4. Now, in your `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` files, you can use the `useTheme` hook to access your custom theme and apply the background color to your components:

```typescript
src/components/Header.tsx
src/components/Footer.tsx
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
import React from 'react';

function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      // Your header content here
    </header>
  );
}

export default Header;
=======
import React from 'react';
import { useTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';
import Box from '@mui/material/Box';

function Header() {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <Box sx={{ backgroundColor: theme.palette.primary.main }}>
      // Your header content here
    </Box>
  );
}

export default Header;
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

Replace `Header` with `Footer` for the `Footer.tsx` file.

This will apply the background color `#131f33` to your header and footer.

aider: Added Vite project setup to the Dockerfile in benchmark directory.

# Context:
USER: Build a web application using the contents of package.json
ASSISTANT: I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. The provided files don't include a package.json file, which is typically used in JavaScript projects. The files you've provided are for a Python project. Could you please provide more details or clarify your request?
USER: I want to create a React project. How do I begin?
ASSISTANT: To create a new React project, you'll need to use Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Here are the steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. You can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can create a new React project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Replace "my-app" with the name you want for your project.

3. This will create a new directory with the name you specified, and it will set up the initial project structure and install the necessary dependencies. Once the setup is complete, navigate into your new project directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

4. Now you can start the development server and open the app in your browser:

```bash
npm start
```

Your new React app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Please note that this is a general guide and might not cover specific needs for your project. If you have more specific requirements, please provide more details.
USER: Are you able to help me build an application outside this pyton project? I want t create a Vite project.
ASSISTANT: Yes, I can guide you through creating a new Vite project. Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It provides a development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a build command for production.

Here are the steps to create a new Vite project:

1. First, ensure you have Node.js (version 12.0.0 or higher) installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Install create-vite, a tool to create a new Vite project:

```bash
npm init @vitejs/app
```

3. You'll be prompted to name your new project and choose a template. For a React project, you can choose the `react` or `react-ts` (if you want to use TypeScript) template.

4. Once the setup is complete, navigate into your new project directory:

```bash
cd my-vite-project
```

Replace "my-vite-project" with the name you gave your project.

5. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

6. Now you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your new Vite project should now be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Please note that this is a general guide and might not cover specific needs for your project. If you have more specific requirements, please provide more details.
USER: Are you able to generate assets on my local file system?
ASSISTANT: As an AI, I don't have the ability to directly interact with your local file system to generate assets or perform any other operations. However, I can guide you through the process of generating assets or any other tasks you need to perform on your local system. If you have any specific requirements or tasks you need help with, please provide more details.
USER: @vitejs/create-app is deprecated, use npm init vite instead
ASSISTANT: You're correct, the `@vitejs/create-app` package is deprecated. The recommended way to create a new Vite project is now with `npm init vite`. Here are the updated steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js (version 12.0.0 or higher) installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Run the following command to create a new Vite project:

```bash
npm init vite@latest
```

3. You'll be prompted to name your new project and choose a template. For a React project, you can choose the `react` or `react-ts` (if you want to use TypeScript) template.

4. Once the setup is complete, navigate into your new project directory:

```bash
cd my-vite-project
```

Replace "my-vite-project" with the name you gave your project.

5. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

6. Now you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your new Vite project should now be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Please note that this is a general guide and might not cover specific needs for your project. If you have more specific requirements, please provide more details.
USER: how should I make changes to this project to run it in a Docker instance?
ASSISTANT: To run your Vite project in a Docker instance, you'll need to create a Dockerfile. This file will contain instructions for Docker to build an image of your application. Here's a basic example:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Make port 5000 available to the outside world
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application when the container launches
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

You can create this Dockerfile in the root directory of your project. Here's how you can build and run your Docker image:

1. Build your Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-vite-app .
```

Replace "my-vite-app" with whatever you want to name your Docker image.

2. Run your Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-vite-app
```

Your Vite app should now be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), but inside a Docker container.

Please note that this Dockerfile is very basic and might not cover specific needs for your project. If you have more specific requirements, please provide more details.
USER: I added these *read-write* files: benchmark\Dockerfile
ASSISTANT: Great! Now that you have added the Dockerfile, we can modify it to set up your Vite project. Here's how you can modify your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
benchmark\Dockerfile
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
FROM python:3.8-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y less git
COPY requirements.txt /aider/requirements.txt
RUN pip install lox typer pandas matplotlib imgcat aider-chat
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r /aider/requirements.txt
WORKDIR /aider
=======
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

This Dockerfile will set up a Node.js environment, copy your project files into the Docker image, install your project's dependencies, and start your Vite development server.

You can build and run your Docker image with the following commands:

1. Build your Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-vite-app .
```

Replace "my-vite-app" with whatever you want to name your Docker image.

2. Run your Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-vite-app
```

Your Vite app should now be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), but inside a Docker container.

Please note that this Dockerfile is very basic and might not cover specific needs for your project. If you have more specific requirements, please provide more details.

Minor changes to the Syndicate Battle Sphere ruin (#2045)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Various fixes for provinggrounds.dmm, mainly the server room and SMES.
Server room is no longer filled with black box recorders, but salvagable
servers. There is now one singular black box recorder in the center
where a black box on a table was. The SMES now should actually charge
the ruin. Tossed a medkit in one of the halls for players to use while
clearing the ruin. Replaced about half of the syndicate researcher mobs
with syndicate operatives who will actually fight the players. Rotated
an airlock missed in the map updates for anywalls.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
boy, i sure love functional ruins! also players should not have 25 of a
very rare potential quest item. The ruin can stay as it is otherwise,
because it provides a fun challenge for superbly well armed players (or
a rugged explorer with nothing but a lazer gun and a dream) with a
fitting reward at the end of a mounted LMG.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Syndicate Battle Dome (provinggrounds.dmm) should now have a
functional SMES and airlocks/blast doors.
fix: Syndicate Battle Dome (provinggrounds.dmm) no longer has ~20 black
box recorders and now only has one.

TileTest Part 1: Big Sweeping Changes! (#2054)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->
## !! WARNING !!
This is a multi-parter PR. Due to the fact that tiles here on shiptest
are an unholy amalgam of decals, greyscale sprites and multiple
spread-out files, things are *bound* to look weird. If they do, feel
free to report it and it will be addressed in future PRs.

## About The Pull Request

This PR finally accomplishes the promise I made to @triplezeta a year
ago, creating a unique tileset for the server that people may enjoy!

To put every single microscopic change I have made would take forever,
so I will instead provide a series of screenshots of it in action!

## Why It's Good For The Game
Utilizing an unique, modernized tileset for our server to differentiate
from our competitors is something that has been requested, and I was
more than happy to lend my hand to make it a reality!
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be

#1 PubSub technically not necessary for this

Propagating from the parent LiveView to a component is as easy as using `send_update`. My problem now comes from wanting to trigger notifications from a background process. The only LiveViews in these instances are the page. The sidebar is a stateless component.

We could use live_session and on_mount to always mount a pubsub subscribe but what catches the events? Each damn page? I need to make Sidebar a LiveView and look into `:sticky` usage. This really fucking sucks honestly. I took enough of a detour just trying to nest the sidebar as a LiveComponent. This helped me greatly: https://stackoverflow.com/a/66325108

Rat RP expansion (#76455)

## About The Pull Request

This fixes a vile and long-standing bug where putting a mouse inside
your hat would not allow the mouse to control your movements, as it
would pop out of the hat whenever it tried to move.
Additionally as a feature this allows a mouse sitting on your head to
convey complicated instructions such as "scream" or "do a flip", via
emoting. Through drift compatibility, the rat's living mech will also
perform this action.

I could have made this into a component but there's no fucking way any
other item is going to have this behaviour, so I didn't.

## Why It's Good For The Game

This feature was already in the game but broken and I want it not to be
broken.
The mouse should be able to control your entire life.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Placing a mouse inside your chef hat will once more allow it to
pilot you around.
add: A player-controlled mouse inside your chef hat can compel you to
perform complex actions, such as flipping and spinning. You will obey
because the mouse knows better than you do.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

[MIRROR] New Wizard spell "branch": Vendormancy [MDB IGNORE] (#22008)

* New Wizard spell "branch": Vendormancy (#75679)

## About The Pull Request
New item for wizards, ~~the Staff~~ Scepter of Runic Vendormancy.

With it, you can summon Runic Vending machines to block your enemies,
push them 2 tiles back around the summoning tile, throw the vendors 4
tiles away to squash them or simple detonate the vendors for direct
damage against enemies within a 2 tile range.

The scepter has 3 charges that can be recharged after a "long" channel
so while powerful, it is a tactical weapon and wizards can't directly
steamroll the crew with endless vendors. (Unless they buy multiple
scepters, but that is just funny.)

Also, there is a bug with the throw... I copied how baseball bats deal
with knockback, but they consistently don't push the vendors back, just
spin them on the same tile... I appreciate if anyone has any idea on how
to fix or change that to a better system.

## New changes I made
The vendor has a random set of REAL wizard robes and hat, sandals and a
foam vendor scepter as products to sell now.
This gives the crew some real armor, and if it is considered too much, I
can swap it for the fake versions.
IMO the real clothes work as the perfect bait for the crew to approach
the vendors and get exploded in the process, and while a random
assistant might get real wizard armor to go valid hunt the wizard, the
crew might just mistake them for the real wizard and beat them to death,
which is too funny.
## Why It's Good For The Game

![vendormancerPR](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/55374212/f9d98f3e-5916-4a17-987e-249f4cdb7185)

About a year ago I played Stoneshard, and it has such an amazing
Geomancy Wizard that I wanted to port some of its gameplay to SS13 as
our wizards, while funny and destructive, are kinda simple to play...

Summoning and blowing up rocks was nice, but I randomly had the idea of
summoning Vendors while at work and vendors squashing people has become
such an iconic SS13 thing to me that I had to stop being lazy and start
working on this.

Something, something, enviromental combat wizard.
## Changelog
Gonna polish the changelog later too...
:cl: Guillaume Prata
add: New Wizard spell branch: Vendormacy! Summon runic vending machines
with your Vending Scepter, force push them on your enemies to squish
them or blow them up while they are busy buying from the machines.

⚡️  NICE-58 performance updates (#1703)

Would like to finally move a parallel website outside of this repo into here, heh:

## Commits

- ⚡️  dont use esm import for radix-ui [b]
- ⚡️  i actually think this hurts perf now ☉_☉ [b]
- ⚡️  cx (!twMerge); 404 link home 
- ⚡️  (next) dynamic !ssr is not ... well working
- ⚡️  siteColors; next/dynamic; cx-vs-twMerge
- 📌  (deps) `@types.node@18.11.9`
- ♻️  moving files around again
- 🚨  (tailwind) tap-dance around siteColors narrowed list
- ⚡️  tsup build; lhci improvements; tailwind
- ⚡️  icon first visually, second in html
- ⚡️  (notion) !EmojiWrapper for now
  - Aye, since `notion` is pretty much _the reason_ for the website, delaying the imports for `node-emoji|emoji-regex` ends up doing nothing but causing more threads to happen.
  - Turning off for now. Instead should pass a configuration setting if people want this or not.
  - I say yes, though descriptors leave a lot to be desired, especially as visually it is better with spacing
  - Acceptable performance hit/trade-off in my estimation. But geez, that was hard to figure out, haha.
- 🐛  (next) Image.client, and optimizations
  - Pass `sizes` 😑 haha how was this also turned off?
- 🚚  (next) static is redundant, + favicon/manifest
  - No need for PWA but some things are nice
- 🔐  (next) _privateFolders
- 🔧  (tsconfig) shared for dev|prod split due to aggressive next
- ⚡️  (next) preconnects, final meta stuff, ship 🚀
  - Ah yes, forgot the `preconnect` hack 🤣
  - Added some more meta stuff too while we were here
  - Altered some sizing on large screens
- 👷  (e2e) npx not pnpm for random installs
  - This should not break `pnpm|turbo` cache -- right? 🙏🏻 

## Breakdown

- Site Architecture movement
- `next/dynamic` should be sparesly used I think
  - If SSR _can_ load it, and it is not a heavy `css|js` hit, this would degrade non-js browsers
- `Emoji` This is not the way to do this, heh
  - yes `node-emoji` (`41.1kB`) and `emoji-regex` (`28.5kB`) are hits
  - but they serve a repetitive purpose _throughout_
  - this visual to html swap works but requires some trade-offs that I do not like
  - need to officially confirm about wrapping emojis with `alt` text too
- `twMerge` is a `~6kB` hit, but it does a lot of _good_
  -  Went through and made everything `cx` official
  - Only 1-2 needed `twMerge` still -- and can be done
- Move away from `framer-motion` until we can determine actual site use
  - `Loading` is not enough of a warranted reason
- Unused `css` from Radix-UI imports
  - On Development we go very dynamic in ensuring everything is available to us
  - For Production we should limit the amount of `css` where possible
  - This is not the _best_ way to go about this as it is confusing, but on the right track at least  
  - Need to tap-dance around dynamic imports and the _now_ excluded colors

`*` Accessibility:   This is/was due to Radix-UI Pills where we follow their lead on 4 BG 11 Text
  - Passes their tests, not Google
  - To appease we drop to 3 BG (though should be 4 BG on Light)

## Next Steps

Final port of un-shared stuff -- though we can probably just transpile or way past this short-term

SEO
  - Misleading as we need to plant-based beef up the Next Metadata generation
  - Recommendation: `/${slug}/seo` and continue to keep separate in KV
  - Also KV is probably not ideal and should we move to Postgres? TOO MNAY QUESTIONS
    - Upstash has no problems, but if we did Vercel we would hit their limits (through Upstash ... 🥴)
    
    
 ## Outcome

Aye, I'll take it. We have to do a `skip ci` to put `@main` back of the gh-action workflows:

Update README.md, removed "malicious packet injection"

First off, "packet injection" by itself would have worked.

Secondly, I'm really more interest in remote kernel exploitation than packet injection, which is a separate concept.

From what I can find online, there are examples of packet injection being used for code injection, but it's mostly used for on-path attacks and DoS attacks, which I'm less interested in. Not uninterested in! They aren't beneath me! Just less interested.

Thirdly, it's nice to simplify back to just kernel exploitation. No chaining from packet injection necessary! Or, in a sense, packet injection is a part of kernel exploitation, sort of.

Dan Rosenberg used what appears to be an injected packet (an evil ROSE frame compiled and sent using rose_call) in his remote kernel exploit to cause an overflow and gain control of the EIP. This is the part of the kernel exploit that makes it doable remotely and it's done by abusing a network protocol.

From what I can tell, packet injection is one common piece of a broader remote kernel exploit. So I don't need to specify packet injection + kernel exploitation. That's covered under "remote kernel exploitation."

Fourthly, this simplification to a single phrase is nice because it makes it feel like it's less intimidating to me. Consolidating the concept into one idea is useful. In my mind, it means I can hyperfocus on "remote kernel exploits" rather than "kernel exploits" and "packet injection" even if "remote kernel exploits" include forms of packet injection.

Fifthly, it's also more communicative, because I'm not interested in packet injection as a general concept. My interest in it is mostly as a means of kernel exploitation. As I said, I'm not especially interested in DoS attacks or MITM attacks or even cheating in mobile phone games.

It's not that packet injection isn't interesting to me. It is, and I even performed a (simulated) MITM attack today in the INE's PTS. Obviously, I have to understand it and put it in my utility belt to be a pentester or a red teamer, and I'll give it the proper respect it's due.

It's just that this part of my bio is meant to showcase what I'm most interested in, and what really fascinates me the most is kernel exploitation. I have nothing against packet injection. I'm just more interested in kernel exploits.

So this might be me inadvertently showing the depths of my ignorance, but as I make this commit I still consider myself a "green hat" and a noob, so that's fine. If this update does turn out to be particularly dumb on my part, future updates will hopefully show how much I've grown.

...of course, nobody reads these except me, so this concern is a little neurotic.

Add flags to go-template context for print action

Fixes #85.

To be able to pass the entire set of flags around, I factored them out
of the Render struct into a new dedicated struct, `renderFlags`.

Q: Why only expose some flags? Why expose `--dest` but not
`--force-overwrite`?
A: API parsimony. We should limit the things we expose to just the
things which we know are useful, since we'll have to support this in
the future. We can always expose more flags later.

Q: Why only expose these flags to the print action?
A: We want to avoid the temptation for template authors to be
inappropriately clever. We think we've provided a single correct way to
do things, and we don't want people macking weird hacks unnecessarily.
We want template rendering to be deterministic, and not change in
surprising ways depending on flag values.

Since we're adding a new `{{.flags}}` namespace, we now forbid a
template from declaring an input named `flags`, to avoid collisions.

[geometry] Add Meshcat::GetRealtimeRate (#19700)

Tidy up recent Meshcat changes:
- Add missing pydrake bindings.
- Strongly prefer testing the public API (eschew test-friendship hacks).
  We want to guard against regressions in the end-user experience;
  using private API goes against that goal.
- Fix indentation, typos, and eschew abbreviation.

[MIRROR] Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited [MDB IGNORE] (#22216)

* Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited (#76492)

## About The Pull Request
This is one of those "can I get away with making a change I want" PRs.

I actually didn't know this had been changed before as it's not exactly
something I mess with often, but I really think it sucks. Plasma stuff
is supposed to ignite and cause fires, not explode (unless in a TTV). I
noticed this when I was poking around and found out that apparently
Disco Inferno just explodes now instead of setting on fire which also
sucks.

I figure there's a few fixes for this problem:

1) Nerf how hard plasma stuff explodes. This is an option, but I kind of
dislike that it does it at all more than anything. The biggest issue is
that just the regular statues explode with 20 LIGHT, which is pretty
fucking massive and basically just delimbs everyone around. I'd have to
nerf it HARD for it to get anywhere near what I think is acceptable.
2) Make a snowflake version of the statue that just ignites on hit with
a torch. I also don't like this because it'll make people think the
regular statues don't explode.
3) This option, which I think is cleaner and just makes sense compared
to the others.

I don't know if @ vincentiusvin still codes, but as far as I can tell
this was their doing, so it's only fair they get to speak up.

Fixes #71894

## Why It's Good For The Game
I don't like it, I think it goes against what we're used to for plasma
stuff (that it starts fires, not makes explosions) and it makes one of
my favorite shuttles boring and stupid. That being said, I'm honestly
not going to fight for this too hard if a lot of people like it, but I
am - as always - open to alternatives.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
del: Plasma objects (statues, toilets, etc.) no longer explode when
ignited. They just release plasma like everything else plasma. (This
doesn't impact injecting plasma into cells or dipping cigars in plasma,
those still explode.)
/:cl:

* Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited

[MIRROR] Expanding the Experimental MODsuit Bepis Node with three new modules. [MDB IGNORE] (#21851)

* Expanding the Experimental MODsuit Bepis Node with three new modules. (#75801)

## About The Pull Request
So, I've had this idea to make a contribution to the Bepis feature with
some modsuit stuff. The gimmicky stuff is ok and a good way to even out
the better content since it has game of chance design it has (you can
find those disks in space anyway so...). However, the Experimental
MODsuit node feels very underwhelming right now, compared to how big
that feature is.

This PR adds three MOD modules to the Experimental MODsuit node, plus
two more:
- Magneto Charger: While the Modsuit is activated, each step the user
takes will charge the installed power cell by a tiny bit, enough to
sustain a standard modsuit of generic slow speed with only a few, easy
modules installed. It won't work in zero G, while flying, pulled by
someone else, on a conveyor belt, riding a vehicle or crawling on the
floor, though.
- Recycler: It collects (most) garbage and casings off the ground and
recycles them into material sheets that can be dispensed on an adjacent
location or storage with with Middle Mouse Button. Doesn't clean debris,
and scuffed because most trash doesn't yield material anyway.
- - It also has two subtypes, unbound from the node: one that dispenses
riot foam darts and can be found on the black market, and another that
dispenses the more innocuous foam darts, rarely found in maints.
- Shooting Assistant: A configurable module. On Stormtrooper mode, it
will give the user a faster fire rate (the double tap trait) at the cost
of accuracy. On Sharpshooter mode, it will improve the user accuracy and
make their shots ricochet against walls at least once (if the hit atom
allows that, that is, e.g. lasers don't ricochet against iron walls), at
the cost of movement speed. Both modes also prevent the user from dual
wielding guns.

To make the Stormtrooper mode stackable with the poor aim quirk and
refrain from making a new trait for the sharpshooter mode, the gun
spread code in gun.dm has also received a little refactor and cleanup.
Also, it's been tested.

## Why It's Good For The Game
The Experimental MODsuit node is quite shabby and could use something
extra to make it more appealing to MODsuit enjoyers.

Also doubles down as a small addition to the black market and maint
loot, and code cleanup, since gun code gives off some garbled vibes.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Expanded the Experimental MODsuit Bepis node with three new
modules: Magneto Charger, Recycler and Shooting Assistant.
add: Added a Riot Foam Recycler module to the black market, as well a
more innocuous version as maint loot.
/:cl:

* Expanding the Experimental MODsuit Bepis Node with three new modules.

* update modular, I hate this file btw

disable icons in treemacs due to rendering bug

an annoying rendering bug causes directories named bin/ to have a
stupid, ugly icon, that doesn't seem to be dependent on the theme
applied, and that I cannot find a way to control.

Debugging this also made me notice an indentation problem for files
ending in .bash and .sqlite which I had previously applied custom
icons to. I was unable to even get this far with the bin directory due
to limitations with Treemacs's documentation.. it only documents how
to create custom icons for files, and these suffer from the
indentation problem.

Maybe this is due to my config, maybe not, but the bin dir was making
me want to stab my eyes out and at least now, with the icons disabled,
it looks nice again and it is perhaps even nicer than it was to start
with. All I know is that I can see the files in their tree layout and
it doesn't make my eyes bleed anymore. Fine.

Revert this commit if they ever fix the problem upstream. I lost two
and a half hours to trying to fix it here, I'm done. Disabled icons is
fine. Fuck.
