Almayer AntiTheft measures. (#5100)

STOP STEALING SHIT
# About the pull request
Adds a subtype of reinforced hull for the Almayer that changes between
indestructible hull and normal reinforced wall after hijack.
Uses this wall type around uniform vendors, the separation wall in the
firing range and around engineering storage.

# Explain why it's good for the game
Having the engineering storage looted at round start is just silly
avoidance of the "don't deconstruct the whole ship without a reason"
rule.

# Testing Photographs and Procedure

I have verified that all works as intended, the walls cannot be harmed
prior to hijack, and shutters function as advertised.

# Changelog
:cl:
add: Added a new almayer hull type (heavy reinforced) which is
indestructible by normal means until after hijack collision.
add: Added a new subtype of shutter that automatically opens or closes
depending on security level.
maptweak: Maps both of the above around the engineering storeroom. Also
adds the walls between the firing ranges and around uniform vendors.
maptweak: Manual control button for shutters over engineering storage in
the CEs office.
code: Changes hijack structural changes (walls/windows/windoors/ladders)
to use signals.

lowers DS sentrygun to 200 from 500 (#5225)

# About the pull request
lowers price of DS installed sentrygun to 200 from 500.

# Explain why it's good for the game

Based on git lense, the cost of 500 points has been fixed for at least 6
years ( from what I understand form the moment the fabricator was
added?). The sentryguns are not worth 500 points at the slightest, from
dozens of rounds of experience I can say that the fire off 20 shots max
before they die ( unless you do some DS hold after hijack, but that
hardly counts). The main issue anyone has with it is when you install 3
of them in south part of DS and I am willing t take suggestions how to
adress this issue, but it is minor one, as xenos never realy have to
fight them as they basicly get to shoot only while marines are pushed
into DS and are about to evac and queen can hijack without getting
anywhere near them ( or can just let marines evac and then take out the
sentryguns with ease after she calls the ship back down). More marines
evacing thanks to sentrguns might make the hijack more enjoyable for
both sides. Also lowering the price will only mean you see sentryguns
installed on ds more often, buying 20 of them will have no bigger effect
then 7.

Reworks The Visuals Of Independent And Nanotrasen Captains (#2453)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Does what it says in the title. This is a demented PR that touches a lot
of things, but its main benefit is that now regular independent
captains, cowboy independent captains, and nanotrasen captains have a
unique identity.

Of those changed, it includes:

- The Nanotrasen Captain (parade)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/48a31cb1-b266-43cb-9b6e-525028893011)

- The Nanotrasen Captain (regular)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/799c88f0-b7ce-4736-956d-2e9c0a096433)

- The Independent Captain (regular/parade)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/17ecb3d3-5f2f-4ce0-a518-81366945ebdf)

- The Independent Captain (western)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/a56a798c-5adf-41d7-917a-730661f306ed)

The PR also axes a bunch of unused, or frankly quite basic lieutenant
outfits that were nothing more than set dressing with not much substance
behind them. The roles were not removed for now, and they have
appropriate outfits as a placeholder pending a full removal.

This also means that the Head of Personnel was slightly touched up,
mostly by having a coat and hat similar to the western captain's when
appropriate. The role itself is pending a full visual rework for later
that is beyond the scope of this PR.

Speaking of removals, this also means that captain outfits/roles that
were there as a legacy of removed ships, were finally axed for good.
Goodbye deserter captain for Riggs variant number 4, you will not be
missed.

This PR also touches several (a lot) of maps, mostly adding/removing
outfits that were either missing, or didn't fit with the dress code of
the vessel.

Also the PR fixes an oversight by @MarkSuckerberg by making the BYOND
version warning an actual warning, instead of an error when compiling.
Etto bleh.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Visual cohesion is important, and dear fucking god if I see one more
independent western captain not wearing the duster because it wasn't in
the ship, I will weep, and my weeping will cause a biblical deluge.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl: PositiveEntropy

violently reworked.

It's not because I'm working alone on this that I should work as a
savage. I thought it will be fun to integrate the linting steps as
reviews from the github action bot (Yeah, I know it might not sound
fun but it is !).

Got a MetaQuest 3 for Christmas from my insanely crazy wife. Guess
that this project will take another slow down because I'll try to

{Icemoon, Ruin} The Crashed Holemaker (#2413)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Adds a brand-new - well, [new to
shiptest](https://cohost.org/bluwu016/post/885120-a-compilation-of-my) -
ruin to the Icemoon roster, focused on the service department.

It's flavored around being an *incredibly* old NT Spaceworks vessel
that's been carved in half and crashed - what's present only being the
fore of the ship. Being mainly service-focused, it's loot is pretty dry
~~as is it's sole threat.~~
If more current-day mappers/balance-heads have any words about how to
fluff out either of those pools a bit more with the screenshots below,
lemme know. I'll listen well.

(Notarized loot summary removed as updating it was a pain in the ass,
lmao.)

It strikes me as leaning on the underwhelming side from looking at the
other ruins present here but we'll. See? I suppose? It's good practice
for me in the whole, "making something I have memorized and that looks
good normally look sicker ruined".

<details><summary>Pictures (All but SDMM Outdated)</summary>
<p>

Ignore that there's no rust, the firelocks are open here, and some
stuff's knocked around, I was testing it prior to me tacking the rust on
and took pics after running around it in-person.

Roundstart AIs are positronic (#80355)

## About The Pull Request

If you disassemble an AI which was in the round from the start it will
produce a Positronic Cube rather than an MMI with the brain of that
player's usual human character in it.

Also I made changes to a couple of feedback balloon alerts which would
always trigger a runtime when constructing or deconstructing an AI, this
was because balloon alerts have a small time delay before executing and
we deleted the AI mob or structure after trying to show a balloon alert
on them, so they'd never appear.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Honestly this is _mostly_ about vibes, it has annoyed me since AI
deconstruction was added that Nanotrasen AIs tend to actually be brains
in jars rather than AIs. Now they're artifical.
It does also mean that you can't deconstruct the AI and then put its
brain into a human body, which is similarly mostly bad because of vibes:
If you sign up as an AI I think you should be an AI or a cyborg even
after deconstruction.

It also universally looks really stupid when you deconstruct an AI and
it says it has the brain of Penelope Dreadful in there, like should I
expect them to start RPing as their normal character instead of the AI
they have been playing all round now?

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Roundstart AIs are now made of positronic cubes, rather than
brains inside MMIs

fuck. i implemented it backwards

instead of using a blacklist now we have an opt in parameter in the find_target proc plus I fucked around with a bunch of other stuff. I ran it and tested and it seemed kinda busted but in theory this should work so I'll give it a proper test tomorrow im too tired today. also idk if non-progtots still exist

Makefile.lib: Lower kernel gzip compression to fastest

You're reading this - so you're trying to understand "JUST WHY OMG".
That's already a good step.

First of all, this is a downstream kernel - always keep that in mind!
Now, this kernel is targeting new *very powerful* Qualcomm platforms
like SM8250 and the Sony Edo platform - which has a very fast UFS card.

Keep in mind that the bootloader sets the CPU at a frequency that is
slightly faster than the "in the middle" ones, which is anyway not
veeeery fast - but that's good, really. I agree.

So.. check this out:   for Image.gz-dtb.....
COMP_LEVEL    SIZE
9             20116171
5      	      20220479
2      	      20940223
1      	      21231290

Remember again that we're loading from a UFS card and that
we are loading ~1.1MB more out of a 20MB file.
If you're smart enough you surely know already about RAM and CPU
overhead of very high compression levels.

If you still disagree with what I just did, read this commit description
another 20 times, or more, until you understand it. :)))

AOTAutograd: handle set_(), detect metadata mutations that cancel out (#111554)

This should be enough to get @voznesenskym 's FSDP branch to plumb `set_()` through AOTAutograd properly and have everything properly no-op out. Main changes are:

(1) graph break on `aten::set_.source_Tensor_storage_offset` (we could support it but it isn't needed, seems safer to graph break)

(2) Functionalization: add a "proper" functionalization kernel for `aten::set_.source_Tensor`. The previous one we had was codegen'd and it was wrong (it would just clone() and call set_(), which does not do the right thing). I also manually mark on the `FunctionalTensorWrapper` when a given tensor has been mutated by a `set_()` call.

(3) AOTAutograd: I added a new field, `InputAliasInfo.mutates_storage_metadata`, so we can distinguish between "regular" metadata mutations, and metadata mutations due to `set_()` calls. This is mainly because at runtime, one requires calling `as_strided_()` to fix up metadata, while the other requires calling `set_()`.

(4) Made AOTAutograd's detection for metadata mutations / set_() mutations smarter and detect no-ops (if the storage and metadata are all the same).

I also killed `was_updated()` and `was_metadata_updated()`, and replaced them with (existing) `has_data_mutation() ` and (new) `has_data_mutation()`, which can more accurately distinguish between data-mutation vs. `set_()` calls vs. metadata-mutation

**This PR is still silently correct in one case though**, which I'd like to discuss more. In particular, this example:
```
def f(x):
    x_view = x.view(-1)
    x.set_(torch.ones(2))
    x_view.mul_(2)
    return
```

If you have an input that experiences both a data-mutation **and** a `x_old.set_(x_new)` call, there are two cases:

(a) the data mutation happened on the storage of `x_new`. This case should be handled automatically: if x_new is a graph intermediate then we will functionalize the mutation. If x_new is a different graph input, then we will perform the usual `copy_()` on that other graph input

(b) the data mutation happened on the storage of `x_old`. This is more of a pain to handle, and doesn't currently work. At runtime, the right thing to do is probably something like:
```

def functionalized_f(x):
    x_view = x.view(-1)
    # set_() desugars into a no-op; later usages of x will use x_output
    x_output = torch.ones(2)
    # functionalize the mutation on x_view
    x_view_updated = x.mul(2)
    x_updated = x_view_updated.view(x.shape)
    # x experienced TWO TYPES of mutations; a data mutation and a metatadata mutation
    # We need to return both updated tensors in our graph
    return x_updated, x_output
def runtime_wrapper(x):
    x_data_mutation_result, x_set_mutation_result = compiled_graph(x)
    # First, perform the data mutation on x's old storage
    x.copy_(x_data_mutation_result)
    # Then, swap out the storage of x with the new storage
    x.set_(x_set_mutation_result)
```

There are two things that make this difficult to do though:

(1) Functionalization: the functionalization rule for `set_()` will fully throw away the old `FunctionalStorageImpl` on the graph input. So if there are any mutations to that `FunctionalStorageImpl` later on in the graph, the current graph input won't know about it. Maybe we can have a given `FunctionalTensorWrapper` remember all previous storages that it had, and track mutations on all of them - although this feels pretty complicated.

(2) AOTAutograd now needs to know that we might have *two* graph outputs that correspond to a single "mutated input", which is annoying.

It's worth pointing out that this issue is probably extremely unlikely for anyone to run into - can we just detect it and error? This feels slightly easier than solving it, although not significantly easier. We would still need `FunctionalTensorWrapper` to keep track of mutations on any of its "previous" storages, so it can report this info back to AOTAutograd so we can raise an error.

[MODULAR] Clothing improvements: renamable Chaplain equipment and holsters for all suit-slot items (#79)

## About The Pull Request

This PR does these simple things:

- Right-clicking almost any suit slot item with the shoulder holsters
item in hand will attempt to fit the holster to that item, allowing it
to be worn in its suit storage slot afterwards.
- It makes chaplain equipment renamable with a pen similar to forged
equipment and other toys.

The holster fix is going here instead of upstream because I don't
particularly want to argue with tg balancejaks about gun storage issues.

## How This Contributes To The Nova Station Roleplay Experience

Holsters are cool. Customize your tactical drip with a personalized
holster and promptly suffocate to death when the internals-storing slot
you took for granted for years is occupied with your gun. Visibly and
outwardly appear to be packing heat to anyone that looks at you with
your badass holster.

Chaplains can now customize their vendor equipment (that can actually
hold bibles) to better suit their given bit. This one has annoyed me in
particular on a few occasions.

PEP 695 `type` aliases x 6.

This commit is the next in a commit chain adding support for PEP
695-compliant type aliases (i.e., type hints instantiated by statements
of the form ``type {alias_name} = {alias_value}``, available under
Python ≥ 3.12), en-route to resolving feature request #297 kindly
submitted by the magical rainbow GitHub unicorn @EtaoinWu (Yue Wu).
Specifically, this commit continues attempting (but mostly failing) to
implement our pragmatic and defensible plan for tackling the most
problematic and troubling aspect of PEP 695 with respect to hybrid
runtime-static type-checking: PEP 695's horrifying, terrifying, and
frankly shocking lack of runtime support for resolving forward
references. Although PEP 695 repeatedly mic-drops forward references as
a central motivation for its existence, the actual runtime
implementation of PEP 695 lacks any support whatsoever for forward
references and even goes to elaborate and outrageous lengths to prevent
runtime-static type-checkers from resolving forward references embedded
in PEP 695-compliant type aliases. Yet again, a new runtime-hostile PEP
arises. Thankfully, this is @beartype. We do what we want here. And what
we want here is to fully dismantle PEP 695, break it, and then bend it
to our perfidious will until this Accursed Abomination Unto Nuggan does
what it was advertised but failed to do at runtime. So says the Bear.

Sadly, it would seem that most of my prior plans were mislaid and that
@beartype must now revert to a brutal application of hardcore AST
transformations just to force PEP 695 to comply with our will. Will you
just stop sucking it already, PEP 695? PEP 695 as if written by Terry
Pratchett:

[MISSED MIRROR] Fixes runtime relating to hard TGS reboots (PROBABLY WON'T FIX REBOOT CRASHES) (#25185)

Fixes runtime relating to hard TGS reboots (PROBABLY WON'T FIX REBOOT CRASHES) (#77309)

## About The Pull Request

Servers are crashing on every round restart and I have absolutely no
idea where to start, but I noticed this so I figure I'll throw up a PR
to fix it.

This is the runtime (only found in dd.log, sorry non-admin/maintainer
gamers
https://[tgstation13.org/raw-logs/sybil/data/logs/2023/08/01/round-211577/dd.log](https://tgstation13.org/raw-logs/sybil/data/logs/2023/08/01/round-211577/dd.log)
)

```txt
[00:07:07] Runtime in code/modules/logging/log_holder.dm,166: Attempted to call shutdown_logging twice!
  proc name: shutdown logging (/datum/log_holder/proc/shutdown_logging)
  src: /datum/log_holder (/datum/log_holder)
  call stack:
  /datum/log_holder (/datum/log_holder): shutdown logging()
  shutdown logging()
  world: Reboot(0, 0)
  Ticker (/datum/controller/subsystem/ticker): Reboot("Round ended.", "proper completion", 600)
```

This is the full log:


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/af938235-3076-41d5-98b2-02907dedb6d5)

This is the code:


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/371b11cb-3bc9-4a99-a17c-73968ded308d)

For some reason, even though we invoke `TGSEndProcess`, we still
continue on in this `if()` chain. I don't know why we keep executing DM
code after TGS is supposed to be shut down (which may be why no one has
ever included a `return` here, but let's be safe instead of sorry.

If you really want to investigate why TGS is running DM code after we
end the process, I am amenable to including a stack trace or crash of
this phenomenon instead.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Since we aren't invoking `LOG_CLOSE_ALL` to rust-g twice (which seems to
be really unwanted per the code I read), hopefully thing no crash?
Rust-g had two breaking changes (one with logs, and one with SQL), so
I'm presuming that this might be related to the log one (which is why we
didn't see this sorta thing happen pre-#77307)... Worst case scenario
less runtimes in the funny runtime log.

I hope this wasn't loadbearing either... Likely requires testmerging
since TGS and I don't get along on my machine.
## Changelog
:cl:
server: Added a preventative measure to prevent calling both
TGSHardRestart and TGSReboot, as well as potentially invoking sensitive
procs that are only meant to be called once.
/:cl:

TL;DR- I do not definitively know why servers are crashing but I noticed
this runtime so I'll put out this open flame while I have the time to do
so.

Implement __IMPLIED_TYPE__ (#368)

It turns out this kinda sucks. it doesn't work with ::, so we don't even
really need to care about its value. I threw in support for constant
eval but that's inconsistent on our end cause type_hint doesn't always
play. I figure it's good to at least have something, and issues can get
sorted out as we go.

It is also seemingly massively annoying to eval in like, an istype(), 
since it has special case behavior there. I just kinda left it sit 
since I'm pretty sure it'd be a massive change to support and it like 
does not matter.

Got this message.

Thanks for the tips. Right now, I already have a job doing some lightweight programming work. And I also have some health issues with my right hand, so I'm not looking for anything else. I did a bunch of applying in 2023 but I got so little interest that the next time I try this I'm going to go the freelancing route. I'm not convinced that resumes mean much, and it's more likely the case that I'd be better off showing a lot of earnings on a freelancing platform. I've read that once you go above 10K getting work becomes a lot easier.

The job I have right now is actually like that. Relatively speaking, it doesn't pay much, but I am working like one or two days a week to make an average monthly salary in Croatia. So, I kind of like it.

I did turn down 65K euro a year job in favor of it. So I guess my path is set.

///

9:10 AM. I'm going to make that those exercises My daily set. It's honestly very weird to me that my right shoulder is. in a difficult position. I shouldn't be having rsi on it. And starting to think that my entire arm is in some very messed up.

I don't under really understand why. If it was just finger side, understand it. But why is my thumb suffering?

///

In late 2021 I threw in the towel. I had grand dreams, but perhaps the biggest lie that I've been telling myself is that I wanted to make money. By doing so, I have been hoping to avoid the fate of an artist. I never thought much about people who say that they aren't in it for the money. I always thought that was a cope compensating for a lack of skill. But even so, having grand dreams didn't help me at all.

I studied AI for so long, and I practiced my programming skills as hard as I could. It was pretty hard training.

It kind of wouldn't have been possible for me to work any harder than I did. I gained a lot of skill.

But it wasn't enough.

It is true that I made progress, but the result of this venture reminds me of high school. Before it, the years that I spent there was a period of stagnation for me.

Before I entered it, in middle school, I was riding high. The year before, in my country of Croatia, I actually won the national programming championship in two different categories. Even though I was really weak back then, I thought that I was particularly good. Eventually, I entered high school and the difficulty of the problems increased drastically.

And I couldn't deal with them.

So I languished for 4 years.

Of course, if it were me right now, I'd take every gold medal there is at those high school competitions. Why?

The primary reason is that I'd actually seek out and study the learning resources as to how to solve the problems I encountered instead of trying to bash my head against the wall. But back then, if you asked me, I would have thought of that approach as being cheating.

I have told you that learning from others is not relying on your own power. It is a very headstrong and foolish attitude to have.

And ultimately, in high school, it was my downfall.

Now that I'm an adult, I thought that I've learned since then. I went into machine learning and did the exact opposite of what I did in high school. I wasn't arrogant like in my youth and I dove into studying resources and machine learning papers in hopes that this would increase my skill. But the problem is, I wanted to tackle and the approach I wanted to take wasn't something the research community could support.

In the end, when I couldn't find the answers that I thought in papers or books, I went back to my old approach of bashing my head against the wall. I inflamed my desire and relied on my own will and power.

And I lost.

But this makes me realize that even though I've learned a lot of things since I was a kid, I haven't really changed. Neither me now, nor me back then could go beyond the bounds of our talent. In the light of that, what does learning functional programming really mean? I haven't become greater. I am not superior to my old self.

As I look at him now, it feels like we are starting to look eye to eye. We are converging to an answer.

We now know enough to say that there is no other choice.

Back in high school, there were times when I thought that it would be great to search the space of all possible programs to find one that would solve those tough problems efficiently. But there were too many reasons why I wouldn't want to attempt such a thing.

1) It would be too inefficient to do such a search.
2) It would take too long to run the meta program.
3) It would be too hard to program.
4) It would take too much time to do.
5) The resulting solutions might not be comprehensible.
6) Somebody else had to have tried it and didn't get good results.
7) It would be better to rely on your own strength and power instead of the machines.
8) The computers are too slow to make such an approach viable.
9) The rewards of such a venture are too uncertain.

I guess what changed since then, is that I recognize these reasons as being excuses. It doesn't mean that they are invalid. But we need to look at reality.

If not true program search, how else are we going to go beyond the bounds of our talent? Doing random experiments like the research community is doing is not going to get me anywhere. Sure, maybe if they try this approach long enough they'll get lucky. A million people thrown at a problem will produce some kind of result.

But since you are very unlikely to get anything with such an approach yourself, it just means that you are playing the lottery. You are just defaulting to relying on other people for insight and knowledge.

Ultimately, the one brick you contribute to the pyramid of knowledge won't be enough.

Let's take it another way and look into the future.

Sure, right now, the researchers are just scaling up deep learning models and that isn't going to go anywhere. But in the future, eventually they're going to figure out what the human brain is doing and what the actual algorithms underlying intelligence are. As far as contributing to machine learning, neuro scientists have been pretty useless, but it's not going to be that way forever.

The brain recording technology is getting better as time passes. And I have no doubt that given enough time, people are going to figure out the algorithmic basis underlying human intelligence.

Right now, one could yearn for such an algorithm. I think if I knew what a brain was doing, I'd have a huge advantage right now. But in the future I would have the exact same problem as before.

At that point, we'd be at the human level of intelligence with regards to artificial agents.

But how would we go beyond that?

Would the human brain's algorithm be the absolute pinnacle of what is achievable in terms of thought? And once we reach that point, the only thing that would matter is to just add more compute and storage to it? No more work would need to be done.

I don't think that is likely. I don't think you can take a monkey brain and simply scale up the number of neurons and synapses in order to get a human brain. You probably wouldn't get a monkey by scaling up a dog.

Studying deep learning won't get us to whatever lies beyond, anymore than studying monkeys will get us to humans.

...

The problem with studying machine learning is that my efforts just amounted to so little. I could have studied anything else. And in fact, I did. And I got much more for the same effort. When I studied web development, I learned web development. When I worked on a programming language, I learned a lot about making programming languages as well as functional programming. When I made a machine learning library, I learned a lot about GPU programming and making machine learning libraries.

I implemented papers, and I tried out various machine learning ideas of my own. I don't think I really learned anything. I didn't learn anything beyond a particular algorithm working or failing in a particular context, in a way that didn't at all generalize to the wider universe.

The experiments were so laborious to make and they didn't teach me anything about intelligence.

Besides being unprofitable, this state of affairs had some gruesome side effects. Most notably, it made me afraid of going off the beaten path.

I might dislike deep learning, but you cannot deny that it is a framework. It has a purpose and its intention is to optimize arbitrary mathematical equations that have some good properties like continuity.

We can very well imagine that the basis of intelligence lies beyond deep learning.

We understand that we need to try out other things.

We understand that we need to go off the beaten path.

But out there, it is a jungle. It is easy to get lost.

We can imagine algorithms that go beyond deep learning, but we can never find the reasons to actually try them out.

And because of that, trying to venture off the beaten path would be akin to trying things out at random. Even if we found something better, it doesn't mean that we define the reason or the explanation for it.

So it is like we are hostage to deep learning. The research community keeps persisting with it in hopes that if they do enough experiments they'll find the enlightenment to do something better than it. They can only hope that the inspiration would come to them if they persist long enough with a failed approach.

But such inspiration will never come to those who lack courage.

I understand that now.

I understand that I need to make it my goal to go off the beaten path.

Otherwise, I will never exceed the bounds of my talent, and I will never find the power that I seek.

Most likely I won't be able to achieve anything by doing that.

But playing it safe didn't exactly work for me either. I've wasted enough of my life doing what is wrong, so I might as well waste the rest of it doing what is right.

It is only a coincidence that the collection of my particular skills is actually very suited for this kind of approach right now. Especially my programming language skills.

The reality is that I don't have anything better to do.

---

He and I were both wrong. Looking back, everything that has gone wrong in my life is rooted in that cowardice, and the lack of courage to tackle that challenge.

What I want now is to abandon my conceit and my worldly desires. There is no need for me to do much.

There is no need for me to be greedy for achievement.

There is no need for me to shake the world.

The only thing I can do is abstract away the process of research itself.

The only thing I can do is conquer the reason’s absence.

///

Here is the corrected essay. I think it flows pretty well right now. I don't know whether I'll leave to 40 or 80 but I'll dedicate the years I have left to this.

11:20am. Let me do some programming from here on out, even if I have to use voice. I'm going to do that training set from the video, maybe two or three times a day.

Simply put, my outer side is getting worse as time goes on, and it isn't healing. If it doesn't heal my life, it's pretty much over.

So I can only try out different things in hope that one of them works.

```
inl (ar : sa 7 card), _ = draw_cards x deck_utils.create()
```

I forgot that actual did the utility for drawing cards. I have no idea why I didn't replace the main loop. Anyway, let me do this, and then I'll start working towards implementing the game itself. That will be a big achievement. I'll implement the game with a random player. That is the next step in my journal. I'm just the following the path outlined in 2021."

Add Postpone API (#27238)

This adds an experimental `unstable_postpone(reason)` API.

Currently we don't have a way to model effectively an Infinite Promise.
I.e. something that suspends but never resolves. The reason this is
useful is because you might have something else that unblocks it later.
E.g. by updating in place later, or by client rendering.

On the client this works to model as an Infinite Promise (in fact,
that's what this implementation does). However, in Fizz and Flight that
doesn't work because the stream needs to end at some point. We don't
have any way of knowing that we're suspended on infinite promises. It's
not enough to tag the promises because you could await those and thus
creating new promises. The only way we really have to signal this
through a series of indirections like async functions, is by throwing.
It's not 100% safe because these values can be caught but it's the best
we can do.

Effectively `postpone(reason)` behaves like a built-in [Catch
Boundary](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26854). It's like
`raise(Postpone, reason)` except it's built-in so it needs to be able to
be encoded and caught by Suspense boundaries.

In Flight and Fizz these behave pretty much the same as errors. Flight
just forwards it to retrigger on the client. In Fizz they just trigger
client rendering which itself might just postpone again or fill in the
value. The difference is how they get logged.

In Flight and Fizz they log to `onPostpone(reason)` instead of
`onError(error)`. This log is meant to help find deopts on the server
like finding places where you fall back to client rendering. The reason
that you pass in is for that purpose to help the reason for any deopts.

I do track the stack trace in DEV but I don't currently expose it to
`onPostpone`. This seems like a limitation. It might be better to expose
the Postpone object which is an Error object but that's more of an
implementation detail. I could also pass it as a second argument.

On the client after hydration they don't get passed to
`onRecoverableError`. There's no global `onPostpone` API to capture
postponed things on the client just like there's no `onError`. At that
point it's just assumed to be intentional. It doesn't have any `digest`
or reason passed to the client since it's not logged.

There are some hacky solutions that currently just tries to reuse as
much of the existing code as possible but should be more properly
implemented.
- Fiber is currently just converting it to a fake Promise object so that
it behaves like an infinite Promise.
- Fizz is encoding the magic digest string `"POSTPONE"` in the HTML so
we know to ignore it but it should probably just be something neater
that doesn't share namespace with digests.

Next I plan on using this in the `/static` entry points for additional
features.

Why "postpone"? It's basically a synonym to "defer" but we plan on using
"defer" for other purposes and it's overloaded anyway.

Added sun rotation based on player position

- This has been an objective for a while that I finally got around to (clumsily) adding. Calculates the ratio of distance of the player from the south to north poles and uses that to set a rotation for the sun.
- The effect right now is that at the north and south ends of the island it's early morning or the evening, and in the central band of the island it's a bright sunny day.
- The idea being to provide a more subtle influence on the sun that means that specific buildings can be in a darker or brighter zone, plus that you can (subtly) see the shadows changing while you move around.
- (I also had the thought while doing this of tying the sun rotation to player movement in a more additive way -- that it rotates while you move and doesn't rotate when you're stopped. So days would pass via your movement. But I lose a ton of control over what the sun is doing in that situation, and I think I'd rather have the controllllll.
- I think this should be effective. I did have a "bug" where the y and z rotations were oscillating between two values while I changed the x which I assume is just my shitty understanding of Unity's transforms? I set them both to zero to avoid it for now, but that's probably going to be limiting sometime.
- Feels good to actually do something.
- The webgl build has jumped to 15MB somehow? A little concerning, but I'm just gonna forge on for now.

Allow dedicated page for each method (#543)

Part of fixing https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation/issues/542.

## Methods living on dedicated pages

Before Qiskit 0.44, methods lived on dedicated HTML pages. We changed
that in Qiskit 0.44 because it resulted in horrible build-time
performance when migrating `qiskit.org/documentation` from the old
Pytorch theme to the new Furo theme, so that instead methods lived
directly on their class pages.

It looks like the script `updateApiDocs.ts` was trying to emulate
methods living on class pages before Qiskit 0.44 through the file
`mergeClassMembers.ts`. This code attempted to remove the method pages
and instead have them live directly on the class pages.

I believe the original script author had `mergeClassMembers.ts` to try
to avoid performance issues. Until a fix a few weeks ago to the docs
application, having a huge amount of pages would cause the site to load
extremely slowly due to the left side bar being too large. That is now
fixed because the left side bar is loaded dynamically rather than
statically.

## `mergeClassMembers.ts` was causing problems

1. It looks like it wasn't behaving properly, at least some of the time.
We did not exhaustively audit every page, but for example,
https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/0.33/qiskit.result.Result only
had properties at the top, then a table summarizing all the methods
below, but not the methods actually inlined:

<img width="774" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-21 at 11 43 47 AM"
src="https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation/assets/14852634/576ff54a-763c-484d-bc3b-42068693b0d1">

2. We didn't know about this inlining when setting up qiskit.org
redirects, which do a 1:1 mapping so that dedicated method pages take
you to the dedicated method page on IBM, which was 404ing.

## Solution: allow dedicated method pages

By deleting `mergeClassMembers.ts`, the script will properly generate
dedicated HTML pages for each method.

We took this approach—rather than instead fixing
`mergeClassMembers.ts`—for a few reasons:

1. It allows us to avoid messing with our redirect rules, which are the
1:1 mapping.
2. We've gotten user feedback that the API docs are not as usable as
they could be. We are planning to fix that in
https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation/issues/479, but it won't be
fixed in time for putting out the fire of
https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation/issues/542. In the meantime, it
is more user-friendly to have dedicated method pages for those
historical API docs.

The biggest reason we would not want to take this approach of dedicated
method pages is the possible impact on performance mentioned above. But
that has been fixed already in the IBM application.

## Impact of this PR

No impact when generating docs where methods already live on class
pages, like Qiskit 0.44+.

For earlier Qiskit versions, it results in the method pages being
generated. Those will be added in follow up PRs.

#### Wednesday 2023-12-27 16:55:58 by Patrick Kidger

Now using the same jaxpr in the state.

This is quite an important fix!

The bit that matters here is that the `f_eval_info.jac` in
`AbstractGaussNewton.step` now throws away its static (non-array) parts
of its PyTree, and instead uses the equivalent static (non-array) parts
of `state.f_info.jac`, i.e. as were computed in
`AbstractGaussNewton.init`.

Now at a logical level this shouldn't matter at all: the static pieces
should be the same in both cases, as they're just the output of
`_make_f_info` with similarly-structured inputs.

However, `_make_f_info` calls `lx.FunctionLinearOperator` which calls
`eqx.filter_closure_convert` which calls `jax.make_jaxpr` which returns
a jaxpr... and so between the two calls to `_make_f_info`, we actually
end up with two jaxprs. Both encode the same program, but are two
different Python objects. Now jaxprs have `__eq__` defined according to
identity, so these two (functionally identical) jaxprs do not compare
as equal.

Previously we worked around this inside `_iterate.py`: we carefully
removed or wrapped any jaxprs before anything that would try to compare
them for equality. This was a bit ugly, but it worked.

However, it turns out that this still left a problem when manually
stepping an Optimistix solver! (In a way akin to an Optax solver:
something like
```python
@eqx.filter_jit
def make_step(...):
    ... = solver.step(...)

for ... in ...:  # Python level for-loop
    ... = make_step(...)
```
)
then in fact on every iteration of the Python loop, we would end up
recompiling, as we always gets a new jaxpr at
```
state      # state for the Gauss-Newton solver
  .f_info  # as returned by _make_f_info
  .jac     # the FunctionLinearOperator
  .fn      # the closure-converted function
  .jaxpr   # the jaxpr from the closure conversion
```
!

Now one fix is simply to demand that manually stepping a solver
requires similar hackery as we had in `_iterate.py`. But maybe enough
is enough, and we should try doing something better instead: that is,
we do what this PR does, and just preserves the same jaxpr all the way
through.

For bonus points, this means that we can now remove our special jaxpr
handling from `_iterate.py` (and from `filter_cond`, which also needed
this for the same reason).

Finally, you might be wondering: why do we need to trace two equivalent
jaxprs at all? This seems inefficient -- can we arrange to trace it
just once? The answer is "probably, but not in this PR". This seems to
require that (a) Lineax offer a way to turn off closure conversion
(done in https://github.com/google/lineax/pull/71), but that (b) when
using this, this still seems to trigger a similar issue in JAX, that
the primal and tangent results from `jax.custom_jvp` match. So for now
this is just something to try and tackle later -- once we do, we'll get
slightly better compile times.

## About The Pull Request

1. *Fixes Bug With Corporate Crates, Subtypes Them.*
2. *Removes Varedited Biohazard Bin and Places Normal Biohazard Bin.*
3. *Changes Advanced Voidsuit Name to Advanced Hardsuit.*

## Why It's Good For The Game

1. _I received reports of one specific corporate crate not rendering
properly when opened. As I inspected it, I realized it would be more
efficient to subtype all corporate crates, so I did that. HOWEVER, this
did not repair the initial bug. For some reason the crate was not
rendering its 'aethersecureopen' state, even though all variables and
code seemed to be working properly. No other crate exhibited this issue.
I discovered that by changing the name of the icon state from
'aethersecureopen' to 'aethersecopen', the state began to enforce and
render properly. I suspected it might be a name length issue, but tests
with other equally long icon states in the crate section disproved this
theory. This may warrant further investigation._
2. _This one avoided detection during my initial sweep through. Can't
remember who just went in and tried to varedit bins to fix biohazards,
but hopefully this is the last one they touched._
3. _This has been driving me crazy for a few days, and yesterday
especially. The Advanced Voidsuit is clearly misnamed, as it is in fact
a Hardsuit. When I tried to order these yesterday I overlooked this
cargo entry twice because I was looking for a hardsuit, not a voidsuit.
This just fixes the name._

Fix #7442 / multi threading dropped log entries issue (#18493)

## Summary & Motivation

This MR should (based on my code understanding and testing) fix [issue
7442](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues/7442). It also fixes
in general randomly dropped user written log messages if logs are being
recorded from multiple threads.
Logging is quite important and its quite annoying to work around this
limitation/bug.

Maybe @sryza or @OwenKephart can have a look, since they already looked
into the 7442 issue.

## How I Tested These Changes

I tested the changes locally with an op/graph, which starts multiple
threads and logs multiple messages in each thread.

```python
import logging
import threading
import time

from dagster import AssetKey, AssetMaterialization, Output, job, op, repository

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def background_thread(thread_name):
    for i in range(0, 5):
        logger.info(f"Background thread: {thread_name} {i}")
        time.sleep(0.5)


@op
def op1():
    yield AssetMaterialization(asset_key=AssetKey(["asset1"]))

    threads = []
    for thread_name in range(0, 5):
        thread = threading.Thread(
            name="background_thread",
            target=partial(background_thread, thread_name),
        )
        thread.start()
        threads.append(thread)

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    yield AssetMaterialization(asset_key=AssetKey(["asset2"]))
    yield Output(123)


@op
def op2(arg):
    logger.info(f"Result of op1: {arg}")


@job
def dropped_events_job():
    op2(op1())


@repository
def dropped_events_repository():
    return [dropped_events_job]
```

Without my change i was missing a significant chunk of the expected log
messages in the captured log output:

![dropped_logs_without_change](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/assets/17649269/d777483a-911b-4010-b2e3-48bf7128437d)

With my change i had the exact amount of log messages in the captured
log output that i expected:

![no_dropped_logs_with_change](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/assets/17649269/d09f3617-fa86-415c-b7de-0dadab078b5b)

I also tested the original reproducing code from
https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues/7442:

Without my change:

![grayed_out_op1_without_change](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/assets/17649269/c32c39ea-33a6-4207-a8c1-b8ddd30aa437)


With my change:

![green_op1_with_change](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/assets/17649269/fac597a6-4e2c-428b-afa4-f7695667ade7)


I am not that familiar with the dagster code. If you can point me to a
place where a unittest for this might go and some info on how to test it
in your opinion, than i will have a look at it.

Codifies male goats not having an udder (#79722)

## About The Pull Request

This was addressed in #78759 (1b1fde4908826ef5c54ffc0734e74028270af3fd)
and reviewed (and merged even though I didn't respond to it, oh well),
but I half-assed it because the whole point was to prevent male goats
from having an udder, but I only added it to the subtype of Pete i made
in that PR. Let's expand that to all male goats now.
## Why It's Good For The Game

It doesn't make biological nor morphological sense as to why a male goat
can provide milk. Ideally this should be like this for all animals
(because that's real life) but that's a later issue with further balance
implication.

I think it's still an interesting idea that Nanotrasen will just send
you any old goat despite it being "useless" beyond being very good at
eating plants. Maybe cargo should have a way to guarantee getting a
female goat in the future? It's just like real life where zoos and farms
have to constantly dealw ith female animals (such as giraffes or other
exotic stuff) tending to be far rarer/cost far more than their male
variants due to the potential to generate offspring (there's more nuance
to husbandry than this but just play along)... and in space, every
animal is "exotic".

It still remains possible to biogenerate milk, which tends to be far
faster than feeding/milking goats- which is something that the cook
should have access to anyways.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Male Goats should no longer spawn with an udder, instead of it
just being Pete.

experimental_use(promise) (#25084)

* Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises

This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when 
something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
can run, then continue in a new task.

I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
separate commit.

* Move throwException to after work loop resumes

throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right 
before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
render the fiber again.

This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
(RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the 
RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
from appearing.

* Use expando to check whether promise has resolved

Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
resolved.

In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
the resolved value.

This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
by `Promise.allSettled`.

The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
without waiting a microtask.

* Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook

Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
implement it yet.

* use(promise)

Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components, 
but that is planned.

If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
"immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in 
previous commits.

Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing 
whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.

When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
principles largely apply.

The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
be deprecated.

# puzzlegame
Creating a professional puzzle game involves several steps and depends on the platform and programming language you're using. Below is a simple example of a puzzle game using Python and the Pygame library. This example is a basic sliding puzzle game.

Feature of puzzle game

Puzzle games are a popular genre of video games that engage players in problem-solving activities, often requiring logical thinking, pattern recognition, and creativity. Here are some common features and characteristics of puzzle games:
1. **Problem Solving*: Puzzle games revolve around the core concept of problem-solving. Players are presented with challenges or puzzles that require creative thinking and strategic planning to solve.
2. **Logical Thinking**: Many puzzles demand logical reasoning and deductive skills. Players must analyze the information given, make connections, and come up with a solution based on sound reasoning.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Puzzle games often involve recognizing patterns within the game environment or the puzzle itself. This can include visual patterns, sequences, or spatial arrangements.

4. **Trial and Error**: Players may need to experiment with different approaches and solutions to find the correct one. This trial-and-error process is a common element in puzzle games.

5. **Progressive Difficulty**: Puzzle games often feature a progression of difficulty, starting with easier puzzles and gradually increasing the complexity as players advance through the game. This helps maintain engagement and provides a sense of accomplishment.

6. **Unique Mechanics**: Puzzle games frequently introduce unique gameplay mechanics or rules that set them apart. These mechanics contribute to the complexity and diversity of the puzzles.

7. **Story or Theme**: While not always a requirement, many puzzle games incorporate a story or thematic elements to provide context for the challenges. This can enhance the overall gaming experience and motivation for solving puzzles.

8. **Immersive Environments**: Puzzle games may be set in visually engaging and immersive environments. The design of the game world can contribute to the overall experience and may contain clues or hints for solving puzzles.

9. **Limited Resources or Moves**: Some puzzle games impose restrictions on resources, time, or the number of moves allowed. This adds an additional layer of challenge and encourages efficient problem-solving.

10. **Feedback and Rewards**: Providing feedback on progress and offering rewards for completing puzzles successfully are common features. This can include visual or auditory cues, unlocking new levels, or revealing parts of a larger narrative.

11. **Open-Ended Solutions**: Some puzzle games allow for multiple solutions or approaches to a problem. This adds replay value and encourages players to think creatively.

12. **Multiplayer or Cooperative Elements**: In some puzzle games, players can collaborate with others to solve challenges. This adds a social dimension to the puzzle-solving experience.

Ultimately, the appeal of puzzle games lies in their ability to engage players mentally, offering a challenging and rewarding experience as they overcome obstacles through clever thinking and strategy.
Use of module
Import Pygame 
 Pygame is a cross-platform set of python module designed for wrting video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries that are commonly used in game development. The Library is built on top of the simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), which is a low-level multimedia library.  
Import sys
The `sys` module is a part of the Python Standard Library and provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It allows you to interact with the Python runtime environment, access command-line arguments, and perform other system-related tasks. Here are some common functionalities provided by the `sys` module:
 Import Random
The `random` module in Python is a standard library module that provides functions for generating random numbers. It is commonly used in various applications, such as simulations, games, and cryptographic systems, where randomness is needed.

Update pytz Python package to latest

We only use the pytz package for generating the Outreachy blog RSS feed.
It's used to output the date and time and timezone of when the blog post
was first written, and last updated.

The pytz Python package has been replaced with native timezone support
in Python 3.9. See the Note in the Introduction paragraph on the pytz
pypi page:

https://pypi.org/project/pytz/

The Outreachy website is already running Python 3.9.17 in production.

Theoretically, we should be able to use the native Python datetime
module to represent this timezone aware datetime. However, the native
Python datetime module lacks a localize() function like pytz has.

I started converting the code to native Python, and I found myself
getting confused as to what type of timezone Wagtail needs (if any).

Things are further confused by the fact that the new native support
needs to know whether you are asking for a timezone that is currently in
daylight savings time or standard time. E.g. PDT (UTC-8) or PST (UTC-7).
I hate daylight savings time. Please please make it go away.

After getting a headache, I threw up my hands and updated the pytz
Python package, rather than trying to replace it with native Python
support.

I downloaded the RSS feed both before and after the pytz package upgrade
to ensure that the ATOM files were identical.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

## Description
Changes the behavior of `add_user_message` and `add_ai_message` to allow
for messages of those types to be passed in. Currently, if you want to
use the `add_user_message` or `add_ai_message` methods, you have to pass
in a string. For `add_message` on `ChatMessageHistory`, however, you
have to pass a `BaseMessage`. This behavior seems a bit inconsistent.
Personally, I'd love to be able to be explicit that I want to
`add_user_message` and pass in a `HumanMessage` without having to grab
the `content` attribute. This PR allows `add_user_message` to accept
`HumanMessage`s or `str`s and `add_ai_message` to accept `AIMessage`s or
`str`s to add that functionality and ensure backwards compatibility.

[MISSED MIRRORS] Linters, part two (#25138)

* Split Run Linters step into multiple steps (#78265)

Splits the big "Run Linters" step into multiple steps. Also since all of
these steps are independent of eachother, I've made them all run
regardless of if the job is currently failing.

<details>
<summary>Proof of testing:</summary>

Fail in install tools, all linting steps are skipped:
https://github.com/distributivgesetz/tgstation/actions/runs/6151628214/job/16692089726
Fail in Run DreamChecker, other steps continue to run:
https://github.com/distributivgesetz/tgstation/actions/runs/6151664705/job/16692203569?pr=2
</details>

<details>
<summary>Pictured: me breaking CI for a day</summary>

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/47710522/ea12ad30-2b69-4aa3-9642-7d0818eab2d1

</details>

Going through the Run Linters step has always been a slog. Finding an
error is like finding a needle in a haystack. Seeing what command
exactly went wrong is going to go a long way in helping people find out
which linters have failed.

nothing playerfacing

* Fixes TFE being useless after #78265 (#78433)

I thought `set +e` would still make the shell exit with an error if any
command failed, I didn't think that it would just use the exit code of
the last command. I am dumb, I'm an idiot and I want to cry.

* Update ci_suite.yml

* Fix some odd vscode highlighting errors in workflow files  (#78274)

few errors which were odd and annoying

stealing PRs from san7890, they wanted to do this
nothing playerfacing

* Only cancel concurrent CI in the same PR (#73398)

More merge queue bullshit. Cancels are counted as failures, and even
though on my test branch it worked completely fine, when trying on two
real PRs, it did not.

This makes it so merges into master might mess with CI clogging again,
but also merge queue is going to do that on its own, and the gain is
worth it.

* Remove cache purge key that has never worked and has meant that our cache has never worked (#71529)

ci_suite.yml runs on your fork. This means you do not have access to
secrets. Every user has had the purge key of blank.

WE have it set to something. Which means the master cache that every PR
pulls from has been unable to match.

This means our cache has been at the max limit all this time, constantly
clearing out old caches, and never reusing any.

* Caches Node and Python Bootstrap for GH Actions (#78307)

## About The Pull Request

I was planning on doing this a lot earlier but ran into some weird
roadblocks, but this time I finally did the research and it's done
properly.

We do a lot of useless work on every single CI run, and in the interest
of saving the world's energy (by a matter of at least 10 seconds per my
testing), lets stop doing so much extra work by caching both the work we
do on the python bootstrap installation (we literally call it `cache`
for a reason) and the Node installation by sharing it between github
actions runners.

Here's a random CI run on master where you can see that the `Install
Tools` portion takes about 19 seconds -
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/actions/runs/6167104927/job/16737570519

Here's the CI run I was testing with where you can see we slim it down
to about 6 seconds for the `Install Tools` step, but with a second-or-so
taken to restore the cache since the runner needs to download+unzip the
cache. it tends to be shorter or longer by a second at times but i'm
certain this is just noise -
https://github.com/san7890/bruhstation/actions/runs/6167245722/job/16737919874

On average, we save about **10 seconds** a run on Run Linters, which is
meant to be the fastest CI step. Future improvements would lie in making
either maplint or the tgui test suite faster, but that would be a much
more complicated and code-intensive task. cache go weeeee

## Changelog

Nothing that concerns players.

* Conditionally run TGS tests (#73704)

Also add test merge support for pull requests

[MISSED MIRROR] Puts all traits in the globalvars file + CI Testing (#79642) (#25131)

* Puts all traits in the globalvars file + CI Testing (#79642)

Fixes #76349

I didn't know that people needed to add any new traits to a global list
so they can be easily read in View Variables, and was pretty shocked to
find out many other people didn't know it was a thing. Let's make it a
thing by testing it using a new CI Python Linter to check this. But oh
no-

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/c093f1a8-00ce-40a6-8e1d-f344107ce7b8)

There were about 200+ missing traits. Alright, so let's do the
following:

* Move trait defines to their own dedicated folder in the `_DEFINES`
folder.
* Split up the traits mega-file into different files, for better
organization. One for the macros, one for the sources, and a few for the
"trait declarations"
* Run the linter a load of times and add everything to the globalvars
file, removing anything that's no longer used and figuring out where the
best categorization of it is. also minor code improvements. also rename
all of the ones that look weird. also fix list indentations
* Also alphabetize the lists because it's easy
* Move everything to a new `traits_by_type` list, while keeping the
admin one the way it is for the time being while we figure out a better
way to show that list to admins.
* Profit

Mapping trait injectors will now work for any type of trait. You
shouldn't add any trait via this injector though, but you're no longer
limited to coders remembering to add it to that critical list you
needed.

Lays the framework for a better view variables experience. This work is
too lengthy to presently do, but hopefully we can get this done sooner
rather than later. we will need a code-accessible way to view these
traits for such a framework to be implemented, so let's just do that.

Future steps are to break down the mega-declarations file into a folder
full of separate files by typepath, but that requires a lot of auditing.
Does need to happen one day though, there's a lot of mob traits mingled
with datum traits and auuugh we gotta do this later this PR is already
massive.

there's probably ways to game this but this catches _my_ mistakes so
good luck to everyone else (it should work for 99% of everyone)

Nothing applicable to players. However, to mappers, the mapping trait
injector should always be able to add any kind of trait (which is rather
good for the times when you need it).

* Update tgstation.dme

* Update _traits.dm

* Comment these out for now

[MIRROR] Make sign language unaffected by the Social Anxiety quirk's direct speech effects [MDB IGNORE] (#25140)

* Make sign language unaffected by the Social Anxiety quirk's direct speech effects (#79809)

## About The Pull Request

Alternative title: "Make going non-verbal make you less anxious."

This is a two line change to `social_anxiety.dm` to quit out its
`handle_speech` method when user has the `TRAIT_SIGN_LANG` trait.
This stops the Social Anxiety quirk from applying its
stutters/fillers/blockers for as long as the speaker is using sign
language.
This does nothing to any of social anxiety's non-verbal effects, those
are still active regardless and entirely unaffected.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Primarily: I think giving people the choice between using anxious talk
or sign language, and thus the different hurdles inherent to both, makes
for a more interesting gameplay interaction than simply blanket-applying
the quirk's speech effects to both.

Secondarily: Social Anxiety's non-verbal penalties are entirely
unaffected. One will still get the penalties from making eye contact and
occasionally make eye contact with objects. Notably this includes the
stuttering making eye contact could get you, which still makes your
signing shaky. You're still anxious, after all.
On top of this, it still costs more to pick up Signer than Social
Anxiety allows for, and thus the change doesn't simply make the
combination free points.

Tertiarily: when one has trouble speaking verbally, non-verbal
communication can be helpful in overcoming that hurdle. This is
especially so when the trigger for said anxiety is speaking verbally in
the first place. This is part of why I was so enamoured by the
combination before a broader and, mind you, fairly needed fix to sign
language made these interact differently.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: signers no longer suffer from social anxiety's speech changes
when they go non-verbal. Other effects are maintained.
/:cl:

* Make sign language unaffected by the Social Anxiety quirk's direct speech effects

[MIRROR] Fixes body collision causing a stun, despite a successful block. [MDB IGNORE] (#25146)

* Fixes body collision causing a stun, despite a successful block. (#79824)

## About The Pull Request

Puts a block check into the ``throw_impact()`` of carbon mobs.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I'm touching on a lot of 'get around shields' stuns, and this has been a
big one for the better part of a few years and potentially not even
intentional. I would say it gained its largest popularity when it became
weaponized with fireman carrying.

Despite seemingly rolling to block, blocking a body hitting you doesn't
actually do anything at all. This reminds me a bit of energy bolas. So I
fixed it? I think, there might be a better fix, I'm just replicating
code present in xenomorph tackles. This shit sucks, please recommend a
better fix if you know it.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: When you successfully block a body collision, it does something
rather than nothing at all.
/:cl:

* Fixes body collision causing a stun, despite a successful block.
