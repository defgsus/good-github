[ci] Mirror third-party images and hailgenetics images on deploy (#12818)

- On *deploys*, makes sure that whatever is in our third-party images is
in our private registry before starting builds like hail-ubuntu that
might depend on those images. This means that we can update our ubuntu
base image without the australians needing to deploy any images by hand.
However, this does not run in PRs because I 1) didn't want to add that
kind of latency for PRs and 2) we don't do any kind of namespacing for
our images so if we did include this for a PR that ultimately wasn't
merged we would have to manually remove the image anyway so why not
manually add it if you're going to PR it… I think point 2 is a little
weak but I recall this being what we agreed on a couple months back when
we discussed this. I'm wondering if we should just eat the minute or so
latency at the beginning of PRs to be safe but it also feels like a
shame for something that changes so infrequently.

- Again on deploys, upload the hailgenetics/* images to the private
registry if they don't already exist there. This way any deployments
that aren't hail team's GCP deployment can get these images
automatically when they deploy a new SHA instead of uploading them
manually. It won't backfill skipped versions, but we decided that was
ok. This seems less relevant for testing on PRs as it will get triggered
on releases and we can easily dev deploy to rectify the image if this
breaks.

The two areas of note are the singularity reactor, which is assembled,
and would just need a hand if someone were to want to start it, and the
research lab. The Research lab contains the fruits of the now deceased
science staff's labors, assorted energy weapons. Unfortunately, it also
contains the deceased science staff.

Other areas of the base were not so lucky, and are thoroughly infested

The engineering team attempted to hold back the vines, and quickly
discovered that fire was not sufficient.

And what used to be the recreation area is completely gone

Notably, the hangar is empty. I plan on making a patch to put a
subshuttle inside it once that rolls around.

Notable loot includes:
3 energy SMGs
3 Flamethrowers
The Ion Projector, a self charging Ion weapon.
An Antique Laser
2 Energy PDWs
2 Accelerator Laser Cannons
4 engineering hardsuits
An engineering lathe and circuit imprinter
A particle accelerator
A singularity generator
6 emitters
1 energy shotgun
Kudzu Seeds
Basically Everything You'd Need For an R&D Set Up
A sense of pride and accomplishment



I feel like this has some rough spots but I've got no idea where to
start, so into the review -> testing -> feedback process it goes

- [x] The ruin spawns when the spawn ruin verb doesn't runtime.
## Why It's Good For The Game
More ruin variety. This one spawns in space and does a few things that I
haven't seen yet. Mainly a singularity, cool semi-hidden asteroid base
that could in theory, be turned into a player lair.

Stops station blueprints from expanding areas of non atmos adjacent turfs. (#74620)

## About The Pull Request
Fixes #74605

the problem starts with `detect_room()` proc. This proc returns turfs
even those with `atmos_adjacent_turfs` = null. This means it returns
turfs that has a wall, airlock, window etc i.e. whatever that stops air
from flowing through it. This coupled together with `create_area()`
causes some wierdness.

Let's take an example
![Screenshot
(154)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110812394/230769831-e84819f2-31b2-4a67-a8bb-5e07e1c5a1cc.png)

Area A is well defined i.e. it has been created via the station
blueprints and is highlighted in green, Area B however is only
theoretical i.e. we haven't created it yet or we are about to create it.
Now you might be thinking Area A is completely walled & sealed off, it
should be physically impossible to expand it unless we broke down one of
it's walls and so since we are standing in Area B it shoudn't even give
me the option to expand area A Right? right? r.i.g.h.t?
![Screenshot
(155)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110812394/230770056-169cbab3-4516-4da7-ae2c-4f40b50be9ba.png)
Well PHFUUK. The area editor completely ignores the laws of physics and
allows me expand Area A anyway. This could cause some real power gaming
shit because if you create an area next to an area having an APC you
could use that area power without even making your own apc by simply
expanding that area(like using someone else's wifi from outside their
house without them even knowing)

#73850 accidently built on top of this as it relied on this to detect
duplicate APC's but the checks became way too strict as it would check
areas of surrounding walls for apc's and throw the conflicting apc
error. You can now build room's next to each other even if they have
fuctioning apc's however you still can't build rooms in space on top of
shuttle walls because that's been the default behaviour for years and
hasn't been touched one bit.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: station blueprints no longer expands & detects areas of non atmos
adjacent turfs.

popup: Fix unwanted animation during popup open in Chrome

In Chrome, the message event is processed a handful of animation
frames later than in Firefox. The result is that, when popup.js is
applying the form state as remembered by background.js, it is
triggering the CSS animation every single time, as if a human had
just toggled the elements. Steps to reproduce this:

* Open the popup in Chrome.
* Turn the big button on.
* Close and re-open the popup, observe bug.
* Repeat, observe bug again (etc).

Avoid this by 1) disabling the transition when body-hidden is active
and 2) delaying its removal until at least 1 frame after popup.js
applies its state.

The pattern of calling rAF() twice is common in frontend JS, and
the reason is as follows:

* During the event loop tick where popup.js applies the form state,
  we can't remove className synchronously in Chrome because it will
  process all DOM writes together once JS yields. The fact that we
  remove the class "after" changing the form state does not change
  the fact that it will render the changed form in the same paint
  frame where the body-hidden class is no longer applied and so
  an animation would happen.

* Calling rAF() once brings us from the main JS portion of a single
  event loop tick, to the end of the event loop tick right before
  the paint action takes place. Given nothing has happened in-between
  and given no third party JS here, this is effectively the same point
  in time still.

* Calling rAF() twice thus brings you to right after the form state
  has been rendered without a transition, and now we can safely remove
  the body-hidden class.

The artificial delay is about ~16ms (1/60fps) on modern screens and
is not expected to introduce annoyance in the form of clicks being
ignored.

The Lizardening Part One (And Friends) (#1845)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
This PR changes a lot of sprites. It's honestly too much. Namely:

- Explorer Equipment + Prototype
- Syndicate clothing
- Digitigrade lizard legs
- A new tail from Halcyon.
- Magboots from Zeta. Originally PR'd to tgstation.
- Colored (not greyscale! Ha Ha!) jumpsuits from Imaginos.

Heavy inspiration from the work of Imaginos, Halcyon, Mqiib, and
2cents#8442 for the original leg-work. (Haha, get it?)
The new digitigrade sprites started as a twinkle in the eye of Mqiib,
for yogstation(?) After myself and Halcyon saw those, an epihpany
struck. Perspective makes things cool and digitigrade perspective was
BAD.

I'll include a collage image of the new sprites if it's needed later.
Preview below:

Give slimes their sex back (not the ERP one) (#14380)

<!-- Please read these guidelines before opening your PR: https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/getting-started/pr-guideline -->
<!-- The text between the arrows are comments - they will not be visible on your PR. -->

## About the PR
<!-- What does it change? What other things could this impact? -->

Gives back the ability for slimes to have a definitive sex. Cosmetic/visual things such as emotes/other stuff use the person's sex and not the gender and I feel like that the removal of slime's having sexes was just to show that the species refactor could handle unsexed species.

Blink is no longer a forbidden school spell?? (#74487)

## About The Pull Request

Turns blink's school from forbidden to translocation. This has some
incredibly minor changes nobody is going to notice:
- Changes the blink's invocations when mixed with a CERTAIN spell
- If you were very specifically a chaplain with the holy crusade sect
and you casted blink, before it would excommunicate you, now it will
just smite you, as translocation spells are seen as less bad than
forbidden magic
- probably some more niche interactions but that's all I can remember

## Why It's Good For The Game

Guys, I know blink is a very annoying spell but come on now it's not
forbidden magic, that's for heretics and super duper evil stuffs

Adds better parts for syndie mechs, some tooltips to mech maintenance mode and some little changes. (#74466)

## About The Pull Request
Kinda resusticates #72442 cause the whole conflict was stupid.
Adds t4 parts for dark gygax, mauler and reticence (for the sake of
shitspawn) and t3 for dark honker.
Formulas of better parts to understand the difference:

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/aff9cf1b434c7a95d156ea20108d8b2bc015083d/code/modules/vehicles/mecha/_mecha.dm#L427-L439


Made examine text into span_notices so it's not just plane text.
Also added tooltips for maintenance. Screens to compare:

Dark gygax will now spawn without access adding regime.
Tool interactions with mech will now have sounds. (wrench and crowbar)
Removing parts from mech will now put them in your hands, and not just
under the mech.
When inserting parts in mech they won't make some noisy noise, already
forgot which noise it was, but i changed it for some reason, so meh.

Also fixed that you can remove capacitors and scanning mods from mech
without proper maintenance as it works with cell. Closes

## Why It's Good For The Game
Syndie mechs are still week. Didn't see them in half a year.
## Changelog

Properly accounts for byond tick fuckery in runechat code (#74388)

## About The Pull Request

Ok so like, the agreed upon assumption for "verb like code" (stuff that
triggers when a client sents a network packet to the server), is it runs
in verb time, that sliver of time between maptick and the start of the
next tick.
We thought MeasureText worked like this. It doesn't.

It will, occasionally, resume not during verb time but as a sleeping
proc, at the start of the next tick.
Before the MC has started working.
This appears to only happen when the tick is already overloaded.

Unfortunately, it doesn't invoke after all sleeping procs as we were
lead to believe, but just like, like any sleeping proc.

This means it fights with the mc for cpu time, and doesn't respect the
TICK_CHECK macro we use to ensure this situation doesn't happen.

SOOO lets use a var off the MC instead, tracking when it last fired.
We can use this in companion with TICK_CHECK to ensure verbs schedule
properly if they invoke before the MC runs.

Hopefully this should fix 0 cpu when running at highpop

Thanks to Kylerace and MrStonedOne for suffering together with me on
this, I hate this engine.

/fun/ from their typepaths.
19. Changes CLF crashed ship M60 to a MAR50
20. Adds sprites for M203, XM177, M16 Grenadier
21. DD spawn with a lucky pack and a zippo in their helmet.


# Explain why it's good for the game

Dutch's Dozen is a bit outdated, and light on content, gives them some
love.
Removes gear that doesn't fit in BM from BM, also I buffed the gear too
so balance concerns.

1. An unwielded rifle(M41A), had more accuracy than a wielded M1911,
would do this for other pistols too but out of scope as DD only use
M1911
2. They were incredibly easy to kill via leg/arm aiming, as no armor,
HPCs instakilled them(DD are default dishonorable), and FF did insane
damage as they all had high AP 40 damage rifles.
3. ERT medical pouch was worse than normal med-pouch, DD use this too.
4. Was intended, survivor endurance skill nerf effected this too as the
same define was used for both as a shortcut
5. M60 underpreformed, makes it better.
6. Dropping Ol' Painless over and over sucks.
7. Unique realistic mechanic for the M60, makes it more interactive
8. Unique guns, only DD get them, also the XM177 is my favorite gun of
all time I love it 😊
9. Unique UGL for M16 Grenadier, designed to work directly with the
sprite, as its integrated and only fits on it.
10. Grenades for DD to have a better chance against preds, riflemen have
a 30% chance of spawning with M16 GL.
11. Made for a stun, team gameplay for DD.
12. Area denial.
13. Vietnam Vibes, support tool cause it does jack shit damage.
14. DD couldn't tell friend from foe
15. (AWESOME) Carbine for Dutch, makes sense for the support and members
of the team to have carbines instead of rifles
16. Variance within DD team, all 3 of the guns are good, GL is a support
tool, M60 as an ambush(also its The Pig), A1 is normal
17. M60 doesn't fit thematically, and is too powerful.
18. Easier access, they don't fit in the fun file
19. Buffed M60, MAR50 fits more there anyway.
20. Sprites for things I added.
21. Its cool.

Introducing the Colonial Marshal ERT w/ Anchorpoint Marines (#2318)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request
My first PR of this scale, for sure. 

Been working on this PR for two weeks off and on, and finally I believe
I have checked every box that I intended to check when I first thought
of this idea a couple months back in November or so. Original idea:
https://discord.com/channels/150315577943130112/1037030635820306562/1037030635820306562

It will be adding a Colonial Marshal Bureau ERT, a Colonial Marshal
Bureau Inspection Team, and an Anchorpoint Station ERT.

First: Anchorpoint Station, unlike many ERTs, this one will hail from a
station. The station is located in the Neroid Sector and is used as a
transit / refinery station. It's large enough to hold 3000 but never
reaches its full potential. It consists of four towers and a central
module - one of the towers houses a permanent CMB presence and in the
same tower, a contingent of Colonial Marines is onboard. There's also a
Seegson office but I didn't do anything with it here.
Reference: https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Anchorpoint_Station

For standard inspections, a dropship is dispatched from Anchorpoint
Station to the USS Almayer to carry out their objectives.
I do expect this to be the primary usage of this entire PR, because
there was always a part lacking for Anti-Corporate/Anti-Smuggling/CMB
type of interactions. It was almost always focused on Corporate, or
USCM. Nothing else. You should consider this to be an HRP addition to
the game.

Its also important to note that the Colonial Marshals are **Colonial**
and UA law enforcement agents / investigative functionaries. **They
shouldn't be enforcing Marine Law** unless: 1. The CMP/aCO has requested
it, 2. The Colonial Marshal believes its in the best interest of the CMB
and 3. The CMB Office at Anchorpoint(admins) does not intervene to
change this decision. Jurisdiction is another interaction that will be
nice to see. Non-USCM suspects should be transferred to the CMB, and
vice versa. The CMB should also be handling crimes, especially with the
ICC, involving smuggling, black market activities, and corporate
corruption/cover-ups.

**The Colonial Marshal** - He leads the team, and should be an
experience player with some knowledge of the lore behind what they are
doing. There's objectives and a backstory to help guide players if they
are unaware.
**The CMB Investigative Synthetic** - Unlike what you would expect from
most Synthetics, this one(as the name implies) is purely for
investigative and/or law enforcement purposes, though they have brought
along a medical belt.
**The CMB Deputy** - Working under the lead of the Marshal, his loyal
deputies uphold Colonial Law, Earth Law, and help with investigations
and/or law enforcement should it be needed.
**Interstellar Commerce Commission Corporate Liaison** - This Executive
works with the Colonial Marshals specifically to observe proper trade
practices and investigate any possibilities of smuggling or black market
activity. They are also an advisory agent to the Marshals by giving them
an eye on the corporate side of things.
**Interstellar Human Rights Observer** - Through a lot of hard work, the
Observer has managed to make his way onto the frontier to document and
record any kind of atrocities that may be occurring in this dark sector
of space. It's a bit of a PR stunt, but the Observer might surprise you.
Also, in an emergency, the Observer may be able to provide medical aid
for the team - they are the most capable of it.


For Emergency Responses, a nearby dropship which was enroute to an
investigation of its own, is re-routed to the USS Almayer's distress
beacon. There is a 10% chance of this happening.
They will not fare very well in extended combat, because they are not
prepared for it. They simply come aboard to lend a helping hand to a
distress beacon.
As the Colonial Marshals are equipped for law enforcement and
investigations, they are comparably lightly armed to most things they
might encounter in or by the USS Almayer.

This is where the contingent of Colonial Marines in Tower 4 comes in.

The third ERT that may be called in is an Anchorpoint Station QRF Team.
Canonically this is purely used when a random-beacon is answered by the
CMB Patrol Team, and they are able to raise the radio back to base to
call in the QRF. Thus giving them an additional, albeit optional
objective. This is controlled entirely by admins, as the Anchorpoint QRF
Team, despite its small size and average skill levels, is equipped with
a decent amount of gear compared to the depleted stocks of the USS
Almayer. Should the CMB team be able to raise its own distress signal to
the preparing QRF team, admins may choose to grant, delay, or deny the
QRF entirely.



Those are the main points of the PR.
There are also small variation changes to CMB-related survivors and also
some changes to synths.dm. (I tried to refractor the code because the
last PR to it bugged out the way items spawn in, but I was unsuccessful
and those changes are not in this PR.)

Pizza ERT chance and Freelancer ERT chance was nerfed by 4 and 5
respectively. This gives room for this ERT, and also Pizza was a bit
LRP.. You see a ship burning with a giant hole in it and you go to
deliver a pizza...?

EDIT: Pizza ERT removed from rotation entirely a la morrow

I would love to give a great thanks to:
nauticall - for their awesome cap and badge sprites! Also they have just
been a great help to me for much of my time here :)
kitsunemitsu - for their CMB hud icons!
harryOB - for helping me with fixing my vars and procs in the main ERT!
I was able to make things a % chance thanks to him.
and forest2001 - for helping me troubleshoot and find a solution for a
really annoying piece of hud code.

# Explain why it's good for the game

This is a great, non-combat ERT and extremely HRP addition which adds a
phenomenal avenue of RP to the game rarely seen before. There is someone
to investigate the CL, interact with survivors, give MPs someone to talk
to, take non-USCM prisoners, assist with CMB-survivors and especially
with the new Black Market update this ERT will have tons of potential to
bring really interesting dynamics to the Almayer. The Colonial Marshal
Bureau are a HRP oriented set of roles, perfect for mini-events.

# Testing Photographs and Procedure
<!-- Include any screenshots/videos/debugging steps of the modified code
functioning successfully, ideally including edge cases. -->
<details>
<summary>
I have done extensive testing with this and believe I have figured out
pretty much every single bug. One thing I was not able to test was the
ERT messages for obvious reasons, but they seem to be sound - and a test
merge will definitely double check that.

In addition, there may or may not be a bug where the CMB cannot see
their own HUD Icons, but ghosts can just fine. I haven't been able to
find the cause of this yet.

:cl: QuickLoad, nauticall, Kitsunemitsu, harryOB, forest2001
add: Introducing the Colonial Marshal Bureau Inspection and Emergency
Response Teams - A Law Enforcement & Investigative UA Functionary which
brings with it an HRP oriented set of roles perfect for your anti-corpo,
colonial, prisoner, smuggling, or other types of interactions on the
Almayer! It should unlock a very unique avenue of RP for many players,
especially smugglers, CL, survivors and the black market. This is a well
supported faction with their own frequencies, equipment, even faxes and
icons etcetera. The laws of the Earth stretch beyond the Sol.
add: Added the Anchorpoint Station Emergency QRF - A team of Colonial
Marines dispatched from Anchorpoint Station to respond to the CMB's
distress signal. Few in numbers, average in skills, but well equipped.
When things get dicey for the Marshals, they are the cavalry. This is an
admin call but makes it into an optional two-part ERT.
imageadd: Awesome looking CMB Cap, Marshal Badge and Deputy Badge by
nauticall!
imageadd: HUD Icons for each of the Colonial Marshal Bureau
Investigation Members, made by Kitsunemitsu!
imageadd: CMB key, hudsec and earpiece! Comes with a nice blue shale
radio color.
qol: Switched up some of the bugged synth loadouts, added some variety.
fix: Corrects the legacy path of hudsec where it was looking for old
paths instead of the updated ones - hudsec should work fine now. Thanks
to forest for his help in spotting these.
tweak: Superficial changes to cryo ERT loadout and CMB-relevant survivor
loadouts.
tweak: Superficial changes to armor vest so that they can carry
guns/lights.
tweak: Superficial changes to not being able to put on vests over
certain uniforms.
tweak: Freelancer ERT chance down from 25 to 20.
tweak: Synthetic vendor has some packs renamed for clarity, and receives
the tech welder satchel and medical satchel as an option.
del: Synthetic nurse hat is gone from Synthetics!
del: Pizza ERT is removed from rotation

✨ NICE-23 app dir to use api not direct functions (#1554)

This _was_ working a-okay, but in a `canary` build this way of getting data within the app dir went the way of the `dodo`.

- https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/deopted-into-client-rendering

The reference hyper-focuses on `useSearchParams` but there is a _bit_ more to it. At least in the way this repo had things set up. I think it could also be the way it was doing a lot more than it should have and duplicating the `api` calls. However, originally, I thought that was the preference for RSC in that you did _not_ have to do an API call from RSC.

I digress. This is working much better, so this refactor (aka feature) is a stepped improvement for sure. At one point an update back on `canary` everything "looked good" but **tanked** RES (Real Experience Score). The Lighthouse was still `100` so this was weird.

Added bonus `ISR` now works again by following the `fetch` pattern more closely. And a proper `preload`.

- [x] upgrade to `next@13.3.0`
- [x] upgrade to `@vercel/og@0.5.2`, `swr@2.1.3`
- [x] Try and find what is causing the deopt
  - This was **three fold** at least: 1) `Analytics` 2) `CommandMenu` 3) `getNotionData`
- [x] Trial and Error on `colophon` so that it does not show: `page deopted into client-side rendering`
- [x] Migrate all `page.tsx` to this and update the Page/ Metadata/ Preload
- [x] Verify ISR
- [x] Determine if this works on Vercel

Yes the big callout is a bit of a hack. Since we _use_ the Next API to generate itself, this is probably anti-pattern. (Lol, this whole websites repo has been from day one.)

### `sites/jeromefitzgerald.com/src/lib/constants.ts`

This is a bit of a headache to look at so at some point we should refactor. This _requires_ the Production API to already exist. So this would work for this website, but not a net-new one. So need to also add to README or the call out in a comment here. I think this is kind of my problem with this site using Notion. Perhaps ... and hear me out here ... it was never a good idea to do this and spend this much time on it haha.

- Notion API is _a lot_
- We take the data and customize ("normalize") it to be digestible within this app an store the output in Redis
- We then use the Next API to call Redis and add some realtime flair from time to time

All of that is overcomplicated and probably not necessary. Or can be improved so let us first **fix** this and get back on canary latest and then see when (if ever) there is time to get out of this quagmire.

New Agda syntax highlighting extension for VSCode (#562)

I've written an improved Agda syntax-highlighting extension for VSCode
called _agda-syntax_
([GitHub](https://github.com/fredrik-bakke/agda-syntax-vscode), [VSCode
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FredrikBakke.agda-syntax)).
Although it is still in preview, my opinion is that it is already a
significant improvement over the previously used extension. Therefore, I
propose that we migrate our development environment (for VSCode users)
to use this new extension.

### Some highlights of the extension
Compared to the previously used extension, this new extension
- injects into markdown syntax, so that the markdown code can be
highlighted as markdown code as well
- highlights all variable declarations (with some bugs still), module
names, wildcard symbols, all reserved keywords (and only recognizes
reserved keywords as reserved keywords)
- Recognizes the appropriate token-boundaries
- Highlights line comments properly

Please understand that the grammar framework that has to be used to
write the extension is highly limited, so not all highlighting
functionality can be implemented. For instance, the parsing must be done
in a single pass, and the functionality to match over multiple lines is
very limited. Hence, for example, matching the left-hand side of an
equals sign is very gnarly (although I have one idea left to try with
regard to this).

Still, I would greatly appreciate any feedback, either if it is a bug or
a feature request, which is another reason why I want to introduce it
into our defined development environment at this point.

If you want to try out the extension right now, follow the VSCode
Marketplace link:

fix: Scroll to top

 Since we are not able to restore the scroll correctly,
 and force the scroll to top every time we change the
 current folder. This is to avoid this kind of weird
 behavior:
 - If I go to a sub-folder, if this subfolder has a lot
 of data and I scrolled down until the bottom. If I go
 back, then my folder will also be scrolled down.

 This is an ugly hack, yeah.

Move a few functions out of OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED

Geoff Thorpe added OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED nearly two decades ago. The hope
was that at some point some functions can be dropped. Most of the functions
marked deprecated are actually unused nowadays but unfortunately some of
them are still used in the ecosystem. Move them out of OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED
so we can define it without breaking the consumers in the next bump.

ERR_remove_state() is still used by a dozen or so ports. This isn't a big
deal since it is just a stupid wrapper for the not quite as deprecated
ERR_remove_thread_state(). It's not worth patching these ports.

Annoyingly, {DH,DSA}_generate_parameters() and RSA_generate_key() are still
used. They "make use" of the old-style BN_GENCB callback, which is therefore
more difficult to remove - in case you don't know know: that's the thing
responsible for printing pretty '.', '+' and '*' when you generate keys.

Most annoyingly, DH_generate_parameters() was added to rust-openssl in 2020
for "advanced DH support". This is very unfortunate since cargo bundles a
rust-openssl and updates it only every few years or so. As a consequence
we're going to be stuck with this nonsense for a good while.

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].
With this patch a process can be killed via:

                 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

         sig = atoi(argv[2]);

         printf("Sending signal %d to process %s\n", sig, argv[1]);
         ret = do_pidfd_send_signal(fd, sig, NULL, 0);

         saved_errno = errno;
         close(fd);
         errno = saved_errno;

         if (ret < 0) {
                 printf("%s - Failed to send signal %d to process %s\n",
                        strerror(errno), sig, argv[1]);
                 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

 */
Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

Containers: don't use a bool in Triple NoInit test.

It's just too fucking painful with GCC 12 optimizations. Like, I
regularly got an XPASS for this code:

    Triple<float, int, bool> aTrivial{35.0f, 3, true};
    new(&aTrivial) Triple<float, int, bool>{Corrade::NoInit};

    CORRADE_EXPECT_FAIL_IF(!aTrivial.third(), "...");
    CORRADE_COMPARE(aTrivial.third(), true);

HOW ON EARTH can the boolean value fail on check, saying it's false, but
then in another check be true?! And of course no amount of trying to
change it to !(aTrivial.third() == true), or CORRADE_VERIFY(), etc.,
fixed it. The boolean always read as two different values on the two
lines. Amazing compilers, or UB, or I don't know what.

Bug fix for calling array.array.tostring in Python 3.9 and above

From Python 3.2, `tostring` was renamed  `tobytes`. Then, from Python 3.9, `tostring` was dropped completely. While the newer function name makes more sense (as it returns a byte representation), it simply does not exist if we're on Python versions prior to 3.2. Hence we now check if the `array.array` instance has the attribute `tobytes` before calling it, and we fall back on `tostring` if `tobytes` doesn't exist. 

This is awkward, but a lot less awkward than my previous solution of creating a child class of array.array with the single purpose of defining `tostring` with a call to `tobytes`.

```import array.array
class stupid_array(array.array):
    def tostring(self):
        return self.tobytes()
```

HOW STUPID WAS THAT SOLUTION?! I only decided against it because it would change the class, and that would break any code that checks whether a variable's type is array.array.

Do you think this level of backwards support is insane, and that we should just use the newer and more sensible `tobytes`? I've seen lab computers that run Python 2.4 on Windows XP. I'm not ready to have the conversation that they should consider upgrading. Also, maybe they have an ancient EyeLink that requires such an old system. *You don't know their life!*

Reassemble-Text

Challenge: Reassemble Text Fragments
Background
Imagine you have 5 copies of the same page of text. You value this text and have no hard or soft
copies of it. Your two year old nephew visits and, while you are not looking, rips each page up into
fragments and gleefully plays in the “snow” he has just created.
You need at least one copy of that page of text back ASAP. As punishment to your niece, who should
have been supervising your nephew at the time of the incident, you set her the painstaking task of
keying in all the paper text fragments to a text file on your shiny MacBook Pro. Now the task is
yours. Can you reassemble a soft copy of the original document?
The Challenge
Write a program to reassemble a given set of text fragments into their original sequence. For this
challenge your program should have a main method accepting one argument – the path to a well-
formed UTF-8 encoded text file. Each line in the file represents a test case of the main functionality
of your program: read it, process it and println to the console the corresponding defragmented
output.
Each line contains text fragments separated by a semicolon, ‘;’. You can assume that every fragment
has length at least 2.
Example input 1:
O draconia;conian devil! Oh la;h lame sa;saint!

Example output 1:
O draconian devil! Oh lame saint!

Example input 2:
m quaerat voluptatem.;pora incidunt ut labore et d;, consectetur, adipisci velit;olore magnam

Let configure detect ABI clashes

Ever since the very first commit of configure.ac (f5ebf77, back in
2002), after hunting down all required libraries, Xyce's configure
does a simple check to see if the entire link line actually works.
This was something that Tammy Kolda had suggested back in those days,
and I took her advice.

Thing is, when configure is hunting down libraries it's already trying
to link small programs with them, so this test has always been
pointless.  All it does is make sure the libraries can be found, which
honestly we already did earlier.

And worse, ever since we started using the Trilinos Makefile.export
thing instead of probing libraries normally, we NEVER actually link
meaningful test programs with trilinos anymore.

This means that while the libraries are found and a link of a trivial
program succeeds, it could be the case that Trilinos has been compiled
with a compiler that uses an ABI that is incompatible with the one
we're trying to use now.

This came up this weekend (again) when Eric tried to build Xyce on one
of the ASCIC machines and tried to use our precompiled Trilinos
archdir for gcc8.  These libraries were compiled with RHEL7 devtools-8
gcc 8.3, but Eric was using CDE gcc 8.4.

RHEL devtools gcc8 is compiled to use the old GCC ABI for compatibility
with the native gcc4, but CDE gcc 8.4 is compiled with the default,
new ABI.  It is not possible to use one with the other unless special
macros are defined to make it use the the non-default ABI.

And because we were only testing whether libraries would link by
linking an empty main function with the libraries, no Trilinos
functions are actually needed and so the linker never pulls them in
and tries to use them.

So configure succeeds, the build proceeds all the way to the final
link phase, and then a semi-infinite number of undefined symbole
errors show up.  It is frustrating and confusing for a user to have
that happen.

In this commit, I change this 20-year-old pointless link test into a
meaningful link test.  Now, configure tries to build a small test
program that includes Teuchos_RCP.hpp and tries to instantiate an
RCP.  This is a real test --- if the Trilinos libraries are
incompatible, this will fail, and fail before the user has bothered to
try to build Xyce.

if it fails, the user will get the message:
checking whether libraries (-lfftw3  -llocaepetra ...  ) will link... no
configure: error: FATAL: cannot link with the libraries detected so far ...
It may be that your compiler is incompatible with the one that was
used to build Trilinos.  See config.log for failure message.

That final error message used to include the entire list of libraries,
but that list is so freakin' long it makes the error message
unreadable (the beginning of the message scrolls off the screen before
the end of it gets printed).  So I shortened it.  The full list is in
the previous message anyway.

And config.log will have all of those undefined symbol errors instead
of them showing up at final link time of the full build.

This does not guarantee we won't get annoyed queries from users who
hit this problem, but it at least gets that frustration to
happen *before* they've spend an hour or so compiling Xyce.

[asset-reconciliation] Use source asset observations to inform when to kick off eager reconciliation (#13304)

## Summary & Motivation

We did a similar sort of thing for data time calculations.

Note the TODO. The material impact is the following. Imagine you have an
asset graph `OS -> A -> B`, where OS is an observable source asset.

- Your asset_selection for your sensor is just `B`.
- `OS` is observed having version `1`, after which all downstreams are
materialized in order.
- `A` is manually materialized again (not pulling in any new data, as no
version was updated).
- `OS` is observed, still having version `1`.

The sensor will see that `A` has a new materialization, but will
erroneously treat it as "unreconciled", as a new observation record has
come in after the latest materialization of `A`. This means that a
materialization of `B` will not be kicked off.

In a fun twist of fate, this is actually arguably desirable behavior, as
there really isn't a reason for `B` to be kicked off in this scenario.
However, we're kinda getting the right answer for the wrong reason, if
that makes sense. We don't factor this sort of versioning information
into other parts of the reconciliation logic, and the following sequence
of events would give us an unambiguously incorrect behavior:

- `OS` is observed having version `1`, after which all downstreams are
materialized in order.
- `A` is manually materialized again (not pulling in any new data, as no
version was updated).
- `OS` is observed, now having version `2`.
- `A` is manually materialized again.
- `OS` is observed again, still having version `2`.

In this case, we get the same behavior (`B` not getting kicked off),
because there is an observation record after the most recent
materialization of `A` (this is the same reason as before).

In reality, we should search backwards for the FIRST occurrence of the
current version, this was just a minor pain to implement in the time I
have today.

## How I Tested These Changes

Add emotional intelligence evaluation (#589)

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Emotional Intelligence

### Eval description
Evaluates GPT's ability to understand and manage emotional situations
using modified versions of the well-validated, public (i.e.
license-unrestricted) tests first developed by MacCann & Roberts (2008).
Items have actually here been aggregated across three different scales--
the STEU and STEM adult measures, along with a dozen questions from the
youth measure.

Keep in mind that there is not expectation that AI models like GPT-4
should be able to process emotions, so applying any emotional
intelligence test to them should be taken with a grain of salt. These
tests can only measure the AI's ability to understand and analyze
emotional information, not the AI's emotional intelligence in the human
sense.

### What makes this a useful eval?
This eval is useful because it assesses the AI model's ability to
navigate complex or ambiguous emotional situations, which is an
important aspect of human-like communication and problem-solving. By
evaluating the model's performance in this unique domain, we can
identify areas for improvement and better understand its limitations
when it comes to handling emotional contexts. This is particularly
important when considering AI applications that involve interactions
with humans, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and customer support
systems. A better understanding of emotional intelligence can
potentially lead to more natural and effective interactions between AI
models and their users.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This Emotional Intelligence eval provides a unique value because by
testing GPT's capacity to understand and manage emotions, we can gain
insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in a more
human-centric context. Relatedly, this eval also emphasizes the
importance of empathy and emotional understanding in AI systems that are
designed to interact with humans. By evaluating GPT's performance in
this way, we can contribute to the ongoing development of AI models that
are more attuned to human emotions and can provide better support in
emotionally charged situations, such as mental health counseling, crisis
management, and conflict resolution. Moreover, this Emotional
Intelligence eval can serve as a foundation for further research and
development in the field of AI and emotional understanding, paving the
way for more sophisticated AI models capable of handling complex human
emotions and fostering more effective communication.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval
(data is publicly available on OSF, and does not have usage
restrictions)

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

**_I already have access to the 8k GPT-4 API, but I am kindly requesting
access to the 32k as soon as it becomes available._**

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

Heart Disease Prediction (#538)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Heart Disease Prediction

### Eval description

This eval tests the models ability to correctly predict the probability
of a patient to have heart disease. The dataset is constructed from the
[Heart Failure Prediction
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
on Kaggle. The data includes the patient's age, sex, and a number of
medical signals relevant to the diagnosis of heart disease.

The data is provided under the Open Database License (ODbL). 

```
fedesoriano. (September 2021). Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. Retrieved [Mar 31, 2023] from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction.
```

### What makes this a useful eval?

This assesses the model's ability to correctly predict adverse medical
events. Correctly predicting heart disease shows the model's capability
for a strong understanding of medicine. The GPT-3.5-turbo models
currently receives an accuracy of 0.778.

PatchesOlderRelease: simplify and strengthen the non-recommendation message

I proposed this change in the original PR but we needed to expedite the blocked edge. I think the detailed messaging is actually not that useful for people, and maybe we do not need to stress out that RH fixes can in theory introduce regressions. I also think that the commitment to eventually deliver a union of all fixes is kinda implicit and we do not need to include it, it just dillutes the 'pls dont upgrade to these versions' core message.

> But the real culprit is NVIDIA; they are proving a lot harder to beat than many companies and their investors ever imagined.

In my view the AI chip companies are incompetent. Just why is it so hard for them to beat GPUs? At the very least, PIM processing should act as the initial advantage.

Things aren't happening the way I anticipated at all. I want to believe in Tenstorrent, but I really expected a bunch of startups to be capable of beating Nvidia in this timeline. There is no real point in believing in TT at this stage. Similarly to Graphcore, they had their Grayskulls out for a while, and where are the benchmarks? If they were better than GPUs, the company would be shouting about it from the rooftops. Even if they were using old process nodes, they could have just compared them to the older GPUs.

If all of those 100 startups are just going to go up in flame, what was the point of them? I'd be better off hoping Google, Amazon or MS come up with new hardware for their cloud services.

I am really behind on ChatGPT. Maybe not for coding, but it is a great poet. I'll have to integrate it into my writing workflow at some point.

4/13/2023

8:50am. I've had trouble falling asleep, and then I woke up early and was lounging in bed, and yet it is this early. I am not that tired.

Let me chill a bit, read MagiTora, then I will take a bath. After that I will start screencasting.

10:15am. Done with the bath. I'll leave Kaijin Kaihatsu and that GB thread for later.

Focus me. Let me start a new video.

Also, you know what? I need some new covers, so let me start up PS while I am at it.

...Nice, I got a GPU right away.

> A bright sun shining over a tranquil lake. A flock of white birds are flying overhead. Best detail, highest quality, masterpiece, 8k.
> A white moon is reflected from tranquil lake. A haunted atmosphere. Best detail, highest quality, masterpiece, 8k.

Neg prompt:
> Dull, muted, ugly, blurry.

10:40am. First time I am using batch upscaling.

Oh, nice. I'll create a whole bunch them this way.

11:15am. Damn it, SD is distracting me. Let me start the screencast.

11:55am. Dealing with SD on paperspace is very distracting.

But on the plus side, these new covers are very beautiful. Especially the intro screens.

12pm. Let me focus on screening. Today had too many distractions for me.

12:40pm. Let me take off here for a bit, and then I will resume.

Rather than going straight forward I had to review the example a bit.

Hmmm, ok, I think I know how to approach this.

12:45pm. Breakfast. Breakfast time.

2:55pm. Let me resume.

Focus only on the screencast. The bath and SD broke my focus in the morning.

4:10pm. https://pixabay.com/music/beats-aesthetics-138637/

Let me get this one.

https://chat.openai.com/chat

Let me ask ChatGPT.

https://pixabay.com/music/solo-piano-this-is-my-fatherx27s-world-146078/

7:15pm. Done with lunch. I am going to stop here for the day.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60198623/how-to-use-both-azure-ad-authentication-and-identity-on-asp-net-core-3

I'll implement this tomorrow.

Today I am done.

It is a pity I couldn't finish it today. But this is the problem with high level libraries. They tend to be inflexible.

I guess this is just one of the pains of being a web dev. I'll get through it soon.

I'll finish this video tomorrow, then deal with SPAs. Then comes the fun stuff."

Financial Math (Evals) (#566)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
finance

### Eval description

Asks the model to calculate how much interest would be owed on a credit
card by a certain date, if a payment was made once but debt remains on
the card.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Finance is likely to be one of the biggest opportunities for LLMs to be
useful, because financial education is incredibly poor globally and the
impact of a mistake in financial calculations is severe. This eval tests
the models ability to combine math with its understanding of a topic
(finance). We plan to use this type of math at
[Dollarwise](https://www.dollarwise.ca) frequently going forward,
including integration into your comparison products. However, for this
to work reliably it's important that the model here can natively
understand financial concepts and apply math to them.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Small tweak suggestions to modern data stack article (#5729)

* Small tweaks

Few small tweaks, feel free to ignore obv:

- Removed the tl;dr in intro as it was repetitive and felt redundant (it's summarizing 3 sentences)
- Removed more air quotes around modern data stack - if you're talking to engineers and call it 'modern data stack' you sound a bit 'how do you do, fellow kids'
- Removed link to our CDP docs because we don't _really_ have a CDP product yet
- Micro changes to flow

In general I think there are still slightly too many links in here that would take people away from the page (we don't need to link to every single relevant article we've written on the topic, especially as we have a Further reading section), but I'll leave that to you to decide!

I wonder if around line 95 there should be a break with a new title called 'So what's the problem' or something - I had to re-read the article to really get the crux of what the burning problem is here besides 'it's a bit complicated'. The gap that is created between (product?) engineers and the data they use is super valuable, but I think a bit buried.  

(Btw sorry to be very nit-picky after it's already been published - ended up re-reading a few times as I think this is awesome Twitter content I'm going to pilfer...)

Parser: drop direction `reports` dependencies

This removes direct dependency on `reports`, but an indirect one still
exists via `msgs`. It's pretty trivial indirection at the moment, but
after dropping direct reports dependencies the API can be changed more
drastically.

A number of changes were required in order to make this possible, here
is an overview:

- smaller parser public API & simpler implementation
- added `parse` compiler command, for devs
- parser error message improvements
- fixes to `astrepr` logic and output
- lots of style clean-ups

Details
=======

Slimmer `parser` Public API
---------------------------

Previously the parser had many public procedures (eg: `isOperator`,
`getTok`, `skipComment`, etc) that would allow fine grained control for
other modules.

There are many issues with this:
- there are no consumers of this API
- lots of public API surface to test
- the API itself was bad, it conflated lexing and parsing

The public API surface for the parser has been reduced significantly,
now consisting of:
- `openParser`
- `parseTopLevelStmt`
- `parseAll`
- `closeParser`
- `parseString`

That's it, which frankly reads far more sensibly.

Simplified `parser` Implementation
----------------------------------

- removed `InternalReport`, `reports_parser`, and `reports_enum` imports
- introduced diagnostics for the parser, akin to the lexer, `ParseDiag`
- `ParseDiag` favours data over strings
- `ParsedNode` now has its own kind enum, mostly a subset of
   `TNodeKind`, but entirely compatible

Consolidated a pattern within the parser, where a node was created with
the current token's information, and then the token was immediately
consumed via `getTok` to advance the `lexer`. This is captured in the
newly introduced `newNodeConsumingTok`.

Long-term, itemizing these traversal/consumption patterns will make the
parser logic not only more regular, but also highlight oddities in the
grammar as the implementation will be convoluted.

Parsing/Diagnostics Performance
-------------------------------

`ParsedNode` uses a lightweight `ParsedToken`

Introduce `ParsedToken`, a smaller data type, storing the least amount
of data required from `lexer.Token` for `ParsedNode`. This not only
saves memory, but the runtime performance impact on my machine is
roughly 33% faster full compiler testament run for all targets

- before change: 3+ minutes
- after change:  2+ minutes

Added specialized diagnostic/report kinds for:
- empty accent quote when ident expected
- msg for asm statements without a string literal
These reduces the amount of string data carried around in the compiler.

Improved Custom Numeric Literal Handling
----------------------------------------

- the `lexer` still does silly things for lexing these
- it just does less work and produces better data
- fewer string operations and hacks are required by the `parser`

Parser Diagnostic/Reporting - Invalid Indentation
-------------------------------------------------

- now has correct source line information
- tracks instantiation and submission location
- has the appropriate severity
- improved phrasing for indent error from possible missed `=` character
- adjusted tests for the above

Parser Diagnostic/Reporting - Malformed Call Syntax
---------------------------------------------------

- `parser` detects malformed calls and sets better line info
- net-net the user will have a better chance to find the issues

Parser Diagnostic/Reporting - Misc
----------------------------------

- token rendering call out keywords via prefix, eg: `keyword template`
- inconsistent spacing style check shows the problematic source

Removed unused report kinds:
- `rparIdentOrKwdExpected`
- `rparRotineExpected`
- `rparPragmaAlreadyPresent`

Parse Compiler Command
----------------------

`parse` command:
- added `parse` command, which outputs the parsed ast for a file
- usage: `nim parse foo.nim`
- super useful for diffing parser output changes
- heavily leverages `astrepr`

`astrepr` module:
- `astrepr.treeRepr` now works for `ParsedNode`, was previously broken
- AST trasversal is now exhaustive and breakages less likely to pass CI

`astrepr` output improvements, mainly for `ParsedNode`:
- `astrepr` now shortens ParsedNodeKind enum
- output now includes line and column information
- comments no longer result in excessive new line output
- fixed many formatting issues for `ParsedNode` output
- improved `astrepr`'s output for custom numeric literals

Canonical Filenames Performance Issue
-------------------------------------

Also discovered a performance issue with canonical filenames option and
the `nimdebugstacktrace` option. Removed some of the pain, but canonical
file paths result in significant performance issues due to filesystem
IO. I've fixed part of it and filed an issue:
https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull/issues/546

Other Improvements
------------------

- introduced `debugutils.setFrame` template for frame msg hints
- above `setFrame` avoids the canonical path performance hit
- removed circular dependency between `ast` and `options` module
- document unused parser reports and other outliers
- move `isImportedException` to `ast/types`, whice drops `front/options`
  cyclic depencdency from `ast/ast_query`
- fixed docs in nimlexbase, also easier to understand
- `ast.toPNode` now handles `nil` input
- `syntaxes.parseFile` returns `ParsedNode`, allows avoiding unnecessary
  conversions in future use cases where only `ParsedNode` is required

Special Mentions
----------------

Thanks, clyybber and zerbina for the reviews!

Misc
----
- remove blank space characters from otherwise empty lines
- remove awful code style of `0 < foo.len`
- fixed a number of typos in comments
- adjusted a few tests to ensure they pass

Refactors Suiciding Variable Into Trait (#74150)

## About The Pull Request

Firstly, this var was on `/mob`, even though only `/mob/living` and
`/mob/dead` could have ever used it, so who knows how much needless
memory it was consuming on stuff such as `oranges_ear` that would never
ever ever use something like this.

Edit: okay instead of memory it just polluted variable edit windows for
all /mob when it didn't need to. I like having a slim VV window

Secondly, it's a technical improvement over the previous system as we
are able to "track" where a suicide originates from, and how we can
track that from mob-to-mob-to-mob. Previously, the boolean `suiciding`
would only inform us if they had ever been connected to a mob that had
ever committed suicide, but now we are able to precisely determine which
mob gave them the trait that they must now apparently bear until the
round restarts.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Less memory usage, more indepth ability to track suicides in case you
really need that dexterity. Currently no implemented code could benefit
from using it, but it would be pretty neat if someone could figure out a
way to have someone be guilt-tripped whenever they look into a mirror
and seeing the reflection of their past life? This PR won't actually
help you code that and it'll probably require a bit more work, but it's
a possibility of some cool interactions you can do when you have this
information available to you.

## Changelog

:cl:
refactor: Some aspects of how we track suicides from your living mob to
your observer have changed- please do let us know if anything has broken
via a GitHub Issue Report.
/:cl:

There's probably some technical improvements that can be made in some
parts of the code I reworked to accommodate this change, do let me know
if you spot any easy ones (or fuckups). a lot of excess comes from the
fact that any step in the TRAIT framework trusts that you are passing in
a valid datum (or subtype) so that's a thing

Faction epilogue stuff

Implemented faction epilogues for Sofia's holdout. This has a few variations depending not only on how far along in the main mission chains you progress, but also in whether you favor one of the main questgivers over the other. Getting it to work was a complicated, giant pain in the ass and it literally only barely scrapes by without it being possible to trigger a given ending threshold early by trying to max out every available mission except the intended trigger.

Also required shifting the merchants and other non-Cleansing Flame NPCs who show up at the rural church into a sister faction so sidequests for the merchants don't mess with the above-mentioned mission chain progression stuff.

Also fixes a type that prevented Nicholas' last mission from working right, oof.

The North Star Expeditionary Vessel - A Second Wind (#74371)

## About The Pull Request
A new map for TGstation, in the works! It has 4 fucking Z levels, a
massive expansive maintenance with unique designs, and some unique code
features in the works.

To Do:
- [x] Update the Map to Modern TG
- [x] Local Tests
- [x] Work on Map Optimizations
- [x] Run Live Tests

Fikou has greatly helped with creating an important flavour aspect of
this map, Trek Uniforms on anyone who joins! See the forum thread for
more. This includes the framework for innate station traits, station
traits loaded as long as it's in a map's json

Here's the forum dev thread there are screenshots there.

### Mapping March
Ckey to receive rewards: Cheshify

## Why It's Good For The Game
So, this is the North Star. An effort taking multiple mappers and of 9~
months of hard work. This map was not initially designed for TGstation,
but always designed for TGstation code. The process of retooling the map
for TGstation was an absolute joy and I feel like the map definitely has
it's niche as a massive and unique experience for it's players.

I adore this map, it's gorgeous, has a unique aesthetic, and a number of
very funny interactions with multi-Z. The PR comes packed with unique
mechanics for future mappers (innate station traits!), a number of
map-fitting shuttles, and a fun spacefaring uniform gimmick for the
crew.

**This is my second attempt at bringing this map into rotation. It was
initially closed due to concerns about maptick and performance, as I
wasn't willing to push for a map to be added to the repository if it
didn't function to my own standards. I've been informed by a number of
coders far better than I that optimizations are arriving and enroute, so
I think it's time to dust her off and set sail for another journey.**

**Quick Disclaimer: Due to some design decisions disagreed upon by the
headcoder team and myself, the map will not be featuring unique
roundstart uniforms, and despite my design intentions, the innate
station trait features will be shelved for now.**

## Changelog
:cl: Cheshify, Fikou, Blue-Berry, Zytolg, InfiniteGalaxies, Striders,
Sylphet, Riggle, Soal, Andry, Crit, Deranging, and Pumpkin0.
add: Nanotrasen's Newest Exploratory Vessel is now available! Meet the
North Star!
add: More landmines, and a landmine random spawner.
add: energy barriers now have a regenerative subtype, fit for permanent
installations.
code: Raised the number of possible level render to 4, check your
preferences if needed to be reduced.

emerge-webrsync: support PGP verification via gemato

Introduce PGP verification of the webrsync snapshot tarballs
using app-portage/gemato - which is already a dependency of Portage
for verifying normal rsync.

This is the same method Portage uses (see below).

Technical changes before we dive into the rationale:
- Use gemato for PGP verification just like Portage does for
  sync-type=webrsync, sync-type=rsync (although that uses a metamanifest),
  and sync-type=git (although that uses gemato for gpg-wrap, so works differently).

- Use gentoo-functions automagically if available for better output
  functions.

- Be more verbose about verification and various other operations,
  while also respecting --quiet if passed for misc. existing & new
  messages.

- Make --verbose a no-op. There weren't enough output messages
  to justify three states (--quiet, normal, --verbose).

- Bail out more aggressively in the event of errors or "warnings".

- Use modern terminology for repository, etc (avoid overloading the
  "portage" term.)

- Allow disabling PGP verification with --no-pgp-verify.

Technically, the fix is very straightforward, but getting to
the fix was the slightly painful bit. What I've concluded
happened is:
- Portage starts getting reworked to gain proper sync module support;

- Someone gets the idea of implementing emerge-webrsync fully in Python
  as a Portage sync module (which is a not-unreasonable idea);

  [This ultimately hasn't gone anywhere, and in fact, while working on this
  bug, I ended up finding a bunch of typos that meant you couldn't even test it.
  But it's a stub anyway.]

- The idea of deprecating emerge-webrsync is floated around. The idea
  being Portage should call it via its new sync module with sync-type=webrsync.

  This is presumably with the ultimate goal of it transparently one day
  using the aforementioned (yet-non-existent) Python implementation as its
  backend, and not the shell script.

  [To this day, Portage's webrsync implementation shells out to the emerge-webrsync
  shell script, but it has the abstraction to switch that out, in theory.]

- At the time, PGP verification in general of the Gentoo
  repository is an active topic, especially now we'd migrated to git which makes
  it way easier, unlike CVS.

- A bug is filed for PGP verification in emerge-webrsync.

  People decide it doesn't matter too much, because Portage is going to
  Real Soon Now (TM) have its own backend (replacing the shell script) and/or
  Portage's sync module support obsoletes emerge-webrsync entirely.

  The idea here, I think, being that nobody should call emerge-webrsync and
  everyone should just call emerge (or emaint) to sync as appropriate.

  [This isn't a terrible idea in a sense, but it needs a better basis:
  we should probably make emerge-webrsync a wrapper which creates a temporary
  repo config to forcefully webrsync a repository if the user asks us to. This
  is what people expect from emerge-webrsync with the default sync-type=rsync
  in repos.conf for ::gentoo.

  I actually started implementing this before I realised that emerge was
  shelling out to emerge-webrsync, so have postponed it.]

- Then nothing happens with the "replacement" ideas and the good
  ol' trusty emerge-webrsync ends up with the same problems sitting
  there because nobody saw the point in working on it if it was to
  be replaced soon. But that didn't happen.

The fix overall for this is pretty small, but the commit is larger
than I'd like because I had to rework a few things to sensibly allow
disabling PGP verification as well as follow the flow.

(I did start splitting up this commit but ultimately it needs -w
for best review even without the output tweaks in this commit and
deconstructing this for atomic commits would end up being more brittle
as I couldn't be as confident in the result.)

Station Trait: Spider Infestation (#73893)

## About The Pull Request

Hate having your cables eaten by mice? Nanotrasen have heard your
complaints and settled on a natural, _organic_, and eco-friendly
solution.

When this station trait is active, roundstart and event mouse spawns
have a chance to instead be replaced with duct spiders (both will exist,
it doesn't remove mice).
Duct spiders are largely harmless to humans, actively hunt other
maintenance creatures (such as mice), and have only one _tiny_ downside.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/224345781-2627be98-67f2-4cab-ac40-c6c9b35ea909.png)

These mobs can also sometimes be spawned by a minor scrubber clog event.

As a side note, all spider basic mobs with AI (except Araneus) will now
try to automatically fill a small area around them with webs.

Also I made it so that mobs will ignore their random_walking behaviour
if they're engaged in a `do_after`, just in case.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Adds a little bit of variety to things which can slightly annoy you in
maintenance.
Spiders will automatically make places they live in look like spiders
live there.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: A station trait which sometimes populates maintenance with small
spiders. You can wear them as a hat if you wanted to have a spider on
your head for some reason.
add: Spider mobs will automatically start webbing up their environment.
