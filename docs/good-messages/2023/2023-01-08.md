[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Basic Mob Carp IX: Carp Rifts & Migration (#4008)

* Basic Mob Carp IX: Carp Rifts & Migration (#72265)

## About The Pull Request

The almost-final part of the much larger PR I tried to make a month ago
(there's actually one more thing but I'm waiting on a dog PR to get
merged first).
This adds _new_ behaviour and abilities to carp.

Now when a Carp Migration occurs, all of the space carp who are spawned
are given a path through the station.
Specifically, each carp which shares a z level will try to path to a
specific station area, then back out into space.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KtTI4_7a0c
Here in this video we follow one carp and its friends as it attempts to
navigate "Kilo Station" in order to return to its ancestral spawning
grounds, via the dormitories.
Why are there walls underneath those windows? That's a question nature
has no answer for.

In order to ensure that they don't destroy Arrivals, Departures, and
anywhere else with windows in the process of trying to get inside they
have also gained a new "Lesser Carp Rift" ability.
This allows carp to teleport a short distance once per minute, leaving a
rift at their exit point. Any other mob can enter the rift to travel to
a similar location to the space carp (within the same 3x3 area).

Teleporting puts their attack on a one second cooldown so you won't be
_immediately_ bitten for 20 damage out of nowhere.

Their AI has been updated appropriately and they will use these
abilities:
- If they're trying to migrate through the station and encounter an
obstacle.
- If they're trying to atack something and encounter an obstacle.
- If they're trying to run away, as soon as possible.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/209584287-4402bf5b-3c41-4603-9205-5c4da8b4cd1c.mp4

That last point includes the HoS's pet Lia, who is an occasional target
of traitor objectives, which can either work in your favour (scaring her
to a less secure location) or against it (wait, where did she go?).

Also this fixes an embarassing bug where space carp weren't spaceproof
but I am going to pull that out into its own PR so it can be merged
without also needing to review this.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Carp are an iconic space animal but also quite boring, which this
hopefully remedies.

In the current game the Carp Migration event announces itself to the
crew and usually advertises to ghosts that a cool shark mob has spawned
and this changes essentially nothing about the round, the only people
Carp will usually attack are people who go out to set up the solars, and
the occasional wandering curator or lone operative.
This should make the announcement mean something, as suddenly it means a
belligerent animal might unexpectedly try to pass through your
workplace.

Non-magical space carp are weak enough that even an unarmed spaceman can
take on one or two at a time (and even being mildly armed with makeshift
weapons you have around makes them fairly non-threatening) but it can
give you a bit of excitement.

The ability for Carp to teleport allows them to do this without causing
_too much_ property damage or breaching the station, in my tests they
will _generally_ find a way in which doesn't involve them busting
windows open en masse. Also it just makes them a bit more interesting.
Traitors with dehydrated carp are not much able to make use of the Carp
Rift ability as there isn't any way to get them to do it on demand, but
you could spawn one which is not allied to you and then try to scare it
in an appropriate direction which I think is a fun use of the item.

This undoubtedly will make Space Dragon player-controlled carp more
dangerous in a way which is difficult to predict, but it also makes
playing as them more fun and might encourage some guerilla tactics and
cooperation which wasn't previously possible.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Space Carp seem to have begun associating the station with food and
attempting to enter from the outside, rather than simply congregating
around solar panels. Employees are advised that these are wild animals,
and should not be fed.
add: Space Carp can intermittently teleport short distances, leaving a
short lived rift which other nearby carp will be attracted to follow
them through.

Auto merge of #104658 - thomcc:rand-update-and-usable-no_std, r=Mark-Simulacrum

Update `rand` in the stdlib tests, and remove the `getrandom` feature from it.

The main goal is actually removing `getrandom`, so that eventually we can allow running the stdlib test suite on tier3 targets which don't have `getrandom` support. Currently those targets can only run the subset of stdlib tests that exist in uitests, and (generally speaking), we prefer not to test libstd functionality in uitests, which came up recently in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104095 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104185. Additionally, the fact that we can't update `rand`/`getrandom` means we're stuck with the old set of tier3 targets, so can't test new ones.

~~Anyway, I haven't checked that this actually does allow use on tier3 targets (I think it does not, as some work is needed in stdlib submodules) but it moves us slightly closer to this, and seems to allow at least finally updating our `rand` dep, which definitely improves the status quo.~~ Checked and works now.

For the most part, our tests and benchmarks are fine using hard-coded seeds. A couple tests seem to fail with this (stuff manipulating the environment expecting no collisions, for example), or become pointless (all inputs to a function become equivalent). In these cases I've done a (gross) dance (ab)using `RandomState` and `Location::caller()` for some extra "entropy".

Trying to share that code seems *way* more painful than it's worth given that the duplication is a 7-line function, even if the lines are quite gross. (Keeping in mind that sharing it would require adding `rand` as a non-dev dep to std, and exposing a type from it publicly, all of which sounds truly awful, even if done behind a perma-unstable feature).

See also some previous attempts:
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86963 (in particular https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86963#issuecomment-885438936 which explains why this is non-trivial)
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89131
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96626#issuecomment-1114562857 (I tried in that PR at the same time, but settled for just removing the usage of `thread_rng()` from the benchmarks, since that was the main goal).
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104185
- Probably more. It's very tempting of a thing to "just update".

refreshes syndi-kits and syndicate surplus crates, introduces shared limited stock (#71869)

## About The Pull Request

After all, the Syndicate loves a good throwback.


![C6O47fPhAB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/207737104-3d24574f-02e0-433d-8ea7-6825ca4cb970.png)

This PR does a few things with the goal of reimplementing and
revitalizing syndicate traitor kits and the syndicate surplus crate.
Of note is that I have added in a way for limited stock items to share
their limited stock.

Following maintainer guidance the syndicate traitor kits have increased
in price and as a result some of the lower value ones have been
adjusted. I've given all active bundles current TC costs per item
knowing full well they will be inaccurate eventually.

<details>
  <summary>Changes as a result of my audit of syndikits</summary>
    
### UNCHANGED
Recon, Spai, Stealthy, Screwed, Sniper, Nukie Meta, Implants
Mad Scientist, Bees

Lord Singuloth is also unchanged and disabled, I think that it should
turn into a new supermatter themed kit maybe. outside of current scope.

### Gun Kit
Replaced emag with doorjack and gave it a chameleon holster, literally
moved 1 tc elsewhere

### Murderer
replaced emag again, no additions its a lot of tc and Just Good

### Hacker
added doorjack, otherwise unchanged

### Sabotage
no changes other than adding in extra bombs it didnt have

### James Bond
gave him some gadgets with the freedom implant, emp flashlight, and one
x4. also a cyanide pill and deck of cards for fun

### Ninja
Added in miner Jump Boots, smoke spell, and doorjack. dont just want it
to be space ninja

### Dark Lord
Added in new lightning bolt spell granter and made the desword default
to red. probably overbudget.

### White Whale
dehydrated carp added so you can ride it alongside the ones you grenade
out. hard to imagine changing this

### Mr Freeze
changed temperature gun to be cryo only so that i could give him the
cryo thermal pistol. cold attacks only.

### 2006 Traitor
doorjack.

</details> 

tl;dr theyre all about 30 tc worth of shit more or less some are more
but thats what rarity should be for
you can only buy from one type of syndicrate per round


![QOF1WO7CC6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/207739417-00ae6b81-b6aa-4774-a4bb-f2d880988ff4.gif)

Next up is the return of the surplus crate. 
Crate is generated, gives you gear **based on your progression at the
time of buying the crate**, you can use it all at the start and get some
chameleon kits and not a lot of dangerous weapons or wait till later.
I've changed the weight on some items here and there and given weight to
role and species locked items, though I will admit that latter is
unimportant because I set moth lanterns to be unable to appear in these
two crates.


![dreamseeker_t8abXysKqK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/206761978-96e2a51e-f9a5-48e4-a863-a9198fa15ea2.gif)

But who cares about that your eyes instantly went to the United Surplus
Crate and the United Surplus Key lets be honest.

The united surplus crate is 80 TC worth of uplink items relative to your
current progression when you purchase it and gives you a locked box. It
**will explode if you try to break it** so be careful with it. It gives
you 80 TC and costs 20 TC because it is impossible to open without key.
The rub of course is that the Syndicate forbids agents from buying more
than one surplus item of any kind, you need to find another traitor and
make them buy you a key to open your box. Or I guess you can share the
box?


![dreamseeker_ts0AZeiyfy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/207740388-3f688bba-5d71-48d2-8079-671bbed7e54e.gif)

Regardless, if the crate is opened with any other means it doesn't spawn
its contents, you need 2 traitor uplinks.
Both of these items have a 30 minute timer because you don't want a
crate that has 5 emp flashlights in it. You at least want one energy
sword.

I did a lot of code shit and changed various things to be proc based to
allow for more editing and interjection of things, as I wrote in code
comments making a crate thats locked to a specific set of progression
just means changing the proc that generates a list of valid uplink items
to check items' progression values to a specified value instead of your
characters progression.

Ok I think that goes over everything more or less????

## Why It's Good For The Game

I've heard that people liked these and I think they are quite fun, being
able to go from "i dunno what to do as a traitor" to "ah, of course, I
will become the Bombler" is a fun thing to be able to have, and people
like to get a bunch of random shit in the mail. Some of it even feels
free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Brain points go up!!!

The division of procs allows for more creativity with this system than
existed before as well as other possibilities for interacting with the
uplink handler in funny ways.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: the syndicate is once again distributing syndi-kits, some now with
new technology
add: a fresh batch of syndicate surplus crates have been sent out,
though they seem a bit lighter than before
add: in an effort to encourage cooperation, a traitor can now purchase
either the new United Surplus Syndicate Crate or its key, but not both
add: lightning bolt book granter for wizard event and one syndie-kit
bundle
add: temperature gun that only makes things colder for one syndie-kit
bundle
code: it is now possible to have uplink items share limited stock
bal: role-restricted items no longer can be delivered by the stray
syndicate drop pod event

Gatfruit will no longer drop from ice portals. (#72048)

## About The Pull Request

For some god-forsaken reason, somebody decided that ice portals should
be able to drop one of the most disruptive items in the game. This PR
amends this by removing it from the drop pool.

## Why It's Good For The Game

In 2013 gatfruit was introduced in the following PR #2000 . This was
almost a decade ago at this point, repeatedly through the PR the creator
states his belief that this item should only ever be obtainable through
admin intervention due to its ridiculous capabilities. At the time
everyone in the PR agreed it was a reasonable item to add **as it was
unobtainable without admin intervention**. Over the years, it has crept
its way to become more prevalent and openly obtainable, the most
offensive of these options is the ice moon portal. As is, there is a 1
in 28 chance of obtaining the seeds, this sounds pretty inoffensive
right? That's just 3.44% probability. Now, let us search the instances
of the portal that spawns this.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16896032/208220173-bbefe604-0885-44a5-9add-b5f0c62067cc.png)

That is a big number, a lot of chances to get that seed packet and other
gamer looters. Now, let's take a look at the probability of being able
to get these seeds, assuming you wipe out all of the portals.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16896032/208220460-3f59a2ac-d936-4f3a-aa14-9c637af6a9d7.png)

92.8% chance to be able to get these seeds each shift if you focus
entirely on gaming the portals. That's a pretty insane probability of
being able to obtain the gatfruit seeds.

While I dislike people who sprint to the seed vault, there is at least
the possibility of a pod person telling them to fuck off when they
demand their _free_ gamer seed. There is also the fact that the ruin
isn't a guaranteed spawn every shift.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Gatfruit seeds will no longer drop from ice portals.

*hand, or That /One/ Emote You Always Felt Was Missing (#71600)

## About The Pull Request
It's happened to me _repeatedly_ that I'd see someone down on the floor,
and wanted to just, give them a hand, so they could take it and get up
that way, without just, directly clicking on them, since that's a little
bland. I've also wanted to just, offer my hand to someone so they could
grab it, so that I could pull them alongside me, rather than just
targeting one of their arms and ctrl-clicking them.

I've had this idea for a _long_ time, and only just decided to do this
today.

Now, I know what you might say. "Golden, that's a lot of code for
something this simple!" You're not wrong. _However_. I decided to go
along and to give some more love to the `/datum/status_effect/offering`
status effect and the offering-related alerts, to make them a lot more
versatile and a lot less hardcoded. Hence the whole "refactoring" part
of this.

Of course, when I add something, I don't do it half-way. So, the way the
emote works is much like the `*slap` emote, except that:

- When you click on someone, it does the exact same as if you were
offering the item to them, except that it's targeted (much like
ctrl-shift-click).
- If there's nobody directly adjacent to you, it won't do anything.
- If there's at least one person lying down around you, you will offer
them your help to get up. Should they take your hand and let you help
them up, you will both receive a simple memory about being helped up (or
helping up), as well as a 45-seconds-long small mood buff, because it
feels nice to be on either end of such a friendly gesture. If they get
up, they automatically get disqualified from being offered some help
standing up, and likewise, if you lie down, that offer goes away as
well.
- If there's at least one person around you, you will instead extend
your hand in their direction, for them to grab onto it. Should they do
so, you will then grab them by their arms and pull them.

I reworked the offering status effect to no longer have a hardcoded
`can_hold_items()` check, so that kisses and the hand offering would no
longer need you to have free hands to complete. The logic here is that
you can still pull someone even with both hands filled, so I figured I'd
leave it this way.

Note: If anyone would like to give the item a better sprite, by all
means, go ahead, that'd be amazing. I'm just not really a great spriter
and couldn't be bothered to waste hours making a very _meh_ hand.

## Why It's Good For The Game
It's fluff, and nice fluff at that. It makes it easier for people to be
nice to one-another without having to necessarily spend so long writing
up an emote that the person on the floor will already have gotten back
up. I'm sure the MRP folks will like it, and I'm certain the HRP
downstreams will love it too ;)

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Added the *hand emote, which you can offer to someone standing up
in order to give them the possibility to grab onto your hand and let you
drag them away, or to someone lying down to help them back up, which
always makes everyone involved a little happier!
refactor: De-hardcoded and genericized a lot of the offering status
effect and alert code, to make it require a lot less copy-paste to
handle new cases.
fix: Offering a kiss no longer requires the receiver to have free hands
to accept said kiss!

fs: get rid of silly base class that causes build failures now

The base class thing was an ugly way to get around the lack of C99
compound literals in C++, and also to make the bare ioctls usable with
the derived classes.

Today, both clang and gcc have C99 compound literals, so there's no need
to do crazy things with memset.  We never used the derived classes for
ioctls, and for this specific ioctl it would have been a very, very bad
idea, so there's no need to support that either.  We do need to jump
through hoops for ostream& operator<<() but we had to do those anyway
as there are other members in the derived type.

So we can simply drop the base class, and build the args object on the
stack in `do_ioctl`.  This also removes the need to verify initialization.

There's no bug here since the `info` member of the base class was
never used in place by the derived class, but new compilers reject the
flexible array member in the base class because the derived class makes
`info` be not at the end of the struct any more:

	error: flexible array member btrfs_ioctl_same_args::info not at end of struct crucible::BtrfsExtentSame

Guess not every story had a good ending.

Well, I tried, tried very hard to earn her trust back, but seems that once something is done, it can't be undone, no matter how hard you tried to make up, to do redemptions, It's just too late because she is already blinded by hate and disappointment from you, and she will never see that effort you are trying to win her heart back, to prove that you are worthy to say "I love u" again. Guess I learned this in a "hard" way, which cost me "you", the one who I loved the most, the one who originally is willing to be with me until our hairs are grey, until we all become dirt and sand and whatever. I love you and will remember you forever. Thanks for everything, Doria, I <3 u and miss u.

[MIRROR] AI actions won't unassign each other's movement targets & Mice stop being scared of people if fed cheese  [MDB IGNORE] (#18268)

AI actions won't unassign each other's movement targets & Mice stop being scared of people if fed cheese  (#72130)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #72116 
I've had a persistent issue with basic mob actions reporting this error
and think I finally cracked it
When replanning with `AI_BEHAVIOR_CAN_PLAN_DURING_EXECUTION` it can run
`Setup` on one action leading to the plan changing, meaning that it runs
`finishCommand` to cancel all other existing commands
If you triggered a replan by setting up a movement action in the middle
of another movement action, cancelling the existing action would remove
the target already set by the current one.
We want actions to be able to remove _their own_ movement target but not
if it has been changed by something else in the intervening time.

I fixed this by passing a source every time you set a movement target
and adding a proc which only clears it if you are the source... but this
feels kind of ugly. I couldn't think of anything but if you have a
better idea let me know.

Also while I was doing this I turned it into a feature because I'm
crazy.
If you feed a mouse cheese by hand it will stop being scared of humans
and so will any other mice it attracts from eating more cheese. This is
mostly because I think industrial mouse farming to pass cargo bounties
is funny.
Mice controlled by a Regal Rat lose this behaviour and forget any past
loyalties they may have had.

Oh also I removed a block about cancelling if you have another target
from the "hunt" behaviour, everywhere using this already achieves that
simply by ordering the actions in expected priority order and it was
messing with how I expected mice to work.
Now if they happen to stop by some cheese they will correctly stop
fleeing in order to eat it before continuing to run away.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes a bug I kept running into.
Makes it possible to set up a mouse farm without them screaming
constantly.
Lets people more easily domesticate mice to support Ratatouille
gameplay.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Mice who are fed cheese by hand will accept humans as friends, at
least until reminded otherwise by their rightful lord.
fix: Fixed a runtime preventing mice from acting correctly when trying
to flee and also eat cheese at the same time.

Happy New Year's! Since the old commit, Head straight to these URLs, http://localhost:3000/users?name=null
https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/6310f50334d2812a3eb177c6#/clusters
https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/6310f50334d2812a3eb177c6#/metrics/replicaSet/6310f63d0fc49052e0e2cd0e/explorer/test/postmessages/find.
33 Messages? Delete them! "But first", let's look and see what they look like on the front-end.
babel-eslint version is a thing.
We weren't fetching them from `memories_project/client`? We are on `memories_project/client`. What was Cannot destructure property 'data' of '(intermediate value)' as it is undefined. It actually comes from ? The *fetch*! The *GET*! Since we look into MongoDB, into the front-end at "Memories" Project & Da-Repo, Server, and can't find the ? posts.js file, we return the axios fetch! Hmm the images Are they loading? No.
Return the axios fetch, and you'll see our new posts "come to life"! What does the axios fetch 'look like' on The Memories Project? `src/api/index.js` strictly an export file. `src/actions/posts.js` strictly an access file, `import * as api from '../api/index.js';` Is it "strictly" an access file? No, it gets exported into `src/App.js`And the rest is "history", the history that we "over-wrote" when that email "made its way" to my inbox. What happens when we dispatch the `getPosts` thunk?
Dispatches the getPosts thunk. Let's dispatch the `getPosts` thunk. ❤️  for thinking of this. We have got the database, the server running. "What's the difference?". Compare and differentiate `npm start` & `npm run dev`. Todo: Compare `npm start` with `npm run dev`. How do you copy & paste forward slash in "the" Discord Thread Title?
Oh sweet, we were able to get that to work on the other page. Like the actual social page we will use.
Return not just to http://localhost:3000/ but to the error, ``` let users = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("users"))
SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON``` in "helpers". helpers/actions/postsAPI.js add the `return` so the function "knows" to return it.
```export const fetchPosts = () => {
  console.log("We are fetching with the 'input'", url)
  return axios.get(url)
};``` http://localhost:3000/users?name=null 🙂
The users undefined JSON "still" persists! "How?" Because we clicked on Conor Lamb http://localhost:3000/users?name=null. What sets a user in "the Browser" Session Storage?
`getPosts` is declared but its value is never read.
Todo: Dispatch getPosts as the Redux thunk that it is. The location is pages/users.js and we are at the "un-used" import
import { getPosts } from '../helpers/actions/posts';
pages/users.js -- Da-Repo
Invoke the getPosts function. How is the getPostsThunk supposed to be invoked?
There are some things called RESTful APIs!
How is the getPosts Thunk supposed to be invoked? How is it invoked in the original memories_project, but "not in the Da-Repo"?
The only thing that we are missing, is the invocation.
The getPosts thunk is simply dispatched within the
```useEffect(() => {
        dispatch(getPosts());
    }, [currentId, dispatch]);``` hook.
UseEffect means the same thing as componentDidMount
in a Regular component 🙂
And do it with the currentId of null and the state of dispatch.
```const [currentId, setCurrentId] = useState(null);
    const classes = useStyles();
    const dispatch = useDispatch();```
Where is this data and does it look similar?
To the data being fetched from memories_project? "We are looking at the data from Da-Repo."
How can we get the data back on the local state (props?) via Redux? At least it arrives on update!
The original client/src/App.js in memories_project. In client/src/App.js, the Container tells us where to put the Posts, and the dispatch is made. In App.js, it's just a container for holding the components later on down the "stream".
client/src/components/Posts/Posts.js.
```import Post from './Post/Post';
return (
        !posts.length ? <CircularProgress /> : (
            <Grid className = {classes.container} container alignItems="stretch" spacing={3}>
                {posts.map((post) => (
                    <Grid key={post._id} item xs={12} sm={6}>
                        <Post post={post} setCurrentId={setCurrentId} />
                    </Grid>
                ))}
            </Grid>
        )
    );```
What does it take to get the "whole" posts thing set-up? Where is the Post component? Post.js. It looks like it takes two para-meters, these are `post` and `setCurrentId` !
Ordinarily, we import Post from './Post/Post';
If we're willing, we can go down the hierarchy directly.
Seems to be "unreachable", posts does
The name of the Posts file can be replicated, just create a new one!
What happens when we invoke the Post (without Actions, without setCurrentId)? Therefore, we are fetching the posts
Let's test Post Creation. Create a POST!
There, we can see it. Todo: find a way to host front-end and back-end on different servers so that our Vercel.app server (or Render, with the appropriate DATABASE_URL?ssl=true we might be able to render the database "API_URL" as an environment variable, with Render we might be able to cross domain origin resource sharing). We just might in that we can "accept" req.body.origin and then...return the data. The server will behave like a reflex in that the data just gets sent back from the server without any need for thought. The server "knows where to send the response", how does it know? What is the "architecture" of the server that may allow us to "transmute" across different req.body.origin? 🙂
serviceAccount.json has the "credentials". The pages/api/database/serviceAccount.json!
If that's for Firebase, then what are "the MongoDB data API keys"?
It is possible that this only needs to occur on "the back-end"
That means the social/server/index.js
There are two primary components the front-end, social/client/...
and the back-end social/server
Then we just connect to the back-end via Axios.
Todo: see "how MongoDB Works" Where are the MongoDB API keys? It's possible that the memories_project doesn't have any.
That we don't have any. Todo: See if we can get the site to cross-connect CORS Resource. Can we host the back-end on a different server? Host the back-end on a "foreign" hosting service, and see if we can connect to it.
The idea is to host the back-end on its own server, and then connect to it via the front-end.
"This is where it all happens.".
"postsAPI.js"
What is the route through which the Back-end receives requests? It could be somewhere on the back-end code.
That means we need to handle incoming requests.
"But first", let us go through the front-end.
Let us do the deployment premierement.
How do we get into the back-end?
How do we host the back-end on a server, is Heroku an "option"?

Make the build work under more JDK versions.

(Guava is already _usable_ under plenty of verions. This change affects only people who build it themselves.)

And run CI under JDK17. Maybe this will make CI painfully slow, but we'll see what happens. If we want to drop something, we should consider whether to revert 17 or to drop 11 instead (so as to maintain coverage at the endpoints of \[8, 17\]).

## Notes on some of the versions

### JDK9

I expected Error Prone to work, but I saw `invalid flag: -Xep:NullArgumentForNonNullParameter:OFF`, even though that flag is [already](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/166d8c0d8733d40914fb24f368cb587a92bddfe0/pom.xml#L515) part of [the same `<arg>`](https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/1086#issuecomment-411544589), which works fine for other JDK versions. So I disabled Error Prone for that version.

Then I had a Javadoc problem with the `--no-module-directories` configuration from cl/413934851 (the fix for https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5457). After reading [JDK-8215582](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8215582) more carefully, I get the impression that that flag might not have been added until 11: "addressed in JDK 11, along with an option to revert to the old layout in case of need." So I disabled it for 9-10.

Then I ran into a problem similar to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6173 / [JDK-8184940](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8184940). I'm not sure exactly what tool produced a file with a month of 0, but it happened only when building `guava-tests`. At that point, I gave up, though I left the 2 above workarounds in place.

### JDK10

This fails with some kind of problem finding a Guice dependency inside Maven. I didn't investigate.

### JDK15 and JDK16

These fail with [the `TreeMap` bug](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8259622) that [our collection testers had detected](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issue-1068748849) but we never got around to reporting. Thankfully, it got reported and [fixed](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/2c8e337dff4c84fb435cafac8b571f94e161f074) for JDK17. We could consider suppressing the tests under that version.

### JDK18, JDK19, and JDK20-early-access

These fail with [`SecurityManager` trouble](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issuecomment-1293817701).

## Notes on the other actual changes

### `maven-javadoc-plugin`

I set up `maven-javadoc-plugin` to use `-source ${java.specification.version}`. Otherwise, it would [take the version from `maven-compiler-plugin`](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issuecomment-1314291284). That's typically fine: Guava's source code targets Java 8, so `-source 8` "ought" to work. But it doesn't actually work because we also pass Javadoc the _JDK_ sources (so that `{@inheritDoc}` works better), which naturally can target whichever version of the JDK we're building with.

### Error Prone

While Error Prone is mostly usable [on JDK11+](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation), some of its checks have [problems under some versions](https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3540), at least when they're reporting warnings.

This stems from its use of part of the Checker Framework, which [doesn't support JDKs in the gap between 11 and 17](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/blob/c2d16b3409000ac2e2ca95b8b81ae11e42195308/framework/src/main/java/org/checkerframework/framework/source/SourceChecker.java#L553-L554). And specifically,  it looks like the Checker Framework is [trying to look up `BindingPatternTree` under any JDK12+](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/blob/c2d16b3409000ac2e2ca95b8b81ae11e42195308/javacutil/src/main/java/org/checkerframework/javacutil/TreeUtils.java#L131-L144). But `BindingPatternTree` (besides not being present at all [until JDK14](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/229e0d16313b10932b9ce7506d84096696983699#diff-3db4b0ce4411c851bcf75d92ef4dadc7351debcf0f9b2c2623dc513923b45867R41)) didn't declare that method [until JDK16](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/18bc95ba51b6864150c28985e65b6f784ea8ee2c#diff-3db4b0ce4411c851bcf75d92ef4dadc7351debcf0f9b2c2623dc513923b45867R39).

Anyway, the problem we saw was [a `NoSuchMethodException` during the `AbstractReferenceEquality` call to `NullnessAnalysis.getNullness`](https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/log-a9d04aa2-8b5a-47ca-8066-7e6b38548064.txt), which uses Checker Framework dataflow.

To address that, I disabled Error Prone for the versions under which I'd expect the `BindingPatternTree` code to be a problem.

(I also disabled it for JDK10: As noted above, Error Prone [supports JDK11+](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation). And as noted further above, Maven doesn't get far enough with JDK10 to even start running Error Prone.)

Won't you step into this cloud of steam?
This steam

Give me steam
And how you feel can make it real
Real as anything you've seen
Get a life with the dreamer's dream

Help me, yeah
Ready to steam out the log jam
Stir crazy from the freezer to the foil
Water's bubbling, it's b-b-b-bubbling
Bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
Like it's coming to a boil
Give me steam, lady
Give me steam around me now
Coming alive
Coming alive
Said give me some steam

Screen/Linux: Support Wayland compositors without wl_shell, but xdg_shell.

libWaffle as of its latest release now also supports the basic stable
xdg shell protocol for window creation and management:

In the past, only wl_shell was supported. Now it will try to use
xdg_shell and fall back to wl_shell if xdg_shell is not supported.
As most production compositors do support xdg_shell in at least a
basic variant by now, this means most of the time xdg_shell will
be used.

Adapt our window setup code to make use of this new Waffle feature.
Also some cosmetic changes to status messages etc.

This now allows testing on wlroots-based compositors like Sway WM,
which do not support old wl_shell, but only xdg_shell. Also a bit
more robust on KDE's kwin wayland and GNOME's Mutter wayland.

Restrictions:

- We do not use xdg_shell calls ourselves yet, but rely on Waffle,
  so we are restricted: Can't select which output to display a
  fullscreen window on. That's supported on wl_shell only so far.

- Also no assignment of window titles in windowed mode.

- Oh and we need a bug-fixed libWaffle, as upstream release has a
  bug in its fullscreen xdg support! I'll need to upstream my fix.

- Sway does support the presentation timing feedback protocol, so
  now we have n=2 compositors with not totally broken timing, yay!
  However: Scheduling on Sway is as much of a s***-show as expected,
  as each Wayland compositor seems to reinvent the wheel in terms
  of composition scheduling. This will stay awful until a proper
  presentation timing extension is released and supported by most
  compositors. On Sway one needs these tweaks to get not totally
  awful timing and performance on a 144 Hz display:

  In Octave: setenv('PSYCH_WAYLAND_SWAPDELAY', '-0.002')
  In Sway's config file (see man sway-output):

  output DP-3 max_render_time 2

  Why these magic numbers? I wouldn't know, but endless tinkering
  made it work best for these settings. Any other refresh rate
  would probably need different numbers.

-> So this is an improvement, but far from anything one would want

Some NITs (follow-up to MR 1600)

Some minor changes that (in my opinion) help to improve the readability and code review, like:

* Using for-range loops if possible.
* Remove `else` and `else if` after `return` to reduce nesting.
* Defaulting constructors/destructors when possible.
* Improve const-correctness.
* Prefer `bool x = false;` than `bool x{};`. The latter makes you have to remember what the default value of the type is. While it should be obvious to the C++ programmer, we have many reviewers who are not experts in the language. I think this kind on initialization is useful for generic programming `T x{};`, but if you know the type, I prefer to be the more explicit as possible.

## Test Plan

* `ninja all check`

Drinking singulo ignores supermatter hallucinations and pulls nearby objects (#71927)

## About The Pull Request
Drinking a singulo will now:

- Give immunity to supermatter hallucinations
- Pulls objects to you based on the total volume in your system (20u =
1x1, 45u = 2x2, 80u = 3x3)
- Makes a burp and supermatter rays/sound when objects are pulled

The new ingredient is:

- Vokda 5u 
- Wine 5u
- Liquid Dark Matter 1u (replaces Radium)

## Why It's Good For The Game
More cool effects for drinks. Singularity is all about gravity and the
drink should have a theme around that.


![dreamseeker_2q21YXS698](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5195984/207297517-90d26395-dd30-4106-bdd4-b30b1ba3e20b.gif)

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Drinking singulo will now ignore supermatter hallucinations and
pull objects to you
balance: Change singulo drink recipe to require liquid dark matter
instead of radium.

"Time for lunch.

6:35pm. Done with lunch. Mitsuha 80k starts today.

https://wyclif.substack.com/p/social-norms-the-downside

8:35pm. Sigh, damn it. I just want the docs to the Tenstorrent chips. Could it really be the case that the company is in trouble? That can't be it. Why all this trouble?

Am I really so cursed that I can't even get the docs for the Tenstorrent chips? If that particular company cannot deliver, then what else am I supposed to hope for?

I have no patience. I am going to fire another email on Wednesday if I still haven't gotten contact by then asking if there is a problem.

8:55pm. I want it so much. If there is any difference between me in late 2021, is that I want just this little bit of hope. If I could at least get some confirmation that the hardware I want is going to exist, that would motivate me.

9:05pm. If I can't get a reply from Tenstorrent by the end of the week, I'll poke their discord as well as post the article on HN. It is not a very interesting article, but the HN guys are smart, so maybe I'll get something good.

If that fails as well, I'll have to push my foray into AI chips all the way into 2024. I guess I'll be working a job by then. Agh, I want to program AI chips. That is the only thing that I want. What is the right choice here? I don't know.

Gee. If only there were some sort of planet-sized electronic network of these AI widgets working together, being staffed around the clock by dutiful apeslaves, working 24/7 to feed data into the datasets and thereby increasing the capacity of each individual AI-widget... The kind of massive worldbrain that could, say, go from nonexistent to being able to replace office-apes over the span of a couple dozen years. The kind of thing that everyone spends all day feeding into, with no exceptions; industry, education, art, literature, music, commerce, every single facet of every human's existence, from love to work to entertainment to death, everything, 24/7, without any hint of slowing down. Gee golly, that sure would be something. But enough about that... let's talk about why ChatGPT is so fucking stupid and can't do word problems.

Most projects I encounter these days instantly reach for kubernetes, containers and microservices or cloud functions.
I find it much more appealing to just make the whole thing run on one fast machine. When you suggest this tend to people say "but scaling!", without understanding how much capacity there is in vertical.

The thing most appealing about single server configs is the simplicity. The more simple a system easy, likely the more reliable and easy to understand.

The software thing most people are building these days can easily run lock stock and barrel on one machine.

I wrote a prototype for an in-memory message queue in Rust and ran it on the fastest EC2 instance I could and it was able to process nearly 8 million messages a second.

You could be forgiven for believing the only way to write software is is a giant kablooie of containers, microservices, cloud functions and kubernetes, because that's what the cloud vendors want you to do, and it's also because it seems to be the primary approach discussed. Every layer of such stuff add complexity, development, devops, maintenance, support, deployment, testing and (un)reliability. Single server systems can be dramatically mnore simple because you can trim is as close as possible down to just the code and the storage.

9:25am. Let me chill and then I will start. Jobs...yeah, my biggest problem is that the true purpose of a programmer is to make money for a company, and making money is my weakness. As much as I'd like to get a job making 500k a year, can I even make 50k for myself? Until I understand this value creation thing, I should dampen my enthusiasm for money. Working for the sake of programming itself is the only purpose that I need.

That is the way things should go.

No emails, as expected.

9:55am. I need to get a handle on my purpose in order to break through this deadlock. If I can do it for the right reason, I could get over my interview neurosis. That is what I've concluded over the night.

For now let me just think about it for a while and then it will come to me. I'll just write for a few months as per plan and bring Heaven's Key to its conclussion.

10:30am. https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/90772792

Let me get started. I'll leave this thread for later.

In some ways, I am done with programming. Having made a language like Spiral, I feel like I've covered a lot of the ground. The experience of making it was good in the end. The problem is AI. The problem is getting stuck. This killed me back in high school too.

In the end, I can only have the machine do the tough problems itself. There will be things I cannot do by myself. Things I cannot see no matter how hard I try.

Making Spiral was an accomplishment.

But the highest thing I can do is make the machine solve the unsolvable problems itself. That is true AI. That cuts to the essence.

I ran into trouble, and I turned the other way. When I can push forward with the strength of the machines, that is when I will have reached the apex. I am not there yet. What I have to do is a very small thing, but nonetheless I have to do it.

10:30am. I cannot do anything more than this. I made a language for myself. The next step is to make a language for the machine itself. The way I've been able to gradually improve while working on Spiral was great. AI should be like that for me, but it wasn't. By making a language for the machines, that is how I will restore balance to the force and bring back the justice to the world.

10:35am. A language for the machine.

That should be the pinnacle of my ambition. I wanted so badly a language for myself, but that is not enough. I need to reach out and open the door fully.

This thing here with Tenstorrent and the article is embarassing. I need to get myself into a position where I do not care about the individual companies. That I've been peeved at the UPMEM guy is already a mistake in itself. If I had a solid sense of purpose, I would not be shaken by interviews or ghosting or lack of money.

I should pay respects to the accomplishments that I've made, and move on to doing what I need to do.

10:40am. For now, let me just write. Since my mom is dying from cancer it is really a tense thing to do. Frittering away time on my hobby when I could be making the money to cryofreeze her. She will die and I will be feeling guilty about it, but I want to be the kind of person that is unshackled by the past, even though I am not at all like that now. Maybe one day, with the power of the transcendence...

12:30pm. 44.25k. 1.2k.

Not bad. Let me chill a bit.

2:30pm. Let me resume. Time to write more Heaven's Key. Stop reading /a/ threads. Focus on writing. Tomorrow will come and maybe I will get an answer to the docs request. If so good. Either way, I will finish it next week and will be able to move no mentally to the next phase.

Evolution through Large Models

> This paper pursues the insight that large language models (LLMs) trained to generate code can vastly improve the effectiveness of mutation operators applied to programs in genetic programming (GP). Because such LLMs benefit from training data that includes sequential changes and modifications, they can approximate likely changes that humans would make. To highlight the breadth of implications of such evolution through large models (ELM), in the main experiment ELM combined with MAP-Elites generates hundreds of thousands of functional examples of Python programs that output working ambulating robots in the Sodarace domain, which the original LLM had never seen in pre-training. These examples then help to bootstrap training a new conditional language model that can output the right walker for a particular terrain. The ability to bootstrap new models that can output appropriate artifacts for a given context in a domain where zero training data was previously available carries implications for open-endedness, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. These implications are explored here in depth in the hope of inspiring new directions of research now opened up by ELM.

Found this on in a HN thread. Seems right up my alley. Using NNs to boost evolution is what I'd want to do.

(Main Euclid POV - Branch Of Reality, Inside The Cab)

‘I am done. In the real world, one of my forks is digging in, under the ground. Now we will be safe from anything. It is as you requested.’ Eua informed.

‘I have no doubt you’d have done this either way without my prompting.’ I told her.

‘Of course. What do you want to do now?’ She asked me, and as she did so the game loaded, and my senses came to me.

“We are here.” The gruff voiced cabbie informed me.

I was inside the cab, the one that gave me a ride back home from the Fireball Arcade. I looked outside the window and right there was my home. I got a twinge of melancholy as I made the decision, but I cannot let personal relations get in the way of my safety and my future. I finally have my power, and a world of adventure is waiting for me out there. A great unknown, that for once I have the power to grasp.

“I changed my mind. Let's go back to town. Take me to the most expensive hotel in town.”

///

Maybe I should just stop here. This kind of melancholic scene fits the mood, but I meant to have Euclid do something based instead. Though admittedly, doing what he would do would mean being a bit of a bitch.

5:35pm. 46.1k. Maybe I will do a branch of reality to incorporate the scene I had in mind.

5:40pm. This is good enough for the day.

Let me post this on the Episteme tier and then I will close.

5:45pm. Posted it on Patreon. Let me close here. Tomorrow I will close this mini-arc with Branch Euclid. Not the chapter, just the particular story thread. Then comes Elaina's introduction. I am not sure if I will put anything else before the City Of Dawn stage.

But there have to be some scenes of Elaina growing up. This is going to be a pretty long chapter.

Time for lunch."

Merge tag 'riscv-for-linus-4.16-merge_window' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/palmer/riscv-linux

Pull RISC-V updates from Palmer Dabbelt:
 "This contains the fixes we'd like to target for the 4.16 merge window.
  It's not as much as I was originally hoping to do but between glibc,
  the chip, and FOSDEM there just wasn't enough time to get everything
  put together. As such, this merge window is essentially just going to
  be small changes. This includes mostly cleanups:

   - A build fix failure to the audit test cases.

     RISC-V doesn't have renameat because the generic syscall ABI moved
     to renameat2 by the time of our port. The syscall audit test cases
     don't understand this, so I added a trivial fix. This went through
     mailing list review during the 4.15 merge window, but nobody has
     picked it up so I think it's best to just do this here.

   - The removal of our command-line argument processing code. The
     "mem_end" stuff was broken and the rest duplicated generic device
     tree code. The generic code was already being called.

   - Some unused/redundant code has been removed, including
     __ARCH_HAVE_MMU, current_pgdir, and the initialization of
     init_mm.pgd.

   - SUM is disabled upon taking a trap, which means that user memory is
     protected during traps taking inside copy_{to,from}_user().

   - The sptbr CSR has been renamed to satp in C code. We haven't
     changed the assembly code in order to maintain compatibility with
     binutils 2.29, which doesn't understand the new name.

  Additionally, we're adding some new features:

   - Basic ftrace support, thanks to Alan Kao!

   - Support for ZONE_DMA32.

     This is necessary for all the normal reasons, but also to deal with
     a deficiency in the Xilinx PCIe controller we're using on our
     FPGA-based systems. While the ZONE_DMA32 addition should be
     sufficient for most uses, it doesn't complete the fix for the
     Xilinx controller.

   - TLB shootdowns now only target the harts where they're necessary,
     instead of applying to all harts in the system.

  These patches have all been sitting on our linux-next branch for a
  while now. Due to time constraints this is all I feel comfortable
  submitting during the 4.16 merge window, hopefully we'll do better
  next time!"

[ Note to self: "harts" is RISC-V speak for "hardware threads".  I had
  to look that up.    - Linus ]

modifying Player Animation system

for the Player, there are 4 different Animations for each action, depending on the direction faced. the 2 primary roles of the Animations are:
1. to change Sprite.frame at specific times;
2. to call functions at specific times.
the function call tracks, per "action", are identical - so i'm wondering if it's smart to separate the Sprite.frame animation tracks from the tracks that handle function calls. that way, each action only has 1 function call animation track, instead of 4. so if you wanted to edit the timing of an action's function calls, you'd only need to edit 1 track and not 4 (for each direction).
so, theoretically: when a Sprite Animation is played, it plays its corresponding Function Animation at the same time.
i think this should work, but i've had unpredictable issues with Animations and timing before. however i believe some of these problems have been solved with godot 4 so it seems like testing is the only way.
issues galore. one issue was a bandaid fix i'd applied to the backstep animations to get consecutively queued backsteps to work properly: briefly, i'd set the backstep animations to loop by default. so queueing a backstep simply wouldn't change the player's state; it'd just sustain the loop.
this was very weird functionality. luckily i think i've come up with a way to fix it.
the reason why we needed (at the time) the backstep animation(s) to loop was because we were calling travel("Backstep") on the AnimationStateMachine while already at the "Backstep" AnimationNode - thus, nothing would happen (though not 100% certain of this). to [potentially] fix this problem, on backstep_start(), we check:
	if animationState.get_current_node() != "Backstep":
		animationState.travel("Backstep")
	else:
		animationState.start("Backstep")

this ensures the Backstep animation plays from the start, even if it's already playing.
however this brings up another issue which has to do with the separation of Sprite animation tracks and Function Call animation tracks:
if you play an animation that has an AnimationPlayback track (to control a different AnimationPlayer), then switch the 1st AnimationPlayer's current animation, then the 2nd AnimationPlayer's animation (played from the AnimationPlayback track) doesn't stop... which... makes sense, it's just not what we want, which is why we need to overhaul the system if we want to continue with the separation of Sprite.frame & function call AnimationPlayers.
right now, the issue is techs that've been queued from a backstep which use the Function AnimationPlayer (FunctionPlayer) become broken because the FunctionPlayer's animation doesn't stop when backstep_stop() is called and tech_queued is true. if tech_queued is true when backstep_stop() is called, then the case should be that the backstep animation is INTERRUPTED before it finishes, then switches to the Tech animation. this is not the case because the FunctionPlayer's "Backstep" Animation plays to its end, calling backstep_animation_finished() DURING the TECH state, setting the Player state to MOVE and breaking the tech behaviour.
theoretically, this problem will solve itself once ALL animations have been re-factored/split between the "default" AnimationPlayer and FunctionPlayer. this is due to the fact that Techs and their Animations will also have corresponding FunctionPlayer animations, which simply haven't yet been created. so, in theory, if these animations get created, and the AnimationPlayer's Tech Animations include an AnimationPlayback track to play them, then by queueing a tech from a backstep - when a Tech animation begins - the backstep's Function animation will get switched, as well.
one of the issues i have currently is that i cannot tell if this is a completely fucking bonkers stupid idea or not. theoretically, it makes things more scaleable. but the number of bugs i'm running into already, at this preliminary stage of the implementation, is making me uneasy - and the only way to find out of this system will truly work in a rigid fashion is to re-implement everything in the new system. which i guess i have no choice but to do at this point, so we'll find out shortly if i've wasted a day or not.

Moves speaking verbs to tongues + subtypes, moves wing sprites to wing subtypes, bodypart damage examines to limbs, fixes sign language not working without a tongue (#71635)

## About The Pull Request

### Moves speaking verbs to tongues + subtypes
Moves species say mod onto tongues, creates any tongues that didn't
exist for the say mods they needed to hold.

### moves wing sprites to wing subtypes
Moves the logic of selecting a wing sprite onto subtypes of /functional
on the wing type. Now, angel wings bring the holy trait with them, it
isn't a special check on flight potions, and we can expand it. (EMPs
taking down robowings? Fires burning megamoth wings? Cool stuff)

### bodypart damage examines to limbs
Instead of checking what your species says, it tallies up your limbs and
provides the damage description that matches most of your limbs. So for
example, If you're mostly human with one augmented part, you take
bruises and cuts. If you're mostly robot augmented with one human part,
you get robot damage descriptions. Yay!

### fixes sign language working without a tongue
Having no tongue would garble your speech, and this had no interaction
with sign language, so you'd be speaking in broken gurgling with
perfectly working hands. Now, the sign language component prevents any
kind of garbling, since it brings its own garbling for full/missing arms

## Why It's Good For The Game

Moving things off of species inherent makes the game expose way more
interesting mechanics to play with. It sucks that you can't steal a
jellyperson's chirping, since they can get a normal tongue and they'll
go back to... chirping! LAME! THAT IS LAME!

Ditto goes for wings, and for limbs, well, having someone be entirely
augmented but get descriptions of bleeding because they didn't spawn as
an android is kinda lame.

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Refactored wings, tongues, and some examine messages,
hopefully with minimal effect on actual changes. A few more species have
tongues, angel wings bring the holy trait with them, and wings have new
descriptions. should be the biggest parts of it
