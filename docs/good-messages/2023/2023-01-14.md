I learned the most valuable lesson in Python today. It is with a heavy heart I inform you that I am an idiot. Python lists are mutable. I forgot when trying to make a function. God has forsaken me. As a side not I corrected the extend_hours function with some .copy()'s so the lists would stop storing in weird places and I could process data correctly. I also found an error in the weather reporting from the weather API. I'm going to look into reporting it.I added a loop that pulls the weather data, processes it into the 24hr format, then stores it tables listed by type in SQLite3. I need to add a try except block to catch further weather api errors so it doesn't destroy the db (I should do this anyway). Tomorrow I am going to write that try-except block and then write an algorithm that compares new weather data with data in the db and overwrites data differences with new data. The next step after that is to implement the startup function into QThreadPool in order to coprocess the gui and startup info.

`__beartype_hint__()` x 6.

This commit is the next in a commit chain defining the PEP
544-compliant `beartype.plug.BeartypeHintable` protocol, en-route to
resolving feature request #192 technically submitted by myself but
spiritually submitted by super-nice NIST scientist @tbsexton (Thurston
Sexton) in his unquenchable search for a utopian DSL for typing Python
that may never exist – *but should*. Specifically, this commit adds
support reducing type hints via user-defined `__beartype_hint__()`
dunder methods to our existing reduction machinery. Unfortunately, doing
so induces infinite recursion (...that's bad) in the common case of a
`__beartype_hint__()` implementation returning a type hint of the form
`Annotated[cls, ...]`. Since resolving that would require non-trivial
refactoring of our current breadth-first code generation algorithm into
a depth-first code generation algorithm, we're temporarily stymied in
this commit chain. Fortunately, we will be performing this refactoring
shortly -- because we need to anyway, for various and sundry reasons.
Until then, this commit chain is sadly on hold.
(*Formidable middling form is gormless meddling!*)

Let me tell you about mv best friend. His name is Yuriy. We have known each other for ages. We live in the same town and went to the same school. Now we study at the same university And though we study at different faculties, we see each other almost every day. My best friend is the first to come and support me in any difficult situation. We have a lot in common. We both do sports regularly. That's because we want to be strong and look handsome. We really look very much alike. We have short dark hair, grey eyes and a sport figure. We also have many similar features of character: we are merry, smart and active.

As Yura is an easy going person, he can easily make friends with anyone He likes communicating with new people. Yura likes travelling. We often visit new places, especially in summer. We have already been to the Crimea, Poltava and Lvov. This year we plan to visit the Carpathian Mountains. Yura's hobby is computer games. He can spend hours in the virtual world. As for me, I like the Internet, where I find interesting information and make friends with people all over the world. But my best friend lives in Ukraine. I am glad I have such a friend as Yura.

Run minicomp shader + present every frame

This is still pretty sketchy/hacky. In the long term I think I'd like
minicomp_state to be an instance of a proper class that can somehow set
up its Vulkan parts properly based on abstract input (perhaps the
mythical Game).

If Vulkan::minicomp_recreate_swch() actually gets called, horrible
things occur in my environment. From the log output it appears that
everything works properly, but the image in the window stops updating,
and the application stops responding to outside events (except very
slowly, sometimes). If I run it from within GDB and kill it from there,
it seems to be stuck hanging on the shader/copy Device::submit() fence,
at least most of the time. Sometimes I've been able to get it to close
while piping log output into less by sending the window close event to
SDL, then changing focus to the less terminal and scrolling to the
bottom to fetch the latest from the buffer. When this has worked, I'll
see that the last frame took several seconds (like 3). I imagine this is
all the result of some mistake I'm making, although I've been trying all
sorts of possible solutions for hours to no avail.

As long as I don't allow the window to be resized, though, the swapchain
never seems to require recreation, so I'm deciding to postpone
implementing dynamic changes in resolution for the time being. My hope
is that when I need to return to it, either:

    a. I'll be experienced enough with Vulkan to trivially spot my
       hypothetical mistake,
    b. I'll have improved the diagnostic features to make it easy to
       diagnose that way,
    c. it's actually due to a driver bug or something and will have been
       fixed long ago, or
    d. the engine will have changed around it in a way that makes the
       problem magically disappear or become irrelevant.

Fingers crossed.

Spanish translation overhaul + Addition of es-ES alternative

In its current state, the Spanish translations for Duckstation are a mess of different dialects, multiple translations for the same terms, mistranslations or excessively literal translations, and typos.

It's a shame, because you could feel that the initial translations were done with care, but were muddled with future revisions.

This commit tries to solve all of these and also change the initial decision of the first translator to have an "universal" "neutral" Spanish, as time has proven it's not possible without a dedicated translator who actually wants to have one Spanish language for all Spanish-speakers across the globe.

I'm not going to be that one, so the next option would be to duplicate the Spanish translations into two: one for the Spanish-speaking American people (called "Latin American Spanish", "español de Hispanoamérica", code es-419") and one for the European Spanish speakers (called "Spanish (Spain)", "español de España", code es-ES).

This distinction is used in multiple software applications that managed to have translators for different languages, and should also funnel any future Latin American Spanish and European Spanish translators to the corresponding file.

I have tried to follow as many existing terms and constructions as possible, restoring and/or rewording any phrasal constructions that were disunified by the multiple translators.

Since I have a limited experience with Latin American Spanish, this commit should be sent as a draft for additional revisions. I'm open to stick to having a single Spanish language, but it has to be done RIGHT.

This is an overview of changes across the board:
 - Added missing translations for QT and Android builds.
 - Unified translations between those.
 - Updated the QT file with the latest string values.
 - Massive removal of Title Uppercasing inherited from English in menu strings (the rules set by the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, or RAE, limit the areas where Title Uppercasing is considered correct in Spanish. Menu names and window header texts are not within those areas).
 - Unified the treatment of users in the Latin American version to formal "ustedeo". This treatment could be modified with additional input.
 - Removed any gendering assumptions from any string directed towards the user (Are you sure...?, changed ¿Está/s seguro...? with ¿Seguro que...?)
 - Naturalization rewrites.
 - Typo corrections.
 - Gender corrections over definitive terms.
 - Adding missing NBSPs after required mathemathical characters or units.
 - Mass replacement of double/single quotes with angled quotes (the ones approved for Spanish).
 - Quoted non-Spanish, non-proper noun English words as dictated by RAE.
 - Removal of unwanted hyphens to join words (Auto-detectar with Detección automática, post-procesamiento with posprocesamiento). In Spanish, hyphens tend to separate, rather than join.
 - Revision of the compound forms, unified depending on Latin American Spanish or European Spanish.
 - Lowercased the first word of a text between parenthesis (Spanish rules dictate that they should be considered a continuation of the phrase, and thus, they should start with lowercase unless it's a proper noun or a word that must be uppercased) and corrected the positions between periods and parentheses.
 - Unified the accentuation rules for the adverb solo/sólo and the demostrative pronouns (este/ese/aquel) by removing all accents in European Spanish (following the RAE's 2010 suggestions) or keeping/adding them for Latin American Spanish (the 2010 rule ended up being a suggestion because while Spain has mostly deprecated those accents, it appears that the Latin American countries have not). To discuss?
 - Tweaked the key shortcuts for the QT menu to minimize duplicates.
 - Terms unified (this list doesn't represent the entirety of the changes):
    - Failed to (Fallo al/Error al): Fallo al
    - Hardcore Mode (Modo Hardcore/Modo Difícil): «hardcore» mode (Foreign non-proper nouns should be quoted, RetroAchievements does not have an official Spanish translation, so the term should be kept in English)
    - Enable/Disable (habilitado/deshabilitado/activado/desactivado/activo/inactivo): habilitado/deshabilitado
    - host (host/anfitrión/sistema): sistema, TO BE DETERMINED AND UNIFIED
    - Signed (numbers; firmados): (números) con signo
    - scan (verb and noun; escanear): buscar/búsqueda
    - Clear (something, like bindings or codes; despejar, limpiar): borrar/quitar
    - requirement (of a system, requisito/requerimento): requisito
    - input (of a controller, control): entrada
    - Threaded X (hilo de X): X multihilo
    - Frame Pacing (frame pacing): duración de fotogramas
    - XX-bit (XX-bit): XX bits (proper form)
    - Widescreen (screens, widescreen hacks; pantalla ancha, pantalla panorámica): pantalla panorámica
    - Antialiasing (anti-aliasing): Antialiasing (considered a proper noun by NVidia, doesn't need that hyphen)
    - hash: «hash» (could be discussed as "sumas de verificación", like on Dolphin)
    - Focus Loss (perder el foco): ir/entrar en segundo plano
    - toggle (verb for hotkeys, activar): alternar (as the key alternates between enabling and disabling the function, while "activate" might sound like it's just the enable part)
    - Rewind (function; retrocediendo, retrocedimiento): rebobinado (to discuss on LATAM Spanish)
    - shader (shader/sombreado): sombreador
    - resume (resumir): reanudar, continuar (resumir is a false friend)
    - Check (verb; chequear/revisar/comprobar): chequear (LATAM Spanish), comprobar (European Spanish)
    - Add (something; añadir/agregar): agregar (LATAM Spanish, to discuss) or añadir (European Spanish)
    - Enter/Input (ingrese, inserte): ingresar (LATAM Spanish) or introducir (European Spanish)
    - mouse (device; mouse/ratón): mouse (LATAM Spanish), ratón (European Spanish)
    - Auto-Detect (Auto-detectar): Detección automática
    - Controller (control): mando (for European Spanish only)
    - run (a game, the emulator; correr): ejecutar, funcionar (for European Spanish only)

[MIRROR] Chaplain armor beacon now uses radial + previews possible armor sets, plus some choice beacon code cleanup. [MDB IGNORE] (#18019)

* Chaplain armor beacon now uses radial + previews possible armor sets, plus some choice beacon code cleanup. (#71674)

## About The Pull Request

- The chaplain choice beacon now uses a radial to select the armor set,
instead of a list, giving the user a preview of what each looks like.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51863163/205417930-f5ceab11-6974-48a9-a871-abcb8228bcf2.png)

- Lots of additional cleanup to choice beacon code in general. Less copy
pasted code.
- All beacons now speak from the beacon with their message, instead of
some going by "headset message". Soul removed

## Why It's Good For The Game

I always forgot when selecting my armor which looks like what, and
choosing an ugly one is a pain since you only get one choice. This
should help chaplains get the armor they actually want without needing
to check the wiki.

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
qol: The chaplain's armament beacon now displays a radial instead of a
text list, showing previews of what all the armor sets look like
qol: (Almost) all choice beacons now use a pod to send their item,
instead of just magicking it under your feet
code: Cleaned up some choice beacon code.

Please DO NOT announce to the server when you are going to masturbate. This has been a reoccurring issue, and I’m not sure why some people have such under developed social skills that they think that a server full of mostly male strangers would need to know that. No one is going to be impressed and give you a high five (especially considering where that hand has been). I don’t want to add this to the rules, since it would be embarrassing for new users to see that we have a problem with this, but it is going to be enforced as a rule from now on.  If it occurs, you will be warned, then additional occurrences will be dealt with at the discretion of modstaff. Thanks.

Allows Chaplain's Spirit Sword To Redo Name If Invalid (#72642)

## About The Pull Request

The current behavior doesn't let the sword re-choose their name if they
screw it up the first time and it turns out to be filtered or sanitized
out for whatever reason. That's silly in my opinion, so I changed it to
be more like holoparasite name-selection behavior, where you get the
text to choose your name until you get it right.

I moved the re-naming portion of the sword to be after all of the
important RegisterSignal steps as well, just to be safe as we sleep as
they plug in different names they might want.
## Why It's Good For The Game

You shouldn't be stuck as "spirit of the blade" permanently if you
accidentally balls up the word filter, let's have it be more like
holoparasite behavior to be nicer.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: Spirits of possessed blades (Chaplain's Null Rod Option) will be
able re-try selecting their name if it ends up to be filtered for any
reason.

[GUI] Add text size & line height calculation

These APIs are quite ugly, but they're a nice start. The problem is that
we'd like to have multithreading in order to have a smooth user
experience.

To achieve this, we need to have Send'able Painter / TextCalculator, but
the mltg library in combination with windows-rs and DirectX doesn't
allow this currently. Because of this, we need quite a few hacks,
including having a separate Direct2D context on the background thread.

Update - German translation

After my earlier commit this day I tried to move on to (Monster-)Traits.
Found out there is no German version of the Monster Codex, GM Guide and MoD, tried to predict the probability of one releasing in the near future. Company is now an unsuccessful 1-man-show (who owes me money or wares btw) and the original translator moved from creative (theatre-)writing to a lucrative non-Fantasy-related job.
Had a mental breakdown over this - fixed that with B&J Cookie Dough Ice Cream that ironically/fatefully was on Sale at the company the original translator now works for.
After a brief chat with Bithir to make sure that there is no fan-translation available I decided to just do it myself.

Also fixed the following mistake from my commit earlier this day in Line 693 ("Fähigkeit" instead of "Merkmal")

Bithir changed the Witchsight Ability while I had dinner, so I added {targetshadow} as per their request:
Line 111:   "ABILITY_WITCHSIGHT.CHAT_FINAL": " Die Farbe des Schattens von {targetname} ist: {targetshadow}",

Torfu gave advice to stick to official wording as planned. Translating the rest (mainly Monster Traits) is the result of my madness. To this day I don't know what "Serenity" is (line 495   "POWER_LABEL.SERENITY":"Serenity",)

This should make the translation of the symbaroum to German as complete as possible.

Improves the grammar, functionality, and code quality of set declarations (#776)

* Makes Consume array overload return the tokentype it found

Plus adds some extra comments, in my crusade to comment more things.

EDIT: hate you Github Desktop

* Removes MultipleVarDec..., replaces with Aggregate generic

Removes DMASTProcStatementMultipleVarDeclarations,
replaces with DMASTAggregate<>.

DMASTAggregate now has the generic-ified responsibility of being a statement which is actually an aggregate of several statements, all of the same type.

The point of this is so that this aggregation behaviour can also be used for set declaration blocks (and maybe other stuff if we find other uses, I dunno)

* Adds some helpful ctors for DMASTProcBlockInner

There's a lot of repetitive empty or near-empty array inits at the caller side of some of these constructions, so I went ahead and moved those into the ctor. Also allows for a minor optimization (preferring using Array.Empty<> instead of constructing empty arrays).

* Improves SetStatement grammar, function & quality

(If any of you demand I insert the oxford comma into the commit header I am leaving 5ever :rage: )

This commit does several things in one fell swoop:
- Set statements now accept blocking, commas, bracing, all the good stuff that var declarations do
- Blocks now very consistently evaluate their SetStatements first and foremost, before anything else, in a way that makes sense
- Use of the 'in' keyword is now properly prohibited for all set use cases except 'src'
- 'src' now properly gives an unimplemented warning

Also in this commit is a bunch of random autodoc added to things that I looked at or touched over the course of writing this commit. :innocent:

* Implements cursed parity behaviour for non-const set statements

AFAIK, in BYOND, the previous set statement value is used to prop-up one that has a non-constant right-hand side. So I guess we have that behaviour available, now. :sweat_smile:

EDIT: Fixed behaviour in the didError case, minor formatting fixes

* Style fix, replaces several "\n{" with "{\n"

Most of these were my fault. Not all of them though. :^)

* Does the Wixoa reviews, adds EmptyBlock pragma error

As a byproduct of doing the reviews, I have accidentally added empty block detection for several (although perhaps not most) loops and blocks available in OD.

* Brace style fixes

* Does more Wixoa reviews, generalizes EmptyBlock emission

Note that we do not, as of yet, emit this warning for empty procs. This is because:
1. our own DMStandard has several empty procs (usually because they are unimplemented or useless, like the BYOND Hub interface procs)
2. Users may sometimes define an empty proc, intentionally, to act as an abstract virtual that child types can define in their own way.

We can revisit the problem later, I'm just trying to get my PR greenlit.

* Adds test for EmptyBlock pragma emission
