have to see if there are functions that i commented out while testing things.

then, of course, elephant in the room is the actual testing.
	-BUT i realised since the CMedia devices return the position for us, we don't do any arithmetic in getCurrentSampleFrame
		-all we need to do is ensure our driver slides along the buffer at the same rate (as defined through the format{extension,description} parameters).

i also added the same formats for the multich stream in 2 channel steps because really we have the choice of 2, 4, 6, or 8. clemens has it set up
	-hoping we don't need to write a userspace program for the mixers but that may be what has to happen. not sure yet
		-someone else can do that. i think i'm near the point of, HOPEFULLY, proving a point.

i'm surprised i'm able to post this commit message after loading/unloading three times. it's been like 15 plus minutes. then again i didn't trigger the handler yet (as the logs show) :P

still. watch me fail to finish this cause of my rap. whatever.

qcacld-3.0: Defer HDD initialization.

 * ALso rely on userspace writing to /dev/wlan, Wi-Fi
   HAL writes "ON" or "OFF" to /dev/wlan.

 * Use this method to initialize hdd as it's a safer
   way to ensure both wlan_mac.bin and WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini
   are ready to be read.

 * This also eliminates the needs for horrible hacks
   to read the userspace file.

FFmpeg BT.709

YES! YES, YES, YES, YES, YES!!! This has been haunting me the past few days, since I was last working on making art tracks for my music. When creating a video from a PNG image, the colors haven't looked the best from the conversion, and I have been scouring the web to find out how to fix it. Setting the scale out color matrix property in the `-vf` flag totally fixes it! It still doesn't look color-for-color to the original PNG, but that's expected. Now the output video looks identical in color to a simiarly-exported iMovie project from the same files, but it's now also 10x smaller, thanks to extra optimizations you can tell FFmpeg to make. So, now a video file being around 77 MB is now only 7.7 MB, and it looks the exact same! This isn't a new thing since I've started looking into FFmpeg, but it's different now, because both videos have the same quality now, and you get the smaller size benefits.

I need to make a StackOverflow account just to thank whoever commented this, thank you so much!!! You saved me so many headaches.

```
You need to convert to BT.709 matrix using -vf scale=out_color_matrix=bt709 not just tag output using -colorspace bt709.
```

Fix eta reduction

To allow eta-reduction I have to add eta-expansion to the frontend
typechecker. These expansions alter the tree in three locations.

 * synthE `-->E`
 * synthE `-->I==>`
 * checkE (LamS [] _) (FunU (t:_)

At least all eta reduction is in the frontend and occurs immediately
after the required type information on the called functions is
extracted. It is logical, I guess. But I am still not happy. Modifying
the tree at this stage leads to nodes with undefined indices, which I
default to (-1). This is sloppy. I should probably generate free
indices.

I remember back to the great deep/wide quagmire of 2021. At the time,
for reasons that I did not find at all satisfactory, I settled on a wide
style. Under this style I implemented the functions type, for example,
as `Fun [Type] Type` with a list of recursive types for inputs. The deep
alternative would have been the traditional FL definition of `Fun Type
Type`. The wide style made for easier parsing and generating, but less
elegant reasoning and typechecking.

Now with eta reduction, I am encountering another difficulty with the
wide style. It is ambiguous. It allows a functions to be written as `a
-> a -> a` or `a -> (a -> a)`. Lambdas expressions also suffer from the
possibility of nested expressions.

```
Fun ts (Fun ts' t)  ===  Fun (ts <> ts') t
Lam vs (Lam vs' x)  ===  Lam (vs <> vs') x
```

I don't think the deep style would entirely remove the eta complexities,
but it would certainly simplify the reasoning process. And it would
remove the ridiculous need for "normalizeTypes" calls.

The codebase is teetering under its weight. There are so many dark
corners with poorly designed syntax. Not to mention so many cases that I
have barely scratched, like `const` keywords in C++ and
pass-by-reference versus pass-by-value.

But I will make it work. I'll find a way.

cocci: make "coccicheck" rule incremental

Optimize the very slow "coccicheck" target to take advantage of
incremental rebuilding, and fix outstanding dependency problems with
the existing rule.

The rule is now faster both on the initial run as we can make better
use of GNU make's parallelism than the old ad-hoc combination of
make's parallelism combined with $(SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE) and/or the
"--jobs" argument to "spatch(1)".

It also makes us *much* faster when incrementally building, it's now
viable to "make coccicheck" as topic branches are merged down.

The rule didn't use FORCE (or its equivalents) before, so a:

	make coccicheck
	make coccicheck

Would report nothing to do on the second iteration. But all of our
patch output depended on all $(COCCI_SOURCES) files, therefore e.g.:

    make -W grep.c coccicheck

Would do a full re-run, i.e. a a change in a single file would force
us to do a full re-run.

The reason for this (not the initial rationale, but my analysis) is:

* Since we create a single "*.cocci.patch+" we don't know where to
  pick up where we left off, or how to incrementally merge e.g. a
  "grep.c" change with an existing *.cocci.patch.

* We've been carrying forward the dependency on the *.c files since
  63f0a758a06 (add coccicheck make target, 2016-09-15) the rule was
  initially added as a sort of poor man's dependency discovery.

  As we don't include other *.c files depending on other *.c files
  has always been broken, as could be trivially demonstrated
  e.g. with:

       make coccicheck
       make -W strbuf.h coccicheck

  However, depending on the corresponding *.c files has been doing
  something, namely that *if* an API change modified both *.c and *.h
  files we'd catch the change to the *.h we care about via the *.c
  being changed.

  For API changes that happened only via *.h files we'd do the wrong
  thing before this change, but e.g. for function additions (not
  "static inline" ones) catch the *.h change by proxy.

Now we'll instead:

 * Create a <RULE>/<FILE> pair in the .build directory, E.g. for
   swap.cocci and grep.c we'll create
   .build/contrib/coccinelle/swap.cocci.patch/grep.c.

   That file is the diff we'll apply for that <RULE>-<FILE>
   combination, if there's no changes to me made (the common case)
   it'll be an empty file.

 * Our generated *.patch
   file (e.g. contrib/coccinelle/swap.cocci.patch) is now a simple "cat
   $^" of all of all of the <RULE>/<FILE> files for a given <RULE>.

   In the case discussed above of "grep.c" being changed we'll do the
   full "cat" every time, so they resulting *.cocci.patch will always
   be correct and up-to-date, even if it's "incrementally updated".

   See 1cc0425a27c (Makefile: have "make pot" not "reset --hard",
   2022-05-26) for another recent rule that used that technique.

As before we'll:

 * End up generating a contrib/coccinelle/swap.cocci.patch, if we
   "fail" by creating a non-empty patch we'll still exit with a zero
   exit code.

   Arguably we should move to a more Makefile-native way of doing
   this, i.e. fail early, and if we want all of the "failed" changes
   we can use "make -k", but as the current
   "ci/run-static-analysis.sh" expects us to behave this way let's
   keep the existing behavior of exhaustively discovering all cocci
   changes, and only failing if spatch itself errors out.

Further implementation details & notes:

 * Before this change running "make coccicheck" would by default end
   up pegging just one CPU at the very end for a while, usually as
   we'd finish whichever *.cocci rule was the most expensive.

   This could be mitigated by combining "make -jN" with
   SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE, see 960154b9c17 (coccicheck: optionally batch
   spatch invocations, 2019-05-06).

   There will be cases where getting rid of "SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE" makes
   things worse, but a from-scratch "make coccicheck" with the default
   of SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE=1 (and tweaking it doesn't make a difference)
   is faster (~3m36s v.s. ~3m56s) with this approach, as we can feed
   the CPU more work in a less staggered way.

 * Getting rid of "SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE" particularly helps in cases
   where the default of 1 yields parallelism under "make coccicheck",
   but then running e.g.:

       make -W contrib/coccinelle/swap.cocci coccicheck

   I.e. before that would use only one CPU core, until the user
   remembered to adjust "SPATCH_BATCH_SIZE" differently than the
   setting that makes sense when doing a non-incremental run of "make
   coccicheck".

 * Before the "make coccicheck" rule would have to clean
   "contrib/coccinelle/*.cocci.patch*", since we'd create "*+" and
   "*.log" files there. Now those are created in
   .build/contrib/coccinelle/, which is covered by the "cocciclean" rule
   already.

Outstanding issues & future work:

 * We could get rid of "--all-includes" in favor of manually
   specifying a list of includes to give to "spatch(1)".

   As noted upthread of [1] a naïve removal of "--all-includes" will
   result in broken *.cocci patches, but if we know the exhaustive
   list of includes via COMPUTE_HEADER_DEPENDENCIES we don't need to
   re-scan for them, we could grab the headers to include from the
   .depend.d/<file>.o.d and supply them with the "--include" option to
   spatch(1).q

Add error handling strawman

There is so far no standard way in Scala to address a class of situations
that's often called "error handling". In these situations we have two possible
outcomes representing success and failure. We would like to process successful
results further and propagate failures outward. The aim is to find a "happy path" where
we deal with success computations directly, without having to special-treat failing
results at every step.

There are many different ways in use in Scala to express these situations.

 - Express success with normal results and failure with exceptions.
 - Use `Option`, where success is wrapped in `Some` and failure is `None`.
 - Use `Either`, where success is wrapped in `Right` and failure is wrapped in `Left`.
 - Use `Try`, where success is wrapped in `Success` and failure (which must be an exception) is wrapped in `Failure`.
 - Use nulls, where success is a non-null value and failure is `null`.
 - Use a special `IO` monad like `ZIO`, where errors are built in.

Exceptions propagate silently until they are handled in a `catch`. All other failure
modes require either ad-hoc code or monadic lifting into for comprehensions to propagate.
`nulls` can only be treated with ad-hoc code and they are not very popular in Scala so far.

Exceptions should only be used if the failure case is very unlikely (rule of thumb: in less than 0.1% of cases).
Even then they are often shunned since they are clunky to use and they currently undermine type safety (the latter
point would be addressed by the experimental `saferExceptions` extension). That said, exceptions have their uses.
For instance, it's better to abort code that fails in a locally unrecoverable way with an exception instead of
aborting the whole program with a panic or `System.exit`.

If we admit that not all error handling scenarios should be handled with exceptions, what
else should we use? So far the only choices are ad-hoc code or monadic lifting. Both of these
techniques suffer from the fact that a failure is propagated out of only a single construct
and that major and pointless acrobatics are required to move out failures further.

This commit sketches a systematic and uniform solution to this problem. It essentially provides a way
to establish "prompts" for result types and a way to return to a prompt with an error value using
a method called `_.?`. This is somewhat similar to Rust's `?` postfix operator, which seems
to work well. But there are is an important difference: Rust's ? returns from the next-enclosing
function or closure whereas our `?` method returns to an enclosing prompt, which can be further outside.
This greatly improves the expressiveness of `?`, at the price of a more complex execution semantics.

For instance, here is an implementation of a "traverse"-like operation, converting a `List[Option[T]]`
into a `Option[List[T]]`.
```scala
def traverse[T](xs: List[Option[T]]): Option[List[T]] =
  optional:
    xs.map(_.?)
```
Here, `optional` is the prompt for the `Option` type, and `.?` maps `Option[T]` to the underlying
type `T`, jumping to the enclosing `optional` prompt in the case a `None` is encountered. You can
think of it as a safe version of `Option`'s `get`. This function could not be written like this
in Rust since `_.?` is a closure so a `None` element would simply be mapped to itself.

Also unlike for Rust, Scala's technique is library-based. Similar prompt/return pairs can be defined
for many other types. This commit also defines a type `Result` which is similar to Rust's that
supports the pattern. `Result` will hopefully replace `Either`, which is in my opinion an abomination
for error handling. All these constructs can be defined in terms of a lower-level construct
where one can simply return a result to an enclosing boundary, without any distinction between
success and failure. The low-level construct is composed of a `boundary` prompt and a `break`
method that returns to it. It can also be used as a convenient replacement for non-local returns.

On the JVM, the break operation is in general implemented by throwing a special `Break` exception,
similar to how non-local returns were handled before. However, it is foreseen to implement an
optimization pass that replaces `Break` exceptions by gotos if they are caught in the same scope without
intervening functions. Dotty already has a `LabeledBlock` tree node that can be used
for this purpose. This means that local return to prompts are about as fast as in Rust whereas
non-local returns in Scala are a bit slower than local returns, whereas in Rust they are impossible.
We plan to do benchmarks to quantify the cost more precisely.

azure: instrument the solution with application insights telemetry

this is the first obvious step moving into azure and the behavior of the telemetry sent is a bit of a deal-breaker in some keys ways

azure application insights is MOSTLY FOR telemetry and not logs so this needs to be said before explaining its nuances

first, one instance is used for all the microservices with a key field being "cloud_RoleInstance" used for each application source.
a better practice would be to create an instance for each application which in a microservices architecture is a nightmare

this behavior is the first nuance

on localhost and in docker-compose, its value is the name of the machine it's running on "Shaylen" in my case but in kubernetes, it's the pod.
for a pod, it has the deployment name followed by the pod-template-hash then the unique id of the pod which is more accurate

this is the value you'd get from running 'kubectl get pods -n seelanstyres' then check the logs 'kubectl logs pod-instance -n seelanstyres'

a second nuance is a field called application_Version

on localhost, it shows the file version which seems to come directly from the assembly info but this is not that useful to me
as the informational version has the first seven characters of the git commit in it which i can use to go to github
and search for the commit id and check the code. any enrichment i added to serilog is non-existent which is a bummer

in docker-compose and kubernetes, this value is "7.0.0", which is totally off and not useful at all and may be the version of the dotnet runtime

with these nuances, looking at the end-to-end transactions [related to distributed tracing] isn't so useful as it shows the exception, fair enough but the version info
is missing so its only use for me is the drill down and get the timestamp which i can use to investigate the logs and get the commit url and check the code

---

moving forward

in a commit that seems like years ago now, "prep for centralized logging with serilog and elasticsearch", i said something about application insights and quote

    "... in the exam, for example, distributed tracing was tested using the application map of application insights and ofcourse,
    the projects have to be instrumented with application insights. i didn't do that here, not too sure how possible that is
    when the solution is in azure kubernetes services but i'll figure that out when i get there ..."

before i had any deep knowledge about kubernetes and how it works, this is what i was thinking at the time

"if a service isn't EXPOSED TO THE INTERNET, how exactly is it going to send telemetry to application insights OVER THE INTERNET ???"

i still cannot confirm this because of my cluster which i have to troubleshoot now 😐

---

the next thing i've done is publish the health check status to app insights using the "AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Publisher.ApplicationInsights" nuget package

figuring out how it works was a bit irritating because the readme on the repo doesn't tell you how it works, you have to right-click and go to the definition
in the code that adds the functionality for a full explanation and here it is:

    "For each Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthReport published
    a new event AspNetCoreHealthCheck is sent to Application Insights with two metrics
    AspNetCoreHealthCheckStatus and AspNetCoreHealthCheckDuration indicating the
    health check status ( 1 Healthy 0 Unhealthy) and the total time the health check
    took to execute on milliseconds"

using this, i checked the logs and it falls under the "customEvents" table and this is the kusto query i created that'll be used to create an alert rule
to eventually trigger the "SystemDegradedToggler" azure function app and turn on the system-degraded state as well as notify me:

customEvents
| where name == "AspNetCoreHealthCheck"
| where customMeasurements.["AspNetCoreHealthCheckStatus"] == 0
| project
    timestamp,
    ApplicationName=customDimensions.["Assembly"],
    ApplicationVersion=application_Version,
    HealthCheckStatus=customMeasurements.["AspNetCoreHealthCheckStatus"],
    HealthCheckDuration=customMeasurements.["AspNetCoreHealthCheckDuration"]

to break it down

most projected fields are renamed with a syntax of "NewName=OriginalName"

with the implementation of application insights, this implements and/or references quite a few exam objectives from all my exams. the az-104, az-204 and az-400.
even though this is true, i will only show the az-400 objectives because its similar to the az-104 and az-204

Develop an instrumentation strategy (5-10%)
    Design and implement logging
        - interrogate Log Analytics logs using basic Kusto (KQL) queries

    Design and implement telemetry
        - design and implement distributed tracing
        - inspect application performance indicators
        - inspect infrastructure performance indicators
        - define and measure key metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)

Develop a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) strategy (5-10%)
    Develop an actionable alerting strategy
        - implement alerts based on application health checks
        - develop communication mechanism to notify users of degraded systems

---

with the move to azure, i've also added the resources that i've used to study for azure.
technically, up until this point i've never even looked at them for this project so i never mentioned it.
even to implement the az-400 objectives, it's been my own skill and understanding of the objectives that i used.
so now that azure comes into play, the resources i used to learn azure also come into play

This can be exploited to put hollowpoint rounds in the S&W, which
combined with its damage multiplier will deal a truly ridiculous amount
of damage, 2-shooting runners in close range.

I strongly believe the multiplier is not the problem - it's the damage.
And the hollowpoint ammo's damage is doubled by the multiplier, while
its intended 'weaker against armor' downside isn't multiplied.

> Reduced the amount of time the Smith & Wesson's trick buff lasts.

It was 8 seconds, i have no idea how I put that value in, maybe it was
for testing purposes and i forgot to remove it. Having it be so long
kind of negates the gimmick of doing a trick and then firing the gun
since it stays active for so long.

> The CMB Spearhead revolver can no longer fire in bursts nor fit the
burst-fire assembly.

I kept this in because I thought it fit the lore - turns out it doesn't!
It's stupid and makes no sense in any way so goodbye legacy poopcode.

These buffs should keep these revolvers' strong utility but ensure no
cheesy overcomplicated strats can be used to instantly satanize Xenos
with. (Or your own teammate..)

> Adds attacking animations to all Xeno abilities that lacked them.

This is useful visual feedback that an attack happened, and it sucks
that it didn't exist until now. It also looks great and really makes you
feel like Batman.

> Made said abilities cause the xeno to face the target.

Probably shouldn't kill people facing backwards from them!

> Said abilities also cause an attack flicker overlay.

These will not easily be confused with normal slashing, as they have
either punching or disarming as their attack flicker.

> Dancer Impale now plays a stronger hit sound and hit animation.

Impale absolutely devastates targets, and changing the effects to fit
will make it that much more satisfying to pull a combo off.

> Base crushers lower their crest while charging.

This looks neat and is cool visual feedback for a crusher charging if
you're not in position to see their tiny windup.

#### Wednesday 2023-01-04 14:52:07 by RichoM

Fixed VM bug when returning from a script call.

The problem was that now that the compiler doesn't emit the "pop" instructions when calling scripts as statements we can have a script whose last instruction is a script call. This shouldn't be an issue except for the fact that when executing the SCRIPT_CALL instruction we're pushing the current pc to the stack so that the VM knows where to return. This pc points to the next instruction to be executed, which may be outside the limits of the calling script, as that's perfectly legal: the VM will then handle the situation as if a return was called (depending on the type of script). The problem is that the VM needs to know to which script to return in order to decide how to proceed, but the way we were finding the script was by using the return pc. If the call was done as the last instruction of the script then the pc will likely point to the next script in the program or to a non existing script. In both cases it's a disaster for the VM because the actual script is impossible to find and thus we can't properly execute the return.
A potential solution to this problem would be to detect these cases in the compiler and emit a NOP operation after the call to simply avoid this situation altogether. I don't like this because it needlessly increases the size of the programs. I also don't like having to introduce a new instruction that does nothing just for this. Maybe I would be able to use the existing PRIM_RET instead of a new NOP instruction. However, I still don't like to increase the size of user programs.
So the solution I decided to implement was to change the meaning of the pc we push to the stack when calling a script. Instead of the next instruction now we push the pc of the currently executing instruction, the SCRIPT_CALL, which we know for sure is in the correct script and thus will allow us to set the currentScript property correctly on return. To do this I simply decrement the pc before pushing it into the stack. And I changed the VM::unwindStackAndReturn(void) function to set the currentScript using the pc from the stack and then increment it before returning.
There is 1 exception, though, if the framePointer is -1 (which means that we're starting the execution of the task) we don't decrement the pc. It's a special case and I don't really like it but it kind of makes sense because if we decrement it anyways we would have the same problem we're trying to solve: the pc would be off by 1 and it will point outside of the script but in the opposite direction.
So anyways, I decided to live with this hack for the time being. It seems to work fine. I don't exactly remember why I need to initialize the stack with -1 for the framePointer when we're starting the execution but I don't have enough brainpower to find out right now, and also I don't want to risk subtle bugs so for now we'll keep that as is.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Adds the Cursed quirk  (#3941)

* Adds the Cursed quirk  (#72317)

## About The Pull Request
Adds a silly negative quirk inspired by fallout's bloody mess.

Bad luck interactions for
- Microwaving
- Cigarette coupons
- Russian roulette
- Vending machines
- Ledges
- Slipping

All of which have a chance to kill you, which, by the way, causes you to
**delimb and explode**.

This changes the admin smite as well since it's all the omen component.
Giving permanent omens will mean the player will gib on death, which is
super probable given the insane base damage from bonking your head.
Permanent omen smites are basically dooming someone to die of natural
causes.

This is my first 'wheels-off' project to, once finished, be a surprise for an incredibly kind dog trainer who gave me the tools, time, and guidance to keep and transform an incredibly challenging dog and help her experience the world and our relationship in far more functional and calm (and continually improving <3) ways.

This initial upload is of just the main index homepage and corresponding CSS file. I am having difficulty figuring out how to create a nice dropdown menu in the navigation bar and haven't, yet, determined how to get the 'dropdown triangle' next to the navbar link with the dropdown portion displaying the same formatting.

Merge #92713 #92783 #92859

92713: sql: fix left semi and left anti virtual lookup joins r=yuzefovich a=yuzefovich

This commit fixes the execution of the left semi and left anti virtual
lookup joins. The bug was that we forgot to project away the looked up
columns (coming from the "right" side) which could then lead to wrong
columns being used higher up the tree. The bug was introduced during
22.1 release cycle where we added the optimizer support for generating
plans that could contain left semi and left anti virtual lookup joins.
This commit fixes that issue as well as the output columns of such joins
(I'm not sure whether there is a user facing impact of having incorrect
"output columns").

Additionally, this commit fixes the execution of these virtual lookup
joins to correctly return the input row only once. Previously, for left
anti joins we'd be producing an output row if there was a match (which
is wrong), and for both left semi and left anti we would emit an output
row every time there was a match (but this should be done only once).
(Although I'm not sure whether it is possible for virtual indexes to
result in multiple looked up rows.)

Also, as a minor simplification this commit makes it so that the output
rows are not added into the row container for left semi and left anti
and the container is not instantiated at all.

Fixes: #91012.
Fixes: #88096.

Release note (bug fix): CockroachDB previously could incorrectly
evaluate queries that performed left semi and left anti "virtual lookup"
joins on tables in `pg_catalog` or `information_schema`. These join types
can be planned when a subquery is used inside of a filter condition. The
bug was introduced in 22.1.0 and is now fixed.

92783: nogo: detect deprecated go standard library packages r=rickystewart a=healthy-pod

92859: rowcontainer: address an old TODO r=yuzefovich a=yuzefovich

This commit addresses an old TODO about figuring out why we cannot reuse the same buffer in `diskRowIterator.Row` method. The contract of that method was previously confusing - it says that the call to `Row` invalidates the row returned on the previous call; however, the important piece was missing - that the datums themselves cannot be mutated (this is what we assume elsewhere and perform only the "shallow" copies). This commit clarifies the contract of the method and explicitly explains why we need to allocate fresh byte slices (which is done via `ByteAllocator` to reduce the number of allocations).

Additional context can be found in #43145 which added this copy in the first place. Here is a relevant quote from Alfonso:
```
I think what's going on here is that this type of contract (you may only
reuse the row until the next call) is a bit unclear. `CopyRow`s of
`EncDatum`s are only implemented as shallow copies, so the reference to
this reuse only applies to the `EncDatumRow`, but not to the `encoded`
field, which is what is rewritten in this case. The `encoded` field will
not be copied, so I think the tests are probably failing due to that.
This is unfortunate and there doesn't seem to be a good reason for it.
To implement deep copies, we will have to implement deep copies for
`Datum`s as well.
```
I think we were under the impression that we'd implement the "deep copy" in `CopyRow`, but I highly doubt we'll do so given that we're mostly investing in the columnar infrastructure nowadays, and the current way of performing shallow copying has worked well long enough.

Epic: None

Release note: None

Nukies Update 6: Interdyne is here for you! Medical Supplies and Atropine! (#71067)

## About The Pull Request

Quite a few changes overall to the nuclear operatives tactical medkit.
The kit is more of a full suite of equipment for performing field
medical duties as a nukie.

- I've split the medkits between two kinds. Basic and premium. Medical
bundle has the premium kit.
- Basic contains additional amounts of basic c2 chem patches, some spare
atropine autoinjectors, sutures and regen mesh, and some basic medical
equipment for tending wounds. 4 TC (as it was before). That's it.
- The premium kit is a far more useful full suite of advanced medical
equipment, MODsuit modules, medical supplies and cybernetic implants,
including the combat hypospray and the combat defib. 15 TC.

**In the premium kit, there is:**
- It has a box of beakers with powerful healing chems. Omnizine,
salicylic acid, oxandrolone, pentetic acid, atropine, salbutamol and
rezadone.
- The combat injector is empty, so you can load it as necessary.
- There are advanced sutures and regenerative mesh packs. They don't
work through spacesuits, but are invaluable for wound repair. Especially
burns.
- There is a surgery arm toolset so you can do field operations without
lugging tools.
- There is a surgery processor module that comes preloaded with advanced
surgeries, a threadripper module, and the combat defib module. The
module works entirely like a combat defib, but you don't need to lose
your belt slot to use it.
- The surgeries are revival, the upgrade surgeries (like vein
threading), brainwashing (did you know they didn't get access to
brainwashing, I think this is a shame) and the better tend wounds
option.
- The nightvision medical hud doubles as a pair of science goggles.

**Atropine changes:**
- Atropine now stops bomb implants from autoexploding. This does **NOT**
stop you from manually detonating the bomb. (This is possible even when
you're dead and haven't left your body)
- As a result, nukies get atropine medipens so that they can potentially
stop themselves detonating prematurely, or stop their allies detonating
prematurely. They have a little pamphlet to help explain how their
microbomb works.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Straight up: The medkit is ass.

The meds in the injector sucks, just getting c2 meds in patches is kind
of insulting for something granted to you from an uplink item (and also
you get those for free with your ~~xbox~~ infiltrator medical room so
lol), and operatives just got the kit for one reason and one reason
only. That combat defib as a _weapon_.

Fuck that. So the kits now much better as a way to both support yourself
AND your team through providing a range of improvements you can provide
the squad, while also not undermining the reason why people may have
wanted the kit (that defib). I would really like to see more nukies
attempt to support one another in combat, and a medic operative is a
role that needs love to make that a reality.

**Edit here**: I reintroduced a low end kit with more c2 medical
supplies _if you want them_. I can see how someone might pinch all of
the medical supplies like a cunt, so maybe we should have a failsafe for
that.

A huge culprit of the lack of value of support meds was usually that
ops...explode when they die. If a medic can pop atropine into an op
before they die, they might be able to save them, or an op could pop
themselves with atropine prematurely to maybe stave off death.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Splits the nuclear operative combat medical kit into two
versions: basic and premium.
balance: Basic contains additional amounts of basic c2 chem patches,
some spare atropine autoinjectors, sutures and regen mesh, and some
basic medical equipment for tending wounds. 4 TC (as it was before).
balance: The premium kit is a far more useful full suite of advanced
medical equipment, MODsuit modules, medical supplies and cybernetic
implants, including the combat hypospray and the combat defib. 15 TC.
balance: Atropine stops bomb implants from automatically detonating on
death. You can still manually activate your bomb implant (even when you
are dead).
balance: Operatives start with an atropine pen to stop themselves and
their allies from detonating so they can hopefully be saved by a medical
operative.
add: There is a pamphlet to explain this in the nuclear operative's
survival box.
add: I'm not telling you to read the pamphlet, but you should probably
read the pamphlet.

Basic Mob Carp Bonus Part: Wall smashing (#71524)

## About The Pull Request

Atomisation of #71421 
This moves the attack function of "environment smash" flags which allow
simple mobs to attack walls into an element, so that we can put it on
other things later.
For some reason while working on carp I convinced myself that they had
"environment_smash" flags, which they do not, so this actually is not
relevant to carp in any way.

While implementing this I learned that the way wall smashing works is
stupid, because walls don't have health and so resultingly if a mob can
attack walls it deletes them in a single click. If we ever decide to
change this then it should be easier in an element than in three
different `attack_animal` reactions.
This is especially silly with the "wumborian fugu" item which allows any
mob it is used on to instantly delete reinforced walls, and also to
destroy tables if they click them like seven or eight times (because it
does not increase their object damage in any way).

## Why It's Good For The Game

Eventually someone will port a basic mob which does use this behaviour
(most of the mining ones for instance) and then this will be useful.
If we ever rebalance wall smashing to not instantly delete walls then
this will also be useful.
Admins can apply this to a mob to allow it to delete walls if they
wanted to do that for some reason, they probably shouldn't to be honest
at least until after we've done point two unless they trust the player
not to just use it to deconstruct the space station.

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Moves wall smashing out of simple mob code and into an element
we can reuse for basic mobs later

"9:50am. I am up. My mom and dad are out for my mother's cancer treatment. Meanwhile, just where is my quest leading me? Insanity and homelessness?

I know what I want to do. Apply for the Tenstorrent SDK. It would not have been much, but had I been thinking, I could have done this long ago. This is the least I can do. Let me check out the PL sub.

https://github.com/Kindelia/HVM

Somebody asked me how Spiral compares to HVM.

https://github.com/Kindelia/HVM/blob/master/guide/HOW.md

This is interesting, but I can't really take anything from it.

https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tenstorrent/learn-more/faq
> How do I get started?
> Please contact us and we will direct you to the latest software stack and User Guide.

> Where can I buy a Tenstorrent card or system?
> You can buy Grayskull products directly from us. Contact us for more information.

That contact link is paywalled.

support@tenstorrent.com

Let me email this public place.

///

I am not a customer yet, but I am considering it. Before I commit to anything I want to see your software documentation. I want to understand your programming model first.

Also, does the SDK have a simulator by any chance? That would be good.

///

Yeah, this is the ideal email. Sent.

Now imagine I actually get a reply for once from one of these companies. I take a look at the user guide, I learn Tenstorrent's programming model and I discover it is a good fit for what I want to do.

Well, I still wouldn't have the money to buy a card, but all of a sudden I would have a reason to get a job so I can buy it. If they have a simulator I could do a Tenstorrent backend. If they like it, maybe that would even make getting a job to get the card unecessary.

This is the correct way to think. If I wasn't so depressed last year, I could have done this then. I keep thinking and I am simply not going to get anywhere with GPUs. Even something something as simple as tabular on top and evolution on the bottom would lead to problems making the full use of the GPU. I really need a device where I can pass the inputs without batching them.

11:05am. Decided to take some time to do the chores.

What should I do now?

I really need the Nightmare Mode to let up a little on me. If Tenstorrent support ignores my User Guide request, just what am I supposed to do here? Not much. They ignored my Discord post. I seem to be getting ignored by all these AI companies. I didn't get a reply either from Cerebras or UPMEM support when I mailed them.

The troublesome thing is that there simply aren't any good companies making AI chips that I could use myself. Cerebras is way out of my league. Groq is super stealthy and big fish focused. Graphcore is public, but too difficult to program in addition to being expensive. There simply isn't anything other than Tenstorrent on the radar for me.

Those other PIM chips in the course are interesting, but when are they going to come out? Isn't there anything I can get my hands on today? This is my only chance for that.

11:15am. It shouldn't take more than a day or two for me to get an answer from support. I'd expect to get one by tomorrow morning. It shouldn't take them too much effort to email me the attached pdfs.

12:20am. https://www.semianalysis.com/p/tenstorrent-wormhole-analysis-a-scale

Forget this, it doesn't matter.

Let me chill a bit. Today I write Heaven's Key.

https://www.quora.com/How-much-vodka-can-you-drink-at-one-time-1

So about 0.35L. I forgot what my own liquor tolerance is, but I know that a third of a liter of hard liquor would be a lot.

12:55pm. Wrote 0.9k words. Let me have breakfast here.

2:20pm. Let me resume.

2:25pm. If I do not get a reply by tomorrow, I might want to touch up the review just a bit, maybe get rid of the UPMEM prankish part and then post it in the Tenstorrent discord.

I really don't feel like writing Heaven's Key. I am at the happiest when I am plotting my way towards my own future. Right now, I'll either be able to use Spiral as a wedge or I won't. If I can't get the User Guide here, or if I managed to get it and it turns the company is a dud, then I will have just wasted my time. I might as well post the article next on HN looking for a job.

For now, let me just focus on writing. It is really difficult to do it, knowing it is not a path I can cultivate, but didn't I want to finish it? I should remember that and keep going.

https://www.gamblingsites.com/online-casino/games/craps/bets/

3:45pm. > Shooters may keep rolling after crapping out; the dice are only required to be passed if a shooter sevens out (rolls a seven after a point has been established). A come-out roll of 7 or 11 is a "natural"; the Pass line wins and Don't Pass loses. The other possible numbers are the point numbers: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10.

Fuck, I didn't know these are the rules. That craps tutorial I watched didn't cover the shooter rules. I am going to have to rewrite some of the story.

https://youtu.be/pq6B-GevfjQ
CRAPS SHOOTER RULES - Craps Basics

https://youtu.be/pq6B-GevfjQ?t=419
> What they check for is that the serial numbers match.

I hadn't realized the dice have serial numbers.

4pm. Let me take a short break here.

4:35pm. Let me resume. I'll have to go over the top.

///

The two dice come up 1-2.

“Damn it!” The degen on my other side, slaps the table in a huff as he watches the dealer take away his 25$ green. Going clockwise, it is finally my turn again.

‘Good work, Eua.’ I praised her. ‘I could see you using the fog.’

‘Huhu, my talent is quite something isn’t it?’ Eua boasted impishly, making me smile. Without her intervention some of the degens at the table would have hit points making the game drag on.

‘Yeah, you are brilliant.’ I compliment her, taking two of the reds into my hand. Everytime I do this I feel very alive. As I grab the dice, my gaze moves past my pile on the felt, and I compare them to how much is in the racks on some of the other degens. They have tiny racks of greens, reds and some even whites, my own has long since overflown.

///

I'll have to cut this sabotage part out.

5:15pm. Let me just do some research on how betting on other players works.

https://youtu.be/2Frmh0ue2LE
How to Bet on Random Shooter in Craps

Not what I want. This video is talking what if the shooter is really random. Craps players are pretty stupid aren't they?

> Craps is a fast-moving, exciting game—players all around the table cheer and clap for each other. It’s a game in which you can bet and win when others are rolling the dice.

How does this work?

https://youtu.be/7daSiVupvmY?t=173
> A pass line betting is that the shooter will win.

Ah, not just the shooter, but anyone can bet on the pass line.

5:25pm. Ok, nevermind this. Let me get back to it.

7:20pm. Done with lunch.

38.3k words. About 2.6k written. This is good enough for one day. I'll make it my priority to try to get something out of Tenstorrent. If I can at least get its user guide, that would be a good enough achievement. These AI companies just won't give me the time of the day. I'll keep the Spiral blog alive for a few more days, just to conclude this brief UPMEM adventure and the intro to the Tenstorrent one. And after that this might be the last time I blog publically again.

Sigh, it is just so hard to be successful with one's own power isn't it? I am starting to think that my own feelings aren't enough to bring me to the victory that I desire. But then again, those feelings are what I am. They the only thing I have. So I'll try it for a bit more. I've been at it for so long, so I can afford a few more days.

If this does not work, I will post a touched up version of this article on HN asking for a regular job."

Goliath dna infusion (#71657)

## About The Pull Request
This is a baseline version of the organs and I intend on polishing them
more in the future (Hopefully after other faunas get added to the
infuser.)

Now, this PR adds goliaths to the DNA infuser at genetics. It gives 4
organs and a final bonus effect.

1- Goliath eyes: Simple mostly filler organ that gives night vision.
2- Goliath lungs: Allow miners to breath either lavaland or the default
air mix. As a side effect they can't breath pure O2 anymore so internals
can't be used. Stay away from N2O or use your gas mask properly.
3- Goliath heart: Give miner ash storm protection
4- Goliath brain: Turns one of the miner's arm into a tendril goliath
hammer that can be used to mine. Like the mounted chainsaw it cannot be
dropped, it has slower atk speed, deals 20 damage by default and a bonus
80 to lavaland fauna, it also acts as a baseball bat against fauna so
you can dodge being hit back with good timing.
As a side effect, you can't equip gloves as your hand is a big ass
hammer...

The extra effect for having all 4 organs is lava immunity for now, I
really want to turn it into something more interesting later.

GAGS organs and bonus coderspriter arm:

sprites](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55374212/205477889-22cfa586-dd43-405d-80cf-3981b31304e1.png)
If I have time I might animate the arm later.
## Why It's Good For The Game
This add some useful tools for miners if they opt into asking genetics
for help and bother to drag a goliath corpses to it.
The organs can be useful on the station, but they will only really shine
at lavaland.

We were brainstorming more things that miners can get from the station
on their downtime waiting the cargo shuttle to bring their bought gear,
this would be a simple and easy power up for miners that can have some
small (ignoring the hammer arm) bonus to miners, but small power ups
pile up.

I also wrote a hackMD around these organs, their goals, non goals,
future possibilities for fauna organs (goliath and others) etc.
https://hackmd.io/@GuillaumePrata/goliath_infusion_organs

## Changelog
:cl: Guillaume Prata
add: Geneticists figured out how to infuse goliath DNA into humanoids!
(Many monkeys were harmed in the process!)
add: Goliath eyes for nightvision, lungs to breath at lavaland safely,
heart to protect you from ash storms and the brain which turns one of
your arms into a tendril hammer.
add: Tendril hammer: Your arm becomes a giant mass of plate and tendril
but it won't fit on gloves anymore. While slow to swing around, you can
obliterate fauna/megafauna with it, 20 base dmg + 80 bonus damage to
fauna/megafauna with a bonus knockback.

Update objective.dm (#17000)

My name is not important. What is important is what I'm going to do. I just fucking hate this world, and the human worms feasting on its carcass. My whole life is just cold, bitter HATRED. And I always wanted to die violently. This is the time of vengeance, and no life is worth saving. And I will put into the grave as many as I can. It's time for me to kill.

It's a way for marines to know there's an entire queen eye looking over
them. Basically means an MD isn't 100% necessary to know the queen will
broadcast the location of your flank to the entire hive.

corner sprites.

Also, it looks fucking creepy as hell! It's awesome.

I didn't really change much, but still wanted to make a commit to signify that I sat down and worked on things that made progress in my life today - not so much as adding to this project but adding to myself, decoupling not a javascript object from another one, but myself from some things that have keeping me distracted from focusing on the things that bring value in my life - in this case, social media and the news. Not a perfect solution and there is still some way to go, but I think a certain level of progress has certianly been reached this morning to warrant a commit on github - my project will in fact benefit from this moment
