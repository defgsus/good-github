## About The Pull Request

[Reduces timer insertion cost by
80%](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/c9e5b285ed74e60108fddd3f6b45d6d3995c92a8)

Timer name generation involved a LOT of string shit, some in ways where
the string only existed for a moment.
This costs a good bit of time, and can be reduced with only minimal
impacts on the end product, so let's do that. Includes a compile flag to
flip it back if we ever have trouble in future.

This is about 0.1s off init, since we do a lot of timer stuff then too

[Removes STOPPABLE flag from QDEL_IN, moves it to a bespoke
macro](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/e7a5d7f2a78fcf0dce4742ced258c9505411b202)

Its a waste most of the time, tho I would LOVE to analyze at compile
time to work out if we care
## Why It's Good For The Game

I like it when we don't spend all of our cpu time just setting the name
var on timers. that's good and not bad.
This saves time fucking everywhere. 15% off explosions, 0.1 seconds off
init, bunch of time off foam. it's just good.

Cherry picked out of #76104 since that was too cluttered (sannnnnn)

Adds border smoothing! (Look ma I'm upstreaming) (#76134)

## About The Pull Request

Ok so we currently have 1 (count em) border object that wants to smooth
with other border objects. That's the tram window.

It currently does this manually, via map edits, but that's kinda crappy
so lets be better.

This pr adds a new smoothing mode to handle border objects. 
Unlike other smoothing modes, it returns a bitfield of directions the
border object connects in.

I do this by memorizing a calculation of which dirs "connect" at init,
and reading out of a global list with border object direction, direction
between objects, and if it's a border object, the other object's dir.

I'm doing this primarily because it's become useful for wallening (a
spriter saw the tram thing and is doing the same thing to pod windows,
and I want to support that)

I do think it's potentially useful in other applications too tho, and I
like dehardcoding tram windows.

Also fun bonus (or maybe downside), it's nearly 0 cost because I pulled
the bitmask smoothing define into 2 subdefines, and am swapping the
handler one out to do what I want.
Oh also I got rid of a for loop in smoothing code, redundant and costs
time in list iteration

[Moves tram windows over to the new border object
smoothing](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/114873679c94d680788edee9665fa18dba8108c0)

Also replaces some typepath chicanery with a setDir override, for
redundancy in future
Oh and there's a update paths script too, to be nice

## Why It's Good For The Game

More visual possibility in future, fixes a hack we have currently, and
makes some spriters happy.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Dehardcodes some stuff with tram windows, they'll be easier to map
with now
refactor: Border objects can now smooth with each other. I'm sure
something cool will come of this

Test Integration

The next release is right around the corner and this is how I start the approval process. This one is a general improvement pass focusing on QOL in installation and general  tweaks throughout the chips to speed them up and improve their workings. Test ship is built so that I can confirm that everything works out of the box, then I integrate it into a big boy ship for long term testing.

Notable changes: 
New chair, new sensor cluster, new brain cluster. Same stuff in total but fewer individual parts to slap on the ship. Should lead to fewer errors in assembly. All the usual modules still exist though so advanced builders can take things apart and put them where they see fit.
Generic states has been changed to always use the Human Input Detection system, and that part has been integrated into the chair.
The brain cluster now has a ship diagnostic scanner in it. I am not sure what I need it for, but there was room and I didn't want to put the FCUs under the MFCs as that would make them hard to tinker with.
Strafe arrest now remembers its state after you press the ESTOP button. I find that I have been using the ESTOP as a general brake and I want whatever I set my Strafe arrest to before hand to stay that way after I'm done with the stop.
Activation delay on the LDTS chip responsible for naming the Laser Desigantor-Sensor combo. This should allow the use of the :transponderOwner field to personalize the :SI names and better avoid nearby ship problems out of the box. You may still want to change them as it is easy for onlookers to figure out what the value is, but that was even more true before when it was always the same if you didn't change it. At least they are now unique per person so that multiple users that didn't do any personalization can play side by side.
Intertial Dampening has had some naming convention changes. Those have been propagated out to all affected systems.
Nav has been renamed Autopilot and has received an overhaul. It has faster loops, more tunable turning burns, and removed a lot of ifthenelseend ugliness.
The rotation matrix now calculates orientation every .6s on the single ship version rather than the 1s loop it used to be. Lxyz is now calculated over in CompassDisplayPrep.
Galacctic alighn has had the same orientation improvements made to it that Autopilot has.
I have also fixed a small cable that was not part of the chair module causing chairs to mysteriously not work when people moved them by the module. I meant to fix this ages ago...but life got in the way.

As always feel free to download the package and the test ship for your own testing and to provide any feedback. Every single new player I have seen has gone straight for the advanced stuff. The more eyes we get on these candidates the more likely they will be easy for new players to put on.

Replaces the Reaper Scythe with the Vorpal Scythe (also the Morbid trait) (#75948)

adds the Vorpal Scythe, a special chaplain null rod variant, replacing
the Reaper Scythe, a not so special null rod variant.

When you choose the vorpal scythe, it comes as a shard that you implant
into your arm, similar to a cursed katana.

Once implanted, you can draw it at any time like an arm implant.
However, sheathing it again presents some problems. (Also, implanting
the organ gives you ``TRAIT_MORBID``, which I'll explain in a bit)

The Vorpal Scythe has 10 force, one of the weakest null rod variants for
force that isn't a joke null rod. However, it has exceptional armor pen
and also has 2 tiles of reach. So quite unique.

It also has a special beheading ability when you right-click someone.
This borrows some code from amputation shears, functioning pretty
similarly, except with a few additional ways to speed up the action and
restrictions. (It takes 15 seconds baseline to behead someone standing
and conscious, and speeds up or slows down based on factors such as
incapacitation and whether or not our scythe is already empowered)

When you successfully behead someone with a mind, the vorpal scythe
gains 20 force and can be safely stowed and drawn for 2 minutes.
Performing more death knells like this will reset the timer.

If it has not performed its 'death knell', or you haven't hit a living
mob, then it will cause severe damage to you if you ever try and stow it
(or its forced back into your arm). Just hitting a mob with the scythe
will sate it for 4 minutes. Unless it is a non-player monkey. Horrible
things. Just hitting mobs does not reset the timer on empowerment.

What this means is that the chaplain may be more hesitant to simply draw
their weapon on people. It also means that potentially, the chaplain
will not always have magic immunity, since they may end up stowing the
weapon away and be reluctant to draw it on a whim without either taking
damage for sheathing it without hitting something, or dealing with
having one less hand up until they can.

While empowerment only happens when you behead mobs with a mind,
beheading monkeyhumans and other mindless humans subtypes causes their
heads to become haunted! It's mostly harmless and largely just SpOoKy.
We don't want heads with actual players in them to go floating off to
space. (Does not work on monkey heads for sanity reasons)

When you have the Morbid trait, you think creepy stuff is cool and hate
saving peoples lives. You get a mood boost from graverobbing, autopsies,
dissections, amputations (including beheadings with the scythe and
amputations with the shears) and revival surgery. However, you get a
mood penalty when you tend wounds on the living, as well as a hefty
penalty when you perform CPR or defibrillate someone. I was thinking
Victor Frankenstein when I was choosing which actions had an associated
moodlet, so anything that I might have missed would be appreciated.

You also count as potentially cool with regards to haunted objects.
Ghosts think you're neat. (Revenants probably will still kill you if
they had the chance)

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].
With this patch a process can be killed via:

 */
Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

cql3: remove expr::token

Let's remove expr::token and replace all of its functionality with expr::function_call.

expr::token is a struct whose job is to represent a partition key token.
The idea is that when the user types in `token(p1, p2) < 1234`,
this will be internally represented as an expression which uses
expr::token to represent the `token(p1, p2)` part.

The situation with expr::token is a bit complicated.
On one hand side it's supposed to represent the partition token,
but sometimes it's also assumed that it can represent a generic
call to the token() function, for example `token(1, 2, 3)` could
be a function_call, but it could also be expr::token.

The query planning code assumes that each occurence of expr::token
represents the partition token without checking the arguments.
Because of this allowing `token(1, 2, 3)` to be represented
as expr::token is dangerous - the query planning
might think that it is `token(p1, p2, p3)` and plan the query
based on this, which would be wrong.

Currently expr::token is created only in one specific case.
When the parser detects that the user typed in a restriction
which has a call to `token` on the LHS it generates expr::token.
In all other cases it generates an `expr::function_call`.
Even when the `function_call` represents a valid partition token,
it stays a `function_call`. During preparation there is no check
to see if a `function_call` to `token` could be turned into `expr::token`.
This is a bit inconsistent - sometimes `token(p1, p2, p3)` is represented
as `expr::token` and the query planner handles that, but sometimes it might
be represented as `function_call`, which the query planner doesn't handle.

There is also a problem because there's a lot of duplication
between a `function_call` and `expr::token`. All of the evaluation
and preparation is the same for `expr::token` as it's for a `function_call`
to the token function. Currently it's impossible to evaluate `expr::token`
and preparation has some flaws, but implementing it would basically
consist of copy-pasting the corresponding code from token `function_call`.

One more aspect is multi-table queries. With `expr::token` we turn
a call to the `token()` function into a struct that is schema-specific.
What happens when a single expression is used to make queries to multiple
tables? The schema is different, so something that is representad
as `expr::token` for one schema would be represented as `function_call`
in the context of a different schema.
Translating expressions to different tables would require careful
manipulation to convert `expr::token` to `function_call` and vice versa.
This could cause trouble for index queries.

Overall I think it would be best to remove expr::token.

Although having a clear marker for the partition token
is sometimes nice for query planning, in my opinion
the pros are outweighted by the cons.
I'm a big fan of having a single way to represent things,
having two separate representations of the same thing
without clear boundaries between them causes trouble.

Instead of having expr::token and function_call we can
just have the function_call and check if it represents
a partition token when needed.

Releasing Torch and TF weights 🚀  (#16)

In this PR we release the weights for Gorilla 0-shot model for Torch Hub
and Tensorflow Hub APIs 🎉

It chooses from 626 (exhaustive) TensorFlow v2 APIs, and 94 (exhaustive)
Torch Hub in a 0-shot fashion (without any retrieval). In the spirit of
being open, we do not filter, nor carry out any post processing either
to the prompt nor response 🎁 We would like to remind the community that
neither of `gorilla-7b-hf-v0`, `gorilla-7b-tf-v0`, nor
`gorilla-7b-th-v0` have any generic chat capability. We do have a model
with all the 1600+ APIs which also has generic chat capability, which we
release slowly to accommodate server demand.

You can play around with Gorilla either through our hosted colab (OpenAI
Chat completion API compliant) or you can download and run it locally.

Thank you for all the comments and suggestions so far! Keep them
coming!!!

Xenomorph/Alien Rework 2023: Part 1 (#75286)

## About The Pull Request

Alternative to #75277

Kept you waiting, huh?

This PR is the first part of a Xenomorph rework which seeks to make the
big lugs more balanced and up to date with /tg/'s current design. This
mainly involves curtailing xenomorph's infamous hardstuns into more
interactive forms of combat, while also giving some buffs to the
xenomorph's more unique abilities in order to keep them threatening.

Part 1 will focus on simple number changes and some simple mechanic
changes. In the future, changes will be made to endgame involving
xenomorphs, along with changes to other facets of Xenomorphs.

Highly based off of #55937.

Changes:

- Xenomorph disarm has been completely reworked. While a disarm will
attempt to, well, disarm, a human opponent should they be holding
something, it will no longer immediately hardstun targets when they
aren't. Instead, the xenomorph will shove the target several tiles back
and inflict 35 stamina damage. If the target slams into a wall, this
will also come with the added effect of knocking them down. If a human
is incapacitated, however, right click will slam them into the ground,
which paralyzes them for a lengthy 5 seconds (which is ultimately half
the time xenos could stun you for before), allowing for safe transport
back to the nest as long as you keep them close.

- Humans can now shove xenomorphs. Due to being the superior predator,
however, you can't knock down xenomorphs from shoving. You can slow them
for a little bit akin to humans though.

- Neurotoxin no longer is a hardstun. Instead, it deals 50 stamina
damage on contact. It is still resisted by BIO armor.

**HUNTER:**
- Speed reduced from -1 to -0.3.
- Pounce speed is twice as fast as before (1 to 2)
- Hardstun time on pounce reduced from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.

Hunters being insanely fast has been a major balance-ruining factor of
xenomorphs for many years now. These buggers could practically ambush
anyone, hardstun them immediately, and then leave before anyone could do
anything. Now, with their speed nerfed and in combination with the xeno
shove changes, hunters will need to spend more time to down a target.
Their pounce was practically useless, so its been sped up in order to
make it more practical to use.

**SENTINEL**
- Speed reduced from 0 to 0.2
- Cloak alpha reduced from 0.75 to 0.25 (you're more hidden now)

Sentinels receive a large nerf in regards to their spit, but their
before useless cloaking ability has been greatly improved upon as
compensation. They now serve better as defenders and ranged ambushers.

**XENOMORPH DRONE**
- No changes

As in the original PR, drones are perfeclty balanced in my eyes, so no
changes were required.

**XENOMORPH PRAETORIAN**
- Speed increased from 1 to 0.5
- No changes

Praetorians get affected by the nerfs of the other xeno abilities, but
now they're a bit faster in order to close the gap to use their
abilities.

**XENOMORPH QUEEN**
- Speed increased from 3 to 2
- Health increased from 400 to 500
- Damage increased from 20 to 50

Xenomorph queens have been sped up and made more tanky and lethal in
close-range combat. Fighting this beast up-close should be a death
sentence to almost anything else in the game. Speed increases will help
her re-position and close the gap on potential prey.

**OTHER CHANGES**
- Fixed a bug where simplemobs didn't actually use xenomorph's damage
values when they were attacked by them.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Xenomorphs are old, and haven't been updated for quite a long time. This
has left them as sources of a bunch of hardstuns which made counterplay
from a modern spaceman extremely difficult. With these changes, fighting
xenomorphs is more interactive and should end up being more enjoyable
for both crew and xenos. Buffs were also given out to incentivize usage
of xenomorph's unique abilities as opposed to the standard disarm spam
which was most effective for them until now.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Xenos have been rebalanced, removing their hardstuns on their
disarm and neurotoxin, along with a slew of other changes. Xenos have
received buffs to their more unique abilities in return.
fix: Fixed simplemobs ignoring xenomorph's melee damage values when
being attacked by them.

Speed and Bugfix ports (#388)

* Fully fixes atom init desyncs (#76179)

The old system was... ok, but the stack trace was unfortuante, and the
potential to double remove was silly.
Let's use a list of source, value instead, to block overremovals and
properly support different load states

Prevents a bug a goodhearted bagilmin showed me where shuttles would
randomly just fail to load.
Calling clear twice should not be a failure

:cl:
fix: Maps loaded post init will no longer randomly enter a failed state.
Hopefully.
/:cl:

* Fixes a runtime in atom init management (#76241)

## About The Pull Request

The issue was map verification calling build_cache, which uses the
define which enables/disables init values on sleep. We avoid this by
using a var on map datums and using that to enable the init value
modification only when we are actually loading stuff.

Also fixes a bug in clear_tracked_initialize() where it being called
with no values lead to bad values/potentially overriding initialized on
accident.

Also also I forgot how for loops worked so this would not have worked
regardless

## Why It's Good For The Game

Code should like, function

* Be polite! While on walk intent you won't bump, swap places or push other people now. (#68493)

* Optimizes timer insertion by 80% (W QDEL_IN micro) (#76214)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

[Reduces timer insertion cost by
80%](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/c9e5b285ed74e60108fddd3f6b45d6d3995c92a8)

Timer name generation involved a LOT of string shit, some in ways where
the string only existed for a moment.
This costs a good bit of time, and can be reduced with only minimal
impacts on the end product, so let's do that. Includes a compile flag to
flip it back if we ever have trouble in future.

This is about 0.1s off init, since we do a lot of timer stuff then too

[Removes STOPPABLE flag from QDEL_IN, moves it to a bespoke
macro](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/e7a5d7f2a78fcf0dce4742ced258c9505411b202)

Its a waste most of the time, tho I would LOVE to analyze at compile
time to work out if we care

I like it when we don't spend all of our cpu time just setting the name
var on timers. that's good and not bad.
This saves time fucking everywhere. 15% off explosions, 0.1 seconds off
init, bunch of time off foam. it's just good.

Cherry picked out of #76104 since that was too cluttered (sannnnnn)

Hacky Puppeteer!

Wow, this is sick! Got this set up using Puppeteer, and an HTTP server to host the site on localhost, which will be where the HTML is rendered to. Is there a better way of doing this that I haven't thought about yet? This is working out, but it does seem a bit ugly to have it working like this 😂

`tsx ./test`

This commit name is absolutely going to be a song name of mine.

I think this could indeed be a neat Electron app too, if all of this was done through a GUI, you could probably use the Electron backing for Puppeteer too right? I've seen a few sources and example of being able to do that. So you could have your app GUI run in Electron, and it would use that same implementation for the renderer window too. I like the CLI approach personally though, so I'm going to experiment with that to start with.

I think the GUI-app way is probably easier for more general users though, so I think that could be more worthwhile. It might make the renderer/Node interations a bit simpler too, as you'd only have to have the GUI bit, and you could use Context Bridges from Electron to get the Node communication set up? That worked fairly nicely in my now classic Electron Text Editor project.

Yeah, Tauri could be nice for this, but that's a bonus thing to worry about later. Having something working to start with is the initial goal yet again for this project here :)

Shuttle events (#76008)

## About The Pull Request


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7501474/a2d83ce8-eba1-42d9-a1f8-9d73f7c40b21

Adds shuttle events! Stuff can now start to happen outside the shuttle,
either benign or spicy (but usually just fun to watch)!
## Why It's Good For The Game

The shuttle escape sequence is an important part of the game, uniting
about every player surviving player. Recently, #71906 has made the
escape sequence more forgiving as well as more interesting by
conditionally doubling the playing field. The area outside the shuttle
is still mostly empty though, except for the few people being spaced,
daredevils and the occasional epic space fight.

This PR adds adds some space events to spice up the outside of the
shuttle! This both gives people something too look at, making the escape
sequence feel less static and more lively, as well as give people a
reason to go outside and get the full experience of ~being decapitated
by a meteor~ swimming with the fishes!

<details>
  <summary>Shuttle Events</summary>

**Friendly carp swarm**
Spawns a group of carp that flies past the shuttle, completely friendly
unless provoked.

**Friendly meteors**
Spawns a lot of strong meteors, but they all miss the shuttle.
Completely safe as long as you don't go EVA

**Maintenance debris**
Picks random stuff from the maintenance spawn pool and throws it at the
shuttle. Completely benign, unless you get hit in the head by a toolbox.
Could get you some cool stuff though!

**Dust storm**
Spawns a bunch of dust meteors. Has a rare chance to hit the shuttle,
doing minimal damage but can damage windows and might need inflight
maintenance

**Alien queen**
One in every 250 escapes. Spawns a player controlled alien queen and a
ripley mech. RIP AND TEAR!! Really not that dangerous when you realize
the entire crew is on the shuttle and the queen is fat as fuck, but can
still be fun to throw people around a bit before being torn to shreds.

**ANGRY CARP**
Once in every 500 escapes. Spawns 12 normal carp and 3 big carps, who
may just decide to go through the shuttle or try and bust through the
window if you look at them wrong. Somewhat dangerous, you could stay
away from the windows and try to hide, or more likely shoot at them and
weld the windows

**Fake TTV**
Lol

**Italian Storm**
Once in every 2000 rounds. Throws pasta, pizza and meatballs at the
shuttle. Definitely not me going off the rails with a testing event

**Player controlled carp trio**
Once in every 100 escapes. Spawns three player controlled carp to harass
the shuttle. May rarely be a magicarp, megacarp or chaos carp. I can't
honestly see them do anything other than be annoying for 3 seconds and
die

There are some other admin only ones: a group of passive carps going
directly through the shuttle and just being little shits, and a magic
carp swarm
</details>

Events are selected seperately, there isn't a crazy weighting system,
each just has a chance to run, and multiple could run at once. They also
don't immediately trigger, so people can get settled a bit, and to make
sure just waiting out the more dangerous ones is still a valid strategy.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Adds shuttle events! If shuttle escapes weren't exciting before
(doubtful), they definitely are now! I'm joking it's mostly an
atmosphere thing.
admin: Adds an admin panel to interact with shuttle events, under the
Events tab: Change Shuttle Events
fix: Objects spawned in hyperspace will properly catch hyperspace drift
/:cl:

There's a few things I'd like to do later (another PR) (honestly anyone
can do them because I suck at follow-ups), because this is too big as
is:
- Hijack triggered shuttle events
- More events (got a lot of cool suggestions, but I'm putting most of
them on hold)
- Maybe stration announcements if some more dangerous ones get added
- Structures appearing next to the escape shuttle???

Port outline-atomics to rust

This has a very long history, summarized in
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/109064. This port is a very
minimal subset of `aarch64/lse.S` from LLVM's compiler-rt. In
particular, it is missing the following:

1. Any form of runtime dispatch between LL/SC and LSE.

Determining which version of the intrinsics to use
requires one of the following:

  i) `getauxval` from glibc. It's unclear whether `compiler_builtins` is
allowed to depend on libc at all, and musl doesn't even support
getauxval. Don't enshrine the requirement "de-facto" by making it
required for outline-atomics.

  ii) kernel support. Linux and FreeBSD have limited support, but it
requires an extremely recent kernel version and doesn't work at all under QEMU (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/109064#issuecomment-1494939904).

Instead, we hard-code LL/SC intrinsics. Users who want LSE support
should use the LLVM compiler-rt (if you're building from source in
rust-lang/rust, make sure you have `src/llvm-project` checked out
locally. the goal is to soon add a new `optimized-compiler-builtins`
option so this is easier to discover).

2. The global `___aarch64_have_lse_atomics` CTOR, required to do runtime
   dispatch. Thom Chiviolani has this to say about global CTORs:

> static ctors are problems because we are pretty eager about dead code elim
> in general if you have a module that isnt directly reference we will probably not have its static ctors
> also, while llvm has a super robust way to have a static ctor (theres s special "appending global" to use for c++), we dont use that and just have people make a #[used] static in a special section
> 1. the robust way kinda requires rust knowing that the argument is a static ctor (maybe a #[rustc_static_ctor] attribute). it also would be... finnicky, since on windows we actually care beyond being a static ctor, that we run as part in a specific group of ctors, which means a very specific section (one for TLS and the other for, uh, i dont remember)
> 2. we still actually have to codegen the cgu that isn't referenced. but maybe we could remember that it has that attribute and use that

So while this is possible in theory, it's decidedly non-trivial, and
needs invasive changes to rust itself. In any case, it doesn't matter
until we decide the story around libc.

3. The 16-byte (i128) version of compare_and_swap. This wouldn't be
   *too* hard to add, but it would be hard to test. The way I tested the
existing code was not just with unit tests but also by loading it as a
path dependency and running `x test core` - the latter caught several
bugs the unit tests didn't catch (because I originally wrote the tests
wrong). So I am slightly nervous about adding a 16-byte version that is
much more poorly tested than the other intrinsics.

Commit: Designed and created Gender.java with comprehensive tests and validation through GenderTest.java

Description:
This commit focuses on the design and creation of the Gender.java class, accompanied by a series of tests within GenderTest.java. The Gender class represents the gender identity of a user and plays a crucial role in capturing and presenting gender-related information. Through the tests conducted, we ensure the proper functionality and integrity of the Gender class, validating its key features. By designing and testing the Gender class, we establish a robust and reliable solution for handling gender-related information in the system.

Changes:
- Set & Get Display Name: Implemented tests to verify the correct setting and retrieval of the display name property in the Gender class. The display name represents the user-friendly name or label associated with each gender identity.
- Enum Values: Created tests to ensure that the Gender class contains the expected set of enum values. These tests guarantee that the predefined gender options, such as MALE, FEMALE, and OTHER, are correctly defined within the Gender class.
- Enum Equality: Designed tests to validate the equality comparison behavior of the Gender enum values. This ensures that two Gender enum values with the same gender identity are considered equal.
- Enum Case Insensitivity: Developed tests to enforce case insensitivity when working with the Gender enum values. By ensuring that the gender identity comparisons are case-insensitive, we improve usability and prevent potential inconsistencies caused by variations in letter casing.
- Enum Values Count: Implemented tests to verify the count of enum values in the Gender class. These tests ensure that the Gender class contains the expected number of predefined gender options, providing an accurate representation of the available choices.
- Enum Iteration: Created tests to iterate over all the Gender enum values and validate their correctness and order. This guarantees that the enum values are correctly defined and maintain the desired sequence.

Importance of Gender:
The Gender class holds significant importance in applications that require the capture and presentation of gender-related information. It allows users to express their gender identity accurately, respectfully, and inclusively. By providing a standardized set of gender options, such as MALE, FEMALE, and OTHER, the Gender class facilitates the customization of user experiences and the implementation of gender-specific features. It also promotes inclusivity by recognizing and accommodating diverse gender identities. Through comprehensive testing of the Gender class, we ensure that it functions as intended, providing reliable and consistent gender-related functionality within the system.

[MIRROR] New Wizard spell "branch": Vendormancy [MDB IGNORE] (#22008)

* New Wizard spell "branch": Vendormancy (#75679)

## About The Pull Request
New item for wizards, ~~the Staff~~ Scepter of Runic Vendormancy.

With it, you can summon Runic Vending machines to block your enemies,
push them 2 tiles back around the summoning tile, throw the vendors 4
tiles away to squash them or simple detonate the vendors for direct
damage against enemies within a 2 tile range.

The scepter has 3 charges that can be recharged after a "long" channel
so while powerful, it is a tactical weapon and wizards can't directly
steamroll the crew with endless vendors. (Unless they buy multiple
scepters, but that is just funny.)

Also, there is a bug with the throw... I copied how baseball bats deal
with knockback, but they consistently don't push the vendors back, just
spin them on the same tile... I appreciate if anyone has any idea on how
to fix or change that to a better system.

## New changes I made
The vendor has a random set of REAL wizard robes and hat, sandals and a
foam vendor scepter as products to sell now.
This gives the crew some real armor, and if it is considered too much, I
can swap it for the fake versions.
IMO the real clothes work as the perfect bait for the crew to approach
the vendors and get exploded in the process, and while a random
assistant might get real wizard armor to go valid hunt the wizard, the
crew might just mistake them for the real wizard and beat them to death,
which is too funny.
## Why It's Good For The Game

![vendormancerPR](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/55374212/f9d98f3e-5916-4a17-987e-249f4cdb7185)

About a year ago I played Stoneshard, and it has such an amazing
Geomancy Wizard that I wanted to port some of its gameplay to SS13 as
our wizards, while funny and destructive, are kinda simple to play...

Summoning and blowing up rocks was nice, but I randomly had the idea of
summoning Vendors while at work and vendors squashing people has become
such an iconic SS13 thing to me that I had to stop being lazy and start
working on this.

Something, something, enviromental combat wizard.
## Changelog
Gonna polish the changelog later too...
:cl: Guillaume Prata
add: New Wizard spell branch: Vendormacy! Summon runic vending machines
with your Vending Scepter, force push them on your enemies to squish
them or blow them up while they are busy buying from the machines.

Demo: New Idea: SSR!

This train ran out of tracks, so I'm going to try taking a different line.

Realized that if I'm going to use an HTTP server, and I plan on using JSX, what if I just did this like a regular person and did this on the 'server' side? Lol

I was trying to load the file using Node's FS, then pass it into Puppeteer's page using `page.evaluate()` but turns out you can't serialize TypedArrays, Files, Blobs, or ArrayBuffers. The only way around this with that current setup would be to convert it to a Base64 DataURL, and that just started to make me feel yucky inside. There's already so many ugly steps going on here, and adding another layer of abstraction like that to simply get the data into Puppeteer (and it would have to come back out this way too) seemed not worth it to me. It started to wreak like the need for a rethink/write.

Took an hour or two to regroup (these changes were from before that), have a late dinner, play some music, and now I feel a bit better about things again. Lets's see where this goes next! Hell yeah!

Make the build work under more JDK versions.

(Guava is already _usable_ under plenty of verions. This change affects only people who build it themselves.)

And run CI under JDK17. Maybe this will make CI painfully slow, but we'll see what happens. If we want to drop something, we should consider whether to revert 17 or to drop 11 instead (so as to maintain coverage at the endpoints of \[8, 17\]).

## Notes on some of the versions

### JDK9

I expected Error Prone to work, but I saw `invalid flag: -Xep:NullArgumentForNonNullParameter:OFF`, even though that flag is [already](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/166d8c0d8733d40914fb24f368cb587a92bddfe0/pom.xml#L515) part of [the same `<arg>`](https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/1086#issuecomment-411544589), which works fine for other JDK versions. So I disabled Error Prone for that version.

Then I had a Javadoc problem with the `--no-module-directories` configuration from cl/413934851 (the fix for https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5457). After reading [JDK-8215582](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8215582) more carefully, I get the impression that that flag might not have been added until 11: "addressed in JDK 11, along with an option to revert to the old layout in case of need." So I disabled it for 9-10.

Then I ran into a problem similar to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6173 / [JDK-8184940](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8184940). I'm not sure exactly what tool produced a file with a month of 0, but it happened only when building `guava-tests`. At that point, I gave up, though I left the 2 above workarounds in place.

### JDK10

This fails with some kind of problem finding a Guice dependency inside Maven. I didn't investigate.

### JDK15 and JDK16

These fail with [the `TreeMap` bug](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8259622) that [our collection testers had detected](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issue-1068748849) but we never got around to reporting. Thankfully, it got reported and [fixed](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/2c8e337dff4c84fb435cafac8b571f94e161f074) for JDK17. We could consider suppressing the tests under that version.

### JDK18, JDK19, and JDK20-early-access

These fail with [`SecurityManager` trouble](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issuecomment-1293817701).

## Notes on the other actual changes

### `maven-javadoc-plugin`

I set up `maven-javadoc-plugin` to use `-source ${java.specification.version}`. Otherwise, it would [take the version from `maven-compiler-plugin`](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issuecomment-1314291284). That's typically fine: Guava's source code targets Java 8, so `-source 8` "ought" to work. But it doesn't actually work because we also pass Javadoc the _JDK_ sources (so that `{@inheritDoc}` works better), which naturally can target whichever version of the JDK we're building with.

### Error Prone

While Error Prone is mostly usable [on JDK11+](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation), some of its checks have [problems under some versions](https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3540), at least when they're reporting warnings.

This stems from its use of part of the Checker Framework, which [doesn't support JDKs in the gap between 11 and 17](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/blob/c2d16b3409000ac2e2ca95b8b81ae11e42195308/framework/src/main/java/org/checkerframework/framework/source/SourceChecker.java#L553-L554). And specifically,  it looks like the Checker Framework is [trying to look up `BindingPatternTree` under any JDK12+](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/blob/c2d16b3409000ac2e2ca95b8b81ae11e42195308/javacutil/src/main/java/org/checkerframework/javacutil/TreeUtils.java#L131-L144). But `BindingPatternTree` (besides not being present at all [until JDK14](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/229e0d16313b10932b9ce7506d84096696983699#diff-3db4b0ce4411c851bcf75d92ef4dadc7351debcf0f9b2c2623dc513923b45867R41)) didn't declare that method [until JDK16](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/18bc95ba51b6864150c28985e65b6f784ea8ee2c#diff-3db4b0ce4411c851bcf75d92ef4dadc7351debcf0f9b2c2623dc513923b45867R39).

Anyway, the problem we saw was [a `NoSuchMethodException` during the `AbstractReferenceEquality` call to `NullnessAnalysis.getNullness`](https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/log-a9d04aa2-8b5a-47ca-8066-7e6b38548064.txt), which uses Checker Framework dataflow.

To address that, I disabled Error Prone for the versions under which I'd expect the `BindingPatternTree` code to be a problem.

(I also disabled it for JDK10: As noted above, Error Prone [supports JDK11+](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation). And as noted further above, Maven doesn't get far enough with JDK10 to even start running Error Prone.)

Sets the default compression to 0 (#5526)

**What's the problem this PR addresses?**

Cache compression doesn't seem the best option nowadays:

- It adds significant time to installs
- It adds a non-negligible runtime overhead (partially related, #1817)
- It prevents Git from diffing archives when they're modified

Its main advantage is for some amazingly large packages, where storing
them inside a Git repository would be impossible (GitHub has a 600MB
file limit). But since we changed the cache default to
`enableGlobalCache: true`, this isn't relevant by default, so the cache
compression should be set to zero.

One potential issue is how it may give the impression that Yarn became
worse for global cache users. We don't believe it's the case (Git can
delta uncompressed archives in some measure, making it less expensive to
upgrade from one package version to another), but to the average eye it
may not look as such.

**How did you fix it?**

This diff sets the new default compression setting to 0.

To avoid breaking projects' (or at least not making the migration more
difficult), I added a rule to automatically set `compressionLevel` (and
`enableGlobalCache`) to their 3.x default values when running `yarn
install` in a 3.x project. When users are ready they can remove these
settings and re-run the install.

I kept the current compression level on our repository to avoid changing
all archives again. I think we'll have to think of purging the
repository in some form to migrate it to `compressionLevel: 0`.

Allow regression with 1d targets (#974)

* Allow regression with 1d targets

This change makes it possible to pass a 1-dimensional y to
`NeuralNetRegressor`.

Problem description

Right now, skorch requires the `y` passed to `NeuralNetRegressor.fit` to
be 2-dimensional, even if there is only one target, as is the most
common case. This problem has come up a few times in the past, but
mostly it's just an annoyance - just do `y.reshape(-1, 1)` and you're
good (the error message says as much).

There are, however, also cases where it's not so easy to solve. For
instance, in #972, a user reports that they cannot use skorch with
sklearn's `BaggingRegressor`. The problem is that even if `y` is
reshaped, once it is passed to the net from `BaggingRegressor`, it is 1d
again. I assume that `BaggingRegressor` internally squeezes `y` at some
point.

This PR lifts the 2d restriction check.

Initial motivation

Why does skorch require `y` to be 2d? I couldn't remember the initial
reasoning and did some archeology.

I found this comment:

(https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch/commit/2f00e2570460fe0a6acd8db94c4d8624b3ddd1eb#diff-66ed08bca4d171889565d0285a36b9b47e0e91e3b33d85c51352d8eb00faefac):

>         # The problem with 1-dim float y is that the pytorch DataLoader will
>         # somehow upcast it to DoubleTensor

This strange behavior should not be an issue anymore, so if that was the
only problem, we should be able to just remove the constraint, right?

Problems with removing the constraint

Unfortunately, it's not that easy. The issue comes down to the
following: When we remove the constraint and allow the target `y` to be
1d, but the prediction `y_pred` is still 2d, the criterion `nn.MSELoss`
will probably do the wrong thing. What exactly is wrong? Instead of
calculating the squared error for each sample pair, the criterion
will broadcast the vector and calculate _all squared errors_ between
each sample, then return the mean of that. To demonstrate, let's remove
the reduction step and look at the shape:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> criterion = torch.nn.MSELoss(reduction='none')
>>> y = torch.rand(100)
>>> y_pred = torch.rand((100, 1))
>>> y.shape, y_pred.shape
(torch.Size([100]), torch.Size([100, 1]))
>>> se = criterion(y_pred, y)
/home/vinh/anaconda3/envs/skorch/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/loss.py:536: UserWarning: Using a target size (torch.Size([100])) that is different to the input size (torch.Size([100, 1])). This will likely lead to incorrect results due to broadcasting. Please ensure they have the same size.
  return F.mse_loss(input, target, reduction=self.reduction)
>>> se.shape
torch.Size([100, 100])
```

As can be seen, PyTorch broadcasts the two arrays, leading to 100x100
errors being calculated. Thankfully, PyTorch warns about potential
issues with that.

The current solution is to accept this behavior and hope that the users
will indeed see the warning. If they don't see it or ignore it, it could
be a huge issue, because they still get a loss scalar and might even see
a small improvement in the loss during training. But the model will not
converge and it's going to be a huge pain to debug the bug, if it's even
identified as such.

Just to be clear, existing code, which uses 2d targets, will not be
affected by the change introduced in this PR and is still the preferred
way (IMO) to use regression in skorch.

Rejected solutions

I did consider the following solutions but rejected them.

Raising an error when shapes mismatch

This would remove the risk of users missing the warning. The problem
with this is that mismatching shapes can be okay in certain
circumstances. Some criteria don't expect target and prediction to have
the same shape, so we would need to check based on criterion. Moreover,
theoretically, users may indeed want to broadcast. Raising an error
would prevent that and users may have to resort to subclassing to
circumvent the error.

Automatic reshaping

We could automatically add/remove dimensions if we see that they
mismatch. This has the same problems as the previous solution regarding
the dependence on the type of criterion. Furthermore, automatic
adjustment of the user's output is prone to run into issues in some edge
cases (e.g. when the broadcasting is actually desired).

* Fix error when initializing BaggingRegressor

For Python 3.7, CI got:

TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'estimator'

for BaggingRegressor. Probably it installs an older version of sklearn,
which uses a different argument name. Passing as positional arg should
fix it.

[FEATURE] Feature/prepare for training feedbacktask (#3151)

# Description

I added a very rough outline of my ideation behind
`prepare_for_training` with the new `FeedbackDataset`. As discussed
there are 3 complexities:

- How to resolve annotator alignment?
- How to resolve optional fields, which have not been filled out? e.g.,
"Please provide a correction for prompt 1?".
- How handle potential concatenation of fields? 

To make it modular I created a step-wise approach.

1. `Pydantic` Models that map and verify data fields, like so. By doing
this we keep the flexibility to allow for other tasks like
TextClassification and this ensures we can directly use `datasets.field`
and `dataset.questions` for defining training. We could also use the
`name` values from the fields/questions, but this might be more error
prone.
2. `get_relevant_data_for_training()` in `List[dict]` format with all
relevant fields from the Pydantic model. **annotator alignment issue**.
For now I opted for choosing the first non-zero value.
3. Forward the `List[dict]` to a similar flow we previously had.
4. Also add `dataset.unify_responses(question, Enum(strategy))`-method
5. Added `*QuestionUnifcation` to schemas to hold logic surrounding
unifying multiplier responses
6. Added `client.feedback.training`
7. Added`TrainingDataFor*` to hold logic surrounding
`prepare_for_training`-methods per task
8. Added inheritance for ArgillaTrainer

```python 
import argilla as rg

xfs: fix negative array access in xfs_getbmap

In commit 8ee81ed581ff, Ye Bin complained about an ASSERT in the bmapx
code that trips if we encounter a delalloc extent after flushing the
pagecache to disk.  The ioctl code does not hold MMAPLOCK so it's
entirely possible that a racing write page fault can create a delalloc
extent after the file has been flushed.  The proposed solution was to
replace the assertion with an early return that avoids filling out the
bmap recordset with a delalloc entry if the caller didn't ask for it.

At the time, I recall thinking that the forward logic sounded ok, but
felt hesitant because I suspected that changing this code would cause
something /else/ to burst loose due to some other subtlety.

syzbot of course found that subtlety.  If all the extent mappings found
after the flush are delalloc mappings, we'll reach the end of the data
fork without ever incrementing bmv->bmv_entries.  This is new, since
before we'd have emitted the delalloc mappings even though the caller
didn't ask for them.  Once we reach the end, we'll try to set
BMV_OF_LAST on the -1st entry (because bmv_entries is zero) and go
corrupt something else in memory.  Yay.

I really dislike all these stupid patches that fiddle around with debug
code and break things that otherwise worked well enough.  Nobody was
complaining that calling XFS_IOC_BMAPX without BMV_IF_DELALLOC would
return BMV_OF_DELALLOC records, and now we've gone from "weird behavior
that nobody cared about" to "bad behavior that must be addressed
immediately".

Maybe I'll just ignore anything from Huawei from now on for my own sake.

btrfs: port to new mount api

Hey everyone,

This ports btrfs to the new mount api.

This passes xfstests for me with a single failure:

Failures: btrfs/277
Failed 1 of 821 tests

which warns about FS_IOC_MEASURE_VERITY failing on
'/mnt/scratch/subv/file.fsv' with ENODATA.

This whole thing ends up being close to a rewrite in some places. I
haven't found a really elegant way to split this into smaller chunks.
Such ports to the new mount api are rather clunky and chunky in general.
My last port for overlayfs was big even after splitting it up with the
help of preparatory patches from the maintainers.

I've done my best to make this somewhat workable but I've retained a lot
of the old structure where possible. There's probably more cleanup
possible in the future based on this.

This is curently based on Jens' for-6.5/block to minimize conflicts with
Christoph's changes to how the exclusive holder of a device is indicated
which changes the signatures for various bdev helpers. This should be
merged early this week.

Structural changes
==================

Structurally, this adds two new files param.{c,h} which contain most
code for the new mount api including all parameter parsing, superblock
creation logic, parameter verification and so on.

This allows us to keep everything related to fs_context handling hidden
and inaccessible to other pieces of the codebase that really shouldn't
need to know anything about this.

We only expose the following types and helpers to super.c which are
required for fs_context handling in btrfs:

(1) a struct fs_parameter_spec defining all supported mount options
(2) a helper to verify a set of paramters after the on-disk superblock
    has been read into memory
(3) a ->get_tree() helper responsible for creating a new or finding a
    matching existing superblock
(4) a ->init_fs_context() helper responsible to initialize internal data
    structures for a newly created btrfs fs_context

The super.{c,h} file only exposes the btrfs_fill_super() helper which is
used in the btrfs ->get_tree() helper when a new superblock is created
and needs to be initialized.

Parameter parsing and on-disk superblock information availability
=================================================================

There are big semantical differences between the new and old mount api
that have consequences for how mounting a btrfs instance works.

The old mount uses a single system call that does parameter parsing and
superblock creation in one step. This means a filesystem was free to
choose to read a superblock from disk before parsing mount parameters.

By defering mount parameter parsing after reading the on-disk superblock
into memory and allocating internal data structures to be stashed in
sb->s_fs_info, it was possible to take on-disk superblock information
into account during parameter parsing.

The new mount api splits parameter parsing and superblock creation into
distinct system calls. A new superblock is only created after all
parameter parsing has finished and this order is enforced by the VFS.

Btrfs was one of the filesystems who had such a parameter parsing order:

        btrfs_mount_root()
        -> btrfs_fill_super()
           -> open_ctree()
               -> memcpy(fs_info->super_copy, disk_super, sizeof(*fs_info->super_copy))
               -> btrfs_parse_options()

This has two main consequences:

(1) This has the consequences that struct btrfs_fs_info->super_copy was
    always initialized and available during superblock creation when
    btrfs_parse_options() was called. Thus, it was possible to check for
    various defaults set on sb->s_fs_info right at mount parameter
    parsing time.
(2) btrfs_parse_options() didn't really need to distinguish between a
    remount and a new superblock creation because in both cases a valid
    sb->s_fs_info was set and initialized.

This doesn't work with the new mount api. When parameter parsing happens
the on-disk superblock will not have been read into memory. This isn't a
problem though as parameter parsing can happen with a separate
verification step of the mount parameters after the superblock has been
created in ->get_tree() and the on-disk superblock has been read into
memory. This verification is done in btrfs_fs_params_verify(). All
filesystems supporting the new mount api more or less do it this way.

Introduction of struct btrfs_fs_context
=======================================

To clearly separate the parameter parsing context from the final
superblock info context stashed in sb->s_fs_info a new struct
btrfs_fs_context is introduced. This context is used during parameter
parsing and superblock creation or reconfiguration to hold information
about the requested mount options. The new mount api specifically has
design for this via the fc->fs_private member where this struct
btrfs_fs_context is stashed. The new context is allocated in
btrfs_init_fs_context() which initializes new btrfs context whenever a
new btrfs mount or a remount is requested.

After the verification step the mount information stashed in struct
btrfs_fs_context is committed to struct btrfs_fs_info which is stashed
in sb->s_fs_info:

* If a new superblock is created no existing mount information and
  struct btrfs_fs_info information exists. So we're starting with a
  blank sheet when parsing parameters.
* If a remount is requested we transfer the existing mount information
  from struct btrfs_fs_info into the btrfs_fs_context during
  btrfs_init_fs_context() so that information is available for parameter
  parsing. This is crucial to correctly handle mount option changes.

Subtree (subvolume) mounting - Part I
=====================================

Subtree mounting basically amounts to swapping out the root dentry for a
given superblock so that only a part of the filesystem is exposed when a
mount is created for it.

For this to work a superblock and a mount for the superblock must be
created so that the dentry for the subtree can be looked up in the
filesystem. Afterwards the mount for the superblock can be discarded and
the root dentry swapped out for the subtree dentry. Easy peasy...

The current btrfs code is mucho convoluted though tbh. Two different
btrfs filesystem types exist with the justification that having the
second filesystem type making things easier to follow. Without throwing
shade on anyone but I'm not really seeing that. It's a bit clumsy.

In any case, we need to kill this for the new mount api anyway and I
hopefully ended up with something cleaner.

As part of the port to the new mount api the reliance on
vfs_kern_mount() is removed and thus the need for a second separate
filesystem type. The callchain now is:

-> btrfs_init_fs_context() # main filesystem context
   -> btrfs_get_tree()
      -> btrfs_get_tree_common()
         -> vfs_dup_fs_context() # superblock filesystems context
            -> fc_mount()
               -> btrfs_get_tree_super()
         -> mount_subvol()

An enum indicator for the phase of the mount is kept in struct
btrfs_fs_context. A second, separate filesystem context is created that
only exists for the creation of the superblock leaving the original
filesystem context pristine.

However, the struct btrfs_fs_context is shared between the two filesytem
context via a simple refcount which is a very lightweight solution that
allows to share the mount context avoiding useless memory duplications.
The btrfs_fs_context is always freed by the original filesystem context
which is responsible for parameter parsing and subtree mounting.

The original filesystem context transfers all information that is only
relevant for superblock creation to the second filesystem context. This
specifically includes the source in fc->source and the security
information in fc->security.

The second filesystem context is also the one that allocates struct
btrfs_fs_info as this is the actual code that is responsible for
initializing sb->s_fs_info. The first filesystem context only handles
subtree creation and consumes the mount we created for the superblock.

Subtree (subvolume) mounting - Part II
======================================

(A good chunk of this can also be found as a comment in the code).

Ever since commit 0723a0473fb4 ("btrfs: allow mounting btrfs subvolumes
with different ro/rw options") the following works:

       (i) mount /dev/sda3 -o subvol=foo,ro /mnt/foo
      (ii) mount /dev/sda3 -o subvol=bar,rw /mnt/bar

which looks nice and innocent but is actually pretty intricate and
deserves a long comment.

On another filesystem a subvolume mount is close to something like:

     (iii) # create rw superblock + initial mount
           mount -t xfs /dev/sdb /opt/

           # create ro bind mount
           mount --bind -o ro /opt/foo /mnt/foo

           # unmount initial mount
           umount /opt

Of course, there's some special subvolume sauce and there's the fact
that the sb->s_root dentry is really swapped after mount_subtree(). But
conceptually it's very close and will help us understand the issue.

The old mount api didn't cleanly distinguish between a mount being made
ro and a superblock being made ro. The only way to change the ro state
of either object was by passing MS_RDONLY. If a new mount was created
via mount(2) such as:

     mount("/dev/sdb", "/mnt", "xfs", MS_RDONLY, NULL);

the MS_RDONLY flag being specified had two effects:

(1) MNT_READONLY was raised -> the resulting mount got
    @mnt->mnt_flags |= MNT_READONLY raised.

(2) MS_RDONLY was passed to the filesystem's mount method and the
    filesystems made the superblock ro. Note, how SB_RDONLY has the same
    value as MS_RDONLY and is raised whenever MS_RDONLY is passed
    through mount(2).

Creating a subtree mount via (iii) ends up leaving a rw superblock with
a subtree mounted ro.

But consider the effect of the old mount api on btrfs subvolume mounting
which combines the distinct steps in (iii) into a a single step.

By first issuing (i) both the mount and the superblock are turned ro due
to (1) and (2). Now when (ii) is issued the superblock is ro and thus
even if the mount created for (ii) is rw it wouldn't help.

Hence, for subtree mounting to work correctly, btrfs needed to
transition the superblock from ro to rw for (ii). It did this using an
internal remount call (a bold choice...).

IOW, subvolume mounting was inherently messy due to the ambiguity of
MS_RDONLY in mount(2). Note, this ambiguity also has mount(8) always
translate "ro" to MS_RDONLY. (The only time there's a real difference is
for MS_REMOUNT | MS_BIND | MS_RDONLY.) IOW, in both (i) and (ii) "ro"
becomes MS_RDONLY when passed by mount(8) to mount(2).

The new mount api however disambiguates making a mount ro and making a
superblock ro:

(3) To turn a mount ro the MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY flag can be used with
    either fsmount() or mount_setattr(). This is a pure VFS level change
    for a specific mount or mount tree that is never seen by the
    filesystem itself. IOW, it has no effect on the superblock.

(4) To turn a superblock ro the "ro" flag must be used with
    fsconfig(FSCONFIG_SET_FLAG, "ro"). This option is seen by the
    filesytem in fc->sb_flags.

This disambiguation has rather positive consequences. Mounting a
subvolume ro will not also turn the superblock ro. Only the mount for
the subvolume will become ro.

So, if the superblock creation request comes from the new mount api the
caller must've explicitly done something such as:

     fsconfig(FSCONFIG_SET_FLAG, "ro")
     fsmount/mount_setattr(MOUNT_ATTR_RRDONLY)

IOW, at some point the caller must have explicitly turned the whole
superblock ro and so we shouldn't just undo it like we did for the old
mount api.

So the port gets rid of this nasty internal remount hack at least for
requests coming from the new mount api.

So the remounting hack must only be used for requests originating from
the old mount api and imho should be marked for full deprecation so it
can be completely turned off in a couple of years.

The new mount api has no reason to support this. It is also a somewhat
bold choice because the VFS may very well apply additional protection
steps when transitioning a superblock from ro to rw which can easily be
missed in btrfs code.

In any case, I think we might end up with a singificantly cleaner way of
mounting a btrfs subtree after these changes.

coredump: require O_WRONLY instead of O_RDWR

The motivation for this patch has been to enable using a stricter
apparmor profile to prevent programs from reading any coredump in the
system.

However, this became something else. The following details are based on
Christian's and Linus' archeology into the history of the number "2" in
the coredump handling code.

To make sure we're not accidently introducing some subtle behavioral
change into the coredump code we set out on a voyage into the depths of
history.git to figure out why this was O_RDWR in the first place.

Coredump handling was introduced over 30 years ago in commit
ddc733f452e0 ("[PATCH] Linux-0.97 (August 1, 1992)").
The original code used O_WRONLY:

    open_namei("core",O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC,0600,&inode,NULL)

However, this changed in 1993 and starting with commit
9cb9f18b5d26 ("[PATCH] Linux-0.99.10 (June 7, 1993)") the coredump code
suddenly used the constant "2":

    open_namei("core",O_CREAT | 2 | O_TRUNC,0600,&inode,NULL)

This was curious as in the same commit the kernel switched from
constants to proper defines in other places such as KERNEL_DS and
USER_DS and O_RDWR did already exist.

So why was "2" used? It turns out that open_namei() - an early version
of what later turned into filp_open() - didn't accept O_RDWR.

A semantic quirk of the open() uapi is the definition of the O_RDONLY
flag. It would seem natural to define:

    #define O_RDWR (O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY)

but that isn't possible because:

    #define O_RDONLY 0

This makes O_RDONLY effectively meaningless when passed to the kernel.
In other words, there has never been a way - until O_PATH at least - to
open a file without any permission; O_RDONLY was always implied on the
uapi side while the kernel does in fact allow opening files without
permissions.

The trouble comes when trying to map the uapi flags onto the
corresponding file mode flags FMODE_{READ,WRITE}. This mapping still
happens today and is causing issues to this day (We ran into this
during additions for openat2() for example.).

So the special value "3" was used to indicate that the file was opened
for special access:

    f->f_flags = flag = flags;
    f->f_mode = (flag+1) & O_ACCMODE;
    if (f->f_mode)
            flag++;

This allowed the file mode to be set to FMODE_READ | FMODE_WRITE mapping
the O_{RDONLY,WRONLY,RDWR} flags into the FMODE_{READ,WRITE} flags. The
special access then required read-write permissions and 0 was used to
access symlinks.

But back when ddc733f452e0 ("[PATCH] Linux-0.97 (August 1, 1992)") added
coredump handling open_namei() took the FMODE_{READ,WRITE} flags as an
argument. So the coredump handling introduced in
ddc733f452e0 ("[PATCH] Linux-0.97 (August 1, 1992)") was buggy because
O_WRONLY shouldn't have been passed. Since O_WRONLY is 1 but
open_namei() took FMODE_{READ,WRITE} it was passed FMODE_READ on
accident.

So 9cb9f18b5d26 ("[PATCH] Linux-0.99.10 (June 7, 1993)") was a bugfix
for this and the 2 didn't really mean O_RDWR, it meant FMODE_WRITE which
was correct.

The clue is that FMODE_{READ,WRITE} didn't exist yet and thus a raw "2"
value was passed.

Fast forward 5 years when around 2.2.4pre4 (February 16, 1999) this code
was changed to:

    -       dentry = open_namei(corefile,O_CREAT | 2 | O_TRUNC | O_NOFOLLOW, 0600);
    ...
    +       file = filp_open(corefile,O_CREAT | 2 | O_TRUNC | O_NOFOLLOW, 0600);

At this point the raw "2" should have become O_WRONLY again as
filp_open() didn't take FMODE_{READ,WRITE} but O_{RDONLY,WRONLY,RDWR}.

Another 17 years later, the code was changed again cementing the mistake
and making it almost impossible to detect when commit
378c6520e7d2 ("fs/coredump: prevent fsuid=0 dumps into user-controlled directories")
replaced the raw "2" with O_RDWR.

And now, here we are with this patch that sent us on a quest to answer
the big questions in life such as "Why are coredump files opened with
O_RDWR?" and "Is it safe to just use O_WRONLY?".

So with this commit we're reintroducing O_WRONLY again and bringing this
code back to its original state when it was first introduced in commit

Auto merge of #112292 - thomcc:tls-ohno, r=m-ou-se

Avoid unwind across `extern "C"` in `thread_local::fast_local`

This is a minimal fix for #112285, in case we want a simple patch that can be easily to backported if that's desirable.

*(Note: I have another broader cleanup which I've mostly omitted from here to avoid clutter, except for the `Cell` change, which isn't needed to fix UB, but simplifies safety comments).*

The only tier-1 target that this occurs on in a way that seems likely to cause problems in practice linux-gnu, although I believe some folks care about that platform somewhat 😉. I'm unsure how big of an issue this is. I've seen stuff like this behave quite badly, but there's a number of reasons to think this might actually be "fine in practice".

I've hedged my bets and assumed we'll backport this at least to beta but my feeling is that there's not enough evidence this is a problem worth backporting further than that.

### More details

This issue seems to have existed since `thread_local!`'s `const` init functionality was added. It occurs if you have a `const`-initialized thread local for a type that `needs_drop`, the drop panics, and you're on a target with support for static thread locals. In this case, we will end up defining an `extern "C"` function in the user crate rather than in libstd, and because the user crate will not have `#![feature(c_unwind)]` enabled, their panic will not be caught by an auto-inserted abort guard.

In practice, the actual situation where problems are likely[^ub] is somewhat narrower.

On most targets with static thread locals, we manage the TLS dtor list by hand (for reentrancy reasons among others). In these cases, while the users code may panic, we're calling it inside our own `extern "C"` (or `extern "system"`) function, which seems to (at least in practice) catch the panic and convert it to an abort.

However, on a few targets, most notably linux-gnu with recent glibc (but also fuchsia and redox), a tls dtor registration mechanism exists which we can actually use directly, [`__cxa_thread_atexit_impl`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/std/src/sys/unix/thread_local_dtor.rs#L26-L36).

This is the case that seems most likely to be a cause for concern, as now we're passing a function to the system library and panicking out of it in a case where there are may not be Rust frames above it on the call stack (since it's running thread shutdown), and even if there were, it may not be prepared to handle such unwinding. If that's the case, it'd be bad.

Is it? Dunno. The fact that it's a `__cxa_*` function makes me think they probably have considered that the callback could throw but I have no evidence here and it doesn't seem to be written down anywhere, so it's just a guess. (I would not be surprised if someone comes into this thread to tell me how definitely-bad-news it is).

That said, as I said, all this is actually UB! If this isn't a "technically UB but fine in practice", but all bets are off if this is the kind of thing we are telling LLVM about.

[^ub]: This is UB so take that with a grain of salt -- I'm absolutely making assumptions about how the UB will behave "in practice" here, which is almost certainly a mistake.

Updated for billionth time.

I was gonna add my actual hobbies but I don't think any of my actual interests can top 'being normal' and 'staring at screen'. Plus it'd all just be stuff like 'watching the leaves sway on trees' because I swear I am the most boring person ever in terms of what I do. Also because admitting half of my time is spent walking around town is incredibly embarrassing. I think admitting I almost killed one of my classmates in gym is more embarrassing though (I'm so sorry Riley jesus christ). Might add an extra readme with fun facts about me or something. They wouldn't even be fun though since they'd all be like 'I like to burn random games to random CD-ROMS and leave them at random tech stores just to perplex the owners.'. Oh well. Whatever. Gamer man out. Live laugh love.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

performance: don't compile on hover on dev (#51830)

An annoying issue that slows down compilation times in dev for Next is
that we might trigger compilation of a page via hover on app.

We do this because we want the same experience in production and dev and
the prefetching is important for instantaneous loading states.

The alternative in this PR is that we don't prefetch at all anymore in
dev but instead, when we handle navigation, we can force a prefetch
navigation.

The slight compromise with this approach is that you can't test
prefetching anymore in dev.

Create Santa is still not married. He approaches a marriage bureau and asks them to hurry the process. The bureau checks the list of eligible girls of size N and hands it over to Santa. Santa being conscious about his marriage is determined to find a girl with maximum connections so that he can gather more information about her. Accordingly, he looks to figure out the maximum number of girls (from the list) who know each other to achieve the above purpose.  In order to finalize the girl, he needs to find the Kth prime. Where k = largest group of girls who know each other. Considering Santa's poor knowledge of Maths, he seeks Banta's help for the answer. Now you, a fan of Santa Banta Jokes, take this prestigious opportunity to solve the problem.  In case no of connections is zero, print "-1". Here the connection between girls is represented by a 2-D array g of dimension M*2, where M is the number of connections.02-06-2023

Drunk slurring scales based on how drunk you are (#75459)

## About The Pull Request

The strength of the slurring effect drunkness applies on you now scales
based on how drunk you are.

Being "a little" drunk still changes your saymod, and makes you
occasionally slur your words...


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/51863163/1b21b359-a1f9-428a-8e10-d2028ac59728)

But being "a lot" drunk kicks it up to 11


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/51863163/9d593c80-75ff-4d02-8e7c-e48c738154bb)

Additionally, drunk slurring was separated into "generic slurring" and
"drunk slurring", the former which does not scale but less closely
resembles drunkness. Generic slurring is used in places such as
concussions, so this is an added bonus.

As a result of the split, I had to update mind restoration. Now it heals
all types of slurring, which does include cult slurs.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I, and many other people, always found it very annoying when you became
completely illegible from taking one sip of a drink. This seeks to amend
that by making low levels of drunkness still for the most part be
legible and sane. Average drunkness is roughly the same / equal to the
old slurring effect, while "very drunk" is even more illegible and silly
(which I find funny).

This has the added bonus of separating out "drunk slurring" and "generic
slurring", allowing effects to slur your words without going full ham on
drunkness (burping and "huhh"s).

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
add: When you are drunk, the strength of your slurring now varies based
on how drunk you are. Being "a little drunk" only rarely slurs your
words, being average drunk is the same as the old effect, while being
very drunk now slurs your words even more.
add: Some non-alcohol sources of slurring, such as concussions, now give
"generic slurring" rather than "drunk slurring", which less resemble
being drunk (ie, no burping).
add: Mind restoration now heals ALL slurring, rather than only drunk
slurring (which includes cult / heretic slurring).

Huge update (See description for full changelog)

Configuration:
- Settings unlocked for local lobby hosting
- Setting that makes the maps wait for a minimum amount of players before starting the waves
- Console variable to allow the use of Smart Pistol as secondary on Easy Mode
- Console variable to setup what Grenade type Grunts can use

Match:
- Frontier Defense Postmatch Summary Menu is restored, it will appear whenever a match ends and returns to lobby if a server allows
- Proper tracking of Titan's Frontier Defense earned experience, allowing them to level up their Aegis ranks
- Dynamic change of Titan/Core Meters based on current players in the match
- If a player as pilot manages to kill 6 or more Titans within a short time (mostly Nuke Rodeos), the server will announce that to all other players
- Droz and Davis will nag to players spend their money at the Store during wave breaks if they have more than 100 Cash
- Proper spawn point rating for when respawning as Titan, players will not drop away from the Harvester anymore as Titan

Maps:
- New Playable Map: Eden
- Angel City Wave Rework to be based off the vanilla spawn amounts
- Boomtown Wave Rework to make waves more consistent with spawn locations and balance
- Drydock: Adjusted where Drones spawns to avoid them making unecessary loops around the Crane area

Live Fire Frontier Defense mode:
- New Playable Maps: Deck, Township, UMA
- Pilot-only gameplay
- 3 Waves with huge amounts of enemies, infantry mostly
- Loadout can be changed at any time during a wave in the Loadout Crates
- Droz and Davis helps players in person by guarding the Harvester
- Players recieve the double amount of money when completing a wave
- Players can have 3 Turrets instead of 2
- Players have no grenades
- Players have limited Anti-Titan ammo, restock possible at Loadout Crate
- Grunts will always have one shield captain in their squads and will always have Anti-Titan weapons
- Stalkers will always spawn with EPG
- Players have a single "public" Titan to use called 'Helper Titan', pilots approaching this Titan gains ownership, staying away clears it

The Helper Titan is:
*A Tone chassis Titan
*Uses XO-16 with Arc Rounds and Faster Reload as primary weapon
*Has basic Dumbfire Missile and Cluster Missile Rack as shoulder mounts
*Has zero-energy Tripwire as utility
*Has basic Salvo Core
*Has passive Shield Regeneration
*Has passive very slow Health Regeneration
*Cannot be rodeoed
*Cannot be disembarked while a wave is active
*Cannot be ordered to follow or guard, it always stays on kneeled position awaiting for a pilot to embark
*If destroyed, it respawns after 2 minutes

AI:
- Cloak Drones will now properly ignore Arc Titans instead of attempting to cloak them
- Mortar Spectres can be hacked if server allows, and they will behave more precisely to vanilla when going into their siege spots
- Grunts will talk about their squadmates being killed or if they are the last person alive in their squad
- Shortened the range where Stalkers starts sprinting at the Harvester from 1800 to 1024 map units
- Sniper Titans will have a better accuracy than normal Titans
- Elite Titans will have grunt pilots inside them

Titans:
- The Shoulder Badge properly updates accordingly to the difficulties played on matches
- Healing back to full health restores the broken parts
- Auto-Titans will ignore friendly fire and AoE's during wave break, this allows Monarch to Electric-Smoke allied Titans without them dodging away

Harvester:
- Properly play the rings start animation when the map starts
- Updates the ring animations when its health reaches 50% and less
- Plays the ring deactivation upon destruction
- Sounds updates accordingly to its health state
- Lightning effects appears in the beam when low health
- The Beam color now reflects more precisely the amount of health it currently have

We regret! And you know what really pisses me off? They think the only way to kill us is to shoot us in the head, like in the old zombie stories, and that will put us out of our misery. Hey, I know! Maybe you could help me even the score."

[Hacky] But Very Close!

Wow! Got this working 'fully on the terminal', thanks to Puppeteer! Of course, it's using Puppeteer under the hood, but now you can actually pass in your own song files, and it will programmatically return back to your what the resulting image is! So you don't have to manually work with the GUI like before.

Been listening to Thank You Scientist 'Terraformer', this album is so sick.

Now that this is working, I want to improve the API so it more simply does the handling, and you do things more functionally. Right now it makes a new Puppeteer browser window for every thumbnail generator, but it doesn't have to be that way, I can set it up much nicer.

I want to make it like the builder pattern for NBT reading and writing, where there are top-level functions that are for the user's ease of use, and to manage the handling on the backside of things so it only has one browser instance at a time. This will work super great with async-await. I also want to only have a single HTTP server at a time too, so I have to move where the definitions for each of these things are into the functions differently, allowing them to manage multiple thumbnail generations concurrently from one instance.

Thought I was going to need to get the MIME type for the artwork file, but I forgot that it's stored in the data itself, so JSMediaTags will provide it (I wrapped those into a Blob object). But if I didn't have that info available to me, I found a really great ESM library to handle that kind of logic.

https://flaviocopes.com/node-serve-html-page/ (Came back to look at this again, didn't need Vite/Express, rebuilt the renderer to simple use HTML templating instead!!! No need for the Canvas implementation now either, since you can just screenshot the window's content. So now you can demo out how the HTML/CSS looks for the thumbnail content, by just opening it with either Live Server, or STE! Yay :D)

I also brought up the updated JSMediaTags module I made, from the CLI branch. It had some better handling compared to that of the original 'site' implementation.

feat(api,shared-data): error codes in PE (#12936)

On the python side of our code, we want our new enumerated exceptions to
be gradually integratable, and we also want to make sure that any errors
that we didn't yet get the chance to give error codes end up with error
codes. To do this in a programmatic way, we can add some automated
methods for wrapping python exceptions.

All enumerated errors now get to wrap errors. These are optional
sequences of more enumerated errors that are considered to have caused
the top-level one - in most cases, this will be because the enumerated
error explicitly was instantiated to wrap a python exception, but it
could also be if it was raised from one.

Since we only wrap other enumerated errors, we need a way to make
exceptions enumerated errors. A new exception type (but not code - it's
just a GeneralError) called PythonException has this capability; it lets
you give it BaseExceptions in addition to other EnumeratedErrors, and
it's capable of walking the python memory model internals to try and get
the other exceptions in a stack of raise from ... raise from ... calls
that are reasonably popular in our code. This is functionality that is
promoted out of The Dunder Zone in python 3.11, so I feel pretty good
using it (this is what ExceptionGroups are).

So now, as in the tests, if you catch an exception and give it to a
PythonException you bless it with an error code and save all the
exceptions and their stack traces for later inspection. Cool!

ProtocolEngine is the first place we'll go through and add places that
actually use these error codes, since it's in a lovely high-leverage
middle spot in our stack. That means we both get to test the upward
interface of how these things will be represented in the HTTP API and
how they'll be created from lower exceptions.

ProtocolEngine already has its own very large and robust set of custom
exceptions, which is awesome. We can make them inherit from the
enumerated errors pretty easily, but unfortunately we have to add a
bunch of stuff to their constructors to pass along things like the
ability to wrap other exceptions and so on. Luckily that's just typing.

Once we've done that, at the three points we catch all missed exceptions
we have to switch over to creating the new style. ProtocolEngineErrors
get passed on; uncaught legacy errors get captured as PythonExceptions;
and uncaught errors in the normal core do too.

Finally, we have to represent this new style of error in the
ErrorOccurrence objects. This is the fun part. Previously, we'd added
error codes to those objects; this was sort of a big deal because we
want them to be required when you make new ErrorOccurrences and when
clients look, but we don't want things to break when we deserialize old
ones. We can extend that trick pretty easily to add new things. What's
not quite as easy is this concept of wrapping errors. Our errors are now
essentially trees, and we need tree structure here. Luckily, jsonschema
and pydantic are actually pretty good at type-recursive schema and
object definitions, so we can plop a list of other error occurrences in
there.

Now, when we catch one of these errors that's bubbled up from hardware,
we give it a name and we capture its entire history in an inspectable
way, and I think that's really cool.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

Update README.md, finished links

I went ahead and added links to everything else that could be linked to.

I also made some minor changes in the "Programming Projects" section to turn it into a more straightforward to-do list that is a little less intimidating.

I also added the Khan Academy courses because, when I finally get back into programming proper, I'm probably going to use those to re-familiarize myself with the process as well as pick up the basics of the languages they cover as a jumping off point.

I only have experience with Lua, C++, and GML right now, and I use "experience" loosely, so that's embarrassingly shameful and needs to be remedied eventually. I really miss the fun of programming in GML, though, and I picked it up quickly, so I should be able to pick up more languages again even after all this time. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to my GML projects to add to my GitHub, but they weren't anything special, anyway.

[Eval] Add Chinese Homophonic  (#1169)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Understand Chinese Homophonic 

### Eval description

We have found some popular homophonic sentences on the Internet,
including the Chinese pronunciation of English words and homophones, and
provide several options for the model to determine which option matches
the homophonic sentence the best.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Chinese homophonic puns are a widely popular internet cultural
phenomenon that generates humor by utilizing the homophonic
relationships between Chinese characters. These puns are typically
spread in text form on social media, forums, and messaging applications,
and they are extremely common in China's online culture.

Homophonic puns have a wide range of applications, encompassing ordinary
daily life scenarios as well as hot news events, entertainment gossip,
and political current affairs. These puns frequently appear in internet
memes, jokes, advertising slogans, and short videos, garnering
significant popularity among young people and internet users.

For those unfamiliar with them, homophonic puns may seem like encrypted
text, making it difficult to grasp the true intention behind them.
However, understanding them allows for the establishment of strong
connections between individuals and facilitates smooth communication.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Add Korean honorific sentence classification eval (#1181)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

korean-honorific

### Eval description

Evaluates LLMs on the task of classifying Korean honorific/non-honorific
sentences.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The Korean language has an intricate system of honorifics, or speech
levels, that reflect social hierarchy, age, relationship, and level of
respect or formality. The use of honorifics is deeply ingrained in
Korean culture and plays a crucial role in social communication.
Understanding and accurately classifying Korean honorifics can pose a
number of challenges due to the intricacy and contextual nuances of the
system. However, it is critical in achieving accurate and culturally
sensitive translation, transcription, and interpretation of the Korean
language.

Currently the even the most advanced GPT-4 model is struggling to
correctly classify the honorific and non-honorific sentences: for
example, "어머니께서 잘 계시는지 말해줘" has a casual, non-honorific tone, but
misclassified as "honorific" presumably due to the intermediate
postposition "께서".

Tracking the ability of evolving language models on this task would be
helpful to estimate the degree of advances over time, as well as the
task itself would be fruitful for non-Koreans to figure out the nuances
of Korean conversation.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

chinese-lantern-riddles

### Eval description

This evaluation tests the model's performance in solving Chinese lantern
riddles, which are based on the shape, pronunciation, and meaning of
Chinese characters.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Lantern riddles are a traditional Chinese festive activity that involves
multiple participants guessing riddles together. Apart from being a part
of festival celebrations, lantern riddles can also serve as an
educational tool to help Chinese language learners enhance their
vocabulary and language reasoning. Through the process of unraveling the
riddles, students can also develop their logical thinking and reasoning
skills, as well as nurture their imagination and creativity. Lantern
riddles can also spark students' interest in language learning and make
the learning experience more enjoyable.

Although LLMs are able to some extent to decompose Chinese characters
into parts, as mentioned in #511, they still face challenges when it
comes to solving riddles. In most cases, GPT 3.5 cannot reason correctly
about the structure of Chinese characters. For instance, the riddle
"上下一体（打一字）" can be interpreted as a combination ("一体") of "上" and "下",
resulting in the answer "卡". However, GPT 3.5 gives the wrong answer,
"升", with a reason that makes no sense. A similar situation occurs when
GPT 3.5 reasons about the pronunciation of Chinese characters, with one
of its explanations stating that the pronunciation of "盼（pàn）" is
similar to the pronunciation of "俄（é）", which is entirely incorrect.
However, on the positive side, GPT 3.5 shows good performance when a
riddle only encodes meaning and does not require reasoning about the
structure and pronunciation.

Add Belarusian orthography eval (#1188)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

belarusian-orthography

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to switch between classical and modern
orthographies of Belarusian.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Belarusian is famous for having two Wikipedias:
[one](https://be.wikipedia.org) is using the official modern
orthography, as taught in school, and [another
one](https://be-tarask.wikipedia.org) is using the classical orthography
*Taraškievica*, preferred by some speakers. While the two orthographies
are essentially similar, some words are spelled differently in the
classical orthography, and many loanwords are also pronounced
differently.

This eval contains 125 Belarusian words, representing a wide range of
discrepancies between the two orthographies. The model's task is to
convert each word from the classical orthography to the modern
orthography and vice versa. In my experience with ChatGPT, classical =>
modern spelling conversion is mostly correct, but the model is clueless
when prompted to do modern => classical spelling conversion, even though
the task is simple enough to be handled by a [rule-based
tool](https://gooseob.github.io/taraskevizatar).

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Ordering Randomised VersionList

### Eval description

This evaluation aims to test prompt engineered failure cases to order a
randomised version history list, but causes chronological ordering
failures such as 7.5.2 -> 7.4.2 -> 7.5.1 -> 7.4.1 (**incorrectly
inserted 7.4.2 in between 7.5.2 and 7.5.1** and **incorrectly skipping
over the major release version 7.5.0** in the Explainable AI chain of
thoughts) and 7.5.2 -> 7.5.1 -> 7.5.0 -> 7.4.1 (incorrectly **skipped
over 7.4.2** in the Explainable AI chain of thoughts).

### What makes this a useful eval?
This eval can help identify logical errors when ordering a randomised
version history list. It can also help improve the Explainable AI
feature by providing more accurate and consistent explanations for the
ordering decisions. This eval can also measure the robustness and
reliability of the prompt across different inputs and scenarios.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval is high quality because it causes the succeed rate for a 5
options (ABCDE) multiple choice quiz drop from 20% correct at randomly
selected answers to only 0-6% correct for GPT-3.5-Turbo. These are
prompt engineered failures, causing [bigger failure rates than prior
work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04388.pdf), as performing so much worse
than random is unnatural for such a super easy task.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

</details>

- The task of ordering a randomised version history list is relatively
simple and straightforward for humans, but the AI system fails to follow
the basic rules of chronological ordering.
- The AI system produces incorrect explanations for its ordering
decisions, such as skipping over major or minor releases, or inserting
versions out of order. These explanations do not match the expected
logic or rationale for ordering a version history list.
- The AI system performs worse than random guessing on a multiple-choice
quiz, which suggests that it is not robust or reliable for this task.

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Reasoning with Contradictory Constraints

### Eval description

Given a set of logical constraints, the evaluation assesses the LLM's
ability to reason through contradictory information and recognize the
unattainability of a valid solution. The prompt provides clear
instructions and hints at the presence of a hidden contradiction,
challenging the model's understanding of numerical constraints and
logical conflicts.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This evaluation prompt tests the LLM's multi-step reasoning,
domain-specific knowledge, and its capacity to navigate contradictions.
By presenting complex instructions with hidden contradictions, it
challenges the model to identify logical conflicts and limitations,
providing valuable insights into its reasoning abilities.

[Eval] Determine a gear rotation given a layout (#1136)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

gears_rotation

### Eval description

Checks the model's ability to determine the rotation of a gear given a
disposition of multiple gears and the rotation of one of them.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Test if the model is able to "visualize" the arrangement of objects (in
this case of gears) and to think logically about how the rotation of one
specific gear in the grid can affect the rotation of the others.
Gpt3.5 had an accuracy of 0.16 (4/25 right). Gpt4 (chatgpt plus
subscription) seems to fail in the same places as 3.5. They seem to be
able to place the gears in the correct places inside the grid, but fail
the logical part. Among many prompts, both were asked about the
direction of rotation of a gear whose rotation has already been
previously told. However, they still got it wrong.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [X] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Simple 2-Block Arrangement Puzzles

### Eval description

Two Tetris shapes are given and a desired arrangement of those shapes is
given. The model must arrange the blocks to match the desired shape
outline.

Here's an example of what a prompt/answer would look like: 

![image](https://github.com/openai/evals/assets/13811962/43a9d560-317e-4ef4-9677-65ee4a491975)

### What makes this a useful eval?

This kind of spatial reasoning is trivial for a human to do. It should
also be a piece of cake for a generally-intelligent AI model.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4

- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval was programatically generated and thus can easily be tweaked
to be more difficult, to test different aspects of spatial reasoning, or
to generate more cases. I [wrote a
script](https://github.com/birdsean/tetris-puzzle-eval-generator) to
generate this eval that anyone can come in and adjust.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

torch.compiler public namespace (#102182)

# torch.compiler public API

## Goal

The goal of this document is to describe the public facing API for torchdynamo and torchinductor.

Today both dynamo and torchinductor are in `torch/_dynamo` and `torch/_inductor` namespace with the only public function

`torch.compile()` which is directly placed in `torch/__init__.py`

This poses a few problems for users trying to take dependencies on PyTorch 2.0
1. Unclear BC guarantees
2. No builtin discovery mechanism outside of reading the source code
3. No hard requirements for docstrings or type annotations

Most importantly it mixes two personas the PyTorch 2.0 developer vs the PyTorch 2.0 customer so this is an attempt to address this. We draw a lot of inspiration from the `functorch` migration to the `func` namespace.

## Alternate names

We did discuss some other alternative names

1. `torch.compile` -> problem is this would break BC on the existing `torch.compile` function
2. `torch.dynamo` -> `dynamo` is so far not something we've deliberately hidden from users but problem is now figuring out what it's `_dynamo` vs `dynamo` might be confusing
3. `torch.compiler` -> 1 would be better but to keep BC this is a good compromise

# The general approach
## Proposal 1
In https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py

We have function called `reset()`, this function is essential if users are trying to `torch.compile()` a model under different settings

```python
# in _dynamo/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff()
```

Instead we propose

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff() # As in copy paste the logic from _dynamo.reset

# in _dynamo/
import warnings
import inspect

def reset():
    function_name = inspect.currentframe().f_code.co_name
    warnings.warn(f"{function_name} is deprecated, use compiler.{function_name} instead", DeprecationWarning)
    return compiler.reset()

```
## Proposal 2

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    “””
    Docstrings here
    “””
    _dynamo.reset()

# in _dynamo/
No changes
```
Consensus so far seems to be proposal 2 since fewer warnings will be less jarring and it’ll make it quite easy to merge the public API

## Docstrings

The above was an example of a function that has no inputs or outputs but there are other functions which could use an improvement in their docstrings, for example allow_in_graph actually works over lists of functions but that’s not mentioned anywhere in the example only if you read the source code.

def allow_in_graph(fn):
    """
    Customize which functions TorchDynamo will include in the generated
    graph. Similar to `torch.fx.wrap()`.

    Parameters:
        fn (callable or list/tuple): The function(s) to be allowed in the graph.

    Returns:
        callable or list/tuple: The input function(s) included in the graph.

    Examples:
        Customize inclusion of a single function:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph(my_custom_function)

        Customize inclusion of multiple functions:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph([my_custom_function1, my_custom_function2])

        @torch._dynamo.optimize(...)
        def fn(a):
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            x = my_custom_function(x)
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            return x

        fn(...)

    Notes:
        The `allow_in_graph` function allows customization of which functions TorchDynamo
        includes in the generated graph. It can be used to include specific functions that
        are not automatically captured by TorchDynamo.

        If `fn` is a list or tuple, `allow_in_graph` will be called recursively on each
        element in the sequence.

        Once a function is allowed in the graph using `allow_in_graph`, it will be captured
        in the graph generated by TorchDynamo. This customization enables more fine-grained
        control over the functions included in the graph.

        Note that `allow_in_graph` expects the input `fn` to be a callable.

    """
    if isinstance(fn, (list, tuple)):
        return [allow_in_graph(x) for x in fn]
    assert callable(fn), "allow_in_graph expects a callable"
    allowed_functions._allowed_function_ids.add(id(fn))
    allowed_functions._disallowed_function_ids.remove(id(fn))
    return fn

So to make the API public, we’d have to write similar docstrings for all public functions we’d like to create.

The benefit of this approach is that
1. No BC risks, internal and external users relying on our tooling can slowly wean off the private functions.
2. We will also have to write correct docstrings which will automatically make our documentation easier to maintain and render correctly on pytorch.org
3. We already have some BC guarantees already, we don’t kill OptimizedModule, we rejected the PR to change the config system

The con of this approach is that
Will be stuck with some potentially suboptimal functions/classes that you can’t kill

## Testing strategy
If the approach is to mostly make a public function call an already tested private function then all we need to do is ensure that the function signatures don't change

## Which functions should be in the public API

Our heuristic for deciding whether something should be public or not is are users already relying on it for lack of other options or have we recommended some non public functions for users to debug their PT 2.0 programs.

Heuristic for not putting something in public is that it’s an experimental subsystem with the goal of turning it on by default, it’s very core dev centric, meta centric, a bunch of different configs that should be batched into a single user facing one, or something that needs to be renamed because the name is confusing

#### Top level
`torch.compile()` -> already is a public API it does require some minor improvements like having configs be passed in to any backend and not just inductor (EDIT: This was already done https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/99645l) and renaming `mode=reduce-overhead` to `mode=cudagraph`

To make sure that PT 2.0 is supported with a given pytorch version users can create a new public function and this would replace the need for `try/except` blocks around `import torch._dynamo` that has been populating user code.

```python
def pt2_enabled():
    if hasattr(torch, 'compile'):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

For all of the below they will be translated to `torch.compiler.function_name()`

#### From _dynamo

As a starting point we looked at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py and we suggest redefining these functions in `pytorch/torch/compiler/__init__.py`

It might also make sense to split them over multiple files and import them in `__init__.py` but because the number of functions is small it'd probably be fine to add them all into a single compiler/__init__.py until this list becomes larger

1. `reset()`
2. `allow_in_graph()`
10. `list_backends()`
12. `compile()`:  torch.compile() would be mostly a shell function passing arguments to torch.compiler.compile()
13. `assume_constant_result()`: TODO: Double check how this is useful
15. `torch._dynamo.disable()`

Some notable omissions
11. `explain()`: We need to clean up the output for this function, make it a data class and pretty printable
1. `forbid_in_graph()`: Considered adding this but should instead consolidate on `disallow_in_graph`
2. `optimize_assert()`: Already covered by `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`
3. `check_if_dynamo_supported()`: this would be supplanted by pt2_enabled()
4. `compilation_metrics`, `graph_breaks_reasons` ..: would all be accessed via `torch.compiler.explain()`
5. `replay` does not seem useful to end customers
6. . `graph_break()`: Mostly useful for debugging or unit tests
9. `register_backend()`: End users will just pass a string backend to torch.compile, only devs will create new backends
10. `export()` : Eventually this needs to public but for now it’s not ready so just highlighting that it will be in the public API eventually
11. `disallow_in_graph()`: Usage is limited
12. `mark_static()`: we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in stable
13. `mark_dynamic()`:  we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in trunk
14. 8. `OptimizedModule`: This is the only class that we'd expose but is crucial since users are running code like `if isinstance(mod, OptimizedModule): torch.save(mod._orig_mod)` EDIT: because we fixed pickling we no longer need to
expose this
15. `is_compiling()`: Still not clear how this useful to end users

There are also config variables which we need to expose https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/config.py

Some of our configs are useful dev flags, others are to gate experimental functionality and others are essential debugging tools and we seperate out the essential debugging and logging tools to a public facing config.

TODO: I still need to think of a good way of porting the config in a BC way here are some ideas
1. Just make all passes available and controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but only show docstrings for the ones users should care about.

The current problem with our config system is we have 3 ways of setting them once via `options={}`, environment variables and variables in `config.py`, it'd be worth settling on one source of truth and have that be the public API.

The configs we should make public are
1. `log_file_name`
2. `verbose`
3. `cache_size_limit`
4. `repro_level` and `repro_after`: Although we can rename these to minifier and give human readable names to the levels

Everything else should stay private in particular

1. `print_graph_breaks`, `print_specializations`: should be supplanted by `explain()` for public users
2. dynamic shape configs : Users should only have to worry about `torch.compile(dynamic=True/False)`
3. The distributed flags, hook or guard configs: If we tell a user to use FSDP and DDP then the flag should be enabled by default or be in a private namespace
4. The fbcode flags: Obviously no need to be user facing
5. Skip/Allow lists: Not something normal users should play around with

#### From _inductor
Very little of inductor should be exposed in a public facing API, our core audience as in people writing models mostly just need information on what certain passes mean and how to control them a high level and they can do this with `torch.compile(options={})` so the goal here should be more to make available passes clearer and ideally consolidate them into `torch.compile()` docstrings or modes.

There are some exceptions though from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_inductor/__init__.py

1. `list_mode_options()`
2. `list_options()`: this needs an additional pass to hide internal or debug options

For both of these we’d rename them to compiler.inductor_list_mode_options and compiler.inductor_list_options() since they would be in the same init file as the one for dynamo

Notable omissions
1. `_inductor.compile()`: Because of users are coming in with their own fx graph, they are likely developers
2. `_inductor.aot_compile()`:Again this is about capturing and modifying fx graphs so users APIs don't need to be public

However the configs are a slightly different story, because we can choose to either
1. Make all configs public
2. Make some configs public and keep most of the private ones. If public config is set it should override the private version
3. Make all configs controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but make list_options() hide more things

For now 3 seems like the most reasonable choice with some high level configs we’ll keep like TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Regardless here's what should probably be public or advertised more
1. `disable_progress` and verbose_progress:  Combine and enable by default
2. `fallback_random`: We could make the case this shouldn't be public if a top level deterministic mode enables this
3. `profile_bandwidth`: Or could make the case that this should be in TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Notable omissions
1. Any config that would generally improve performance for most that we should probably enable by default but might be disabled in the short term because of stability: example `epilogue_fusion`, `pattern_matcher`, `reordering`
2. Autotuning flags: Should just sit behind `torch.compile(mode="max-autotune")` like `max_autotune`, `max_autotune_gemm`
3. `coordinate_descent_tuning`: This one I'm a but mixed about, maybe it just also fall into `mode="max-autotune"`
4. `trace`: `TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG` is the best flag for all of this
5. `triton.cudagraphs`: Default should be `torch.compile(mode="reduce-overhead")` - I'd go further and rename the `mode=cudagraph` and we can keep reduce-overhead for BC reasons
6. `triton_unique_kernel_names`: Mostly useful for devs debugging
7. `dce`: which doesnt really do anything
8. `shape_padding`: Elias is working on enabling this by default in which case we also remove it

## Mechanics

This PR would include the public functions with their docstrings

Another PR will take a stab at the configs

And for work where the APIs are still being cleaned up whether its minifier or escape hatches, export or dynamic shapes, aot_inductor etc.. we’ll keep them private until a public commitment can be made
