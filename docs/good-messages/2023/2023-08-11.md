windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

smaps: use vm_normal_page_pmd() instead of follow_trans_huge_pmd()

We shouldn't be using a GUP-internal helper if it can be avoided.

Similar to smaps_pte_entry() that uses vm_normal_page(), let's use
vm_normal_page_pmd() that similarly refuses to return the huge zeropage.

In contrast to follow_trans_huge_pmd(), vm_normal_page_pmd():

(1) Will always return the head page, not a tail page of a THP.

 If we'd ever call smaps_account with a tail page while setting "compound
 = true", we could be in trouble, because smaps_account() would look at
 the memmap of unrelated pages.

 If we're unlucky, that memmap does not exist at all. Before we removed
 PG_doublemap, we could have triggered something similar as in
 commit 24d7275ce279 ("fs/proc: task_mmu.c: don't read mapcount for
 migration entry").

 This can theoretically happen ever since commit ff9f47f6f00c ("mm: proc:
 smaps_rollup: do not stall write attempts on mmap_lock"):

  (a) We're in show_smaps_rollup() and processed a VMA
  (b) We release the mmap lock in show_smaps_rollup() because it is
      contended
  (c) We merged that VMA with another VMA
  (d) We collapsed a THP in that merged VMA at that position

 If the end address of the original VMA falls into the middle of a THP
 area, we would call smap_gather_stats() with a start address that falls
 into a PMD-mapped THP. It's probably very rare to trigger when not
 really forced.

(2) Will succeed on a is_pci_p2pdma_page(), like vm_normal_page()

 Treat such PMDs here just like smaps_pte_entry() would treat such PTEs.
 If such pages would be anonymous, we most certainly would want to
 account them.

(3) Will skip over pmd_devmap(), like vm_normal_page() for pte_devmap()

 As noted in vm_normal_page(), that is only for handling legacy ZONE_DEVICE
 pages. So just like smaps_pte_entry(), we'll now also ignore such PMD
 entries.

 Especially, follow_pmd_mask() never ends up calling
 follow_trans_huge_pmd() on pmd_devmap(). Instead it calls
 follow_devmap_pmd() -- which will fail if neither FOLL_GET nor FOLL_PIN
 is set.

 So skipping pmd_devmap() pages seems to be the right thing to do.

(4) Will properly handle VM_MIXEDMAP/VM_PFNMAP, like vm_normal_page()

 We won't be returning a memmap that should be ignored by core-mm, or
 worse, a memmap that does not even exist. Note that while
 walk_page_range() will skip VM_PFNMAP mappings, walk_page_vma() won't.

 Most probably this case doesn't currently really happen on the PMD level,
 otherwise we'd already be able to trigger kernel crashes when reading
 smaps / smaps_rollup.

So most probably only (1) is relevant in practice as of now, but could only
cause trouble in extreme corner cases.

Let's move follow_trans_huge_pmd() to mm/internal.h to discourage future
reuse in wrong context.

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull

## About The Pull Request
This time with revengence.

Adds the full Syndicate maid outfit to the loadout but without its stats
bonus and syndicate part replaced with tactical.
Suggested changes are welcome and I will do them as soon as possible. 
This item was requested by skyefree. 

This was in another PR, but I think I broke the actual rebasing and
wasn't sure if I was doing it right. So I closed that PR and made this
one since It was much easier to just make a new branch based on the up
to date master and just quickly put the new files in.

Original PR was  https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/pull/307

Sorry about the hassle. I'm not that experienced with using Git.

Restores Low end Space sprites (#442)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may

<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

tgstation made (awful) changes recently that made space look like THIS

![dreamseeker_YuYFvv77q1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/208272381-2b91b4f1-04e5-4c8c-bd4c-225b6386f575.png)

Then like THIS (not live yet on skyrat).

![dreamseeker_AgEEkhRDkR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/208272386-1a886d28-ee54-4487-b987-62095d86ddcd.png)

For what? shaving a whole fraction of a second off, hypothetically, of
init time? The job of the server is to pre-bake things as client-side
rendering is pretty much non-existent beyond filters and other
particular things. Not everyone likes the parralax, feels comfortable
with the parallax or even otherwise can run it on their hardware at
cost. We don't need to shave a fraction of a second off init because
it's pretty damn fast anyways, and, once I am done BENCHMARKING on a
CELERON TABLET I will prove it silly. I personally think init time saves
like this are fetishized when it throws the user experience out of the
fucking window, especially for broke/third world gamers who run systems
with like, 2GB of memory. We have players running truly destitute
systems.
## Before

![dreamseeker_vT1uJeDmgx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/208272512-628559ac-8c2a-4f29-9863-a998257c890f.png)
## After

![dreamseeker_lBhaey7ZFd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/208272521-4007b674-7126-4599-b786-fbfc512995bb.png)

I could brand this as saving 4 seconds of init time, to be deceiving.
This is with 64GB of ram on a Ryzen 5800H, Samsung 980 EVO NVME with
lowmememorymode defined.
## How This Contributes To The Skyrat Roleplay Experience

This readds a decent looking space option for those seeking every ounce
of performance in their client in exchange for the server using a
fraction of a second more CPU during init.

Added Omen Spontaneous Combustion and light tube and mirror effects (#77175)

## About The Pull Request

Cursed crewmembers can randomly, extremely rarely, spontaneously combust
for no reason.

Cursed crewmembers can get zapped by nearby light tubes.

Cursed crewmembers can freak out when passing by mirrors.

To make up for these, triggering a cursed effect is slightly less than
half as likely now when walking around now.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Cursed is fun as hell, but after a certain point it gets kind of
monotonous - it's airlocks, vending machines, and the rest is too rare
to count. We need more ways to comically get hurt in the game.

You might dislike the 'reduced effects' bit but trust me it is
incredibly frickin' common to have shit happen to you. Add to the
occasional vending machine and airlock crushes the near-constant light
tubes all over the station? Yeah, that needs a toning down else it will
be just a tad too miserable to be funny. Also cause the poor janitor
unneeded stress.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Cursed crewmembers can randomly, extremely rarely, spontaneously

Restricts Scrapheap & Lepton Violet behind conditions, alters Rollerdome (#77277)

## About The Pull Request

Lepton Violet (wabbajack) shuttle must be unlocked by having some form
of polymorph happen in-game first (Pride Mirror or the cursed springs
are the most accessible sources)

Scrapheap shuttle can only be bought if the Cargo budget is below 600
credits, and the shuttle has just less than half of its usual refueling
time left. However, it gives the cargo budget an influx of 3000 credits!

Uncle Pete's Rollerdome has had its price increased, and the disco
machine is no longer unbreakable.

## Why It's Good For The Game

First off, here is my reasoning for why these need altering at all.

Players will always naturally gravitate to the wackiest and
most-out-there options, in this case this applies to shuttles. It's why
the Monastery or the Asteroid or Daniel are reasonably common sights,
more common than some of the 'boring' shuttle options that don't need
unlock with an emag.

The problem here, as I see it, is that there is no incentive
what-so-ever to NOT purchase these 'wacky' shuttles. Some of the
shuttles in the code are just way too stupid to be seen on most or even
some rounds (Arena, Disco Inferno?), so they require rare unlocks to
occur. Wacky shuttles being spammed round after round are bad due to
several reasons:
1. Players will run every joke to the ground. Wacky conditionless
shuttles take up a large amount of space in the shuttle memeplex, so
they are disproportionately seen in comparison to any of the
less-extravagant but more grounded and actually interesting options.
(Medisim? Monkeys anyone?). This ends up making the wacky shuttles
actually *less* wacky and just the stale and boring options.
2. Wacky shuttles affect the end-round quite a lot. This is fine, of
course, but not when these wacky shuttles can be seen every round.
3. These wacky shuttles don't have proper facilities. None of them have
a good medical section, or emergency supplies, or enough room. This gets
pretty annoying pretty fast.
4. One Funny Guy (the quintessential example being the clown with a dead
captain's ID) is all but guaranteed to try to buy the funniest and most
annoying shuttle to piss off the rest of the crew. With how Funny and
Annoying these shuttles are, not to mention how dirt-cheap they are (or
literally give you money!), they're easily the most seen alternate
shuttles, which isn't good when they alter how the round-end plays so
heavily.

> Lepton Violet (wabbajack) shuttle must be unlocked by having some form
of polymorph happen in-game first (Pride Mirror is the most accessible
source)

The Wabbajack has a endless source of voluntary Polymorphs with a
comically low price, which means it is purchased endlessly by crew, not
to mention being literally a source of free syndiborgs and xenos. While
I'm not a balanceposter, this does come with some annoyances especially
for antagonists who just randomly get blown up by an assault borg. This
is fine and fun every so often, but not as a common occurrence, not as a
guaranteed every-round option. I think it's an excellent candidate for
an unlock condition.

> Scrapheap shuttle can only be bought if the Cargo budget is below 600
credits, and the emergency shuttle is more than halfway refueled.
However, it gives the cargo budget an influx of 3000 credits!

This is LITERALLY 'haha grief shuttle', I have no idea how it even got
in as a condition-less shuttle. You see the captain buy it For No Raisin
Lul 2 minutes in, sigh to yourself, and secure an EVA suit when the
shuttle lands to try to survive in the unbelievably cramped space.
(Someone always blows it up.)

Instead of being JUST Grief Shuttle, now it has some interesting reasons
to exist. Revs and you're dirt-poor? Nukies just declared war after the
Clown bought ten crates of creampie dufflebags? Buy this shuttle and get
an influx of money.

> Uncle Pete's Rollerdome has had its price increased, and the disco
machine is no longer unbreakable.

This one isn't as egregious as the above, but I believe my personal
dislike of it extends to a game design level, to an extent. One person
can buy this shuttle and the crew as a whole are left to groan as they
prepare for a noisy, confusing shuttle in which everyone is ten tiles
shifted to their left as their sprite does the most ridiculous dance
seen in SS13 history. 'Just turn the music off!': I'm glad this is an
option, but it doesn't change how much this shuttle alters things. It's
fine as a sendoff to a nice, chill greenshift, but as a constant sight
in red shifts it's just... frustrating. And purchased BECAUSE it's
frustrating, to the short-lived schadenfreude of one person and the
frustration of others.

And then the unbreakable disco machine. Why is it unbreakable. If the
crew doesn't want to listen to the thing, let them break it? Buy Disco
Inferno if you want an unbreakable disco.

Some of these changes are probably over-the-top, but remember that these
will still be seen in-game, just a bit rarer. Worst case scenario the
shuttle replacement event will let them have their time in the
limelight.

## Changelog

some form of polymorph happen in-game first (Pride Mirror or the cursed
springs are the most accessible sources)

[MIRROR] Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into gibtonite [MDB IGNORE] (#22990)

* Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into gibtonite (#77385)

## About The Pull Request

Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into
gibtonite.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into
gibtonite

There's not enough time to react, the mining scanner is surprisingly
slow sometimes and it means you drill straight into gibtonite, which
primes it the first drill and blows it up the second, which is a lot
more of a pain than it sounds because drilling is night-instant. These
explosions are usually enough to crit you, and if they don't, the stun
and area clear means any fauna can wander in and finish you off.

The auto-disable still makes it an annoyance to stumble upon gibtonite,
but it won't round end you for using modsuits.

## Changelog

Martian Food: A Taste of the Red Planet (#75988)

## About The Pull Request
Adds a selection of new foods and drinks based around Mars.
More information on Mars can be found here:
https://github.com/tgstation/common_core/blob/master/Interesting%20Planets/Human%20Space/The%20Sol%20System.md
To summarise for the general audience, Mars is a vital colony of the
Terran Federation, having been primarily settled (at least originally)
by Cybersun Industries to harvest its lucrative supplies of plasma, the
second largest in human space behind Lavaland. This has given Mars a
diverse culture evolving from the mostly East Asian colonists, and their
food reflects this.

Thanks to Melbert for their work on the soup portion of this PR.

The food:
Martian cuisine draws upon the culinary traditions of East Asia, and
adds in fusion cuisine from the later colonists. Expect classics such as
ramen, curry, noodles and donburi, as well as new takes on the formula
like the Croque-Martienne, Peanut Butter Ice Cream Mochi, and the
Kitzushi- chilli cheese and rice inside a fried tofu casing. Oh, and
lots of pineapple. The Martians love pineapple:

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/58124831/c9ae33a1-e03a-4f94-8ce0-8ad124e88e8d)
Also included are some foods for Ethereals, which may or may not be
hinting at something I've got planned...

The drinks:
Four new base drinks make their way to the game, bringing with them a
host of new cocktails: enjoy new ventures in bartending with Coconut
Rum, Shochu/Soju, Yuyake (our favourite legally-distinct melon liqueur),
and Mars' favourite alcoholic beverage, rice beer. Each is available in
the dispenser, as well as bottles in the booze-o-mat:

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/58124831/914a6e2a-7ef5-4791-ae31-d08fa9211083)

The recipes:
To make your (and the wiki editors) lives easier, please find below the
recipes for both foods and drinks:
Food: https://hackmd.io/@EOBGames/BkVFU0w9Y
Drinks: https://hackmd.io/@EOBGames/rJ1OhnsJ2
## Why It's Good For The Game
Another lot of variety for the chef and bartender, as well as continuing
the work started with lizard and moth food in getting Common Core into
the game in a tangible and fun way.
## Changelog
:cl: EOBGames, MrMelbert
add: Mars celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Martian Concession
this year, and this has brought Martian cuisine to new heights of
popularity. Find a new selection of Martian foods and drinks available
in your crafting menu today!

Fixes things about goliaths: wallhacks/range hacks(no, really) and tentacles not spawning in mineral turfs; also fixes `find_potential_targets` wallhacks (#77393)

## About The Pull Request

Goliath's sand digging behaviour could potentially target a turf that's
actually unreachable by the goliath, e.g.
```
G#
#T
```
where G - goliath # - wall T - target turf. fixed that, but i think
there could be something easier here, maybe instead grabbing turfs in
goliath's `view()`? unsure

The component goliaths use to telegraph their attacks
(`basic_mob_attack_telegraph`) casts a `do_after()` to perform the
attack, but it was not actually checking for the target staying in melee
range, as it was using the source goliath as both `user` and `target`,
so it didn't actually care at all for the target. Implemented an
`extra_checks` to `Adjacent()` since that's the closest we get for melee
range shenanigans I suppose
This still allows the source basicmob to attack the target if the target
moves around the source basicmob.

`!`Goliaths were also able to summon tentacles on a target that moved
into cover and still stayed in the `find_potential_targets` target
range. Which meant more wallhacks. This was a thing for the base
`find_potential_targets`, meaning that every basic mob using it was a
dirty haxxor (or very vengeful). Fixed that by making
`find_potential_targets` also check for `can_see()` before proceeding
further down `find_potential_targets/perform()`. `!` The only exception
to this check currently are bileworms.

`!`Goliath tentacles were not spawning in mineral turfs as their
`Initialize()` checked for closed turfs before handling mineral turf
mining. Fixed that as well.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: fixed goliaths digging sand that they can't actually reach (behind
windows or inbetween closed turfs)
fix: fixed goliaths melee attacking their target despite the target
running away from goliath melee range
fix: fixed goliath tentacles not spawning in mineral turfs
fix: fixed goliaths summoning tentacles on targets that moved behind
cover but stayed in their targeting range. this applies for most basic
mobs, really, so if any basic mob was targeting you despite you hauling
ass behind cover, they shouldn't anymore

Hard russian computer science tasks  (#1323)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

hard_russian_computer_science_tasks

### Eval description

Challenging computer science problems primarily sourced from Russian
academic and competitive programming contexts. The problems cover
various subfields of computer science, including data structures,
algorithms, computational mathematics, and more.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Russian computer science education and competitive programming are known
for their rigorous and complex problem sets. These problems can be used
to assess an GPT's ability to solve high-level, challenging problems.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [ + ] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [ + ] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either
GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [ + ] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This
means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact`
Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for
the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.
- [ + ] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [ + ] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [ + ] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [ + ] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this
eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ + ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [ + ] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [ + ] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the
requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4
access be granted.

### Submit eval

- [ + ] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [ + ] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Nukies Update 7: Hats (Also massive uplink standardization, weapon kits and ammo changes) (#77330)

## About The Pull Request

Massively overhauls and standardizes the nuclear operative uplink. 

### Weapon Kits

Essentially, all the main weapons of the uplink have been changed to
instead come as 'weapon kits', which are essentially cases containing a
weapon loadout to enable operatives to easily start operating on only
just one item purchase, without the fuss of worrying whether or not
operatives are getting spare ammo, or getting relevant equipment for
success. Consider this a pseudo-loadout, though without necessarily
restricting the purchasing of more weapon kits.

All kits come in three categories: Low Cost (8 TC), Medium Cost (14 TC)
and High Cost (18 TC). This is also matched by categorized ammo costs;
Basic Ammo (2 TC), Hollow Point and Armour Penetrating (4 TC),
Incendiary (3 TC) and Special (or anything that does not easily fit
these categories and does something real extra) (5 TC). Weapons that
lacked these ammos have gained these ammo types to fill the gaps.

<details>
There is may one exception to this in disruptor ammo, which is priced as
basic ammo if only because it isn't _quite_ good enough to justify
pricing at 5 tc and I can see an op wanting to use it as a basic ammo
type instead of normal .50 BMG against, say, a silicon/mech heavy
opposition. Since it cannot kill organics on its own, I'll consider this
mostly basic-adjacent
</details>
The kits have also been labelled based on potential difficulty. This
reflects possible difficulties in using the item, how conducive it is to
success for how much game knowledge needed to actually use it, and how
likely an op is to succeed using it. I don't expect ops to win using
nothing but a rocket launcher, but I think ops should get a fair shake
at trying, yeah?

The kits are as below:
#### **Low-Cost**
_Bulldog (Moderate):_ Shotgun and three magazines of standard ammo.
_Ansem (Easy/Spare):_ Pistol and three spare magazines of standard ammo.
#### **Medium Cost**
_C-20r (Easy):_ SMG and three spare magazines of standard ammo.
_Energy Sword and Shield (Very Hard):_ Energy sword and shield. (Also a
special hat)
_Revolver (Moderate):_ Revolver and three speedloaders of standard ammo.
_Rocket Launcher (Hard):_ Rocket launcher with three spare rockets.
#### **High Cost**
_L6 SAW (Moderate):_ LMG, and that's it. No spare ammo.
_M-90gl (Hard):_ Rifle, two spare magazines of standard ammo and a box
of rubber grenades.
_Sniper (Hard):_ Sniper rifle, two spare magazine of standard ammo, and
one magazine of disruptor ammo. Also suit and tie.
_CQC (Very Hard):_ Comes with a stealth implant and a bandana.
_Double-Energy Sword (Very Hard):_ Double-energy sword, syndicate soap,
antislip module, meth injector and a prisoner jumpsuit.
_**NEW** Grenadier's Kit (Hard):_ Grenadier's belt and grenade launcher
(the one that launchers chem grenades). (I replaced the shit acid
grenade with another flashbang in the belt)

Surplus SMG (Flukie difficulty) has been unchanged. It just now comes
with two rations.

Includes two new revolver ammo types: Phasic, which goes through walls
and armor, but has significantly less damage as a result (I've equalized
the revolver damage and the rifle version's damage to 30 for both). And
Heartseeker, which has homing bullets. Both are Special ammo, and are
priced at 5 TC a speedloader.

### Other Gear

The other items in the uplink have also been consolidated and
standardized in various ways.

#### Grenades

Most now cost 15 TC for three grenades of any given type (including the
full fungal tuberculous). This is pretty much identical to the previous
price, just more consistent overall and front-loaded in cost.

#### Reinforcements

All the various reinforcements now cost 35 TC and all refundable,
equalizing cost to the average across the reinforcements. This is
primarily because I feel like all these options should be weighed
equally, and not one of these options are necessarily worse or better
than the other in their current balance. They're largely inaccessible
for normal ops regardless, and typically come out when there is a
discount or war ops. I took the average value and went with it. Not much
more to say.

#### Mechs

They're just cheaper. These things still suck and they need help.
They've always needed help. A slightly less excessive value for the
mechs may help see people willing to spend the TC on them. I doubt it. I
seriously suggest not buying these still. I keep them in primarily
because they are big stompy mechs and are kind of iconic 'war ops' gear.

#### Bundles

Since I've implemented weapon kits, gun bundles are rather redundant. So
the bulldog weapon and ammo bundle, the c20-r weapon and ammo bundle and
technically the sniper bundle were removed. The sniper bundle is now the
weapon kit, obviously.

Nothing else here really. Except for one....

#### Implants

Not much changed here. I standardized the implant prices to 8 TC a pop.
This is in accordance with traitor implants, which ops also get. So
everything in this category bar a few exceptions (like macro/microbombs)
are around 8 TC. Makes sense to me, really.

Importantly, I made the Implant bundle 25 TC, and I unrandomized the
contents. Who in the right fucking mind would spend 40 TC just to get
five reviver implants is beyond me. But instead, you get one of each of
the cybernetic implants except thermal eyes (you can just buy thermals
and get the benefit of both vision types; x-ray and thermal vision, if
you want to use smokescreens a lot).

#### Base Keys

They're all now 15 TC, except the fridge which is 5 TC. It's weird
they're valued differently when they are taken mostly to do gimmicks
like xenobio and toxins in a hurry before hitting the station. So we've
standardized it.

## Hat Crate

**YES, GOOD SIR, YOU TOO CAN ORDER A HAT CRATE FROM THE SYNDICATE STORE
FOR ONLY 5 TC!**

**NO NEED FOR A KEY, JUST BUY IT AND PULL IT OPEN WITH YOUR STANDARD
ISSUE CROWBAR!**

**ENJOY YOUR NEW CRATE! ENJOY YOUR NEW HAT!**

**PUT IT ON USING THE FREE HAT STABILIZERS WE INCLUDED WITH THE HATS!**

~~**NO REFUNDS IF YOU GET BLOOD ON YOUR HAT!**~~

<details>
There is a 1% chance to instagib people with direct hits from a rocket.
This does the crit effect.
</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game

The uplink needed more spring cleaning and standardization.

With this, I've partially implemented my older idea for ammo consistency
and initial allowance for nukies. Ammo is kind of over-priced and often
where a good chunk of TC goes towards without really pushing nukies
towards meaningful success. And it is often what is tripping up new
players who didn't think to get any. Now, when they get a gun, they get
ammo in their case. On top of this, the weapon kit category is both at
the top of the uplink AND has a little label to say 'Recommend', so that
these new players will hopefully know they should be looking there
first.

In addition, it is the gateway towards a concept that is currently being
worked on. Nuclear operatives having some degree of predefined loadouts
for players to select if they aren't sure what they want, or don't know
what to get. Nukies is very confusing for many players. So giving them a
fighting chance with some premade setups can help ease them into the
role without needing too much player knowledge in how to apply the
items. This is only one step towards that, so that players can identify
what gear they need to help succeed based on their skill.

I wanted to implement a difficulty warning so that players can choose
gear loadouts that are actually conducive to their skill and knowledge.
I based it on how much players would need to know to engage in combat
with it, and how much fiddling is required to get something to work
properly (overly involved reloading is a consideration, for example, as
well as precise button presses). In addition, how much of a force
multiplier some weapons can be for their ease of use.

Most people recognize the c20-r as the most new player friendly weapon,
as an example. So it would be good to steer players towards taking that
gun because of how easy it is to use, understand and succeed with it.

And most importantly of all; Having standards within the uplink is
important. Most of the values in the uplink are just completely random.
Nobody has a good grasp of what is too much or too little. Even just a
hint of consistency, and people will stick to it (see implants for what
I mean). And there is still some work to be done even there. A good
start is weapons. Price for power can be meaningful when decided whether
we want some weapons to come out more often than others. Players do
enjoy making informed decisions and choices, and having affordability be
a draw to some otherwise less powerful weapons (looking at you, Bulldog)
can actually be a worthwhile and meaningful difference.

~~I thought it would tick off the gun nerds to change the calibers on
the guns.~~

~~I also thought adding hats would be funny given the release of TF2's
most recent update.~~

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Standardizes some of the nuclear operative entries to have more
consistent pricing within their respective categories.
add: Adds some new categories so that players have an easier time
navigating the nuclear operative uplink.
balance: Many items have had prices reduced or adjusted to make them
more desirable or more consistent within their category.
add: Weapon kits have replaced almost all the individual weapons in the
uplink. You now buy these instead of the individual weapon. These often
come with spare ammo or relevant gear for success.
add: Most ammo types have been standardized in price.
refactor; Removes a lot of redundant item entry code and tidies up the
actual code part of the nuclear uplink so that it is much easier to find
things within it.
add: Added 40 new cosmetic items to the Syndicate Store. Buy them now
from the Hat Crate, only 5 TC!
code: Updated the nuclear operative uplink files.

Dissection experiments are handled by autopsy surgery. Removes redundant dissection surgery. You can repeat an autopsy on someone who has come back to life. (#77386)

## About The Pull Request

TRAIT_DISSECTED has had the surgical speed boost moved over to
TRAIT_SURGICALLY_ANALYZED.

TRAIT_DISSECTED now tracks if we can do an autopsy on the same body
again, and blocks further autopsies if it is on the mob. A mob that
comes back to life loses TRAIT_DISSECTED. This allows for mobs to be
autopsied once again.

Since it is completely redundant now (and was the whole time TBH),
dissections have been removed in favour of just having the experiment
track autopsies.

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/76775

## Why It's Good For The Game

Today I showed up to a round where someone autopsied all the bodies in
the morgue, not realizing they were using the wrong surgery. Since I
couldn't _redo_ the surgery, this rendered all these bodies useless.
This was not out of maliciousness, they just didn't know better. There
are two autopsies in the surgery list, but only one is valid for the
experiment and doing the wrong one blocks _both surgeries_. Dissection
is completely useless outside of experiments. This same issue also
prevents additional autopsies on the same person, even if they had come
back to life and died again after you had done the initial autopsy.
Surely you would want to do more than one autopsy, right? That's two
separate deaths!

This resolves that by giving you a method of redoing any screwups on the
same corpse if necessary. It only matters if the experiment is available
anyway, so there isn't much reason to punish players unduly just because
they weren't aware science hadn't hit a button on their side (especially
since it isn't communicated to the coroner in any way to begin with). It
also removes a completely useless surgery and ties in the experiment to
what the coroner is already going to be doing. They can dissect their
corpses to their hearts content without worrying about retribution from
science for doing so.

In addition, someone repeatedly dying can continue to have autopsies
done on them over the course of the round. The surgery bonus only
applies once, so the only reason to do autopsies after the first is to
discover what might have killed someone. No reason this should block
further surgeries, just block surgeries when the person remains a
corpse.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: You can do autopsies on people who were revived and died again
after they had already been dissected.
qol: Autopsies have become the surgery needed to complete the dissection
experiments. As a result, the dissection surgery has been removed as it
is now redundant.
qol: A coroner knows whether someone has been autopsied and recently
dissected (and thus hasn't been revived) by examining them.

Changeling armblade gets 35% armour penetration + better wounding. (#77416)

## About The Pull Request
Gives the changeling armblade an armour penetration of 35%. Sets their
bare_wound_bonus to 10 (from 20), and a wound_bonus of 10 (from -20).
## Why It's Good For The Game
The wound bonuses basically gave massive punishment if they attacked
anything but the skin. It honestly felt kinda lame. The better wounding
potential will help bring a bloodier and more exciting atmosphere when a
changeling whips out the blade.

The armour penetration will help reduce dragged out fights that get a
little silly, while keeping the wounding more consistent.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Changeling arm blade has an armour penetration of 35%.
balance: Changeling arm blade has a wound bonus of 10, from -20.
balance: Changeling has a bare wound bonus of 10, from 20.

#### Friday 2023-08-11 05:28:39 by Andrew Sutherland

Allow diagramming C++ includes in both directions; adds `calls-from` and UI.

We make it possible to visualize C++ includes by:
- Hackily attaching context/contextsym to file includes in crossref.  This
  is something that MozsearchIndexer.cpp could/should instead generate but
  that's a follow-up.
- Creating a synthetic "structured" record for files as we ingest them
  in the crossref.  This is also something that I guess the indexers could
  create, although there is the interesting situation that we could add
  information about the generators to the structured records, and there's no
  way that the C++ indexer would know that, so there may be an argument for
  not bothering with that.
- For the generated HTML, adding a weird looking "(file symbol)" after the
  breadcrumbs that you can click on to get a context menu to be able to
  request the diagrams.
  - This also required a change to make sure we always insert the jumpref
    for the file in the file, otherwise we wouldn't have the symbol data.
- I also messed up and reformatted "output.rs", but frankly this is a good
  test of the new token-centric diff magic, so I'm going to leave it in.
- I added `calls-from` which I was scared of exposing before because I had
  such bad experiences with this being useless in the fancy-branch
  prototype.  This will probably need a follow-up to make sure that by
  default it avoids calls out of the current sub-system or at least into
  XPCOM and MFBT, as those were the real problems and required marking some
  code as explicitly boring.  Maybe that could come from the ontology

notes/figures: suruga-ya.com (not .jp) order got canceled cus they suck

(is this a stupid blogpost? probably, i don't feel like putting it on the main
site tho)

so basically i ordered 2 scale figures and 10 nendoroids with free shipping
during a free int'l shipping promotion, the DHL shipping alone would have
probably cost them ¥70,000 alone, just slightly more than my order total, and
obviously they refused to honor it and they ended the promotion early (meant to
run until aug 10th) so nobody would have a chance to reorder in time, also they
increased prices of everything on their site 10-25% to screw with us dirty
gaijins, just use the japanese domestic site (.jp) and a forwarding service,
suruga-ya.com sucks hard and you have zero reason to use it, they have a tiny
fraction of the .jp site's merchandise anyway.

they were running a free shipping sale for international customers at the time
(july 27-aug 2, 2023) and were hemhoraging money shipping international DHL and
looking for any excuse to cancel large orders, including dumb things like CC
billing address not matching shipping address or large orders over ¥7,000 being
made on a new account with no prior order history being "autocanceled" by their
fraud protection, incompetent fucks literally tied up their own inventory
(marked as sold out) for 2 weeks and probably even boxed it up too before they
decided to actually attempt billing and subsequently cancel my order

in any case, this is literally never happening again and was very likely a
mistake on their end that they even canceled the sale early, they were sending
the same size boxes they use for domestic japanese orders and it doesn't matter
usually because japan post charges by weight and not package volume, not so in
international air parcels! These cost a shit-ton to ship DHL or EMS to the
U.S., imagine blowing ¥44,500 to ship a 40x30x18cm, 1kg box containing ¥1,100
in goods. Why don't they offer surface mail, I don't mind the 3-4mo wait really.

Implement new forking technique for vendored packages. (#51083)

## Vendoring

Updates all module resolvers (node, webpack, nft for entrypoints, and nft for next-server) to consider whether vendored packages are suitable for a given resolve request and resolves them in an import semantics preserving way.

### Problem

Prior to the proposed change, vendoring has been accomplished but aliasing module requests from one specifier to a different specifier. For instance if we are using the built-in react packages for a build/runtime we might replace `require('react')` with `require('next/dist/compiled/react')`.

However this aliasing introduces a subtle bug. The React package has an export map that considers the condition `react-server` and when you require/import `'react'` the conditions should be considered and the underlying implementation of react may differ from one environment to another. In particular if you are resolving with the `react-server` condition you will be resolving the `react.shared-subset.js` implementation of React. This aliasing however breaks these semantics because it turns a bare specifier resolution of `react` with path `'.'` into a resolution with bare specifier `next` with path `'/dist/compiled/react'`. Module resolvers consider export maps of the package being imported from but in the case of `next` there is no consideration for the condition `react-server` and this resolution ends up pulling in the `index.js` implementation inside the React package by doing a simple path resolution to that package folder.

To work around this bug there is a prevalence of encoding the "right" resolution into the import itself. We for instance directly alias `react` to `next/dist/compiled/react/react.shared-subset.js` in certain cases. Other times we directly specify the runtime variant for instance `react-server-dom-webpack/server.edge` rather than `react-server-dom-wegbpack/server`, bypassing the export map altogether by selecting the runtime specific variant. However some code is meant to run in more than one runtime, for instance anything that is part of the client bundle which executes on the server during SSR and in the browser. There are workaround like using `require` conditionally or `import(...)` dynamically but these all have consequences for bundling and treeshaking and they still require careful consideration of the environment you are running in and which variant needs to load.

The result is that there is a large amount of manual pinning of aliases and additional complexity in the code and an inability to trust the package to specify the right resolution potentially causing conflicts in future versions as packages are updated.

It should be noted that aliasing is not in and of itself problematic when we are trying to implement a sort of lightweight forking based on build or runtime conditions. We have good examples of this for instance with the `next/head` package which within App Router should export a noop function. The problem is when we are trying to vendor an entire package and have the package behave semantically the same as if you had installed it yourself via node_modules

### Solution

The fix is seemingly straight forward. We need to stop aliasing these module specifiers and instead customize the resolution process to resolve from a location that will contain the desired vendored packages. We can then start simplifying our imports to use top level package resources and generally and let import conditions control the process of providing the right variant in the right context.

It should be said that vendoring is conditional. Currently we only vendor react pacakges for App Router runtimes. The implementation needs to be able to conditionally determine where a package resolves based on whether we're in an App Router context vs a Page Router one.

Additionally the implementation needs to support alternate packages such as supporting the experimental channel for React when using features that require this version.

### Implementation

The first step is to put the vendored packages inside a node_modules folder. This is essential to the correct resolving of packages by most tools that implement module resolution. For packages that are meant to be vendored, meaning whole package substitution we move the from `next/(src|dist)/compiled/...` to `next/(src|dist)/vendored/node_modules`. The purpose of this move is to clarify that vendored packages operate with a different implementation. This initial PR moves the react dependencies for App Router and `client-only` and `server-only` packages into this folder. In the future we can decide which other precompiled dependencies are best implemented as vendored packages and move them over.

It should be noted that because of our use of `JestWorker` we can get warnings for duplicate package names so we modify the vendored pacakges for react adding either `-vendored` or `-experimental-vendored` depending on which release channel the package came from. While this will require us to alter the request string for a module specifier it will still be treating the react package as the bare specifier and thus use the export map as required.

#### module resolvers
The next thing we need to do is have all systems that do module resolution implement an custom module resolution step. There are five different resolvers that need to be considered

##### node runtime
Updated the require-hook to resolve from the vendored directory without rewriting the request string to alter which package is identified in the bare specifier. For react packages we only do this vendoring if the `process.env.__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT` envvar is set indicating the runtime is server App Router builds. If we need a single node runtime to be able to conditionally resolve to both vendored and non vendored versions we will need to combine this with aliasing and encode whether the request is for the vendored version in the request string. Our current architecture does not require this though so we will just rely on the envvar for now

##### webpack runtime
Removed all aliases configured for react packages. Rely on the node-runtime to properly alias external react dependencies. Add a resolver plugin `NextAppResolverPlugin` to preempt perform resolution from the context of the vendored directory when encountering a vendored eligible package.

##### turbopack runtime
updated the aliasing rules for react packages to resolve from the vendored directory when in an App Router context. This implementation is all essentially config b/c the capability of doing the resolve from any position (i.e. the vendored directory) already exists

##### nft entrypoints runtime
track chunks to trace for App Router separate from Pages Router. For the trace for App Router chunks use a custom resolve hook in nft which performs the resolution from the vendored directory when appropriate.

##### nft next-server runtime
The current implementation for next-server traces both node_modules and vendored version of packages so all versions are included. This is necessary because the next server can run in either context (App vs Page router) and may depend on any possible variants. We could in theory make two traces rather than a combined one but this will require additional downstream changes so for now it is the most conservative thing to do and is correct

Once we have the correct resolution semantics for all resolvers we can start to remove instances targeting our precompiled instances for instance making `import ... from "next/dist/compiled/react-server-dom-webpack/client"` and replacing with `import ... from "react-server-dom-webpack/client"`

We can also stop requiring runtime specific variants like `import ... from "react-server-dom-webpack/client.edge"` replacing it with the generic export `"react-server-dom-webpack/client"`

There are still two special case aliases related to react
1. In profiling mode (browser only) we rewrite `react-dom` to `react-dom/profiling` and `scheduler/tracing` to `scheduler/tracing-profiling`. This can be moved to using export maps and conditions once react publishses updates that implement this on the package side.
2. When resolving `react-dom` on the server we rewrite this to `react-dom/server-rendering-stub`. This is to avoid loading the entire react-dom client bundle on the server when most of it goes unused. In the next major react will update this top level export to only contain the parts that are usable in any runtime and this alias can be dropped entirely

There are two non-react packages currently be vendored that I have maintained but think we ought to discuss the validity of vendoring. The `client-only` and `server-only` packages are vendored so you can use them without having to remember to install them into your project. This is convenient but does perhaps become surprising if you don't realize what is happening. We should consider not doing this but we can make that decision in another discussion/PR.

#### Webpack Layers
One of the things our webpack config implements for App Router is layers which allow us to have separate instances of packages for the server components graph and the client (ssr) graph. The way we were managing layer selection was a but arbitrary so in addition to the other webpack changes the way you cause a file to always end up in a specific layer is to end it with `.serverlayer`, `.clientlayer` or `.sharedlayer`. These act as layer portals so something in the server layer can import `foo.clientlayer` and that module will in fact be bundled in the client layer.

#### Packaging Changes
Most package managers are fine with this resolution redirect however yarn berry (yarn 2+ with PnP) will not resolve packages that are not defined in a package.json as a dependency. This was not a problem with the prior strategy because it was never resolving these vendored packages it was always resolving the next package and then just pointing to a file within it that happened to be from react or a related package.

To get around this issue vendored packages are both committed in src and packed as a tgz file. Then in the next package.json we define these vendored packages as `optionalDependency` pointing to these tarballs. For yarn PnP these packed versions will get used and resolved rather than the locally commited src files. For other package managers the optional dependencies may or may not get installed but the resolution will still resolve to the checked in src files. This isn't a particularly satisfying implemenation and if pnpm were to be updated to have consistent behavior installing from tarballs we could actually move the vendoring entirely to dependencies and simplify our resolvers a fair bit. But this will require an upstream chagne in pnpm and would take time to propogate in the community since many use older versions

#### Upstream Changes

As part of this work I landed some other changes upstream that were necessary. One was to make our packing use `npm` to match our publishing step. This also allows us to pack `node_modules` folders which is normally not supported but is possible if you define the folder in the package.json's files property.

See: #52563

Additionally nft did not provide a way to use the internal resolver if you were going to use the resolve hook so that is now exposed

See: https://github.com/vercel/nft/pull/354

#### additional PR trivia
* When we prepare to make an isolated next install for integration tests we exclude node_modules by default so we have a special case to allow `/vendored/node_modules`

* The webpack module rules were refactored to be a little easier to reason about and while they do work as is it would be better for some of them to be wrapped in a `oneOf` rule however there is a bug in our css loader implementation that causes these oneOf rules to get deleted. We should fix this up in a followup to make the rules a little more robuts.


## Edits
* I removed `.sharedlayer` since this concept is leaky (not really related to the client/server boundary split) and it is getting refactored anyway soon into a precompiled runtime.

9.2 Our problem is that we need to add the .js. It turns out that leaving the .js off is a Node thing... and it works if you're programming in Node. But in true JavaScript environments, like in your browser, you do need to include it.

 If we refresh now... that was it! It was really my editor's fault that the .js was missing when it autocompleted it. Fortunately, we can fix that! Go into your PhpStorm settings and search for "use file extension". Under "Code Style" and "JavaScript", change "Use file extension" to "Always".

 This time... if we say import Vinyl and hit "tab", nice! We get the .js.

 Automatic Importmap Entries
 - But the fun doesn't stop: there's something interesting happening behind the scenes. Click into this console.log()... just as an easy way to see the source of the final app.js file.

 Yup, its contents look exactly like the original file, including the import from './lib/vinyl.js'. There's just one problem: that's not the final filename for vinyl.js!

 Pop over to the Network tools, select "JS", and search for "vinyl". All files served by AssetMapper have a versioned part of their file name, and we see that for vinyl.js. But then... how the heck does our browser read ./lib/vinyl.js and know that it should download this long filename?

 The answer, if you view the page source, is... dramatic drumroll... the importmap. And I love this. The importmap is constructed from two sources. The first source is obvious: importmap.php. And we'll add more entries to it soon. The second source is more subtle. Whenever our JavaScript imports another JavaScript file using a relative path, that imported file is automatically added.

 This is powerful. It means that our final code can look like it originally does: ./lib/vinyl.js. But thanks to the importmap, our browser will smartly download the real file with the long version part in the name. This is really an internal detail, but it's cool to see how it works.

 Okay, we've talked about importmaps a little... but we haven't seen its biggest superpower: using third party packages. Let's explore that next.

9.1 JavaScript & importmap

 Remove the <img> tag, so we can see our normal page. Don't worry about our little penguin guy: we still have him up here in the logo.

 When we refresh the page, notice that we do have a console.log() message... which says it's coming from assets/app.js. If we head over to assets/app.js... yup! There it is!

 8 lines  assets/app.js
 console.log('This log comes from assets/app.js - welcome to AssetMapper! 🎉')

 How assets/app.js is Loaded
 - We know that we can write modern ES6 code in here, as well as import other files. We're going to do all of that. But first: How and why is this file even being executed? Our CSS is being loaded thanks to this nice, boring <link> tag. We don't see a <script> tag for app.js... but we do see this importmap() function. And that's the key.

 Back over on the site, View the page source. Down here... this is what importmap adds. We're going to talk about each part, but the most important thing right now is at the bottom:

  <script type="module">import 'app';</script>
 Earlier, when we created an app.js file inside the public/ directory, this is almost exactly the code we wrote to load it. We used import and then the path to that file. But... this time, it just says app. Shouldn't it say something like /assets/app.12345.js"? How does it know that app refers to the final version of this file? This is where the importmap part, up here, shines.

 The Wonderful importmap
 - This section is generated from an importmap.php file inside our project. The file isn't super-interesting yet: it'll be more useful soon when we talk about third party JavaScript. But it does have this app key that points to our assets/app.js file using its logical path.

 22 lines  importmap.php
return [
    'app' => [
        'path' => 'app.js',
        'preload' => true,
    ],
];
 Thanks to that, this <script type="importmap"> dumps onto the page. When you import something that doesn't start with a ".", "/", or "../", that's called a bare import. We usually see this for third-party libraries. In the browser environment, when it sees a "bare import", your browser looks for an importmap on the page to find a matching entry. Our browser sees import 'app', finds this key here, and that's the path it downloads. It effectively copies this path here and pastes it down there. That's why our app.js file is being executed: it's team work between the importmap and the extra <script type="module"> that bootstraps our app!

 The greatest thing about importmap is that it's not a Symfony thing: it's just an internet thing. It's how your browser works. We do have this importmap.php file, which is a Symfony thing. But once this is on the page, your browser is the star.

 The importmap shim + Older Browsers
 - And importmap works in... most browsers. If you go to "caniuse.com" and search for "importmap"... it currently works in about 81% of browsers. That would be a huge problem, except that the importmap() function also dumps a shim. You can see that here. Thanks to this, if a browser doesn't support importmap, this adds that functionality. So, it's just going to work.

 Importing Relative JavaScript Files
 - Head into app.js: let's write some modern code. In assets/, first create a new directory called lib/. And inside that, a new file called vinyl.js. You can organize things however you want, and this is one example of isolating some code into its own file.

 I'll paste in the same class we had earlier. Back over in app.js, import that: import Vinyl and I can hit "tab" to autocomplete the from './lib/vinyl' part. Instantiate this using the same code as before... and then console.log(mix.describe()).

 Using .js when Importing
 - I love it! We're coding like normal and using ./ to import. But when we go over and refresh... it doesn't work. Check out the 404: /assets/lib/vinyl coming from app.js.

 So... what's going on here? We'll talk more later about debugging, but here's a hint: if you ever notice that your browser is trying to download a path that doesn't include the "version" part in the filename, something is wrong with your path... and you should check for typos.

(math/R-quantreg) Updated 5.88 to 5.96

(From: inst/ChangeLog)
5.89

1.  removed the anonymous function syntax in 5.87 #2 since it did provoke
complaints from users.

2.  Fixed bootstrap methods for sparse X matrices for wild and pwy methods
report by Tom Parker.

a  mcmb is hopeless since it doesnt know about sparse matrices, will add
something to man page
b  pwy problem was annoying in the sense that rbind(X,0) doesnt work in
SparseM because 0 isnt sparse! Duh.
c  wild problem revealed an ecosystem of bugs, even in the non-sparse
case there was a bug:  hat(X) was called but should have specified hat(X,
intercept = FALSE),  when X is sparse I needed to cook up a special version of hat.

5.91

1.  CRAN is doing more severe checking about installed packages, so several
changes were made to make calls to suggested packages conditional on their
loading status.  This is supposed to be checkable by setting the environment
variable  _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_="true" R CMD check ...    but I haven't yet
gotten this to work.

5.93

1.  The problem referenced in 5.91 above was mainly due to the fact that
packages were put in the system library not my personal library.  This was
fixed by reinstalling so that now:

Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")
[1] "/Users/roger/Library/R/x86_64/4.2/library"

and now adding to .Renviron

_R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_=true

I believe will trigger the checking without the dependencies as required.

5.94

1.  Albrecht Gebhardt has made a translation of the Renka interp functionality
used for bivariate smoothing by rqss.  This effectively eliminates the need
for tripack in quantreg, and the code as been modified accordingly, thanks to
Albrecht for all his efforts on this.  This is all due to the unfortunate ACM
TOMS licencing policy that is incompatible with R.

2. Brian Ripley noted that the DOI for my CUP book was broken and I have urged
them to fix this.

3.  Minor bug fix in crq for case that the user specifies a single tau value.

5.95

1.  modified rqss to use rgl.triangles3d instead of rgl.triangles as suggested
by Duncan Murdock

2.  modified predict.rq and friends to adapt to na.action as suggested in
email of ggrothendieck@gmail.com on 5 April 2023.

5.96

1.  Changed gtimer to return 0.0 at suggestion of BDR to facilitate
compatibility with flang.

# Description

I found the quickstart workflow not as quick as it could be:

- Cells cannot be run straightaway in google colab and need extra work
(eg. libraries not imported).
- Some important concepts (eg. records and datasets) are not clearly
stated in text and code snippets
- Text refers to the same steps more than once (no clear chain of
thought)
- Cells override the same variable (eg. record), so the feeling is more
of a cheatsheet than of a tutorial notebook
- Content is not updated (eg. ArgillaTrainer is not ever mentioned in
the Train section)

I worked on a new version of the notebook with enhanced code and text
cells.Ii added also code snippets for training examples which were only
described textually.

One last suggestion: It's advisable that external files (data) are
downloaded programmatically by running a cell (eg. using `requests
`library). `Snapchat_app_store_reviews.csv` and `kaffee_reviews.csv` are
taken from kaggle which requires sign-in, so it's not possible to
download them directly. Possible solutions:

- place a copy of the Kaggle datasets in Arggilla's GitHub repository
(if permitted by Kaggle's terms of use)
- select other datasets from another source.

Closes #3431

**Type of change**

(Please delete options that are not relevant. Remember to title the PR

[MIRROR] Refactors Slaughter/Laughter Demons into Basic Mobs [MDB IGNORE] (#22801)

* Refactors Slaughter/Laughter Demons into Basic Mobs (#77206)

## About The Pull Request

On the tin, the former "imp" is now refactored into basic mob code. Very
simple since these are only meant to be controlled by players, and all
of their stuff was on Signal Handlers and Cooldown Actions anyways. Just
lessens the amount of stupidity.

Did you know that we were trying to make demons spawn in a `pop`'d cat
named "Laughter"? Embedded in the list? I've literally never seen this
cat, so I'm under heavy suspicion that the code we were using was broken
for the longest time (or may have never worked), and we now instead just
do it a much more sane way of having a cat spawn on our demise.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Cleaner code! Less simple mob jank to deal with. Trims down the list of
simple animals to refactor. No more duplicated code that we were already
doing on parent! It's so good man literally everything was seamless with
a bit of retooling and tinkering. The typepath is also no longer `imp`,
it's actually `demon`, which I'm happy with because there's no other
demons to have it be confused with anymore.

We were also doing copypasta on both the demon spawner bottle and the
demon spawning event so I also just unified that into the mob. I also
reorganized the sprites to be a bit clearer and match their new
nomenclature

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Slaughter and Laughter Demons have been refactored, please
place an issue report for any unexpected things/hitches.
fix: Laughter Demons should now actually drop a kitten.

[MIRROR] Improves the RPG loot wizard event. [MDB IGNORE] (#22800)

* Improves the RPG loot wizard event. (#77218)

## About The Pull Request
As the title says. Adds a bunch more stat changes to various different
items and a somewhat simple way of modifying them whilst minimizing
side-effects as much as possible.
Added a new negative curse of polymorph suffix that can randomly
polymorph you once you pick up the item.
Curse of hunger items won't start on items that are not on a turf.
Curse of polymorph will only activate when equipped.

Bodyparts, two-handed melees, bags, guns and grenades, to name a few,
have a bunch of type-specific stat changes depending on their quality.

Some items won't gain fantasy suffixes during the RPG loot event, like
stacks, chairs and paper, to make gamifying the stats a bit harder.
I'm sure there'll still be other ways to game the event, but it's not
that big of a deal since these are the easiest ways to game it.
High level items also have a cool unusual effect aura

## Why It's Good For The Game
Makes the RPG item event cooler. Right now, it's a bit lame since
everything only gains force value and wound bonus on attack. This makes
the statistic increases more type-based and make it interesting to use

It's okay for some items to be powerful since this is a wizard event and
a very impactful one too. By making the curse of hunger items not spawn
on people, it'll also make it a less painful event too.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Expanded the RPG loot wizard event by giving various different
items their own statistic boost.

Enemy Balance Pass 1 + Other Enemy Changes

-Health values for SHM enemy spawns have been equalized to roughly all be in the same range (1k-3k mostly, in increments of 500), that way, if these values are still too high they can be reduced by increments of 500
-Some health values for preHM & HM enemies were rounded up or down slightly to be less random
-Soul drop values have been equalized roughly using a basic equation: life / 2 for preHM and HM, and life / 2.5 for SHM - these equations ended up being very close to existing values for most enemies: some enemies thus got an increase, some got a reduction, but the standardization should allow us to monitor the soul economy more easily (vanilla enemies weren't touched however, but should probably be handled differently due to their simplicity, like life / 3 or 4 etc)
-Several enemies soul drops were adjusted differently or untouched based on their rarity, simplicity, or worm-multi-hit nature (worms were life / 2 / 2)
-Many enemies got spawn rate buffs or nerfs based on feedback and a look through their current locations
-Several enemies spawn in new locations
-Basilisk enemies no longer can teleport by default and spawns were reduced slightly
-All Hollow and Lothric enemies finally got damage scaling for HM and SHM, and a visual ring was added for lothric enemies to reveal their proximity debuffs
-The Birds now are a bit more thematically distinct:  On enrage, The Hunter goes invisible, The Rage gains a bit of life, and The Sorrow gains high defense (ice protection)
-Red Knight gained SHM stats
-Fighter AI enemies TP less often when hit
-Added Black Knight event to SHM dungeon
-The old Jungle Wyvern sprite folder was renamed OceanWyvern as a reminder to potentially add a mini-boss event in the Western Ocean

Update tox configuration to use tox >= 4.4.0 (#851)

* Update tox configuration to use tox >= 4.4.0

Tox 4.0.0 was released in December 2022 [1] and was a major rewrite of
the internals of the package that included numerous backwards
incompatible changes [2]. Along with that major rewrite was a long
period of instability in the package with a flurry of 47 releases [3]
since 4.0.0 (which has only been 3-4 months). At the time of the 4.0.0
release we pinned the tox version in CI with #761 to avoid this
instability as our tox configuration was not compatible with tox 4.x.y
and tox was actually not compatible with how we had things configured
more generally. The hope was that tox would stabilize more, fix the
issues that plagued the tox 4 release series and we'd be able to relax
that pin without requiring bumping our minimum tox version to ensure
users could use either the old version or the new version locally.
However, since #761 that hope hasn't been realized the divergence
between tox 3 and tox 4 has only widened and at least personally I'm not
convinced of an improvement in stability to the tox 4 release series.
That being said however, this is becoming a developer pain as by default
when setting up a new build environment pip will install the latest
version of tox and we don't have an effective mechanism to pin the tox
version for users as you need to install tox manually as it's the
primary python development entrypoint we use. The only only avenue to
address this would be documentation updates in the CONTRIBUTING.md file,
which we didn't update at the time in #761 because it was meant to be
a version temporary pin that has turned out to not be so temporary.

Since it's been >3 months since we first pinned the tox version and that
pin was meant to be temporary this commit removes that pin and bumps our
minimum supported tox version to be 4.4.0, which despite not being
compatible with tox < 4 as we originally hoped, at least seems to work
fine with install rustworkx after updating the configuration file. This
should hopefully ease the onboarding experience for developers when
working with rustworkx and trying to bootstrap a local development
environment. Longer term I expect we'll look at moving off of tox,
as it no longer seems like a project we can rely on (especially as
a key component for our development and CI infrastructure) for rustworkx
and instead look at something like `nox` which I've heard good things
about and know that PyO3 had moved to it a year or two ago.

Fixes #812

* Stop using tox for retworkx backwards compat jobs

Tox's isolated builder mechanism seems to be incompatible with our
environment variable based package naming mechanism that we use to build
the legacy retworkx package. This is causing CI to fail on the backwards
compat jobs that are installing retworkx (which depends on rustworkx) to
ensure that our backwards compatibility shim works as expected. Instead
of trying to force tox to do the correct thing, it's just easier to stop
using it for that one CI job and instead just manually install and run
the tests.

Add Pytest and translations_test.py (#309)

Closes https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit_sphinx_theme/issues/305.

## Both Pytest and Jest tests

We now have tests both in Python and JavaScript. That is because this is
a multilingual repository, and we can only test code in the language
it's written in.

The tests are organized into `tests/{js,py}`.

## Changes `tox -e py` and adds `tox -e docs`

Before, `tox -e py` was used to build example_docs. But that is
different than every single Qiskit project, where `tox -e py` normally
runs tests and you use `tox -e docs` to build the docs.

This PR aligns us with the greater Qiskit ecosystem.

## Uses Pytest rather than unittest

Most Qiskit projects use unittest/stestr (a way to parallelize
unittest), although a few have switched to Pytest:

Yeah, there are a few projects using Pytest but indeed most use
unittest/stestr

```
❯ rg pytest -g '*.txt' -l
qiskit-ionq/requirements-test.txt
mthree/requirements-dev.txt
qiskit-qasm3-import/requirements-dev.txt
qiskit-metal/requirements-dev.txt
```

If I remember correctly from when I first joined the project, Jake (or
Matthew) was interested in eventually migrating more of Qiskit to Pytest
and that they don't love stestr/unittest. But it's a bigger migration to
do that

I've found that Pytest in general is more ergonomic & also more flexible
than unittest. For example, it has neat support for parametrization to
make it easy to write several similar tests.

And it's easier for developers to use because you only ever need to use
`assert <some condition>`, rather than figuring out which to use between
`self.assertEqual` vs `self.assertTrue` vs `self.assertContains` etc.
Pytest will make the output of the `assert` useful for you
automatically.

[MIRROR] Base Female sprite tweaks [MDB IGNORE] (#22924)

* Base Female sprite tweaks (#77407)

## About The Pull Request

ASS STUFF HAS BEEN REMOVED BUT I STILL HATE IT

This PR tones down the proportions of the female base sprites, as
currently they have about SIX extra pixels on the ass and a random pixel
missing from the neck, which breaks some hairstyles & makes the neck
look quite stupid.
It also adds a couple pixels to the male one because theirs was so
stupidly SMALL it looked like they had no tailbone (still does, kind
of).

Here is the current sprite

Attachment nerfs and removals (#4122)

# About the pull request

This PR:

Removes the barrel charger from vendors

Removes all benefits other than wield delay mod from the angled grip

Adds wield delay to the extended barrel

# Explain why it's good for the game

Barrel charger is a straight damage increase and rather silly to work
around given how burst works bypassing real fire rate concerns. If you
know, you know. Horrible idea, I am amazed it's been around this long.

Angled grip had zero downside. Now it still has zero downside but isn't
also a ton of accuracy buffs on top of the god-tier lower wield delay.

Extended barrel had zero downside. Now it has a downside.

fix: lru_cache issues + meta info missing  (#72)

Context: https://github.com/codecov/engineering-team/issues/119

So the real issue with the meta info is fixed in codecov/shared#22.
spoiler: reusing the report details cached values and _changing_ them is not a good idea.

However in the process of debuging that @matt-codecov pointed out that we were not using lru_cache correctly.
Check this very well made video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVjtp6tGo0g

So the present changes upgrade shared so we fix the meta info stuff AND address the cache issue.
There are further complications with the caching situation, which explain why I decided to add the cached value in the
`obj` instead of `self`. The thing is that there's only 1 instance of `ArchiveField` shared among ALL instances of
the model class (for example, all `ReportDetail` instances). This kinda makes sense because we only create an instance
of `ArchiveField` in the declaration of the `ReportDetail` class.

Because of that if the cache is in the `self` of `ArchiveField` different instances of `ReportDetails` will have dirty cached value of other `ReportDetails` instances and we get wrong values. To fix that I envision 3 possibilities:
1. Putting the cached value in the `ReportDetails` instance directly (the `obj`), and checking for the presence of that value.
If it's there it's guaranteed that we put it there, and we can update it on writes, so that we can always use it. Because it is
for each `ReportDetails` instance we always get the correct value, and it's cleared when the instance is killed and garbage collected.

2. Storing an entire table of cached values in the `self` (`ArchiveField`) and using the appropriate cache value when possible. The problem here is that we need to manage the cache ourselves (which is not that hard, honestly) and probably set a max value. Then we will populate the cache and over time evict old values. The 2nd problem is that the values themselves might be too big to hold in memory (which can be fixed by setting a very small value in the cache size). There's a fine line there, but it's more work than option 1 anyway.

3. We move the getting and parsing of the value to outside `ArchiveField` (so it's a normal function) and use `lru_cache` in that function. Because the `rehydrate` function takes a reference to `obj` I don't think we should pass that, so the issue here is that we can't cache the rehydrated value, and would have to rehydrate every time (which currently is not expensive at all in any model)

This is an instance cache, so it shouldn't need to be cleaned for the duration of the instance's life
(because it is updates on the SET)

[docs] Expand docs for implementing new backends

Using the current documentation, it can be pretty difficult to learn how
to appropriately implement a new backend for perceval.  Many of the
methods that backends are supposed to implement have no documentation
explaining what the methods are supposed to do, or even how their
arguments are formatted.

Although it is possible to reverse engineer this information from other
backends, this process is time consuming, frustrating, and may deter new
developers from being able to use perceval with their application.

This commit expands documentation relating to implementing new backends
in several ways:

- The class-level documentation for backends has been expanded to list
more of the necessary methods and attributes that backends are
responsible for implementing, and additionally lists a brief summary of
each method.
- Several methods which were previously not listed (_init_client), or listed as
optional (metadata_*) have been listed as mandatory.  As far as I can
tell, there is no way to create a working backend without implementing
these methods, or at least stubbing them.
- Information about class attributes in the class-level documentation
has been replaced with a brief summary and a link, with the full text
being moved to the attribute itself, making the class-level
documentation easier to digest.
- Some of the documentation for class attributes that was sparse or
missing altogether has been added
- All* methods and class attributes that are intended to be implemented
by subclasses of `Backend` have detailed documentation describing
exactly what is expected of the implementor, and giving context for some
of the terms or argument names used where necessary.
- Some references to other methods and class attributes in the docs have
been converted to links, to make navigating the docs easier.

Some important notes:

- The documentation for `has_resuming` has been left blank.  Despite my
efforts, I wasn't able to determine what this was meant to indicate, and
could find no examples of it being used in context with which to
reverse engineer its purpose.  If someone is able to fill me in on what
this method does, I would be happy to add documentation in.
- I haven't been working with perceval very long, and most of the
knowledge I am contributing here is based on experimentation, reverse
engineering, my own experiences working on perceval-osf, and
extrapolating from what documentation existed before hand.  It's very
possible that I've made a mistake in describing some of these methods,
so please review carefully to make sure I am correct.  If I've made any
mistakes, I will be happy to be corrected, and revise my mistake quickly
after.

If you have any other advice, or recommended changes, I would be happy
to hear!

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Angled Lights & Lighting Prototyping Tool  [MDB IGNORE] (#22582)

* [MDB IGNORE] Angled Lights & Lighting Prototyping Tool  (#74365)

## About The Pull Request

Hello friends, I've been on a bit of a lighting kick recently, and I
decided I clearly do not have enough things to work on as it is.
This pr adds angle support to static lights, and a concepting/debug tool
for playing with lights on a map.

Let's start from first principles yeah?

### Why Angled Lights?

Mappers, since they can't actually see a light's effect in editor, tend
to go off gut.
That gut is based more off what "makes sense" then how things actually
work
This means they'll overplace light sources, and also they tend to treat
lights, particularly light "bars" (the bigger ones) as directional.
So you'll have two lights on either sides of a pillar, lights inside a
room with lights outside pointing out, etc.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58055496/228785032-63b86120-ea4c-4e52-b4e8-40a4b61e5bbc.png)

This has annoying side effects. A lot of our map is overlit, to the
point that knocking out a light does.... pretty much nothing.
I find this sad, and would like to work to prevent it. I think dark and
dim, while it does not suit the normal game, is amazing for vibes, and I
want it to be easier to see that.

Angled lights bring how lights work more in line with how mappers expect
lights work, and avoids bleedover into rooms that shouldn't be bled
into, working towards that goal of mine.

### How Angled Lights?

This is more complex then you'd first think so we'll go step by step

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58055496/228786117-d937b408-9bc2-4066-9aee-aae21b047151.png)

Oh before we start, some catchup from the last time I touched lighting
code.
Instead of doing a lighting falloff calculation for each lighting corner
(a block that represents the resolution of our lights) in view we
instead generate cached lightsheets. These precalculate and store all
possible falloffs for x and y distances from a source.

This is very useful for angle work, since it makes it almost totally
free.

Atoms get 2 new values. light_angle and light_dir
Light angle is the angle the light uses, and light_dir is a cardinal
direction it displays in

We take these values, and inside sheetbuilding do some optional angle
work. getting the center angle, the angle of a pair of coords, and then
the delta between them.
This is then multiplied against the standard falloff formula, and job
done.

We do need some extra fenangling to make this all work nicely tho.

We currently use a pixel turf var stored on the light source to do
distance calculations.
This is the turf we pretend the light source is on for visuals, most
often used to make wall lights work nice.
The trouble is it's not very granular, and doesn't always have the
effect you might want.

So, instead of generating and storing a pixel turf to do our distance
calculations against, we store x and y offset variables.
We use them to expand our working range and sheet size to ensure things
visually make sense, and then offset any positions by them.

I've added a way for sources to have opinions on their offsets too, and
am using them for wall lights.
This ensures the angle calculations don't make the wall behind a light
fulldark, which would be silly.

### Debug Tool?

In the interest of helping with that core problem, lights being complex
to display, I've added a prototyping tool to the game.
It's locked behind mapping verbs, and works about like this.

Once the verb is activated, it iterates over all the sources in the
world (except turfs because those are kinda silly), outlining and
"freezing" them, preventing any future changes.
Then, it adds 3 buttons to the owners of a light source.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58055496/228776539-4b1d82af-1244-4ed6-8754-7f07e3e47cda.png)
The first button toggles the light on and off, as desired.
The third allows you to move the source around, with a little targeting
icon replacing your mouse
The second tho, that's more interesting.

The second button opens a debug menu for that light

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58055496/228777811-ae620588-f08a-4b50-93a0-beea593aea77.png)
There's a lot here, let's go through it.

Bit on the left is a list of templates, which allow you to sample
existing light types (No I have no idea why the background is fullwhite,
need to work on that pre merge)
You can choose one by clicking it, and hitting the upload button.

This replaces your existing lighting values with the template's,
alongside replacing its icon and icon state so it looks right.
There are three types as of now, mostly for categorization. Bar, which
are the larger typically stronger lights, Bulb, which are well, bulbs,
and Misc which could be expanded, but currently just contains floor
lights.

Alongside that you can manually edit the power, range, color and angle
of the focused light.
I also have support for changing the direction of the light source,
since anything that uses directional lighting would also tie light dir
to it.
This isn't *always* done tho, so I should maybe find a way to edit light
dir too.

My hope is this tool will allow for better concepting of a room's
lights, and easier changing of individual object's light values to suit
the right visuals.

### Lemon No Why What

Ok so I applied angle lights to bars and bulbs, which means I am
changing the lighting of pretty much every map in the codebase.
I'm gonna uh, go check my work.

Alongside this I intend to give lighting some depth. So if there's room
to make a space warmer, or highlight light colors from other sources, I
will do that.

(Images as examples)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58055496/228786801-111b6493-c040-4199-ab99-ac1c914d034c.png)

I also want to work on that other goal of mine, making breaking lights
matter. So I'll be doing what I can to ensure you only need to break one
light to make a meaningful change in the scene.

This is semi complicated by one light source not ever actually reaching
fullbright on its own, but we do what we must because we can.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58055496/228786483-b7ad6ecd-874f-4d90-b5ca-6ef78cb70d2b.png)

I'm as I hope you know biased towards darker spaces, I think contrast
has vibes.
In particular I do not think strong lights really suit maintenance.

Most of what is used there are bulbs, so I'm planning on replacing most
uses with low power bulbs, to keep light impacts to rooms, alongside
reducing the amount of lights placed in the main tunnels

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58055496/228786594-c6d7610c-611e-478b-bcba-173ebf4c4b12.png)

**If you take issue with this methodology please do so NOW**, I don't
want to have to do another pass over things.
Oh also I'm saving station maps for last since ruins are less likely to
get touched in mapping march and all.

### Misc + Finishing Thoughts

Light templates support mirroring vars off typepaths using a subtype,
which means all the templates added here do not require updating if the
source type changes somehow. I'd like to expand the template list at
some point, perhaps in future.

I've opened this as a draft to make my intentions to make my changes to
lights known, and to serve as motivation for all the map changes I need
to do.

### Farish Future

I'm unhappy with how we currently configure lights. I would like a
system that more directly matches the idea of drawing falloff curves,
along with allowing for different falloffs for different colors,
alongside extending the idea to angle falloff.
This would make out of engine lighting easier, allow for nicer looking
lights (red to pink, blue to purple, etc), and improve accessibility by
artists.

This is slightly far off, because I have other obligations and it's
kinda complicated, but I'd like to mention it cause it's one of my many
pipedreams.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Added angle lighting, applies it to most wall lights!
add: Adds a lighting prototyping tool, mappers go try it out (it's
locked behind the mapping verb)

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Adds the Storage Implanter to the spy kit. (#77452)

## About The Pull Request

Adds the storage implanter to the spy kit to make it decent.

## Why It's Good For The Game
This PR hopes to bring Spy at least a little more in-line with the rest
of the syndie-kit specials, so it doesn’t feel like a complete dud to
get.

Spy absolutely sucks as a syndie-kit and getting it is basically
throwing away 20 TC. Not all of them should be equally powerful but all
of them should be at least more satisfying to get. Spy is so bad that
it’s listed in the official wiki as ‘honestly not that good’. It’s also
_barely_ even above 25 telecrystals as the switchblade is a black market
uplink item, not a syndicate uplink item, and not even that good of an
item at that! And the chameleon kit inside isn’t even a full chameleon
kit! Pitiful. Compare it to stealth right below it which totals to _36_
telecrystals.

Adding a storage implant adds a relatively useful item to the kit that
still fits with the entire theme of ‘stealth and deception’, as you can
be searched without having anything on you. To be stealthy, and deceive
people. Like you should. Given the fact that searches are quite common.
It doesn’t make it TOO overpowered as the rest of the gear is still ‘not
that great’.


## Changelog

:cl:
balance: added the storage implanter to the syndie-kit tactical 'spy'
kit to make it decent.

[MIRROR] Adds Summon Simians & Buffs/QoLs Mutate [MDB IGNORE] (#22970)

* Adds Summon Simians & Buffs/QoLs Mutate (#77196)

## About The Pull Request

Adds Summon Simians, a spell that summons four monkeys or lesser
gorillas, with the amount increasing per upgrade. The monkeys have
various fun gear depending on how lucky you get and how leveled the
spell is. If the spell is maximum level, it only summons normal
gorillas.

Added further support for nonhuman robed casting: Monkeys, cyborgs, and
drones can all now cast robed spells as long as they're wearing a
wizardly hat as well.

Made monkeys able to wield things again.

Wizard Mutate spell works on non-human races. It also gives you
Gigantism now (funny). If the Race can't support tinted bodyparts, your
whole sprite is temporarily turned green.

Made Laser eyes projectiles a subtype of actual lasers, which has
various properties such as on-hit effects and upping the damage to 30.

Improved some monkey AI code.

It's criminal we don't have a monky spell, and this is a really fun spin
on it. Total chaos, but total monky chaos. It's surprisingly strong,
but! it can very well backfire if you stay near the angry monkeys too
long and your protection fades away. Unless you become a monkey
yourself!!

> Wizard Mutate spell works on non-human races.

This spell is great but it's hampered by the mutation's human
requirement, which is reasonable in normal gameplay. Wizards don't need
to care about that, and the human restriction hinders a lot of possible
gimmicks, so off it goes. Also, wizard hulk does't cause chunky fingers
for similar reasons

> Made Laser eyes projectiles a subtype of actual lasers, which has
various properties such as on-hit effects and upping the damage to 30.

Don't really caer about the damage so much, this is more so that it has
effects such as on-hit visuals. Can lower the damage if required, but
honestly anything that competes against troll mjolnir is good.

> Added further support for nonhuman robed casting: Monkeys, cyborgs,

SS13 is known for 'The Dev Team Thinks of Everything' and I believe this
is a sorely lacking part of this or something. It's funny.
I want to see a monkey wizard.

> Made monkeys able to wield things again.

I really don't know why this was a thing and it was breaking my axe and
spear wielding primal monkeys. Like, why?

various fun gear depending on how lucky you get and how leveled the
spell is. If the spell is maximum level, it only summons normal
gorillas.
balance: Wizard Mutate spell works on non-human races. It also gives you
Gigantism now (funny). If the Race can't support tinted bodyparts, your
whole sprite is temporarily turned green.
balance: Made Laser eyes projectiles a subtype of actual lasers, which
has various properties such as on-hit effects and upping the damage to
30.
add: Added further support for nonhuman robed casting: Monkeys, cyborgs,
and drones can all now cast robed spells as long as they're wearing a
wizardly hat as well.
balance: Made monkeys able to wield two-handed things again.

Joy?!!

I don’t know what to say. I am literally living in a nightmare and I think I just ate a friend and former colleague. 

I thought it was fine, but he duped me. Taking foods that I was told may have human in them for his two days away. Fine. 

I eat what the box said was Fiber One. No faces on it (check the Twitter about faces on food). But there’s apparently a name l, Joy, on it. 

These people are fucking sick!

They call their operation to massacre everyone inside Mount Calvary Baptist Church (a predominantly black church) “Frying Chicken” that was on a Sunday morning when they literally invaded. 

They then kept talking about “Grilling Chicken” and I’ve found out that was the funerals. Much slower less popping. 

Who is Joy?

I KNOW SEVERAL JOYS AND I CANT FIND ANYBODY. I only have GitHub.

Dear community,

In the last 2 years, I have had the great pleasure to be part of the community building this amazing open-source tool. I am quite satisfied in feeling that I left a small dent in the overall experience for new users.

Today I see my path take a different course, which I am excited to invest my full energy into. 🚀

I was also very lucky to work on Canonical's distribution - which I leave in the great hands of @knkski  @DomFleischmann and more. 

If you want to stay in touch, please connect via LinkedIn.

I nominate @knkski to take on some of the responsibilities I held, in his own capacity, given his 3 years of dedication to Kubeflow.

With Gratitude,
Rui

Drunk slurring scales based on how drunk you are (#75459) (#460)

The strength of the slurring effect drunkness applies on you now scales
based on how drunk you are.

Being "a little" drunk still changes your saymod, and makes you
occasionally slur your words...

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/51863163/1b21b359-a1f9-428a-8e10-d2028ac59728)

But being "a lot" drunk kicks it up to 11

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/51863163/9d593c80-75ff-4d02-8e7c-e48c738154bb)

Additionally, drunk slurring was separated into "generic slurring" and
"drunk slurring", the former which does not scale but less closely
resembles drunkness. Generic slurring is used in places such as
concussions, so this is an added bonus.

As a result of the split, I had to update mind restoration. Now it heals
all types of slurring, which does include cult slurs.

I, and many other people, always found it very annoying when you became
completely illegible from taking one sip of a drink. This seeks to amend
that by making low levels of drunkness still for the most part be
legible and sane. Average drunkness is roughly the same / equal to the
old slurring effect, while "very drunk" is even more illegible and silly
(which I find funny).

This has the added bonus of separating out "drunk slurring" and "generic
slurring", allowing effects to slur your words without going full ham on
drunkness (burping and "huhh"s).

:cl: Melbert
add: When you are drunk, the strength of your slurring now varies based
on how drunk you are. Being "a little drunk" only rarely slurs your
words, being average drunk is the same as the old effect, while being
very drunk now slurs your words even more.
add: Some non-alcohol sources of slurring, such as concussions, now give
"generic slurring" rather than "drunk slurring", which less resemble
being drunk (ie, no burping).
add: Mind restoration now heals ALL slurring, rather than only drunk
slurring (which includes cult / heretic slurring).

Your parents will let you go to the beach with your friends if you have written 1500 or more
words for your term project. Write a program that asks the user how many words they have
written and then prints out one of the two following messages, based on the resul.
Great, you've done your homework. Enjoy the beach!
Sorry, you must stay home and work on your term paper.

SR PR 22828

I was torn on this being funny but ultimately decided that if you give an inch, some jackass will use it, build a mile-long highway, and make fill it with potholes to be as uncomfortable as possible. I'm not indirectly ranting about anything in particular, hahah. That'd be silly. So yeah this is ported now.

North Star Science Rework And More (#77439)

## About The Pull Request
I fixed a few miscellaneous issues and also redid science (mainly
genetics, cytology, and xenobiology)
This is genetics, it's basically the same but moneky have bananas and I
rotated it so they'll be visible from the front desk.

![geneticsnew](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/73589390/7c10d75b-2a7a-47b2-a6ca-a30354d713c3)

Holy fuck it's Cytology as a proper area. It now has main hall access
and a public access petting zoo. Now you can show off all your new
creatures (it also has some items cytologists generally want)

![cytonew](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/73589390/7d9256c9-b39a-4502-b599-9226a2ca5cd8)

Upstairs is Xenobio, which is now much larger and soulless. Instead of a
normal holding cell there's a prefilled room of oxygen and BZ (the
holding room, why is BZ invisible?)

![xenonew](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/73589390/5dc28dba-a051-4858-a9fc-16d51e987c33)

I also gave Ordnance 5 TTVs, same as other maps.
Also the coroner no longer has an unreachable box of bodybags
Also sec now has 2 secways + 2 keys for their usage
## Why It's Good For The Game
I'm forcing xenobiologists to be closer to a hall so they might actually
interact with people, and giving cytologists a reason to do anything
ever because they have a petting zoo to show their creatures off in. Oh
yeah also cytology gets equipment they should just have (a botany tray,
tools to butcher with, a shitty old laser gun to kill experiments gone
wrong)
Genetics is just better because people from the hall can see the
Geneticists working so they can bug them for stuff.

A few of the fixes are very tiny, like moving a few areas by the service
hall and adding a single pipe to the AI SAT
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: North Star's Cytology and Xenobiology are now significantly more
usable.
add: North Star's Genetics has been tweaked.
fix: The North Star's AI SAT has a working vent and it's service hall
has a working lightswitch

Reagent Description and Abstract Changes (#164)

* Reagent Description and Abstract Changes...
Abstract reagents are no longer detected via a magic list.
Added a description to non-abstract reagents that were missing them.
Adds a unit test to detect non-abstract reagents missing a description.

As a consequence:
Some reagents have disappeared from lists for being abstract.
Instantiating an abstract reagent is illegal and crashes New().

* Minor fixes
It's 3am go fuck yourself.

* Apply suggestions from code review

* Allows access to a new ANSI color

* C&D creates a notice on start for logging purposes

Fix Pack 3: Revenge Of The Fuck (#225)

* Various Jaunt fixes (#70431)

* Jaunt code path reworked so that traits and other effects can be removed consistently regardless of how effect is ended.
Jaunts will more consistently clean themselves up (and unjaunt you) when you lose the spell.
If a shuttle lands on you while you are jaunted it will now kill you instead of crashing and fucking with the shuttle landing process.
Z travelling while inside an object or mob will now relay that direction instead, allowing you to jaunt up and down as well as cardinally.
Mirror walk button updates at correct times.
Blood and Shadow walk buttons have same functionality as Mirror Walk.

* Fixes Soul Scythe being able to get to Centcom by moving down on the bottom Z-level (#71171)

## About The Pull Request

`/obj/item/soulscythe/relaymove()` was using `get_step()` which doesn't
understand our multi-z system and was happily trying to move Z - 1 which
is Centcom. I'm still not really sure I understand why move() allowed
the scythe to just move right through the floor in this case, I think
moving to turfs with `density = 0` is also behaving strangely and just
skipping some checks that should keep it from moving through the floor,
but to be honest I don't fully understand the move chain and just
changing to `get_step_multiz()` at least keeps the scythe from going to
Z-levels it shouldn't.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Whilst it is fun for the scythe to go on an adventure to forbidden
Z-levels, admins probably don't appreciate these adventures so much.
## Changelog
:cl: VexingRaven
fix: Soul Scythes can no longer phase through the floor into Centcom.
/:cl:

* Fixes multi-Z ruins (Ice Moon Mining Site) not spawning (#70097)

* Fixes multi-z ruins not spawning

* I should proably commit said changelog files.

* Proc Ref wrapping

* Update to the correct procs
