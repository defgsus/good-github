Rat RP expansion (#76455)

## About The Pull Request

This fixes a vile and long-standing bug where putting a mouse inside
your hat would not allow the mouse to control your movements, as it
would pop out of the hat whenever it tried to move.
Additionally as a feature this allows a mouse sitting on your head to
convey complicated instructions such as "scream" or "do a flip", via
emoting. Through drift compatibility, the rat's living mech will also
perform this action.

I could have made this into a component but there's no fucking way any
other item is going to have this behaviour, so I didn't.

## Why It's Good For The Game

This feature was already in the game but broken and I want it not to be
broken.
The mouse should be able to control your entire life.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Placing a mouse inside your chef hat will once more allow it to
pilot you around.
add: A player-controlled mouse inside your chef hat can compel you to
perform complex actions, such as flipping and spinning. You will obey
because the mouse knows better than you do.

Chadlyalan/issue22 (#34)

* working animations

we converted this landing widget into a stateless widget because the animated text was freaking out when setState was called. I extracted all of the setState functionality to their individual widgets, and let landing page worry less about them.

Now the animations work just as they used to, AND when the theme get's toggled, they rebuild correctly.

* Update landing.dart

converting to stateless widget

* a light theme

this likely won't be the final light theme scheme but it works for now. I'll continue playing around with some of the colors to see how I feel about them as time goes on.

Also a small grammatical fix to the About me section.

* text colors

these changes will update the text color for the light mode to white. White comes up fairly well on the tealish background, better than the black does at any rate. It's not the best, I'm not convinced this is the final color scheme, but it's a color scheme at least.

* light theme overlap error fix

The colors aren't correct as those changes seem to be local on my PC but this includes the fix to the light theme's overlap issue. It was because I was using material3 on light, which I do like, but there was extra padding in the animated texts that was causing issues.

I also have fixed the appbar's color in this mode, as normal material had a plain white appbar in light mode by default.

I also realized that I didn't need the align widget in the landing page, as the column was already telling it's children where to be placed.

* a light theme that works

maybe not the final product but it is a light theme that doesn't cause sizing issues when turning back and forth from light/dark.
I'm not sold on the orange cards but I kinda like them. I want to do something a little bit different with the project cards if I can think of what to do.

* Update my_theme.dart

* Update my_theme.dart

* redpoint demo video

I cut together a demo video of redpoint finally. It should be working but has not been tested yet.

* project card styling

Especially in the light theme, it felt like the project cards needed a little extra love. I added a color to the entire "card" to give it a little extra feeling on hover.

I haven't decided what I should do for the mobile site to make sure it feels good.

Cassandra support for chat history using CassIO library (#6771)

### Overview

This PR aims at building on #4378, expanding the capabilities and
building on top of the `cassIO` library to interface with the database
(as opposed to using the core drivers directly).

Usage of `cassIO` (a library abstracting Cassandra access for
ML/GenAI-specific purposes) is already established since #6426 was
merged, so no new dependencies are introduced.

In the same spirit, we try to uniform the interface for using Cassandra
instances throughout LangChain: all our appreciation of the work by
@jj701 notwithstanding, who paved the way for this incremental work
(thank you!), we identified a few reasons for changing the way a
`CassandraChatMessageHistory` is instantiated. Advocating a syntax
change is something we don't take lighthearted way, so we add some
explanations about this below.

Additionally, this PR expands on integration testing, enables use of
Cassandra's native Time-to-Live (TTL) features and improves the phrasing
around the notebook example and the short "integrations" documentation
paragraph.

We would kindly request @hwchase to review (since this is an elaboration
and proposed improvement of #4378 who had the same reviewer).

### About the __init__ breaking changes

There are
[many](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/3.28/api/cassandra/cluster/)
options when creating the `Cluster` object, and new ones might be added
at any time. Choosing some of them and exposing them as `__init__`
parameters `CassandraChatMessageHistory` will prove to be insufficient
for at least some users.

On the other hand, working through `kwargs` or adding a long, long list
of arguments to `__init__` is not a desirable option either. For this
reason, (as done in #6426), we propose that whoever instantiates the
Chat Message History class provide a Cassandra `Session` object, ready
to use. This also enables easier injection of mocks and usage of
Cassandra-compatible connections (such as those to the cloud database
DataStax Astra DB, obtained with a different set of init parameters than
`contact_points` and `port`).

We feel that a breaking change might still be acceptable since LangChain
is at `0.*`. However, while maintaining that the approach we propose
will be more flexible in the future, room could be made for a
"compatibility layer" that respects the current init method. Honestly,
we would to that only if there are strong reasons for it, as that would
entail an additional maintenance burden.

### Other changes

We propose to remove the keyspace creation from the class code for two
reasons: first, production Cassandra instances often employ RBAC so that
the database user reading/writing from tables does not necessarily (and
generally shouldn't) have permission to create keyspaces, and second
that programmatic keyspace creation is not a best practice (it should be
done more or less manually, with extra care about schema mismatched
among nodes, etc). Removing this (usually unnecessary) operation from
the `__init__` path would also improve initialization performance
(shorter time).

We suggest, likewise, to remove the `__del__` method (which would close
the database connection), for the following reason: it is the
recommended best practice to create a single Cassandra `Session` object
throughout an application (it is a resource-heavy object capable to
handle concurrency internally), so in case Cassandra is used in other
ways by the app there is the risk of truncating the connection for all
usages when the history instance is destroyed. Moreover, the `Session`
object, in typical applications, is best left to garbage-collect itself
automatically.

As mentioned above, we defer the actual database I/O to the `cassIO`
library, which is designed to encode practices optimized for LLM
applications (among other) without the need to expose LangChain
developers to the internals of CQL (Cassandra Query Language). CassIO is
already employed by the LangChain's Vector Store support for Cassandra.

We added a few more connection options in the companion notebook example
(most notably, Astra DB) to encourage usage by anyone who cannot run
their own Cassandra cluster.

We surface the `ttl_seconds` option for automatic handling of an
expiration time to chat history messages, a likely useful feature given
that very old messages generally may lose their importance.

We elaborated a bit more on the integration testing (Time-to-live,
separation of "session ids", ...).

### Remarks from linter & co.

We reinstated `cassio` as a dependency both in the "optional" group and
in the "integration testing" group of `pyproject.toml`. This might not
be the right thing do to, in which case the author of this PR offer his
apologies (lack of confidence with Poetry - happy to be pointed in the
right direction, though!).

During linter tests, we were hit by some errors which appear unrelated
to the code in the PR. We left them here and report on them here for
awareness:

```
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:137: error: Argument 1 to "insert_many" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[Dict[str, Sequence[object]]]"; expected "Iterable[Union[MongoDBDocumentType, RawBSONDocument]]"  [arg-type]
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:186: error: Argument 1 to "aggregate" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[object]"; expected "Sequence[Mapping[str, Any]]"  [arg-type]

langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:16: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:19: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:20: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:22: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:23: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
```

In the same spirit, we observe that to even get `import langchain` run,
it seems that a `pip install bs4` is missing from the minimal package
installation path.

Thank you!

Fixes some inconsistencies with the chaplain revolver and gets rid of a weird ammo define (#76237)

## About The Pull Request

Firstly, I gave the revolver a new sprite. I mean, this isn't so much of
an improvement as it is a reference I wanted to go with, so if people go
'no not a new sprite' I don't mind reverting.

What's the reference? Check the new name I added as a potential name
roll.

![lucky
38](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/40847847/e11874be-1416-4e21-bda9-4881d49cad1b)

Secondly; I applied to the gun itself revenant bane, the ability to
clear runes, and proper magic immunity as a full null rod would enable.
This last bit was a deliberate design choice, but the divine bow has
full magic protection, so I think this is now more of a consistency
consideration compared to the divine bow.

Thirdly, the revolver is a .38 revolver, HOWEVER, it uses a damage
multiplier to bring it back to the damage it did originally. It also
cannot be reloaded without the prayer action. No cheating. Effectively,
this is the same mechanically as it was before.

It rarely does a funny crit fanfare. This does nothing mechanically, I
just thought it was a funny nod to the sprite's reference (and I guess
another game that the crit fanfare is based on). Borrowed parts of the
code and sprite from this April Fool's pr by Wallemations >
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/74425

## Why It's Good For The Game

I think this might have been a little forgotten since implementation now
that we have another projectile weapon for the chaplain. So I'm brushing
it up a bit.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Makes the chaplain's revolver consistent with its immediate
sibling, the Divine Bow, by giving it similar statistics.
code: Makes the chaplain revolver a .38 but prevents it from being
loaded without using the special prayer action. Also applies a damage
multiplier to keep it at the original 18 force. Mechanically, no
different.
sprite: Gives the chaplain revolver a new sprite.
code: Removes an unnecessary admin log when removing runes.

Wire up results TableView and OMG I hate IB

* Recreate Results storyboard from scratch to get hierarchy right
* OMG I HATE IB.  The cells were not auto-resizing because of an extra
  customClass="ResultsTableViewCell" on the tableViewCellContentView
  I don't know how it got there but wow what a pain.
* For now have to fetchCodedValueMaps so we have format labels.

Eval addition: AI vs Human Text Detector (#1021)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
GPT Model Text Detection

### Eval description

The goal of this evaluation is to test the AI model's ability to
correctly identify whether a given piece of text was generated by a
specific AI model, in this case, the GPT model 'text-davinci-003'. The
model's performance is then measured by its accuracy in making this
determination. The text presented to the AI is diverse and can range
from literary summaries to general discourse, designed to challenge the
AI's understanding and analysis capabilities.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This evaluation serves a critical role in the context of education where
AI technologies are increasingly being used. As AI-generated text
becomes more sophisticated, there's a risk that students might use AI
models to complete assignments, circumventing the learning process. The
ability of an AI to detect whether a piece of text is human-written or
generated by a specific AI model like 'text-davinci-003' is essential to
maintaining academic integrity. This task not only provides a measure of
an AI's discernment capabilities but also has broader implications for
AI ethics and safety.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This evaluation uniquely addresses the intersection of AI and education.
As AI technologies continue to evolve, it is crucial to have mechanisms
in place to detect AI-generated content, particularly in academic
settings where these technologies could be misused. By focusing on the
ability to discern output from a specific AI model, 'text-davinci-003',
this evaluation task pushes AI capabilities while simultaneously
addressing a real and timely issue. It underscores the necessity for AI
to not only be more capable but also more discerning, supporting
academic integrity in the face of rapidly advancing AI technologies.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Evaluates the model's ability to correctly use confusing Korean.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

It is a sentence that is used a lot in everyday life.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

[Eval]Identify Chinese Shi Jing Title (#1245)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Identify Chinese Shi Jing title

### Eval description

Given some content from the "Classic of Poetry" (also known as "Shi
Jing"), return its title.

### What makes this a useful eval?

"The Classic of Poetry" (also known as "Shi Jing") is an important
collection of ancient Chinese literature and the earliest existing
anthology of poetry in China. It is also known as "Three Hundred Poems."
It is considered the foundation of ancient Chinese poetry and
encompasses a wide range of themes, reflecting the social customs,
people's lives, and thoughts during the Western Zhou period (11th
century BC to 6th century BC). Shi Jing consists of 305 poems and is
divided into three sections: Feng (Air), Ya (Elegant), and Song (Odes).
Each poem is composed in the form of verses and stanzas, used to praise,
depict specific events, scenes, or emotions. Currently, Both of GPT-3.5
and GPT-4 models can only give correct titles to only a few of the more
well-known content in Shi Jing, and the rest are returned randomly.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

All contents and titles of this eval are from 诗经析读 published by Zhonghua
Book Company in 2018. All entries are double-checked to make sure they
are correct.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

SMILES to Molecular Formula Conversion

### Eval description

Conversion of SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System)
strings -- a widely used ASCII string notation for molecular structures
-- to the corresponding molecular formula (the types and numbers of
atoms in the molecule).

### What makes this a useful eval?

This conversion is of utility in cheminformatics, the intersection of
chemistry and computer science. It is invaluable in various contexts
such as drug discovery, where large databases of chemicals are often
stored as SMILES strings. Converting these SMILES strings into molecular
formulas can provide a quick understanding of the molecular composition,
without having to decipher the original SMILES string.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

NER for finance

### Eval description

Named entity recognition (NER) over financial documents.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Named entity recognition is used in many fields for document
understanding and extraction. In finance, NER can be particularly tricky
since financial documents often involve complex interactions between
several entities. Enhanced NER capabilities in finance can be very
useful to improve news analysis, risk assessments, and much more. This
PR was partly motivated by [Bloomberg
GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564) and the data comes from a [2015
paper](https://aclanthology.org/U15-1010.pdf).

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

[Eval]Identify the author and title of Chinese modern poem (#1256)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Identify the author and title of Chinese modern poem

### Eval description

Given the famous sentences from Chinese modern poems, return its author
and title.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Modern Chinese poetry, including New poetry (新诗), refers to post Qing
dynasty(1644 to 1912), including the modern vernacular (baihua) style of
poetry increasingly common with the New Culture movements, with the
development of experimental styles such as "free verse" (as opposed to
the traditional Chinese poetry written in Classical Chinese language);
but, also including twentieth and twenty-first century continuations or
revivals of Classical Chinese poetry forms. Currently, Both of GPT-3.5
and GPT-4 models can only give correct author and title to only a few of
the more well-known content in Chinese modern poems, and the rest are
returned randomly.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

All the poems in this eval are random picked from 中国现代诗歌名篇赏 published by
Guangming RiBao Publishing House in 2010, 中国现代诗歌选 published by people's
Literature Publishing House in 2018, and other poets' albums. All the
poems are double-checked against Google search result to make sure we
have put in the right author and title for each poem.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

[Eval] Identify Dhammapada Pali reference (#1261)

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

dhammapada-reference

### Eval description

Given a snippet of a Dhammapada verse in Pali, identify who the Buddha
was referencing in that verse.

### What makes this a useful eval?

> The Dhammapada is a collection of sayings of the Buddha in verse form
and one of the most widely read and best known Buddhist scriptures.
[Dhammapada—Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammapada)

This ancient Buddhist text is not explicit about who the Buddha is
referencing in each of these 423 verses. Yet, behind every verse (and
behind every hidden reference) is a parable--that once understood, adds
much more meaning and clarity to these spoken words. These references
are found in other parts of the Pali Canon, such as the Commentarial
section.

Currently, GPT-3.5 has trouble identifying and referencing Pali verses
from the Dhammapada.


![dhammapada-reference-eval](https://github.com/openai/evals/assets/81899308/6f23420c-e08d-4882-b76c-a9793c18f2fc)

Also, I stumbled upon this issue when personally using ChatGPT-3.5 and
-4 to study the Pali Canon, including the Dhammapada. But I found the
models hallucinating answers, even fabricating verses.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically

particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

All Dhammapada verses in this eval are randomly picked from _A
Comparative Edition of the Dhammapada_ by Ānandajoti Bhikkhu (as sourced
in Wikipedia). I made one spelling update in the verse "sabbattha ve
sappurisā **vajanti**" to "sabbattha ve sappurisā **cajanti**" as I
noticed more sources referenced that spelling instead. All the verses
and references were cross-checked with the sources below to ensure the
correct information is provided.

Here are the sources used:

- [_Comparative Edition of the Dhammapada_ by Ānandajoti
Bhikkhu](https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Buddhist-Texts/C3-Comparative-Dhammapada/index.htm)
- [_Dhammapada (Illustrated)_ by Ven.
Thero](https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/dhammapada-illustrated)

Reader](https://www.digitalpalireader.online/_dprhtml/index.html)
- [_The Dhammapada: Verses and Stories_ by Daw Mya Tin,
M.A.](https://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/)

Larva surge is limited by marines/xenos ratio (#3592)

# About the pull request

Xenos after hijack now get larva based on marines/xenos ratio. Instead
of infinite larva, larva surge will try to increase the initial amount
of xenos on hijack to 50% of marines forces over time (with a minimum of
5 larvas, if xenos already have good numbers).

# Explain why it's good for the game

Initially, if I remember correctly, larva surge was brought into the
game to discourage marines from early meta-evacuations, which is fair.
But consequently, it really hurt the hijack sequence. Even if marines
evac fair and square, larva surge still comes in action and makes
situation for marines even worse, utterly discouraging everything but
either boomrushing the Alamo or holding lifeboats to evac.

This resulted in hijacks being very repetitive and boring. More than
that, larva surge is extremely busted on lowpop due to the fact you can
get around 20 xenos from nothing, making lowpop hijack even less
interesting. So with this change marines will still get punished for
evaccing with good numbers, but won't be penalized as much for honest
evacuations.

So hopefully, we will see more variety of hijacks and more interesting
stories!

P.S. if you have a better formula, let me know.

[Needs TM] The Accelerataning (#1781)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Gone are the days of spam clicking buttons to move faster in a
direction, with this PR, ships now accelerate constantly (as long as you
have fuel and don't touch the throttle) in a direction you set, leading
to a much smoother flight experience. I imagine it's going to be a bit
tougher to thread gaps, but flying a spaceship *is* quite literally
rocket science. So.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29362068/220281305-12f6b796-9d8a-41ce-84a6-236bb03274da.gif)

Also actually makes the minimum and maximum speed work, and adjusts them
to a more tolerable level.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Eliminates the ability to cheese high speeds by spamming the accelerate
button, and also makes the flight experience much more pleasant as you
don't have to spam click to move a decent speed.

[MIRROR] Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited [MDB IGNORE] (#22216)

* Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited (#76492)

## About The Pull Request
This is one of those "can I get away with making a change I want" PRs.

I actually didn't know this had been changed before as it's not exactly
something I mess with often, but I really think it sucks. Plasma stuff
is supposed to ignite and cause fires, not explode (unless in a TTV). I
noticed this when I was poking around and found out that apparently
Disco Inferno just explodes now instead of setting on fire which also
sucks.

I figure there's a few fixes for this problem:

1) Nerf how hard plasma stuff explodes. This is an option, but I kind of
dislike that it does it at all more than anything. The biggest issue is
that just the regular statues explode with 20 LIGHT, which is pretty
fucking massive and basically just delimbs everyone around. I'd have to
nerf it HARD for it to get anywhere near what I think is acceptable.
2) Make a snowflake version of the statue that just ignites on hit with
a torch. I also don't like this because it'll make people think the
regular statues don't explode.
3) This option, which I think is cleaner and just makes sense compared
to the others.

I don't know if @ vincentiusvin still codes, but as far as I can tell
this was their doing, so it's only fair they get to speak up.

Fixes #71894

## Why It's Good For The Game
I don't like it, I think it goes against what we're used to for plasma
stuff (that it starts fires, not makes explosions) and it makes one of
my favorite shuttles boring and stupid. That being said, I'm honestly
not going to fight for this too hard if a lot of people like it, but I
am - as always - open to alternatives.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
del: Plasma objects (statues, toilets, etc.) no longer explode when
ignited. They just release plasma like everything else plasma. (This
doesn't impact injecting plasma into cells or dipping cigars in plasma,
those still explode.)

Near miss study

A basic search idea used on a commissioned django site project. Originally was intended to be its own thing but ended up as a decent idea due to the site's need for mobile friendly features and setups. In my personal experience, this would capture many of the typos I make in my daily life with my phone.

The idea originated from reading descriptions of warship combat in WW1/WW2 which helped inspire the name and function. In testing with the project it is a part of, it has proven fairly reliable, though it is only compliant with english keyboards/input currently

Shuttle events (#76008)

## About The Pull Request


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7501474/a2d83ce8-eba1-42d9-a1f8-9d73f7c40b21

Adds shuttle events! Stuff can now start to happen outside the shuttle,
either benign or spicy (but usually just fun to watch)!
## Why It's Good For The Game

The shuttle escape sequence is an important part of the game, uniting
about every player surviving player. Recently, #71906 has made the
escape sequence more forgiving as well as more interesting by
conditionally doubling the playing field. The area outside the shuttle
is still mostly empty though, except for the few people being spaced,
daredevils and the occasional epic space fight.

This PR adds adds some space events to spice up the outside of the
shuttle! This both gives people something too look at, making the escape
sequence feel less static and more lively, as well as give people a
reason to go outside and get the full experience of ~being decapitated
by a meteor~ swimming with the fishes!

<details>
  <summary>Shuttle Events</summary>

**Friendly carp swarm**
Spawns a group of carp that flies past the shuttle, completely friendly
unless provoked.

**Friendly meteors**
Spawns a lot of strong meteors, but they all miss the shuttle.
Completely safe as long as you don't go EVA

**Maintenance debris**
Picks random stuff from the maintenance spawn pool and throws it at the
shuttle. Completely benign, unless you get hit in the head by a toolbox.
Could get you some cool stuff though!

**Dust storm**
Spawns a bunch of dust meteors. Has a rare chance to hit the shuttle,
doing minimal damage but can damage windows and might need inflight
maintenance

**Alien queen**
One in every 250 escapes. Spawns a player controlled alien queen and a
ripley mech. RIP AND TEAR!! Really not that dangerous when you realize
the entire crew is on the shuttle and the queen is fat as fuck, but can
still be fun to throw people around a bit before being torn to shreds.

**ANGRY CARP**
Once in every 500 escapes. Spawns 12 normal carp and 3 big carps, who
may just decide to go through the shuttle or try and bust through the
window if you look at them wrong. Somewhat dangerous, you could stay
away from the windows and try to hide, or more likely shoot at them and
weld the windows

**Fake TTV**
Lol

**Italian Storm**
Once in every 2000 rounds. Throws pasta, pizza and meatballs at the
shuttle. Definitely not me going off the rails with a testing event

**Player controlled carp trio**
Once in every 100 escapes. Spawns three player controlled carp to harass
the shuttle. May rarely be a magicarp, megacarp or chaos carp. I can't
honestly see them do anything other than be annoying for 3 seconds and
die

There are some other admin only ones: a group of passive carps going
directly through the shuttle and just being little shits, and a magic
carp swarm
</details>

Events are selected seperately, there isn't a crazy weighting system,
each just has a chance to run, and multiple could run at once. They also
don't immediately trigger, so people can get settled a bit, and to make
sure just waiting out the more dangerous ones is still a valid strategy.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Adds shuttle events! If shuttle escapes weren't exciting before
(doubtful), they definitely are now! I'm joking it's mostly an
atmosphere thing.
admin: Adds an admin panel to interact with shuttle events, under the
Events tab: Change Shuttle Events
fix: Objects spawned in hyperspace will properly catch hyperspace drift
/:cl:

There's a few things I'd like to do later (another PR) (honestly anyone
can do them because I suck at follow-ups), because this is too big as
is:
- Hijack triggered shuttle events
- More events (got a lot of cool suggestions, but I'm putting most of
them on hold)
- Maybe stration announcements if some more dangerous ones get added
- Structures appearing next to the escape shuttle???

Converts del logging to proper json, using json objects instead of building a text file (#75636)

## About The Pull Request

It's easier to parse, and makes more sense when you read it. This way
I'll never have to add yet another case to my parser for someone
changing where a space goes or something.

Moves qdel into its own category cause the old name looked ugly (yell if
this is dumb)
Added a bitfield to entries pulled from categories, adds a new flag that
enables pretty printing json lists.


## Why It's Good For The Game

IMPROVES my workflow

## Changelog
:cl:
server: del logging is now done by outputting to a json file again, but
this time we're using ACTUAL json and not just a big text string with
newlines and shit

SPECIES NUKING 2023: Head flags 3 & Knuckles: Fixes some growing pains with head flags  (#76440)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/76422
This was caused by me somehow not using the wrapper there and not
noticing it

Also fixes hair gradients and facial hair gradients. I am pretty sure
they were uhh, being hidden behind the actual hair/facial hair. Oops.

Also also fixes spawning yourself as a human as admin and getting random
hair colors. That was just a failure to update the icon after updating
everything, I think?

Additionally, to totally babyproof all of this, ensures that head_flags
involved stuff gets applied AFTER species by creating a new preference
priority, and uses two separate wrappers to apply gradient style and
color.

Here's this absolute hellspawn to prove that everything works.

gdb/testsuite: add test for core file with a 0 pid

This patch contains a test for this commit:

  commit c820c52a914cc9d7c63cb41ad396f4ddffff2196
  Date:   Fri Aug 6 19:45:58 2010 +0000

              * thread.c (add_thread_silent): Use null_ptid instead of
              minus_one_ptid while getting rid of stale inferior_ptid.

This is another test that has been carried in the Fedora GDB tree for
some time, and I thought that it would be worth merging to master.  I
don't believe there is any test like this currently in the testsuite.

The original issue was reported in this thread:

  https://inbox.sourceware.org/gdb-patches/AANLkTi=zuEDw6qiZ1jRatkdwHO99xF2Qu+WZ7i0EQjef@mail.gmail.com/

The problem was that when GDB was used to open a vmcore (core file)
image generated by the Linux kernel GDB would (sometimes) crash with
an assertion failure:

  thread.c:884: internal-error: switch_to_thread: Assertion `inf != NULL' failed.

To understand what's going on we need some background; a vmcore file
represents each processor core in the same way that a standard
application core file represents threads.  Thus, we might say, a
vmcore file represents cores as threads.

When writing a vmcore file, the kernel will store the pid of the
process currently running on that core as the thread's lwpid.

However, if a core is idle, with no process currently running on it,
then the lwpid for that thread is stored as 0 in the vmcore file.  If
multiple cores are idle then multiple threads will have a lwpid of 0.

Back in 2010, the original issue reported tried to change the kernel's
behaviour in this thread:

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/3/75

This change was rejected by the kernel team, the current
behaviour (lwpid of 0) was considered correct.  I've checked the
source of a recent kernel.  The code mentioned in the lkml.org posting
has moved, it's now in the function crash_save_cpu in the file
kernel/kexec_core.c, but the general behaviour is unchanged, an idle
core will have an lwpid of 0, so I think GDB still needs to be able to
handle this case.

When GDB loads a vmcore file (which is handled just like any other
core file) the sections are processed in core_open to generate the
threads for the core file.  The processing is done by calling
add_to_thread_list, a function which looks for sections named .reg/NN
where NN is the lwpid of the thread, GDB then builds a ptid_t for the
new thread and calls add_thread.

Remember, in our case the lwpid is 0.  Now for the first thread this
is fine, if a little weird, 0 isn't usually a valid lwpid, but that's
OK, GDB creates a thread with lwpid of 0 and carries on.

When we find the next thread (core) with lwpid of 0, we attempt to
create another thread with an lwpid of 0.  This of course clashes with
the previously created thread, they have the same ptid_t, so GDB tries
to delete the first thread.

And it was within this thread delete code that we triggered a bug
which would then cause GDB to assert -- when deleting we tried to
switch to a thread with minus_one_ptid, this resulted in a call to
find_inferior_pid (passing in minus_one_ptid's pid, which is -1), the
find_inferior_pid call fails and returns NULL, which then triggered an
assert in switch_to_thread.

The actual details of the why the assert triggered are really not
important.  What's important (I think) is that a vmcore file might
have this interesting lwpid of 0 characteristic, which isn't something
we see in "normal" application core files, and it is this that I think
we should be testing.

Now, you might be thinking: isn't deleting the first thread the wrong
thing to do?  If the vmcore file has two threads that represent two
cores, and both have an lwpid of 0 (indicating both cores are idle),
then surely GDB should still represent this as two threads?  You're
not wrong.  This was mentioned by Pedro in the original GDB mailing
list thread here:

  https://inbox.sourceware.org/gdb-patches/201008061057.03037.pedro@codesourcery.com/

This is indeed a problem, and this problem is still present in GDB
today.  I plan to try and address this in a later commit, however,
this first commit is about getting a test in place to confirm that GDB
at a minimum doesn't crash when loading such a vmcore file.

And so, finally, what's in this commit?

This commit contains a new test.  The test doesn't actually contain a
vmcore file.  Instead I've created a standard application core file
that contains two threads, and then manually edited the core file to
set the lwpid of each thread to 0.

To further reduce the size of the core file (as it will be stored in
git), I've zeroed all of the LOAD-able segments in the core file.
This test really doesn't care about that part of the core file, we
only really care about loading the register's, this is enough to
confirm that the GDB doesn't crash.

Obviously as the core file is pre-generated, this test is architecture
specific.  There are already a few tests in gdb.arch/ that include
pre-generate core files.  Just as those existing tests do, I've
compressed the core file with bzip2, which reduces it to just 750
bytes.  I have structured the test so that if/when this patch is
merged I can add some additional core files for other architectures,
however, these are not included in this commit.

The test simply expands the core file, and then loads it into GDB.
One interesting thing to note is that GDB reports the core file
loading like this:

  (gdb) core-file ./gdb/testsuite/outputs/gdb.arch/core-file-pid0/core-file-pid0.x86-64.core
  [New process 1]
  [New process 1]
  Failed to read a valid object file image from memory.
  Core was generated by `./segv-mt'.
  Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  The current thread has terminated
  (gdb)

There's two interesting things here: first, the repeated "New process
1" message.  This is caused because linux_core_pid_to_str reports
anything with an lwpid of 0 as a process, rather than an LWP.  And
second, the "The current thread has terminated" message.  This is
because the first thread in the core file is the current thread, but
when GDB loads the second thread (which also has lwpid 0) this causes
the first thread to be deleted, as a result GDB thinks that the
current (first) thread has terminated.

As I said previously, both of these problems are a result of the lwpid
0 aliasing, which is not being fixed in this commit -- this commit is
just confirming that GDB doesn't crash when loading this core file.

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

Reworks Duffel Bags (Zippers) (#76313)

## About The Pull Request

Reworks duffel bags in line with oranges proposed plan.

Basically, instead of just making you slower all the time, they make you
slower while you have them open, but give you the same speed while
they're closed.
As a trade off, opening and closing them takes time, 2.1 seconds
(matches the sound) and 0.5 respectively.

[Adds support for limiting extra storage, uses it to make syndie stuff
cool](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/76313/commits/d0b2bbf937435b36de3ba497c48771f563b76684)

Syndicate bags currently ignore downsides by just ignoring the slowdown,
but that's kinda boring so let's just buff em instead.

They now support holding a limited amount of bulky items (3), filtered
down to things that would otherwise constitute going loud (or otherwise
be useful to carry around as a loudish traitor)

I may have gone a bit overboard on what I whitelisted here, lemme know
yeah?

I also did some fenangling with backpack uses of create_storage, I don't
like this pattern it was a bad idea I think.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I'm unsure if these delays enough, I think any length of time is decent
since it means you need to stop moving and focus on it for a bit.
My hope is this will make them a proper sidegrade, rather then something
that goes unused/acts as newbie bait

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Duffelbags will now only make you slow while they are unzipped.
As a tradeoff, you now need to stand still and zip/unzip them to access
their contents/not move real slow.

Trickwines! Again! (#1914)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Trickwines are a set of new reagents aimed at improving tribal/srm style
ships
The core concept are wines crafted out of mob drops and plants that
provide a buff on drinking and a debuff on throwing with bonus effects
against fauna
To facilitate the transfer of booze to target it also adds breakaway
flasks, 50u glass bottles that shatter violently on contact providing
extra throw force as well as a 25u gulp size which forces the user to
choose between buff or debuff
I plan on adding a fair few more Trickwines and the SRM Barrel Class
Brewer Vessel (SRM could really use one then 1 original ship) in later
prs to build on this concept
This HackMD will provide descriptions for the wines as well as a place
of information for all Trickwine-related content
https://hackmd.io/eUIddN2dS3mpeU1CThFGng

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is

## Why It's Good For The Game
Adds a fun new option for ships that lack proper chemistry and forces

TileTest Part 1: Big Sweeping Changes! (#2054)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->
## !! WARNING !!
This is a multi-parter PR. Due to the fact that tiles here on shiptest
are an unholy amalgam of decals, greyscale sprites and multiple
spread-out files, things are *bound* to look weird. If they do, feel
free to report it and it will be addressed in future PRs.

## About The Pull Request

This PR finally accomplishes the promise I made to @triplezeta a year
ago, creating a unique tileset for the server that people may enjoy!

To put every single microscopic change I have made would take forever,
so I will instead provide a series of screenshots of it in action!

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from

## Why It's Good For The Game
Utilizing an unique, modernized tileset for our server to differentiate
from our competitors is something that has been requested, and I was
more than happy to lend my hand to make it a reality!
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be

## Changelog

:cl: PositiveEntropy
del: Removes several unused floor types, as well as completely
annihilating the "monofloor" and "dirty" floor types, and the "edge"
decal type.
imageadd: Redoes the floors using the TileTest tileset!

I love how vite dev server doesn't complain about this, but vite build says HELL NAH, AIN'T NO FUCKING WAY I COMPILE THIS SHIT.
Anyhow, this is a follow-up on my writeup on the last commit.
I don't love how Kiwi browser suddenly disconnects my dev console/tools from the page, just because of some shitty "battery saving" capabilities of my Android phone.
So, instead I have fallen in love with Chrome DevTools remote debugging (chrome://inspect/#devices and https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging). Very juicy stuff if you ask me.
Chromium Remote Debugging ftw.

[MIRROR] Expanding the Experimental MODsuit Bepis Node with three new modules. [MDB IGNORE] (#21851)

* Expanding the Experimental MODsuit Bepis Node with three new modules. (#75801)

## About The Pull Request
So, I've had this idea to make a contribution to the Bepis feature with
some modsuit stuff. The gimmicky stuff is ok and a good way to even out
the better content since it has game of chance design it has (you can
find those disks in space anyway so...). However, the Experimental
MODsuit node feels very underwhelming right now, compared to how big
that feature is.

This PR adds three MOD modules to the Experimental MODsuit node, plus
two more:
- Magneto Charger: While the Modsuit is activated, each step the user
takes will charge the installed power cell by a tiny bit, enough to
sustain a standard modsuit of generic slow speed with only a few, easy
modules installed. It won't work in zero G, while flying, pulled by
someone else, on a conveyor belt, riding a vehicle or crawling on the
floor, though.
- Recycler: It collects (most) garbage and casings off the ground and
recycles them into material sheets that can be dispensed on an adjacent
location or storage with with Middle Mouse Button. Doesn't clean debris,
and scuffed because most trash doesn't yield material anyway.
- - It also has two subtypes, unbound from the node: one that dispenses
riot foam darts and can be found on the black market, and another that
dispenses the more innocuous foam darts, rarely found in maints.
- Shooting Assistant: A configurable module. On Stormtrooper mode, it
will give the user a faster fire rate (the double tap trait) at the cost
of accuracy. On Sharpshooter mode, it will improve the user accuracy and
make their shots ricochet against walls at least once (if the hit atom
allows that, that is, e.g. lasers don't ricochet against iron walls), at
the cost of movement speed. Both modes also prevent the user from dual
wielding guns.

To make the Stormtrooper mode stackable with the poor aim quirk and
refrain from making a new trait for the sharpshooter mode, the gun
spread code in gun.dm has also received a little refactor and cleanup.
Also, it's been tested.

## Why It's Good For The Game
The Experimental MODsuit node is quite shabby and could use something
extra to make it more appealing to MODsuit enjoyers.

Also doubles down as a small addition to the black market and maint
loot, and code cleanup, since gun code gives off some garbled vibes.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Expanded the Experimental MODsuit Bepis node with three new
modules: Magneto Charger, Recycler and Shooting Assistant.
add: Added a Riot Foam Recycler module to the black market, as well a
more innocuous version as maint loot.
/:cl:

* Expanding the Experimental MODsuit Bepis Node with three new modules.

* update modular, I hate this file btw

Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited (#76492)

## About The Pull Request
This is one of those "can I get away with making a change I want" PRs.

I actually didn't know this had been changed before as it's not exactly
something I mess with often, but I really think it sucks. Plasma stuff
is supposed to ignite and cause fires, not explode (unless in a TTV). I
noticed this when I was poking around and found out that apparently
Disco Inferno just explodes now instead of setting on fire which also
sucks.

I figure there's a few fixes for this problem:

1) Nerf how hard plasma stuff explodes. This is an option, but I kind of
dislike that it does it at all more than anything. The biggest issue is
that just the regular statues explode with 20 LIGHT, which is pretty
fucking massive and basically just delimbs everyone around. I'd have to
nerf it HARD for it to get anywhere near what I think is acceptable.
2) Make a snowflake version of the statue that just ignites on hit with
a torch. I also don't like this because it'll make people think the
regular statues don't explode.
3) This option, which I think is cleaner and just makes sense compared
to the others.

I don't know if @vincentiusvin still codes, but as far as I can tell
this was their doing, so it's only fair they get to speak up.

Fixes #71894

## Why It's Good For The Game
I don't like it, I think it goes against what we're used to for plasma
stuff (that it starts fires, not makes explosions) and it makes one of
my favorite shuttles boring and stupid. That being said, I'm honestly
not going to fight for this too hard if a lot of people like it, but I
am - as always - open to alternatives.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
del: Plasma objects (statues, toilets, etc.) no longer explode when
ignited. They just release plasma like everything else plasma. (This
doesn't impact injecting plasma into cells or dipping cigars in plasma,
those still explode.)

In Desert and Wilderness – Henryk Sienkiewicz

“Do you know, Nell,” said Stas Tarkowski to his friend, a little English girl, “that
yesterday the police came and arrested the wife of Smain, the overseer, and her three
children,—that Fatma who several times called at the office to see your father and mine.”
And little Nell, resembling a beautiful picture, raised her greenish eyes to Stas and asked
with mingled surprise and fright:
“Did they take her to prison?”
“No, but they will not let her go to the Sudân and an official has arrived who will see that
she does not move a step out of Port Said.”
“Why?”
Stas, who was fourteen years old and who loved his eight–year–old companion very
much, but looked upon her as a mere child, said with a conceited air:
“When you reach my age, you will know everything which happens, not only along the
Canal from Port Said to Suez, but in all Egypt. Have you ever heard of the Mahdi?”
“I heard that he is ugly and naughty.”
The boy smiled compassionately.
“I do not know whether he is ugly. The Sudânese claim that he is handsome. But the word
‘naughty’ about a man who has murdered so many people, could be used only by a little
girl, eight years old, in dresses—oh—reaching the knees.”
“Papa told me so and papa knows best.”
“He told you so because otherwise you would not understand. He would not express
himself to me in that way. The Mahdi is worse than a whole shoal of crocodiles. Do you
understand? That is a nice expression for me. ‘Naughty!’ They talk that way to babes.”
But, observing the little girl’s clouded face, he became silent and afterwards said:
“Nell, you know I did not want to cause you any unpleasantness. The time will come
when you will be fourteen. I certainly promise you that.”
“Aha!” she replied with a worried look, “but if before that time the Mahdi should dash
into Port Said and eat me.”
“The Mahdi is not a cannibal, so he does not eat people. He only kills them. He will not
dash into Port Said, but even if he did and wanted to murder you, he would first have to do
with me.”
This declaration with the sniff with which Stas inhaled the air through his nose, did not
bode any good for the Mahdi and considerably quieted Nell as to her own person.
“I know,” she answered, “you would not let him harm me. But why do they not allow
Fatma to leave Port Said?”
“Because Fatma is a cousin of the Mahdi. Her husband, Smain, made an offer to the
Egyptian Government at Cairo to go to the Sudân, where the Mahdi is staying, and secure
the liberty of all Europeans who have fallen into his hands.”
“Then Smain is a good man?”
“Wait! Your papa and my papa, who knew Smain thoroughly, did not have any confidence
in him and warned Nubar Pasha not to trust him. But the Government agreed to send
Smain and Smain remained over half a year with the Mahdi. The prisoners not only did
not return, but news has come from Khartûm that the Mahdists are treating them more and
more cruelly, and that Smain, having taken money from the Government, has become a
traitor. He joined the Mahdi’s army and has been appointed an emir. The people say that in
that terrible battle in which General Hicks fell, Smain commanded the Mahdi’s artillery
and that he probably taught the Mahdists how to handle the cannon, which before that
time they, as savage people, could not do. But now Smain is anxious to get his wife and
children out of Egypt. So when Fatma, who evidently knew in advance what Smain was
going to do, wanted secretly to leave Port Said, the Government arrested her with the
children.”
“But what good are Fatma and her children to the Government?”
“The Government will say to the Mahdi,—‘Give us the prisoners and we will surrender
Fatma’—”
For the time the conversation was interrupted because the attention of Stas was attracted
by birds flying from the direction of Echtum om Farag towards Lake Menzaleh. They flew
quite low and in the clear atmosphere could be plainly seen some pelicans with curved
napes, slowly moving immense wings. Stas at once began to imitate their flight. So with
head upraised, he ran a score of paces along the dyke, waving his outstretched arms.
“Look!” suddenly exclaimed Nell. “Flamingoes are also flying.”
Stas stood still in a moment, as actually behind the pelicans, but somewhat higher, could
be seen, suspended in the sky, two great red and purple flowers, as it were.
“Flamingoes! flamingoes! Before night they return to their haunts on the little islands,” the
boy said. “Oh, if I only had a rifle!”
“Why should you want to shoot at them?”
“Girls don’t understand such things. But let us go farther; we may see more of them.”
Saying this he took the girl’s hand and together they strolled towards the first wharf
beyond Port Said. Dinah, a negress and at one time nurse of little Nell, closely followed
them. They walked on the embankment which separated the waters of Lake Menzaleh
from the Canal, through which at that time a big English steamer, in charge of a pilot,
floated. The night was approaching. The sun still stood quite high but was rolling in the
direction of the lake. The salty waters of the latter began to glitter with gold and throb
with the reflection of peacock feathers. On the Arabian bank as far as the eye could reach,
stretched a tawny, sandy desert—dull, portentous, lifeless. Between the glassy, as if half–
dead, heaven and the immense, wrinkled sands there was not a trace of a living being.
While on the Canal life seethed, boats bustled about, the whistles of steamers resounded,
and above Menzaleh flocks of mews and wild ducks scintillated in the sunlight, yonder, on
the Arabian bank, it appeared as if it were the region of death. Only in proportion as the
sun, descending, became ruddier and ruddier did the sands begin to assume that lily hue
which the heath in Polish forests has in autumn.
The children, walking towards the wharf, saw a few more flamingoes, which pleased their
eyes. After this Dinah announced that Nell must return home. In Egypt, after days which
even in winter are often scorching, very cold nights follow, and as Nell’s health demanded
great care, her father, Mr. Rawlinson, would not allow her to be near the water after
sunset. They, therefore, returned to the city, on the outskirts of which, near the Canal,
stood Mr. Rawlinson’s villa, and by the time the sun plunged into the sea they were in the
house. Soon, the engineer Tarkowski, Stas’ father, who was invited to dinner arrived, and
the whole company, together with a French lady, Nell’s teacher, Madame Olivier, sat at the
table.
Mr. Rawlinson, one of the directors of the Suez Canal Company, and Ladislaus Tarkowski,
senior engineer of the same company, lived for many years upon terms of the closest
intimacy. Both were widowers, but Pani Tarkowski, by birth a French lady, died at the
time Stas came into the world, while Nell’s mother died of consumption in Helwan when
the girl was three years old. Both widowers lived in neighboring houses in Port Said, and
owing to their duties met daily. A common misfortune drew them still closer to each other
and strengthened the ties of friendship previously formed. Mr. Rawlinson loved Stas as his
own son, while Pan Tarkowski would have jumped into fire and water for little Nell. After
finishing their daily work the most agreeable recreation for them was to talk about the
children, their education and future. During such conversations it frequently happened that
Mr. Rawlinson would praise the ability, energy, and bravery of Stas and Pan Tarkowski
would grow enthusiastic over the sweetness and angelic countenance of Nell. And the one
and the other spoke the truth. Stas was a trifle conceited and a trifle boastful, but diligent
in his lessons, and the teachers in the English school in Port Said, which he attended,
credited him with uncommon abilities. As to courage and resourcefulness, he inherited
them from his father, for Pan Tarkowski possessed these qualities in an eminent degree
and in a large measure owed to them his present position.
In the year 1863 he fought for eleven months without cessation. Afterwards, wounded,
taken into captivity, and condemned to Siberia, he escaped from the interior of Russia and
made his way to foreign lands. Before he entered into the insurrection he was a qualified
engineer; nevertheless he devoted a year to the study of hydraulics. Later he secured a
position at the Canal and in the course of a few years, when his expert knowledge, energy,
and industry became known, he assumed the important position of senior engineer.
Stas was born, bred, and reached his fourteenth year in Port Said on the Canal; in
consequence of which the engineers called him the child of the desert. At a later period,
when he was attending school, he sometimes, during the vacation season and holidays,
accompanied his father or Mr. Rawlinson on trips, which their duty required them to make
from Port Said to Suez to inspect the work on the embankment or the dredging of the
channel of the Canal. He knew everybody—the engineers and custom–house officials as
well as the laborers, Arabs and negroes. He bustled about and insinuated himself
everywhere, appearing where least expected; he made long excursions on the
embankment, rowed in a boat over Menzaleh, venturing at times far and wide. He crossed
over to the Arabian bank and mounting the first horse he met, or in the absence of a horse,
a camel, or even a donkey, he would imitate Farys[Footnote: Farys, the hero of Adam
Mickiewicz’s Oriental poem of the same name.—Translator’s note.] on the desert; in a
word, as Pan Tarkowski expressed it, “he was always popping up somewhere,” and every
moment free from his studies he passed on the water.
His father did not oppose this, as he knew that rowing, horseback riding, and continual life
in the fresh air strengthened his health and developed resourcefulness within him. In fact,
Stas was taller and stronger than most boys of his age. It was enough to glance at his eyes
to surmise that in case of any adventure he would sin more from too much audacity than
from timidity. In his fourteenth year, he was one of the best swimmers in Port Said, which
meant not a little, for the Arabs and negroes swim like fishes. Shooting from carbines of a
small caliber, and only with cartridges, for wild ducks and Egyptian geese, he acquired an
unerring eye and steady hand. His dream was to hunt the big animals sometime in Central
Africa. He therefore eagerly listened to the narratives of the Sudânese working on the
Canal, who in their native land had encountered big, thick–skinned, and rapacious beasts.
This also had its advantage, for at the same time he learned their languages. It was not
enough to excavate the Suez Canal; it was necessary also to maintain it, as otherwise the
sands of the deserts, lying on both banks, would fill it up in the course of a year. The grand
work of De Lesseps demands continual labor and vigilance. So, too, at the present day,
powerful machines, under the supervision of skilled engineers, and thousands of laborers
are at work, dredging the channel. At the excavation of the Canal, twenty–five thousand
men labored. To–day, owing to the completion of the work and improved new machinery,
considerably less are required. Nevertheless, the number is great. Among them the natives
of the locality predominate. There is not, however, a lack of Nubians, Sudânese, Somalis,
and various negroes coming from the White and Blue Niles, that is, from the region which
previous to the Mahdi’s insurrection was occupied by the Egyptian Government. Stas
lived with all on intimate terms and having, as is usual with Poles, an extraordinary
aptitude for languages he became, he himself not knowing how and when, acquainted with
many of their dialects. Born in Egypt, he spoke Arabian like an Arab. From the natives of
Zanzibar, many of whom worked as firemen on the steam dredges, he learned Kiswahili, a
language widely prevalent all over Central Africa. He could even converse with the
negroes of the Dinka and Shilluk tribes, residing on the Nile below Fashoda. Besides this,
he spoke fluently English, French, and also Polish, for his father, an ardent patriot, was
greatly concerned that his son should know the language of his forefathers. Stas in reality
regarded this language as the most beautiful in the world and taught it, not without some
success, to little Nell. One thing only he could not accomplish, that she should pronounce
his name Stas, and not “Stes.” Sometimes, on account of this, a misunderstanding arose
between them, which continued until small tears began to glisten in the eyes of the girl.
Then “Stes” would beg her pardon and became angry at himself.
He had, however, an annoying habit of speaking slightingly of her eight years and citing
by way of contrast his own grave age and experience. He contended that a boy who is
finishing his fourteenth year, if he is not fully matured, at least is not a mere child, but on
the contrary, is capable of performing all kinds of heroic deeds, especially if he has Polish
and French blood. He craved most ardently that sometime an opportunity would occur for
such deeds, particularly in defense of Nell. Both invented various dangers and Stas was
compelled to answer her questions as to what he would do if, for instance, a crocodile, ten
yards long, or a scorpion as big as a dog, should crawl through the window of her home.
To both it never occurred for a moment that impending reality would surpass all their
fantastic suppositions.

Change the metadata serialization from cbor to capnproto

Capnproto [1] is a fast data interchange format which uses zero-copy
serialization, meaning there is no encoding/decoding step.

Advantages over cbor:
* it removes the custom fixed-length serialization for the inode vector
* it removes the streaming deserializer hack (used because we leave
  extra bytes on the wire)
* it removes the artificial splitting of the Inode structure (a
  low-level Inode which stores the offset to its additional data and a
  high-level Inode structure which rebuild the data at runtime)
* it removes the custom serialization code used to compute the offsets
  of the data structures on the wire (and also having to deal with the
  specifics of the cbor encoding format)
* the encoding format splits the structures into two sections [2], data
  and pointers, which is similar to our strategy of storing offsets into
  the low-level Inode structure, so we could efficiently store the vector
  of Inodes at the beginning of our metadata file; however, Capnproto
  handles this serialization for us
* the format is not self-describing (it uses a schema language in which
  you must describe your data), so it should takes less space on disk
* it allows schema evolution, which means we can add new fields to our
  schema over time, without breaking backwards-compatibility [3]

Disadvantages:
* while the Capnproto format itself doesn't require encoding/decoding,
  it also doesn't generate Rust structures, which means that every field
  access must be done through getters and setters; to make my life
  easier, I've written from_capnp and to_capnp functions for each
  structure, so I could create a Rust structure from the in-memory Capnp
  serialization format; however, this also means that my implemenentation
  is not zero-copy, since it needs to allocate Rust structures; anyway,
  this implemenentation is similar to what was done with the cbor
  serialization, so it shouldn't be less performant; Kent Overstreet
  also had some suggestions for improvement [4]
* there is no support for specifying required or optional fields in the
  format, so the data validation onus is on the user of the library; on
  the other hand, this could be an advantage because it allows greater
  flexibility (we don't need to wrap the structure into an Option if we
  decide it's not required, e.g. fs verity data)

Other changes:
* BlobRef now always holds a digest, it never refers to an offset in the
  same file

For a Ubuntu 20.04 distribution (single layer puzzlefs image) the amount
of space taken by the metadata is:
Cbor serialization:
puzzlefs manifest: 869K
puzzlefs metadata layer: 4.2M

Capnproto serialization:
puzzlefs manifest: 662K
puzzlefs metadata layer: 3.8M

Remarkup Code-block: parse language specifier in markdown

Summary:
We add support to code blocks with the language expressed as GitLab/GitHub/StackOverflow/...
"flavored markdown".

So we support this syntax: (to avoid confusion see it online on the Diff)

    lang=text
    ```php
    $asd = 1;
    ```

Before this change, this was the only supposed syntax in Remarkup, with an explicit "lang=":

    lang=text
    ```lang=php
    $asd = 1;
    ```

This change introduces a minor risk to eat legitimate Remarkup content, since Remarkup allows
to do a multi-line in this way:

    lang=text
    ```$asd = 1;
    $asd = 2;```

The above example still works, but, there is a chance that hardcore Remarkup people
have a problem when doing a code block to mention programming languages.

In short, this can be problematic since "cpp" will be eaten from this list:

    COUNTEREXAMPLE
    ```cpp
    php
    python
    ```

Using the above example is not socially nice because it is not usable in GitLab, GitHub and Stack Overflow.

If your first line is eaten:

Just *add* a newline on the top to reach a valid raw Markdown list (suggested, valid in Remarkup + Markdown):

    lang=text
    ```
    cpp
    php
    python
    ```

Or, just add "text" to specify that as language (suggested, valid in Remarkup + Markdown):

    lang=text
    ```text
    cpp
    php
    python
    ```

Or, just *remove* a newline from the bottom to reach a valid raw Remarkup list (Remarkup-only):

    lang=text
    ```cpp
    php
    python```

Or, just specify that you are writing in the language "text" (Remarkup-only):

    lang=text
    ```lang=text
    cpp
    php
    python```

To reduce impact and help you, the logic of this strict implementation is:

- must have backticks
- must not have any valid remarkup option, like lang=, counterexample, etc.
- must not have content in the same line of the last backticks
- must have a known language in our proposed subset

If everything is OK, we remove that language from the content since it would be otherwise displayed.

Interestingly, this could improve performance when rendering README files or snippets from external
websites, since - in case - we do not need to guess the language using our deep dark magic.

Closes T15481

Test Plan:
We added some nice unit tests. Ensure that this test passes:

    PhutilRemarkupEngineTestCase::testEngine

Optionally, take vision of these, before and after:

https://we.phorge.it/P16

Change the test plan slightly every time, to make sure it is not in your cache.

Insomnia Cure

"One dragon. Two dragon. Three dragon", — the princess was counting. She had trouble in falling asleep, and she got bored of counting lambs when she was nine.

However, just counting dragons was boring as well, so she entertained herself at best she could. Tonight she imagined that all dragons were here to steal her, and she was fighting them off. Every k-th dragon got punched in the face with a frying pan. Every l-th dragon got his tail shut into the balcony door. Every m-th dragon got his paws trampled with sharp heels. Finally, she threatened every n-th dragon to call her mom, and he withdrew in panic.

Write a program to find how many imaginary dragons suffered moral or physical damage tonight, if the princess counted a total of d dragons?

INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
Input data contains integer numbers k, l, m, n and d, each number in a separate line (1 ≤ k, l, m, n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ d ≤ 105).
The output displays the number of damaged dragons.

Replaces the Reaper Scythe with the Vorpal Scythe (also the Morbid trait) (#75948)

adds the Vorpal Scythe, a special chaplain null rod variant, replacing
the Reaper Scythe, a not so special null rod variant.

When you choose the vorpal scythe, it comes as a shard that you implant
into your arm, similar to a cursed katana.

Once implanted, you can draw it at any time like an arm implant.
However, sheathing it again presents some problems. (Also, implanting
the organ gives you ``TRAIT_MORBID``, which I'll explain in a bit)

The Vorpal Scythe has 10 force, one of the weakest null rod variants for
force that isn't a joke null rod. However, it has exceptional armor pen
and also has 2 tiles of reach. So quite unique.

It also has a special beheading ability when you right-click someone.
This borrows some code from amputation shears, functioning pretty
similarly, except with a few additional ways to speed up the action and
restrictions. (It takes 15 seconds baseline to behead someone standing
and conscious, and speeds up or slows down based on factors such as
incapacitation and whether or not our scythe is already empowered)

When you successfully behead someone with a mind, the vorpal scythe
gains 20 force and can be safely stowed and drawn for 2 minutes.
Performing more death knells like this will reset the timer.

If it has not performed its 'death knell', or you haven't hit a living
mob, then it will cause severe damage to you if you ever try and stow it
(or its forced back into your arm). Just hitting a mob with the scythe
will sate it for 4 minutes. Unless it is a non-player monkey. Horrible
things. Just hitting mobs does not reset the timer on empowerment.

What this means is that the chaplain may be more hesitant to simply draw
their weapon on people. It also means that potentially, the chaplain
will not always have magic immunity, since they may end up stowing the
weapon away and be reluctant to draw it on a whim without either taking
damage for sheathing it without hitting something, or dealing with
having one less hand up until they can.

While empowerment only happens when you behead mobs with a mind,
beheading monkeyhumans and other mindless humans subtypes causes their
heads to become haunted! It's mostly harmless and largely just SpOoKy.
We don't want heads with actual players in them to go floating off to
space. (Does not work on monkey heads for sanity reasons)

When you have the Morbid trait, you think creepy stuff is cool and hate
saving peoples lives. You get a mood boost from graverobbing, autopsies,
dissections, amputations (including beheadings with the scythe and
amputations with the shears) and revival surgery. However, you get a
mood penalty when you tend wounds on the living, as well as a hefty
penalty when you perform CPR or defibrillate someone. I was thinking
Victor Frankenstein when I was choosing which actions had an associated
moodlet, so anything that I might have missed would be appreciated.

You also count as potentially cool with regards to haunted objects.
Ghosts think you're neat. (Revenants probably will still kill you if
they had the chance)

Fixes a good chunk of Vox sprites. Removes environmental regulator (#2092)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may

<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Oh god the pain. Oh god. The unbearable pain. Why.

Adds a ton of unused vox sprites from Drawsstuff.
Cleans up the files for sprites we don't actually have
Ensures they are pathed correctly, with flags set correctly.
I spent five hours on this in one sitting after being upset at shitty
vox mechanics/sprite support again. They're cool and unique and it was
sad.
Removes the Environmental Regulator.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
1. Vox sprites were incomplete. This completes them a little bit more.
2. The environmental regulator isn't fun. This will remove the regulator
and vox needing to use it. It was buggy, poorly made, and just not fun
even when it worked correctly. Vox aren't nearly strong enough to be
constantly crippled.

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be

New planetary exclusive random event/unfavorable situation, Chasmic Earthquake [MDB IGNORE] (#21778)

* New planetary exclusive random event/unfavorable situation, Chasmic Earthquake (#75864)

## About The Pull Request

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/2451bc69-db1e-420d-9a18-2f899ca65427

This introduces a new unfavorable situation (non-antagonist random
events that dynamic triggers under certain circumstances), restricted to
planetary maps (Icebox). An earthquake occurs, felt by everyone on the
map, forming a fault that tears the a hole somewhere on the station.

The fault zone is indicated by shaking tiles, which gives a chance
(about 30 seconds) for you to move your machinery/property/crewmembers
out of the way. If you're on those tiles when the fault forms, get ready
to take a nasty fall.

Anything caught in the fault zone as it collapses inward will be
destroyed, violently, _before_ being dropped down into the z-level
below.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/56916c9f-c8da-4ffb-9d8b-7e940e92bbc2)

These can also happen as a random event, however their rarity is on-par
with that of a meteor storm.

This also adds a helper for finding a midpoint turf between two provided
turfs, thanks to ZephyrTFA.

This idea basically possessed me over the course of a few days, and I
found myself unable to work on anything else until I had it complete.
I'm glad its done.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Gives Icebox its own big "environmental disaster" event. I'm hoping it
isn't received as being too destructive, but mind that this is meant to
be an equal to the dreaded meteor storm.

Also makes it so that unfavorable events aren't a coinflip between a
portal storm/rod on planetary maps.
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
add: Chasmic Earthquake random event, exclusive to Icebox. Tears a huge
chasm in the hull of the station. Watch out for shaking tiles!
sound: Adds sounds for distant rumbling, metal creaking, and rubble
shaking.
imageadd: Achievement icon for getting sucked up in an earthquake chasm.

Added type annotations and use of Path
Replaced some instances of os.path with the Path object from pathlib for
readability. Also added type annotations to MCprepEnv as we're moving
towards that. This also means MCprep will not work at all in Blender
2.7x due to the use of new syntax.

This will be the first in a long process of modernizing MCprep's code
with 2.8 style code. Blender 2.7x users may not be happy, but it's for
the better. If anything, 6 years worth of 2.7x support was a mistake (in
my opinion), as it limited what we could do and opened MCprep to even
more bugs (like in Blender 2.93 with make_annotations, which ironically
now is deprecated).

Holy FUCK temporary commit

Mixed between previous abno based spawning and new subsystem

Cleanup Commit

Removes a lot of previous code and paves the way for the subsystem method.

Major Commit

Apocalypse Bird drops it's loot and only spawns once. It'll not try to happen if there aren't enough birds, and if two are breached before the third arrives it'll take the third breaching to start the event, until the others are suppressed. Birds do not target people and are immortal while moving to the portal. If unable to reach it after 3 minutes they'll be forced in manually.

Tweaked Proc

Redundant Code Removal

Remembered I didn't need this

Enhanced Code

Moved an if-statement to a better place to more adequately solve the issue.

Test Commit

Does this solution work?

Global Abnormality Mob List

Patrol Changes and Bird Grab changes

Gaming Test?

Temp Commit

Second Commit

Another Commit!

Fourth Commit

Subsystem changes. Dead abno cleansing. Lower speak cooldown. Debug text removal.

P-bird fix

Fixes P-bird able to die before reaching the portal

🧨 (revamp) NICE-43 Next RSC, Notion API, & Tailwind [b] [!] (#1621)

# ⚠️ Please Note

This is a bit bigger than I would want, but this is a complete refactor to better utilize a `Notion CMS` within a `Next 13 App` structure taking advantage of `RSC`. And then for good measure started the migration _back_ to `Tailwind` (but now I think `Stitches|Vanilla Extract` are oaky with Next 13).

✨ NICE-43 revamp Next RSC, Notion API, & Tailwind

BREAKING CHANGE: New Notion Implementation through Next 13 RSC (App)

# Complete Refactor for Next RSC

- [x] Redis KV Cache
  - Good for quicker Vercel builds / and reducing Notion random limits
  - Next will still limit due to deduplicated requests
    - Sidenote: Need to get better at _not_ prop-drilling and just calling function again
- [x] Image Component
  - [x] Next Refactor
  - [x] Notion Refactor
- [x] Tailwind
  - [x] Move away from Stitches
  - [x] Temporary move to `@jeromefitz/ds` localized version
  - [x] Radix UI Refactor
  - [x] Use internal Component Library for now
- [x] Notion Refactor

  - [x] Image: Hosted by Notion Expiration Refresh
  - [x] Rely less on custom queries and manipulation, more on out of the box Notion API, React, and Next
    - [x] Move from `nodes` to more straight-forward components
    - [x] Refactor logic for
      - [x] `Column|ColumnList`
      - [x] `ListBulleted|ListItem|ListNumbered`
      - [x] `TextAnnotations`
    - [x] **New**: `Embed|Video`
      - [x] `Embed.Twitter` <= Twitter is self-imploding, so good timing.
      - [x] `Embed.YouTube` <= YouTube is ... no comment.

- [x] Next
  - [ ] `preload` => hold on this for now not working as expected
  - [x] `generateMetadata` => move away from `next-seo` (rip)
    - [ ] Need to re-incorporate `@vercel/og` -- or not temporarily.
  - [x] `generateStaticParams` => hack if `isDev` to stop running all the time :?
  - [x] `not-found` => Instead of customizing every route, use `notFound()`
  - [x] `robots.ts|sitemap.ts` => move away from `next-sitemap` (rip)
- [x] Package Upgrades
  - [x] Basically everything except `plaiceholder|semantic-release|syncpack`
- [x] Other refactors
  - [x] EmojiWrapper
  - [x] Config Packages
    - [x] `./packages/*` – this all needs to be ported to [`@jeromefitz/packages`](https://github.com/JeromeFitz/packages)
      - Was borderline impossible to do these in-tandem (need to get better at `pnpm linking`)
- [x] Fathom advises against custom domains now :/

## Layout

Not to be lost in the backend type stuff but this is a complete rehaul of presentation.

The eventual goal of this `Notion + Next` implementation is you can take the data in any way and display it as you would like. For now though still tightly coupled with a lot of decisions until I can abstract away further. Which -- at teh rate I am going may never happen.

## Notion

Do not "normalize" data from Notion, embrace it.

- This is the CMS why are we going through all the trouble to hack it
- Create new Block Components to match and mimic needs

### Formulas

The "big change" here is utilizing Notion Formulas in the CMS.

#### Slug

Before we had `Slug` now we populated `Slug.Preview` where we are able to have Notion mimic Routes better Server Side than figuring it all out on the fly in `next`.

**Note:** For `Events` we need to manually write the `Slug` for now. The potential clash of having multiple Headline Acts means we could have a url like:

- `../jerome-and,alex-o-jerome`

Which I think _could_ work because we could loop through but also _very_ confusing as a URL to share, haha.

To recap:

- `Slug.Preview` for example will create the matching Next Segment Route
  - Before: `jerome-and` (shows); After: `/shows/jerome-and`
  - Before: `jerome-and` (events); After: `/events/2023/06/16/jerome-and`
  - Before: `homepage` (pages); After: `/`

##### Date

Same here, instead of getting the data from Notion then running through `date-fns`, Notion uses `moment` (I think). So we can do more preparation which makes for a more straight-forward:

```bash
- Date: July 15, 2023 9:00PM
- Date.DayOfMonth: 15
- Date.DayOfMonthOrdinal: 15th
- Date.DayOfWeek: Saturday
- Date.DayOfWeekAbbr: Sat
- Date.DaysUntilEvent: 15
- Date.HoursUntilEvent: 360
- Date.ISO: 2023-07-15T21:00:00-04:00
- Date.Month: 07
- Date.MonthName: July
- Date.MonthNameAbbr: Jul
- Date.Time: 09:00 PM
- Date.Timezone: EDT
- Date.WeekNumber: 28
- Date.Year: 2023
```

## Next

### App

The gains of doing `[[...catchAll]]` for everything at **root** was not worth it. 😅

Especially if we _want_ to be able to change layout, RSC data points and more based on the Segment (Notion Database Type).

So there is some duplication of code throughout but will look into better ways of lifting the "same" stuff.

### Events

Ability to see a range of events depending on Date (say for a week, or a weekend):

- `events/yyyy/mm/dd/to/yyyy/mm/dd`
- `events/2023/06/29/to/2023/07/02`

Props to Katie T. as we came up with this idea in a brainstorm session.

- `events/[from]/to/[to]`
- `events/2023/06/15/to/2023/06/18` (THU-SUN)
- `events/2023/06/29/to/2023/05/01` (Across Months)
- `events/2023/12/28/to/2025/01/07` (Across Years)

Probably need to do something for malformed dates, but I reckon `404` will do that.

Up next would be ideas for `Landing Pages`.

### In-House

`next-seo` and `next-sitemap` will eventually be absorded, or their functionality at least, within `next` itself. This gets the ball rolling on that. They were awesome, and thank you.

Depending on your use case those will still be very valid for use!

## Packages

This just covers the `sites/jeromefitzgerald.com` for now

**Upgrade:**
```bash
@mantine/hooks@6.0.15
@notionhq/client@2.2.6
@radix-ui/...@latest
@upstash/redis@1.22.0
@vercel/og@0.5.8

@types/react@18.2.14
@types/react-dom@18.2.6
@types/uuid@9.0.2
tailwind-merge@1.13.2
```

**Add:**

```bash
