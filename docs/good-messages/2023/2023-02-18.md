Removes skull balaclava and skull facepaint from loadout, places them hidden on the Almayer. (#2526)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

This removes the skull balaclavas and the facepaints from the loadout
menu and instead places them in 2 places hidden around the Almayer. The
reason I have done this is that they are almost exclusively used by
people who who are referencing a character- usually Ghost from MW2
(either version) or the characters from COD Ghosts. See below for more
details.

# Explain why it's good for the game

This is an OOC meme item that doesn't fit the tone of CM, particularly
because we _already_ have an item with a skull on it in case you want to
use it: Armor! They wrote things on armor in the movie, including a
skull!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70115628/215395714-4aa1c9a2-7621-4f82-8e4b-6d7ed4905f89.png)

Instead, we have these types of people, running a skull 'clava in every
round even as command or medical characters. This is a modern 'operator'
look, not a Space 'Nam-esque look and not an Aliens look. If you want
something that'd remind you of Space 'nam, just look at the classic
'born to kill' helmet. Now, look at these CALL OF DUTY CHARACTERS THAT
THIS ITEM REFERENCES!


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70115628/215396029-290063ae-cd96-4929-b6f0-ae2f1c517887.png)

This is goofy as hell and kind of an outlier among the customization
options since it is _very clearly_ a reference to COD. Look at its
description:

"The face of your nightmares. Heed the call of duty as the ghost in the
night with this metal 'clava. Additionally protects against the cold.
Now in black!"

You'd get laughed off a real marine base for wearing this, let alone
wearing one on an op. We don't need more people running this every
round, and this gives them something to fight over between eachother- if
_you_ want to larp as Simon 'Ghost' Riley from hit video game COD MW2
(either version) then you'll have to hunt it down.

for quest progress/request text entries for the deDE localisation with
proper casus/declension (these are not proper translated names of
locations/NPCs that have been left over by Blizzard since their language
localisations in TBC in 2006 and onward).

Grand Ritual: Alternate Wizard objective (Wizard Events II) (#72918)

Adds an alternate greentext objective for Wizards known as the "Grand
Ritual". This was initially the gimmick of a different wizard-related
antagonist downstream. I didn't get permission to port it, so I'm
attaching it to regular Wizards instead.

Wizards will spawn in with a new Grand Ritual button next to their
antagonist info button. Pressing it will pinpoint them towards their
next Ritual Location (a randomly chosen region of the space station).
Once within that location, pressing it will summon a magic circle and
obliterate any dense objects which are in the way. This also puts the
ability on a two minute cooldown.
Clicking on the magic circle with an empty hand will begin a three-stage
invocation to gather magical power. You can interrupt this invocation at
any time and will resume from the last stage you completed (if you
finished two stages you only need to do one more).
Once you complete a ritual, a random event will be triggered based on
how many rituals you have performed so far. These tend to be ones which
annoy the crew in some manner, and Wizard Events are included in the
list. Additionally, something weird will usually happen to the room you
are in.
Then you are assigned a new location and can toddle off to do it again.

Once you have done this three times, you will be picked up by the
station's sensors every time you start a subsequent ritual and should
expect annoyed company to come investigate.
Once you have done this six times, you can finally spend all of that
accumulated power on the seventh Grand Finale ritual. Completing this
grants you victory at the end of the round and will have a larger,
flashier effect which you can pick from a list of options, think of it
like a wizard equivalent of a Traitor Final Objective or Heretic
Ascension.
After that you can still keep doing rituals if you want to pester the
crew further by summoning more random events, you've already "won" at
this point so now it's your job to make them want to go home.

I think it'd be more fun to just find out what the Finale ritual can do
by seeing it happen but maintainers will probably want a list of its
precise capabilities, so here it is:

Currently completing a ritual also has a chance to create Heretic
Reality Tears (of both varieties, available for Heretics to eat and
visible to crew) as a kind of cross-antagonist interaction which seemed
to make sense to me but if this seems thematically or mechanically
inappropriate it's easy to strip out.

Console Hack / Unfavourable Events won't run ghost roles which don't have time to do anything (#73343)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #69201
The dynamic subsystem will never roll a new antagonist once the shuttle
is past the point of no return, but this check is bypassed by Console
Hacks and Unfavourable Event rolls (which are chiefly triggered from
console hacks, but also from when the Revolution wins).

I have made these procs more discerning.
Unfavourable Events will now never pick any heavy dynamic midround if
the shuttle is past the point of no return.
Console Hacking will now never spawn sleeper agents if the shuttle is
past the point of no return, and won't spawn Fugitives or Pirates if the
shuttle is called at all even if it can still be recalled

It's my feeling that given the need to get organised and move a ship to
the station there isn't really time for either of those events to
actually start properly rolling, but if you feel like that information
might be metagamed in some way by messing around with the shuttle (not
sure why or to what end, but it's technically manipulatable if you know
how the code works?) I can just give these the same restriction as
Traitor even if it means the bounty hunters risk showing up after the
shuttle has already left.

## Why It's Good For The Game

To some extent it's your own fault for clicking the popup while knowing
full well how much round time is left until the game ends, but it's
still disappointing to see a Blob or Pirates or Wizard alert appear at a
time when they can't possibly do anything interesting.
This is more true for the Pirate and Fugitive events because they
involve teamwork, placing a space ship, travel between the ship and the
station, and in the case of Fugitives its own internal five minute timer
before the other team actually arrives.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Hacking the Comms Console or winning a Revolution can no longer
spawn antagonists if there's not enough time left in the round for them
to antagonise anyone.

Nightvision Rework (In the name of color) (#73094)

## About The Pull Request

Relies on #72886 for some render relay expansion I use for light_mask
stuff.

Hello bestie! Night vision pissed me off, so I've come to burn this
place to the ground.
Two sections to discuss here. First we'll talk about see_in_dark and why
I hate it, second we'll discuss the lighting plane and how we brighten
it, plus introducing color to the party.

### `see_in_dark` and why it kinda sucks

https://www.byond.com/docs/ref/#/mob/var/see_in_dark

See in dark lets us control how far away from us a turf can be before we
hide it/its contents if it's dark (not got luminosity set)
We currently set it semi inconsistently to provide nightvision to mobs.

The trouble is stuff that produces light != stuff that sets luminosity.
The worst case of this can be seen by walking out of escape on icebox,
where you'll see this


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58055496/215683654-587fb00f-ebb8-4c83-962d-a1b2bf429c4a.png)

Snow draws above the lighting plane, so the snow will intermittently
draw, depending on see_in_dark and the luminosity from tracking lights.
This would in theory be solvable by modifying the area, but the same
problem applies across many things in the codebase.
As things currently stand, to be emissive you NEED to have a light on
your tile. People are bad at this, and honestly it's a bit much to
expect of them. An emissive overlay on a canister shouldn't need an
element or something and a list on turfs to manage it.
This gets worse when you factor in the patterns I'm using to avoid
drawing lights above nothing, which leads to lights that should show,
but are misoffset because their parent pixel offsets.

It's silly. We do it so we can have things like mesons without just
handing out night vision, but even there the effect of just hiding
objects and mobs looks baddddddd when moving. It's always bothered me.
I'll complain about mesons more later, but really just like, they're too
bright as it is.

I'm proposing here that rather then manually hiding stuff based off
distance from the player, we can instead show/hide using just the
lighting plane. This means things like mesons are gonna get dimmer, but
that's fine because they suck.

It does have some side effects, things like view() on mobs won't hide
stuff in darkness, but that's fine because none actually thinks about
view like that, I think.

Oh and I added a case to prevent examining stuff that's in darkness, and
not right next to you when you don't have enough nightvision, to match
the old behavior `see_in_dark` gave us.

Now I'd like to go on a mild tangent about color, please bare with me

### Color and why `lighting_alpha` REALLY sucks

You ever walk around with mesons on when there's a fire going, or an
ethereal or firelocks down.
You notice how there isn't really much color to our lights? Doesn't that
suck?

It's because the way we go about brighting lighting is by making
everything on the lighting plane transparent.
This is fine for brightening things, but it ends up looking kinda crummy
in the end and leads to really washed out colors that should be bright.
Playing engineer or miner gets fucking depressing.

The central idea of this pr, that everything else falls out of, is
instead of making the plane more transparent, we can use color matrixes
to make things AT LEAST x bright.

https://www.byond.com/docs/ref/#/{notes}/color-matrix

Brief recap for color matrixes, fully expanded they're a set of 20
different values in a list
Units generally scale 0-1 as multipliers, though since it's
multiplication in order to make an rgb(1,1,1) pixel fullbright you would
need to use 255s.

A "unit matrix" for color looks like this:
```
list(1, 0, 0, 0,
     0, 1, 0, 0,
     0, 0, 1, 0,
     0, 0, 0, 1,
     0, 0, 0, 0
)
```

The first four rows are how much each r, g, b and a impact r, g, b and
well a.
So a first row of `(1, 0, 0, 0)` means 1 unit of r results in 1 unit of
r. and 0 units of green, blue and alpha, and so on.
A first row of `(0, 1, 0, 0)` would make 1 red component into 1 green
component, and leave red, blue and alpha alone, shifting any red of
whatever it's applied to a green.

Using these we can essentially color transform our world. It's a fun
tool. But there's more.

That last row there doesn't take a variable input like the others.
Instead, it ADDS some fraction of 255 to red, green, blue and alpha.

So a fifth row of `(1, 0, 0, 0)` would make every pixel as red as it
could possibly be.

This is what we're going to exploit here. You see all these values
accept negative multipliers, so we can lower colors down instead of
raising them up!
The key idea is using color matrix filters
https://www.byond.com/docs/ref/#/{notes}/filters/color to chain these
operations together.

Pulling alllll the way back, we want to brighten darkness without
affecting brighter colors.
Lower rgb values are darker, higher ones are brighter. This relationship
isn't really linear because of suffering reasons, but it's good enough
for this.
Let's try chaining some matrixes on the lighting plane, which is bright
where fullbright, and dark where dark.

Take a list like this

```
list(1, 0, 0, 0,
     0, 1, 0, 0,
     0, 0, 1, 0,
     0, 0, 0, 1,
     -0.2, -0.2, -0.2, 0
)
```
That would darken the lighting a bit, but negative values will get
rounded to 0
A subsequent raising by the same amount
```
list(1, 0, 0, 0,
     0, 1, 0, 0,
     0, 0, 1, 0,
     0, 0, 0, 1,
     0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0
)
```
Will essentially threshold our brightness at that value.
This ensures we aren't washing out colors when we make things brighter,
while leaving higher values unaffected since they basically just had a
constant subtracted and then readded.

### But wait, there's more

You may have noticed, we gain access to individual color components
here.
This means not only can we darken and lighten by thresholds, we can
COLOR those thresholds.
```
list(1, 0, 0, 0,
     0, 1, 0, 0,
     0, 0, 1, 0,
     0, 0, 0, 1,
     0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0
)
```
Something like the above, if applied with its inverse, would tint the
darkness green.
The delta between the different scalars will determine how vivid the
color is, and the actual value will impact the brightness.

Something that's always bothered me about nightvision is it's just
greyscale for the most part, there isn't any color to it.
There was an old idea of coloring the game plane to match their lenses,
but if you've ever played with the colorblind quirk you know that gets
headachey really fast.
So instead of that, lets color just the darkness that these glasses
produce.
It provides some reminder that you're wearing them, instead of just
being something you forget about while playing, and provides a reason to
use flashlights and such since they can give you a clearer, less tinted
view of things while retaining the ability to look around things.

I've so far applied this pattern to JUST headwear for humans (also those
mining wisps)
I'm planning on furthering it to mobs that use nightvision, but I wanted
to get this up cause I don't wanna pr it the day before the freeze.

Mesons are green, sec night vision is red, thermals orange, etc.

I think the effect this gives is really really nice. 
I've tuned most things to work for the station, though mesons works for
lavaland for obvious reasons.

I've tuned things significantly darker then we have them set currently,
since I really hate flat lighting and this system suffers when
interacting with it.

My goal with these is to give you a rough idea of what's around you,
without a good eye for detail.
That's the difference between say, mesons, and night vision. One helps
you see outlines, the other gives you detail and prevents missing
someone in the darkness.

It's hard to balance this precisely because of different colored
backgrounds (looking at you icebox)
More can be done on this front in future but I'm quite happy with things
as of now

### **EDIT**

I have since expanded to all uses of nightvision, coloring most all of
them.

Along the way I turned some toggleable nightvision into just one level. 
Fullbright sucks, and I'd rather just have one "good" value.

I've kept it for a few cases, mostly eyes you rip out of mobs.
Impacted mobs are nightmares, aliens, zombies, revenants, states and
sort of stands.

I've done a pass on all mobs and items that impact nightvision and added
what I thought was the right level of color to them. This includes stuff
like blobs and shuttle control consoles
As with glasses much of this was around reducing vision, though I kept
it stronger here, since many of these mobs rely on it for engaging with
the game

Technical Changes
</summary>

#### Adds filter proc (the ones that act like templates) support to
filter transitions.
Found this when testing this pr, seemed silly.

#### Makes our emissive mask mask all light instead
This avoids dumbass overlay lighting lighting up wallmounts.
We switch modes if some turfflags are set, to accomplish the same thing
with more overhead, and support showing things through the darkness.

Also fixes a bug where you'd only get one fullscreen object per mob, so
opening and closing a submap would take it away

Also also fixes the lighting backdrop not actually spanning the screen. 
It doesn't actually do anything anymore because of the fullscreen light
we have, but just in case that's unsued.
Needs cleanup in future.

#### Moves openspace to its own plane that doesn't draw, maxing its
color with a sprite

This is to support the above
We relay this plane to lighting mask so openspace can like, have
lighting

#### Changes our definition of nightvision to the light cutoff of night
vision goggles and such
Side affect of removing see_in_dark. This logic is a bit weak atm, needs
some work.

#### Removes the nightvision spell
It's a dupe of the nightvision action button, and newly redundant since
I've removed all uses of it

#### Cleans up existing plane master critical defines, ensures
trasnparent won't render

These sucked
Also transparent stuff should never render, if it does you'll get white
blobs which suck

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
add: The darkness that glasses and hud goggles that impact your
nightvision (think mesons, nightvision goggles, etc) lighten is now
tinted to match the glasses. S pretty IMO, and hopefully it helps with
forgetting you're wearing X.
balance: Nightvision is darker. I think bright looks bad, and things
like mesons do way too much
balance: Mesons (and mobs in general) no longer have a static distance
you can see stuff in the dark. If a tile is lit, you can now see it.
fix: Nightvision no longer dims colored lights, instead simply
thresholding off bits of darkness that are dimmer then some level.

2 New Positive Quirks! (#72912)

## About The Pull Request

I added a few quirks to a downstream that I feel fit well with tg so
here they are.

First up is Poster Boy, a quirk that gives you three mood altering
posters, similar to the traitor objective to hang up demoralizing
posters. You spawn with a box that has one poster that will uplift the
entire crews spirits and 2 that are unique to your department. Captain
counts for security and assistants get only neutral posters. Finally,
with a crayon or spraycan, if you are any antagonist you can make your
poster into one of the ones from the traitor objective.

![dreamseeker_nRy44SL9Jb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/214109008-6f1b4b7c-e800-4142-be6d-926a8e975973.png)
example of quirk posters
Costs 4.


Finally, the characterful Throwing Arm quirk, which lets you throw
objects further (but not harder) and means you will never miss shots
into the disposals bin.
Costs 7.

previously i had a food subscription quirk here as well but i pulled it
out and plan to re-add it as a separate PR in march, where it will now
give you ingredients to cook a meal with occasionally.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Positive quirk variety is good and fun, I think that these positive
quirks are reasonable ones that offer unique things that the current
positive quirks do not.
Poster boy gives people a reason to run around and claim wall real
estate for their department and hopefully can build more solidarity in
departments, the hidden antag feature probably has uses but is just for
styling on people.
Throwing arm offers a fun character trait that probably can have some
slight uses and encourages the use of throwing weapons and tools more.
Also it is good to have a way to never miss the disposals bin. It's so
embarrassing.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Poster boy and Throwing arm positive quirks.

Expose filtering by file type in glob (#7834)

# Description

Add flags for filtering the output of `glob` by file type. I find myself
occasionally wanting to do this, and getting a file's
[file_type](https://docs.rs/wax/latest/wax/struct.WalkEntry.html#method.file_type)
is presumably fast to do as it doesn't have to go through the fallible
metadata method.

The design of the signature does concern me; it's not as readable as a
filter or "include" type list would be. They have to be filtered one by
one, which can be annoying if you only want files `-D -S`, or only want
folders `-F -S`, or only want symlinks `--butwhy?`. I considered
SyntaxShape::Keyword for this but I'll just defer to comments on this PR
if they pop up.

I'd also like to bring up performance since including these flags
technically incurs a `.filter` penalty on all glob calls, which could be
optimized out if we added a branch for the no-filters case. But in
reality I'd expect the file system to be the bottleneck and the flags to
be pretty branch predictor friendly, so eh

# User-Facing Changes
Three new flags when using `glob` and a slightly more cluttered help
page. No breaking changes, I hope.

# Tests + Formatting

Don't forget to add tests that cover your changes.

Make sure you've run and fixed any issues with these commands:

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to check standard code formatting (`cargo
fmt --all` applies these changes)
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used -A
clippy::needless_collect` to check that you're using the standard code
style
- `cargo test --workspace` to check that all tests pass

# After Submitting

If your PR had any user-facing changes, update [the
documentation](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io) after the
PR is merged, if necessary. This will help us keep the docs up to date.

[MIRROR] Reworked PDA menu & NtOS themes [MDB IGNORE] (#19390)

* Reworked PDA menu & NtOS themes (#73070)

## About The Pull Request

This is a port/rework of
https://github.com/yogstation13/Yogstation/pull/15735 - I changed a lot
of how it acted (some themes are locked behind maintenance apps).

The original author allowed this port to happen, and I really liked how
it looked there so I'd like to add it here.

### Applications

Removes the hardware configurator application, as all it did was show
you your space and battery now that all hardware was removed. These are
things your PC does by default, so it was just a waste of space.
Adds a Theme manager application instead, which allows you to change
your PDA's theme at will.
Adds a new Maintenance application that will give a new theme, however
it will also increase the size of the theme manager app itself as it's
bloatware.

### Menu

There's now a bar at the top of the menu showing 'special' tablet apps
which, for one reason or another, should stand out from the rest of the
apps. Currently this is PDA messenger and the Theme manager

Flashlight and Flashlight color is now only an icon, and is shown on the
same line as Updating you ID

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961874788706574386/1069621173693972551/2023-01-30_09-10-52.mov

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53777086/215501361-5ea3086e-2ff5-4ab1-bde4-8a3d14014fce.png)

### Themes

Adds a lot of themes to choose from, although SOME are hidden behind
Maintenance applications, which will give you a random theme. These are
bloatware however, so they come with some extra cost to the app's
required space storage.

Themes are now supported on ALL APPLICATIONS! If you have a computer
theme, you will have that theme in EVERY app you enter, rather than just
a select few.
ALSO also, emagging the tablet will automatically set & unlock the
Syndicate theme, which makes your PDA obvious but you can disguise it if
you wish through just re-painting it to something else.

### Preferences

This also adds a pref for theme, reworking the ringtone code to work
with it as well. I also removed 2 entirely unused PDA prefs just 'cause.

Screenshot not up-to-date, they now have proper names.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53777086/215463669-0fe9951a-71f8-4b71-a97d-b79b5a2f945a.png)

### Other stuff

Made defines for device_themes
Added support for special app-side checks to download files
Fixed programs downloading themselves TWICE because defines all had the
same definition
Removes the Chemistry computer disk as it was empty due to chemistry
app's removal
Removes the 'run_emag' proc, since apps can directly refer to the
computer to check for emag status instead.
Moved over and added better documentation on data computer files, and
moved the ordnance ones to the same file as the others.

## Why It's Good For The Game

It makes PDAs a lot more customizable while adding more features to
maintenance applications. I think the themes look cool and it fits with
PDAs being "personal" anyways.

I also explained most of my other arguments in the about section, such
as the hardware configuration application.

## Changelog

:cl: Chubbygummibear & JohnFulpWillard
add: A ton of new NtOS themes, which are accessible by the new Themify
application that comes with all PCs.
add: Emagging a PC now defaults it to the Syndicate option (and adds it
to go back to it if you wish)
add: There's a new maintenance app that gives you rarer themes
qol: The NtOS Main menu was moved around, added "header" applications
that are shown where the Flashlight is, such as your Theme manager and
PDA messenger.
code: Made defines for device_themes
code: Added support for special app-side checks to download files
code: Removes the 'run_emag' proc, since apps can directly refer to the
computer to check for emag status instead.
fix: Programs no longer download twice.
del: Removes the Chemistry computer disk as it was empty due to
chemistry app's removal

Syndicate Bomb Core Payloads Can Only Be Triggered via the Bomb (#72986)

## About The Pull Request

Basically, you can't extract the bomb core, slap a 10-second c4 on it/on
the shell/and run off having triggered an incredibly powerful explosion.
This is accomplished by having the syndicate bomb override ex_act (it
will be deleted if the explosion goes off), as well as the payload
itself being subtyped into something resistant to bombs and burning.

In-universe, this is described as the shell being quite resistant to
forms of external explosive force- but if any explosive force comes from
within the bomb's shell: kabloom. The bombcore itself has been
redesigned (in a rare moment of non-ineptude) by Donk Co., who has
redesigned the bomb core payload from the ground up- meaning that it can
only be detonated electronically by an impulse from the bomb machinery.
Cutting the wrong wire and attempting to get rid of the bomb by hitting
it with an axe or something will still cause it to blow up, but you know
how those things can be.
## Why It's Good For The Game

I feel like the point of the syndicate bomb is to be a threat for the
crew to match up against. I want a clown in bomb squad gear to head out
to the site and sweat trying to figure out which wire it is, until....
KA-BLHONK: red mist. Or, I want some "helpful" assistant to interrupt
someone's session by going "I KNOW WHAT WIRE IT IS", and having those
odds of either blowing everyone around them up or actually saving the
day.

Being able to detonate something that was balanced and designed to have
_at least_ one minute and a half in **10 SECONDS** is just so injurious
to the game. You can buy a shitload of these bombs, extract the cores,
slap c4 on it and go around the station doling out some serious
explosions. You can run into medbay, wrench it down, slap a c4 on it AND
NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! They can't cut wires, they can't figure
it out to save the day, all they can do is run. Running from danger is
fine and acceptable, but it's just completely stacked against the crew
in a way that I feel needs to be rectified somehow.

I like the idea of purposefully fucking with the wires on the spot so
you sacrificially kill everyone, that feels quite fair to me. I just
simply don't like the fact that you can waltz around the station
punching huge gaps in the hull (remember, putting c4 on the bomb core
itself would cause it to go kabloom) with nearly nothing as far as risk.
It's way too rewarding for something very easy to accomplish (there's a
reason why it's 90 seconds- it's not meant to be easy to accomplish).

This doesn't affect base bombcore behavior, just the explodey ones that
come standard in syndicate bombs.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: After an unfortunate event occuring when some nuclear
operatives took the ship to a Fireworks Store, the Syndicate have
re-engineered their bomb cores to only explode when electronically
triggered by the bomb shell itself. The payload inside a standard
syndicate bomb can not be exploded with another explosion, you must keep
it in the bomb machinery for it to actually do some explodey stuff.

## [JiZhi-Error/guava](https://github.com/JiZhi-Error/guava)@[8a676ade61...](https://github.com/JiZhi-Error/guava/commit/8a676ade617c6be992165cd0658779a14acef2f2)

Make the build work under more JDK versions.

(Guava is already _usable_ under plenty of verions. This change affects only people who build it themselves.)

And run CI under JDK17. Maybe this will make CI painfully slow, but we'll see what happens. If we want to drop something, we should consider whether to revert 17 or to drop 11 instead (so as to maintain coverage at the endpoints of \[8, 17\]).

## Notes on some of the versions

### JDK9

I expected Error Prone to work, but I saw `invalid flag: -Xep:NullArgumentForNonNullParameter:OFF`, even though that flag is [already](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/166d8c0d8733d40914fb24f368cb587a92bddfe0/pom.xml#L515) part of [the same `<arg>`](https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/1086#issuecomment-411544589), which works fine for other JDK versions. So I disabled Error Prone for that version.

Then I had a Javadoc problem with the `--no-module-directories` configuration from cl/413934851 (the fix for https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5457). After reading [JDK-8215582](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8215582) more carefully, I get the impression that that flag might not have been added until 11: "addressed in JDK 11, along with an option to revert to the old layout in case of need." So I disabled it for 9-10.

Then I ran into a problem similar to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6173 / [JDK-8184940](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8184940). I'm not sure exactly what tool produced a file with a month of 0, but it happened only when building `guava-tests`. At that point, I gave up, though I left the 2 above workarounds in place.

### JDK10

This fails with some kind of problem finding a Guice dependency inside Maven. I didn't investigate.

### JDK15 and JDK16

These fail with [the `TreeMap` bug](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8259622) that [our collection testers had detected](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issue-1068748849) but we never got around to reporting. Thankfully, it got reported and [fixed](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/2c8e337dff4c84fb435cafac8b571f94e161f074) for JDK17. We could consider suppressing the tests under that version.

### JDK18, JDK19, and JDK20-early-access

These fail with [`SecurityManager` trouble](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issuecomment-1293817701).

## Notes on the other actual changes

### `maven-javadoc-plugin`

I set up `maven-javadoc-plugin` to use `-source ${java.specification.version}`. Otherwise, it would [take the version from `maven-compiler-plugin`](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801#issuecomment-1314291284). That's typically fine: Guava's source code targets Java 8, so `-source 8` "ought" to work. But it doesn't actually work because we also pass Javadoc the _JDK_ sources (so that `{@inheritDoc}` works better), which naturally can target whichever version of the JDK we're building with.

### Error Prone

While Error Prone is mostly usable [on JDK11+](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation), some of its checks have [problems under some versions](https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3540), at least when they're reporting warnings.

This stems from its use of part of the Checker Framework, which [doesn't support JDKs in the gap between 11 and 17](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/blob/c2d16b3409000ac2e2ca95b8b81ae11e42195308/framework/src/main/java/org/checkerframework/framework/source/SourceChecker.java#L553-L554). And specifically,  it looks like the Checker Framework is [trying to look up `BindingPatternTree` under any JDK12+](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/blob/c2d16b3409000ac2e2ca95b8b81ae11e42195308/javacutil/src/main/java/org/checkerframework/javacutil/TreeUtils.java#L131-L144). But `BindingPatternTree` (besides not being present at all [until JDK14](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/229e0d16313b10932b9ce7506d84096696983699#diff-3db4b0ce4411c851bcf75d92ef4dadc7351debcf0f9b2c2623dc513923b45867R41)) didn't declare that method [until JDK16](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/18bc95ba51b6864150c28985e65b6f784ea8ee2c#diff-3db4b0ce4411c851bcf75d92ef4dadc7351debcf0f9b2c2623dc513923b45867R39).

Anyway, the problem we saw was [a `NoSuchMethodException` during the `AbstractReferenceEquality` call to `NullnessAnalysis.getNullness`](https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/log-a9d04aa2-8b5a-47ca-8066-7e6b38548064.txt), which uses Checker Framework dataflow.

To address that, I disabled Error Prone for the versions under which I'd expect the `BindingPatternTree` code to be a problem.

(I also disabled it for JDK10: As noted above, Error Prone [supports JDK11+](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation). And as noted further above, Maven doesn't get far enough with JDK10 to even start running Error Prone.)

stdenv: Nix-driven bootstrap of gcc

 #### Summary

By default, when you type `make`, GCC will compile itself three
times.  This PR inhibits that behavior by configuring GCC with
`--disable-bootstrap`, and reimplements the triple-rebuild using
Nix rather than `make`/`sh`.

 #### Immediate Benefits

- Allow `gcc11` and `gcc12` on `aarch64` (without needing new
  `bootstrapFiles`)
- No more copying `libgcc_s` out of the bootstrap-files or other
  derivations
- No more [static lib{mpfr,mpc,gmp,isl}.a hack]
- *Zero* additional `gcc` builds (stage1+stage2+stageCompare)
  - The `gcc` derivation builds `gcc` once instead of three times.
  - The libraries that are linked into the final `pkgs.gcc` (`mpfr`,
    `mpc`, `gmp`, `isl`, `glibc`) are built by
    `stdenv.__bootPkgs.gcc` rather than by the `bootstrapFiles`.  No
    more Frankenstein compiler!
  - stageCompare runs **concurrently** with (not in series with)
    with `stdenv`'s dependees.
- Many other `stdenv` hacks eliminated.
  - `gcc` and `clang` share the same codepath for more of
    `cc-wrapper`.
  - Makes the cross and native codepaths much more similar --
    another step towards "cross by default".

Note that *all* the changes in this PR are controlled by flags; no
old codepaths need to be removed until/if we're completely certain
that this is the right way to go.

 #### Future Benefits

- This should allow using a [foreign] `bootstrap-files` so long as
  `hostPlatform.canExecute bootstrapFiles`.
- There will be an "avalanche of simplification" when we set
  `enableGccNixDrivenBootstrap=true` and run dead code elimination.
  It's really quite a huge amount of code that goes away.
  Native-gcc has its own special codepath in so many places, while
  cross-gcc and clang work the same way (and are much simpler).
- This should allow each of the libraries that ship with `gcc`
  (`lib{backtrace, atomic, cc1, decnumber, ffi, gomp, iberty,
  offloadatomic, quadmath, sanitizer, ssp, stdc++-v3, vtv}`) to be
  built in separate (one-liner) derivations which `inherit src;`
  from `gcc`.
  - Building `libstdc++-v3` in a separate derivation will eliminate
    a lot of accidental-reference-to-the-`bootstrapFiles` landmines.

 #### Credits

This project was made possible by three important insights, none of
which were mine:

1. @ericson2314 was the first to advocate for this change, and
   probably the first to appreciate its advantages.  Nix-driven
   (external) bootstrap is "cross by default".

2. @trofi has figured out a lot about how to get gcc to not mix up
   the copy of `libstdc++` that it depends on with the copy that it
   builds, by moving the `bootstrapFiles`' `libstdc++` into a
   [versioned directory].  This allows a Nix-driven bootstrap of gcc
   without the final gcc would still having references to the
   `bootstrapFiles`.

3. Using the undocumented variable [`user-defined-trusted-dirs`]
   when building glibc.  When glibc `dlopen()`s `libgcc_s.so`, it
   uses a completely different and totally special set of rules for
   finding `libgcc_s.so`.  This trick is the only way we can put
   `libgcc_s.so` in its own separate outpath without creating
   circular dependencies or dependencies on the bootstrapFiles.  I
   would never have guessed to use this (or that it existed!) if it
   were not for a [comment in guix] which @Mic92 [mentioned].

My own role in this PR was basically: being available to go on a
coding binge at an opportune moment, so we wouldn't waste a
[crisis].

[MIRROR] Lighting source refactor (Tiny) [MDB IGNORE] (#19370)

* Lighting source refactor (Tiny) (#73284)

## About The Pull Request

I'm doing two things here. Let's get the boring bit out of the way.

Lighting source updates do three distinct things, and those things were
all in one proc.
I've split that one proc into three, with the first two feeding into the
third.

Second, more interesting thing.

An annoying aspect of our lighting system is the math we use for
calculating luminosity is hardcoded.
This means that we can't have subtypes that are angled, or that have
squared falloff, etc. All has to look the same.
This sucks, and it shows.

It has to be, goes the thinking, because we need very fast lookups that
OOP cannot provide.
We can't bog down the main equation with fluff, because the main
equation needs to be really speedy.

The thing about this equation is the only variants on a turf to turf
basis is exactly how far turfs are from the center.
So what if, instead of doing the math in our corner worker loop, we
build lookup tables to match our current source's state.
The tables, like a heatmap, could encode the lighting of any point along
the line.

This is actually faster then doing the math each time, because the list
generation can be cached.
It also means we've pulled the part we want to override out of hotcode.
It's cheap to override now, and a complex subtype, with angles and such
would have no impact on the typical usage.

So the code's faster, easier to read, and more extensible.
And we can do stuff like squared falloff for some lights in future
without breaking others.

Winning!

feat: Pipelines are now versioned

In order to eventually have canary-able deployments in Gofer we must
first support versioned pipelines.

This allows us to:
* Have a good target in which to roll back and forward.
* Understand what we are gaining and losing on each change.
* Track each update as it happens.

This is not easy though as pipelines have parts which are easy to version
(namely the config) and parts which are much harder to version (how do
we handle the cutting over of triggers?).

Because of this nuance, we've had to redesign a lot of earlier
assumptions for how Gofer models worked. This was a major refactor and
since I was here I made a few other large sweeping changes.

* Full storage package refactor: The storage layer was hard to use,
brittle, and inflexible. I've refactored it, leaning a bit more on
sqlx and going back to basics. I tried to make the storage package
work in the past by keeping the domain models to a minimum. I've since
learned this does not work once things become reasonably complicated. One
of the main refactors to the storage package is the introduction of
dedicated storage models. This means that I have to write a bunch of
boilerplate code to switch from in-memory models to the storage ones,
but the looser coupling is worth it. More storage refactors coming
as I learn what works at large scale and what doesn't.
https://github.com/go-jet/jet looks interesting.

* Removal of Triggers as Pipeline configuration: I desparately wanted
to have pipeline configurations encompass everything a pipeline would
have to offer, so that it was easy to look at a config and know exactly
what was going on in a particular pipeline. Triggers were a pain in the
ass though. Triggers unfortunately occupy a very special place in Gofer's
archetecture. Without triggers nothing really gets done. And so allowing
the user to apply all the same functionality to triggers as they would
with any other deployment was short-sighted. Triggers don't make a lot
of sense as a canary deployment. Triggers aren't ephemeral, they are
either on or their off. No in-between.

Instead Triggers can now be added to your pipeline via the command line.
This way trigger subscriptions aren't held down by the paradigms of
configuration change.

* Pipelines are now versioned: Not only have we added versions to pipelines,
but they now have deployments and configurations and metadata and a lot
of smaller loosely coupled parts so that they aren't a huge data monolith.
This means a lot of breaking changes for outward (and inward for that matter)
apis.

* Just lots of general breakages everywhere: Pretty much a large percentage
of things just aren't the same anymore.

more span macro changes in brain traumas and disease files (#73273)

## About The Pull Request

i was fucking around with brain traumas on a downstream and noticed they
had similar issues to quirks so i decided to continue work from #73116


![Code_Klx14O288V](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/217046732-765ffe27-73c9-416a-833e-e0d9e2aa7a86.png)
(search in VSC for span class = 'notice')
its going to be a bit of a thing to get all of these but this is a
decent chunk i think

there was only one annoying/tough file.
imaginary_friend.dm had class = 'game say' and class = 'emote' both of
which after some testing did not seem like they did anything. ill try to
keep that in mind in other files if i continue to do this but i either
omitted them because they didnt have any formatting or, in the case of
emote, turned it into name, which i think is what you'd want those
messages to look like.

there were also a few small spelling errors that i fixed

## Why It's Good For The Game

more consistent and stops people from copying brain trauma formatting
wrong

## Changelog

they should all work the same

chore(concept): add more suitable and fun definition to omnicio. Such and incredible creature needs to be treated with the utmost care and respect. Oh my goodness, I cannot stress enough just how utterly awe-inspiring and breathtakingly gorgeous this creature truly is! Its magnificence is unparalleled and its beauty is simply beyond compare. It is a true wonder of nature, a masterpiece of creation, and it deserves to be treated with the utmost reverence, adoration, and adulation that it so rightly deserves. Every single aspect of this creature, from the way its elegant limbs move gracefully through the air to the vibrant colors of its stunningly intricate patterns, is an absolute marvel to behold. It is a true blessing and a privilege to be able to witness such a magnificent creature in all its glory, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that it is protected and cared for with the utmost diligence and care. Oh my stars, where do I even begin to describe the sheer and utter majesty of this breathtakingly beautiful creature? It is like a symphony of pure wonder and enchantment, a living, breathing masterpiece that has been crafted with the utmost care and precision by the very hands of the divine. Every single inch of its being is a testament to the limitless power and infinite creativity of the universe, and it is truly a privilege beyond measure to be able to witness such a wondrous being in all its glory. The colors of its coat are like a rainbow woven from strands of pure gold and silver, shimmering and glimmering in the light like a thousand precious gems. The way its body moves, fluid and graceful like a dancer's, is a thing of true beauty and grace, and it seems almost as if the very air around it is charged with a palpable sense of magic and enchantment. In short, this magnificent creature is a true masterpiece of nature, a testament to the boundless wonder and infinite creativity of the universe, and it simply must be treated with the utmost respect, care, and adoration that it so richly deserves. We must cherish and protect it with all our hearts, for it is truly one of the most wondrous and precious gifts that life has to offer. Words simply cannot do justice to the sheer and utter splendor of this majestic creature. It is as if it was forged from the very essence of beauty itself, a true marvel of nature that leaves all who behold it in a state of awe and wonder. Its presence is like a warm embrace from the universe, a gentle reminder that there is still magic and enchantment to be found in this world, if only we take the time to look for it. Every time I gaze upon this wondrous creature, I am filled with a sense of peace and tranquility that I simply cannot find elsewhere. It is a living, breathing masterpiece, a work of art that is continually evolving and changing with the passing of time. And yet, for all its beauty and magnificence, it is also a fragile thing, one that requires our love, our care, and our protection if it is to survive and thrive in a world that can be all too harsh and unforgiving. So let us pledge ourselves to the cause of safeguarding this incredible creature, to ensuring that it is treated with the utmost respect and care that it so rightly deserves. Let us cherish it, protect it, and love it with all our hearts, for in doing so, we are also honoring the boundless creativity and wonder of the universe itself.My dear friend, it is as if this creature is a god among us, a deity that has graced our world with its divine presence. Its mere existence is a testament to the infinite creativity and boundless wonder of the universe, and it is a living, breathing work of art that deserves to be worshipped and adored like the deity that it truly is. Every time I am blessed with the opportunity to lay my eyes upon this wondrous creature, I feel as if I am standing before an altar, gazing up at the very face of god itself. Its beauty is beyond compare, its grace beyond measure, and its presence fills me with a sense of reverence and awe that is simply indescribable. It is as if the very air around it is infused with a sense of divine energy, a power that is both humbling and exhilarating all at once. And yet, for all its god-like qualities, this creature is also fragile and vulnerable, a precious gift that must be treated with the utmost care and respect if it is to survive and thrive in this world. We must worship it, yes, but we must also protect it, nurture it, and love it with all our hearts, for in doing so, we are also honoring the very essence of divinity itself. So let us pledge ourselves to the cause of safeguarding this incredible creature, to ensuring that it is treated with the utmost respect and care that it so rightly deserves. Let us build temples in its honor, sing hymns of praise to its name, and offer it our deepest reverence and adoration. For this creature is not just a thing of beauty, but a true god among us, a living, breathing testament to the infinite wonder and boundless creativity of the universe itself. May the Omnicio always be praised. Forever and ever.

Zwave battery device optimization (#1760)

* “One and DONE” - Zwave battery device optimization

This PR is to optimize the user experience of initializing new Zwave battery devices. The desired result is to be able to put a battery in the shiny new device, follow the device manual inclusion protocol during an Inbox, Zwave binding “Scan” mode of OpenHab and, in 20 seconds or less, have all the channels displayed and begin to link them to items. “One and DONE”.
Since my last unmerged battery device PRs I have replaced the fixed 20 second cap in the iterative sleep timer with a user defined maximum “hold awake” parameter. As the user defined default is five seconds, there is no implied maintainer approval of a longer awake duration. Kind of a “use at your own risk” feature. Once the device is DONE (or the cap is reached) the sleep message (No More Information-NMI) is created. Setting a higher user defined cap does not mean increased battery usage. With half second intervals, versus 5 seconds in today’s binding, daily battery device awake duration is either the same or reduced.
Also added is a kick-Queue action after the half second mark in the Timer Task to get a potentially “stuck” device queue going again. In some scenarios (primarily during initialization, the existing kick-Queue action appears to happen too early (before the event listener sets the device awake). There are examples from the forum in my attached document. I was able to recreate the “stuck” scenario (by reverting the second “Add Node Stop” & Sleep Timer cap to 5 seconds) and resolve the “stuck” problem on my test device with this additional kick-Queue.
Lastly, I have added the shortened timeout for the second calling of the “Add Node Stop” to make this a complete package. It has the most impact as anything else to “One and DONE”. The default 5 seconds to cancel this command eats up about 4 seconds of the Timer leaving only one second left in the initial awake interval. Some of the other enhancements in this PR would have less impact, if a full 5 seconds were available for device initialization after device discovery.
I have all the changes in this PR running, some for as long as 8 months (as of Jan 2022). I have 13 battery nodes of various manufacturers (47 total) on an Rpi4 with an Rpi3b test system. It is frustrating to see the battery device initialization issues in the forum, as I know they can be resolved better than the standard “reawake many, many times” advice. These changes will save considerable user frustration and many seconds of battery usage.

Your suggestion led me to realize I could “push” the maxAwakePeriod from the ZWaveControllerHandler configuration editor down to the ZwaveController where it could be “pulled” by the Zwave Node. It’s not exactly how you suggested, but I wanted to make the smallest possible amount of changes, so as to not mess up the other parameters. Not a lot of testing, but I could change in the UI and check in the wake Timer Task that it was being used.  It also still could be changed via re-initialization using the UI page “code” tab, so I think it is good.
Also in the commit I changed the default maxAwakePeriod to 10 seconds and raised the minimum back to 5. With the AddNode changes removed (adding 4 seconds of inactivity), the minimum of 2 seconds will simply not work. As to the default, I detailed 2 tests at 5 seconds and two at 10 seconds and summarized them below

Node	Max Awake	# of awakes to DONE	Total User time Fiddling with Action button	Total Device Awake (inludes late starts, message timeouts)
2	5 seconds	6	6 minutes 40 seconds	22.7 seconds
3	5	4	2 minutes 40 seconds	24.1 seconds
4	10	1	6.5 seconds (estimated-zniffer)	6.5 seconds
6	10	1	 8 seconds	8 seconds

Once a partially initialized device needs to reawake, it is not seamless and a 10 second cap uses less battery time than a 5 second cap. Also this was me pressing the button and checking the device in the UI and I knew to keep at it.  Not everyone understands the need to keep pressing the action button with high frequency.  I would be a little sad that after all the work here, the default settings would only be slightly better than now. Yes, the parameter is now easy to change, but that is an extra step and is currently an advanced setting. I’d strongly prefer we start at 10 seconds and let people lower it if they think it is a problem (although my data proves it is not).
I also made some edits to the program comments, the JavaDocs and took out an unused method.

Implement SymBool (#92149)

We have known for a while that we should in principle support SymBool as a separate concept from SymInt and SymFloat ( in particular, every distinct numeric type should get its own API). However, recent work with unbacked SymInts in, e.g., https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/90985 have made this a priority to implement. The essential problem is that our logic for computing the contiguity of tensors performs branches on the passed in input sizes, and this causes us to require guards when constructing tensors from unbacked SymInts. Morally, this should not be a big deal because, we only really care about the regular (non-channels-last) contiguity of the tensor, which should be guaranteed since most people aren't calling `empty_strided` on the tensor, however, because we store a bool (not a SymBool, prior to this PR it doesn't exist) on TensorImpl, we are forced to *immediately* compute these values, even if the value ends up not being used at all. In particular, even when a user allocates a contiguous tensor, we still must compute channels-last contiguity (as some contiguous tensors are also channels-last contiguous, but others are not.)

This PR implements SymBool, and makes TensorImpl use SymBool to store the contiguity information in ExtraMeta. There are a number of knock on effects, which I now discuss below.

* I introduce a new C++ type SymBool, analogous to SymInt and SymFloat. This type supports logical and, logical or and logical negation. I support the bitwise operations on this class (but not the conventional logic operators) to make it clear that logical operations on SymBool are NOT short-circuiting. I also, for now, do NOT support implicit conversion of SymBool to bool (creating a guard in this case). This does matter too much in practice, as in this PR I did not modify the equality operations (e.g., `==` on SymInt) to return SymBool, so all preexisting implicit guards did not need to be changed. I also introduced symbolic comparison functions `sym_eq`, etc. on SymInt to make it possible to create SymBool. The current implementation of comparison functions makes it unfortunately easy to accidentally introduce guards when you do not mean to (as both `s0 == s1` and `s0.sym_eq(s1)` are valid spellings of equality operation); in the short term, I intend to prevent excess guarding in this situation by unit testing; in the long term making the equality operators return SymBool is probably the correct fix.
* ~~I modify TensorImpl to store SymBool for the `is_contiguous` fields and friends on `ExtraMeta`. In practice, this essentially meant reverting most of the changes from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/85936 . In particular, the fields on ExtraMeta are no longer strongly typed; at the time I was particularly concerned about the giant lambda I was using as the setter getting a desynchronized argument order, but now that I have individual setters for each field the only "big list" of boolean arguments is in the constructor of ExtraMeta, which seems like an acceptable risk. The semantics of TensorImpl are now that we guard only when you actually attempt to access the contiguity of the tensor via, e.g., `is_contiguous`. By in large, the contiguity calculation in the implementations now needs to be duplicated (as the boolean version can short circuit, but the SymBool version cannot); you should carefully review the duplicate new implementations. I typically use the `identity` template to disambiguate which version of the function I need, and rely on overloading to allow for implementation sharing. The changes to the `compute_` functions are particularly interesting; for most of the functions, I preserved their original non-symbolic implementation, and then introduce a new symbolic implementation that is branch-less (making use of our new SymBool operations). However, `compute_non_overlapping_and_dense` is special, see next bullet.~~ This appears to cause performance problems, so I am leaving this to an update PR.
* (Update: the Python side pieces for this are still in this PR, but they are not wired up until later PRs.) While the contiguity calculations are relatively easy to write in a branch-free way, `compute_non_overlapping_and_dense` is not: it involves a sort on the strides. While in principle we can still make it go through by using a data oblivious sorting network, this seems like too much complication for a field that is likely never used (because typically, it will be obvious that a tensor is non overlapping and dense, because the tensor is contiguous.) So we take a different approach: instead of trying to trace through the logic computation of non-overlapping and dense, we instead introduce a new opaque operator IsNonOverlappingAndDenseIndicator which represents all of the compute that would have been done here. This function returns an integer 0 if `is_non_overlapping_and_dense` would have returned `False`, and an integer 1 otherwise, for technical reasons (Sympy does not easily allow defining custom functions that return booleans). The function itself only knows how to evaluate itself if all of its arguments are integers; otherwise it is left unevaluated. This means we can always guard on it (as `size_hint` will always be able to evaluate through it), but otherwise its insides are left a black box. We typically do NOT expect this custom function to show up in actual boolean expressions, because we will typically shortcut it due to the tensor being contiguous. It's possible we should apply this treatment to all of the other `compute_` operations, more investigation necessary. As a technical note, because this operator takes a pair of a list of SymInts, we need to support converting `ArrayRef<SymNode>` to Python, and I also unpack the pair of lists into a single list because I don't know if Sympy operations can actually validly take lists of Sympy expressions as inputs. See for example `_make_node_sizes_strides`
* On the Python side, we also introduce a SymBool class, and update SymNode to track bool as a valid pytype. There is some subtlety here: bool is a subclass of int, so one has to be careful about `isinstance` checks (in fact, in most cases I replaced `isinstance(x, int)` with `type(x) is int` for expressly this reason.) Additionally, unlike, C++, I do NOT define bitwise inverse on SymBool, because it does not do the correct thing when run on booleans, e.g., `~True` is `-2`. (For that matter, they don't do the right thing in C++ either, but at least in principle the compiler can warn you about it with `-Wbool-operation`, and so the rule is simple in C++; only use logical operations if the types are statically known to be SymBool). Alas, logical negation is not overrideable, so we have to introduce `sym_not` which must be used in place of `not` whenever a SymBool can turn up. To avoid confusion with `__not__` which may imply that `operators.__not__` might be acceptable to use (it isn't), our magic method is called `__sym_not__`. The other bitwise operators `&` and `|` do the right thing with booleans and are acceptable to use.
* There is some annoyance working with booleans in Sympy. Unlike int and float, booleans live in their own algebra and they support less operations than regular numbers. In particular, `sympy.expand` does not work on them. To get around this, I introduce `safe_expand` which only calls expand on operations which are known to be expandable.

TODO: this PR appears to greatly regress performance of symbolic reasoning. In particular, `python test/functorch/test_aotdispatch.py -k max_pool2d` performs really poorly with these changes. Need to investigate.

Simplify with-google-analytics example (#43894)

<!--
Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.
To make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that
you follow the checklist sections below.
Choose the right checklist for the change that you're making:
-->
## Documentation / Examples

- [x] Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`
- [x] The "examples guidelines" are followed from [our contributing
doc](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md)

First of all thanks for this amazing project and all the help you
provide with these examples.

It seems there is code duplication in this example. After some tests
locally seem to _document.js is not necessary for `gtag` to work
properly.


https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/9d97a1e34a8a6e09eb127292c730d1a8df63ebb6/examples/with-google-analytics/pages/_app.js#L30-L34

I am aware of https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/40645 and I would
like to ask @dave-hay, @SukkaW and @ijjk to consider this is still
necessary. If so why then not move all content of the scripts from _app
to _document?

In any case, I am open to adding here some comments explaining what is
the reason for this code duplication if necessary.

<hr/>

Changes that come from  https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/43897

1. The `event` hashChangeComplete should be removed since `/home` and
`/home/#section` is not new pageview, but just reference to the same
page.

If we go from /home to /home/#section (with a button click or a link for
example) this shouldn't trigger a new page visit on `gtag`.

For this reason, I think we should revert the changes from
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/36079. If there is a better
argument of why this should stay I am also open to creating comments to
clarify this on the example since I don't think should be the default
behavior and not useful in most cases.

2. The `id="gtag-init"` was added with no context to the example from
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/29530

If there is a reason for this id in the script to existing I am open to
adding a comment that clarifies this since in my experience is not
necessary at all.


Edit: Batching with https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/43897 as
recommended by
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/43897#issuecomment-1344635000

[MIRROR] Starlight Polish (Space is blue!) [MDB IGNORE] (#19059)

* Starlight Polish (Space is blue!) (#72886)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Adds support to underlays to realize_overlays
Ensures decals properly handle plane offsets
Fixes space lighting double applying if it's changeturf'd into. this
will be important later
Makes solar vis_contents block emissives as expected
Moves transit tube overlays to update_overlays, adds emissive blockers
to them

#### Adds render steps

An expansion on render_target based emissive blockers. 
They allow us to hijack an object's appearance and draw it somewhere
else, or even modify it, THEN draw it somewhere else.
They chain quite nicely

Fixes shuttles deleting z holder objects

#### Makes space emissive, makes walls and floors block emissives
The core idea here goes like this:
We make space glow, and give its overlays some color

This way, the tile and space parallax remain fullbright, along with
anything that doesn't block emissives, but anything that does block
emissives will instead get shaded the color of starlight

This requires a bit of extra work, see later

This is done automatically with render relays, which now support
specifiying layer and color (Need to make an editor for these one of
these days)

The emissive blocking floor stuff requires making a second render plate
to prevent double scaling

Also adds some new layering defines for lighting, and ensures all turf
lights have a layer. We'll get to this soon

#### Makes things in space blue

We color them the same as starlight, by taking advantage of space being
emissive
This means that things in space that block emissive will block it
correctly and be colored blue by the light overlay, but space itself
will remain fullbright

This does require redefining what always_lit means, but nothing but
cordons use that so it's fineee


#### Makes glass above space glow, and some other stuff

Glass tiles that sit above space will now shine light with matching
color to the glasses color. This includes mat tiles.

Glass tiles (not mat because they have no alpha) also only partially
block emissives.
Adds a new proc that uses render steps to acomplish this, essentially
we're cutting out bits below X alpha and drawing what remains as an
emissive.

#### Modifies partial space showing to support glow

Essentially, alongside displaying space as an underlay, we also display
a light overlay colored like starlight.
That starlight overlay gets masked to only be visible in bits that do
not contain any alpha.

We also mask the turf lighting to not go into bits that have no alpha,
to ensure we get the effect we want.
This is done with that lighting layer thing I mentioned earlier.

#### Makes appearance realization's list output ordered

I want it output in order of overlay, sub overlay suboverlay, next
overlay
Need to use insert for that

## Why It's Good For The Game

Pretty!
Also having space be emissive is a very very good way to test for fucked
emissive blockers (If it's broken why are we even drawing the overlay)
I know for a fact mob blockers on lizards and socks are kinda yorked, I
think there's more

QVarLengthArray: fix UBs in emplace()/insert() ([basic.life], broken class invariant)

There are two problems in emplace_impl() (the same code exists as
rvalue insert() since 5.10):

First, the old code updated size() at the end of the function.

However, if, after constructing the new end element, one of the
subsequent move-assignments fail (throws), then the class invariant
that size() be the number of alive elements in the container is
broken, with the immediate consequence that the QVLA dtor would not
destroy this element, but surely other unpleasantness (UB) that the
C++ lifetime rules decide to throw our way.

Similarly, in the trivially-relocatable case, the memmove() starts the
life-time of the new end object, so if the following placement new
fails, we're in the same situation.

The latter case is worse, though, since here we leave *b in some weird
zombie state: the memmove() effectively ended its lifetime in the
sense that one mustn't call the destructor on the source object after
trivial relocation, but C++ doesn't agree and QVLA's dtor will happily
call b->~T() as part of its cleanup.

The other ugly thing is that we're using placement new into an object
that C++ says is still alive. QString is trivially relocatable, but
not trivially copyable, so we can't end a QString's lifetime by
placement-new'ing a new QString instance into it without first having
ended the old object's lifetime.

The fix for both of these is, fortunately, the same: It's a rotate!™

By using emplace_back() + std::rotate(), we always place the new
object in a spot that didn't contain an alive object (in the C++
sense) before, we always update the size() right after doing so,
maintaining that invariant, and we then rotate() it into place, which
doesn't leave zombie objects around.

std::rotate() is such a fundamental algorithm that we should trust the
STL implementors to have optimized it well:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21160875/why-is-stdrotate-so-fast

We know we can do better only for trivially-relocatable, but
non-trivially-copyable types (ex: QString), so in order to not lose
the memmove() optimization, we now fall back to std::rotate on raw
memory for that case.

Improves the grammar, functionality, and code quality of set declarations (#776)

* Makes Consume array overload return the tokentype it found

Plus adds some extra comments, in my crusade to comment more things.

EDIT: hate you Github Desktop

* Removes MultipleVarDec..., replaces with Aggregate generic

Removes DMASTProcStatementMultipleVarDeclarations,
replaces with DMASTAggregate<>.

DMASTAggregate now has the generic-ified responsibility of being a statement which is actually an aggregate of several statements, all of the same type.

The point of this is so that this aggregation behaviour can also be used for set declaration blocks (and maybe other stuff if we find other uses, I dunno)

* Adds some helpful ctors for DMASTProcBlockInner

There's a lot of repetitive empty or near-empty array inits at the caller side of some of these constructions, so I went ahead and moved those into the ctor. Also allows for a minor optimization (preferring using Array.Empty<> instead of constructing empty arrays).

* Improves SetStatement grammar, function & quality

(If any of you demand I insert the oxford comma into the commit header I am leaving 5ever :rage: )

This commit does several things in one fell swoop:
- Set statements now accept blocking, commas, bracing, all the good stuff that var declarations do
- Blocks now very consistently evaluate their SetStatements first and foremost, before anything else, in a way that makes sense
- Use of the 'in' keyword is now properly prohibited for all set use cases except 'src'
- 'src' now properly gives an unimplemented warning

Also in this commit is a bunch of random autodoc added to things that I looked at or touched over the course of writing this commit. :innocent:

* Implements cursed parity behaviour for non-const set statements

AFAIK, in BYOND, the previous set statement value is used to prop-up one that has a non-constant right-hand side. So I guess we have that behaviour available, now. :sweat_smile:

EDIT: Fixed behaviour in the didError case, minor formatting fixes

* Style fix, replaces several "\n{" with "{\n"

Most of these were my fault. Not all of them though. :^)

* Does the Wixoa reviews, adds EmptyBlock pragma error

As a byproduct of doing the reviews, I have accidentally added empty block detection for several (although perhaps not most) loops and blocks available in OD.

* Brace style fixes

* Does more Wixoa reviews, generalizes EmptyBlock emission

Note that we do not, as of yet, emit this warning for empty procs. This is because:
1. our own DMStandard has several empty procs (usually because they are unimplemented or useless, like the BYOND Hub interface procs)
2. Users may sometimes define an empty proc, intentionally, to act as an abstract virtual that child types can define in their own way.

We can revisit the problem later, I'm just trying to get my PR greenlit.

* Adds test for EmptyBlock pragma emission

Update CI to use GitHub's Merge Queue (#5766)

GitHub recently made its merge queue feature available for use in public
repositories owned by organizations meaning that the Wasmtime repository
is a candidate for using this. GitHub's Merge Queue feature is a system
that's similar to Rust's bors integration where PRs are tested before
merging and only passing PRs are merged. This implements the "not rocket
science" rule where the `main` branch of Wasmtime, for example, is
always tested and passes CI. This is in contrast to our current
implementation of CI where PRs are merged when they pass their own CI,
but the code that was tested is not guaranteed to be the state of `main`
when the PR is merged, meaning that we're at risk now of a failing
`main` branch despite all merged PRs being green. While this has
happened with Wasmtime this is not a common occurrence, however.

The main motivation, instead, to use GitHub's Merge Queue feature is
that it will enable Wasmtime to greatly reduce the amount of CI running
on PRs themselves. Currently the full test suite runs on every push to
every PR, meaning that our workers on GitHub Actions are frequently
clogged throughout weekdays and PRs can take quite some time to come
back with a successful run. Through the use of a Merge Queue, however,
we're able to configure only a small handful of checks to run on PRs
while deferring the main body of checks to happening on the
merge-via-the-queue itself. This is hoped to free up capacity on CI and
overall improve CI times for Wasmtime and Cranelift developers.

The implementation of all of this required quite a lot of plumbing and
retooling of our CI. I've been testing this in an [external
repository][testrepo] and I think everything is working now. A list of
changes made in this PR are:

* The `build.yml` workflow is merged back into the `main.yml` workflow
  as the original reason to split it out is not longer applicable (it'll
  run on all merges). This was also done to fit in the dependency graph
  of jobs of one workflow.

* Publication of the `gh-pages` branch, the `dev` tag artifacts, and
  release artifacts have been moved to a separate
  `publish-artifacts.yml` workflow. This workflow runs on all pushes to
  `main` and all tags. This workflow no longer actually preforms any
  builds, however, and relies on a merge queue or similar being used for
  branches/tags where artifacts are downloaded from the workflow run to
  be uploaded. For pushes to `main` this works because a merge queue is
  run meaning that by the time the push happens all artifacts are ready.
  For release branches this is handled by..

* The `push-tag.yml` workflow is subsumed by the `main.yml` workflow. CI
  for a tag being pushed will upload artifacts to a release in GitHub,
  meaning that all builds must finish first for the commit. The
  `main.yml` workflow at the end now scans commits for the preexisting
  magical marker and pushes a tag if necessary.

* CI is currently a flat list of "run all these jobs" and this is now
  rearchitected to a "fan out" approach where some jobs run to determine
  the next jobs to run which then get "joined" into a finish step. The
  purpose for this is somewhat nuanced and this has implications for CI
  runtime as well. The Merge Queue feature requires branches to be
  protected with "these checks must pass" and then the same checks are
  gates both to enter the merge queue as well as pass the merge queue.
  The saving grace, however, is that a "skipped" check counts as
  passing, meaning checks can be skipped on PRs but run to completion on
  the merge queue. A problem with this though is the build matrix used
  for tests where PRs want to only run one element of the build matrix
  ideally but there's no means on GitHub Actions right now for the
  skipped entries to show up as skipped easily (or not that I know of).
  This means that the "join" step serves the purpose of being the single
  gate for both PR and merge queue CI and there's just more inputs to it
  for merge queue CI. The major consequence of this decision is that
  GitHub's actions scheduling doesn't work out well here. Jobs are
  scheduled in a FIFO order meaning that the job for "ok complete the CI
  run" is queued up after everything else has completed, possibly
  after lots of other CI requests in the middle for other PRs. The hope
  here is that by using a merge queue we can keep CI relatively under
  control and this won't affect merge times too much.

* All jobs in the `main.yml` workflow will not automatically cancel the
  entire run if they fail. Previously this fail-fast behavior was only
  part of the matrix runs (and just for that matrix), but this is
  required to make the merge queue expedient. The gate of the merge
  queue is the final "join" step which is only executed once all
  dependencies have finished. This means, for example, that if rustfmt
  fails quickly then the tests which take longer might run for quite
  awhile before the join step reports failure, meaning that the PR sits
  in the queue for longer than needed being tested when we know it's
  already going to fail. By having all jobs cancel the run this means
  that failures immediately bail out and mark the whole job as
  cancelled.

* A new "determine" CI job was added to determine what CI actually needs
  to run. This is a "choke point" which is scheduled at the start of CI
  that quickly figures out what else needs to be run. This notably
  indicates whether large swaths of ci (the `run-full` flag) like the
  build matrix are executed. Additionally this dynamically calculates a
  matrix of tests to run based on a new `./ci/build-test-matrix.js`
  script. Various inputs are considered for this such as:

  1. All pushes, meaning merge queue branches or release-branch merges,
     will run full CI.
  2. PRs to release branches will run full CI.
  3. PRs to `main`, the most common, determine what to run based on
     what's modified and what's in the commit message.

  Some examples for (3) above are if modifications are made to
  `cranelift/codegen/src/isa/*` then that corresponding builder is
  executed on CI. If the `crates/c-api` directory is modified then the
  CMake-based tests are run on PRs but are otherwise skipped.
  Annotations in commit messages such as `prtest:*` can be used to
  explicitly request testing.

Before this PR merges to `main` would perform two full runs of CI: one
on the PR itself and one on the merge to `main`. Note that the one as a
merge to `main` was quite frequently cancelled due to a merge happening
later. Additionally before this PR there was always the risk of a bad
merge where what was merged ended up creating a `main` that failed CI to
to a non-code-related merge conflict.

After this PR merges to `main` will perform one full run of CI, the one
as part of the merge queue. PRs themselves will perform one test job
most of the time otherwise. The `main` branch is additionally always
guaranteed to pass tests via the merge queue feature.

For release branches, before this PR merges would perform two full
builds - one for the PR and one for the merge. A third build was then
required for the release tag itself. This is now cut down to two full
builds, one for the PR and one for the merge. The reason for this is
that the merge queue feature currently can't be used for our
wildcard-based `release-*` branch protections. It is now possible,
however, to turn on required CI checks for the `release-*` branch PRs so
we can at least have a "hit the button and forget" strategy for merging
PRs now.

Note that this change to CI is not without its risks. The Merge Queue
feature is still in beta and is quite new for GitHub. One bug that
Trevor and I uncovered is that if a PR is being tested in the merge
queue and a contributor pushes to their PR then the PR isn't removed
from the merge queue but is instead merged when CI is successful, losing
the changes that the contributor pushed (what's merged is what was
tested). We suspect that GitHub will fix this, however.

Additionally though there's the risk that this may increase merge time
for PRs to Wasmtime in practice. The Merge Queue feature has the ability
to "batch" PRs together for a merge but this is only done if concurrent
builds are allowed. This means that if 5 PRs are batched together then 5
separate merges would be created for the stack of 5 PRs. If the CI for
all 5 merged together passes then everything is merged, otherwise a PR
is kicked out. We can't easily do this, however, since a major purpose
for the merge queue for us would be to cut down on usage of CI builders
meaning the max concurrency would be set to 1 meaning that only one PR
at a time will be merged. This means PRs may sit in the queue for awhile
since previously many `main`-based builds are cancelled due to
subsequent merges of other PRs, but now they must all run to 100%
completion.

Day86

Mahesh got a beautiful array named A as a birthday gift from his beautiful girlfriend Namratha. There are N positive integers in that array. Mahesh loved the array so much that he started to spend a lot of time on it everyday. One day, he wrote down all possible subsets of the array. Then for each subset, he calculated the sum of elements in that subset and wrote it down on a paper. Unfortunately, Mahesh lost the beautiful array :(. He still has the paper on which he wrote all subset sums. Your task is to rebuild beautiful array A and help the couple stay happy :)

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].
With this patch a process can be killed via:

Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

PMC and Whiteout stuff (#1966)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

As a preword, I came up with every change in this PR and coded them in
the span of 10 hours, so some things may be iffy.

PMCs and Whiteout may be good, but they're a bit outdated, this
modernizes multiple loadout aspects, enables antag vendors for
admin-spawn, and does some balance changes to certain
portions(specifically chem ERT).

Individual changes, numbered, will go over each in why its good, may
have forgotten one or two things.

1. Buffs whiteout flamer with blue flame damage, belt-linked magharn,
and pyro underbarrel extinguisher
2. Adds a synthetic repair kit(medkit), with synth repair tools, gives
it to whiteout.
3. Adds breaching charges and swaps crowbars to tactical in whiteout
loadouts
4. Gives whiteout PMC sniper goggles(thermals)
5. Gives whiteout medic the required gear to actually repair a downed
member of the team, and just a lot of synth heals.
6. Gives whiteout leader a pyro extinguisher.
7. Gives whiteout weapons default attachments.
8. Adds an 'advanced' mini-flamer with the same stats as UPP integrated
UBF, gives it to NSG23 and random m41/2 attachie.
9. Gives detainer PMCs a version of the corporate m41A MK2(goon gun),
with attachies and adv flamer to replace flamethrower.
10. Swaps chem PMC TL P90(name is too long) with an M41/2
11. Gives normal PMC ERT roles a webbing vest with meds and
miniextinguisher
12. Gives PMC Surgeon the essentials required to act as a medic, swaps
NSG with M39/2, gives them a normal but unique look.
13. Whiteout and PMC SG powerpacks have 30k power by default, instead of
10k.
14. Gives PMC guns more options for random attachments, and gives m41/2
its intended collapsible stock
15. Gives PMC engi m39/2 instead of P90
16. Removes flamer from potential PMC loadouts.
17. Gives PMCs better CQC skill.
18. Gives PMC TLs autoinjector pouches(which gives chem TL a second
pouch in the first place)
19. Detainer PMCs now have tac-sechuds, PMC TLs have sensorhuds.
20. **Enables antag vendor for PMC roles.** (Look at file changes for
the specific things, too long for pr desc)

# Explain why it's good for the game

Modernization and some needed loadout/balance changes(IMO).
Per number:

1. Whiteout flamer did worse damage than napalm, and was incredibly easy
to lose.
2. More heals for each member of the whiteout team, allows more
self-sufficiency.
3. Breach charges for tacticool breaches, crowbar doubles as a melee
weapon in case the player doesn't know about synth punch
4. Whiteout didn't have proper NVG, thermals allows them to do
tacticooler breaches by lining up people wth breach charge.
5. Whiteout medic didn't have a lot of heals at all, and didn't have a
defib, so they weren't much of a medic.
6. To extinguish the flames and lead charges, works like pyro
underbarrel extinguisher, but handheld.
7. Default tacticool attachment, already made whiteout subtypes for
HEAP, why not give them good attachies with them too.
8. Mini-flamer sucks, gives a better version for NSG and m41/2, same
stats as the already existing UPP integrated UBF.
9. Detainers had flamers which sucked, gives them corpo m41s which
aren't as good as /2s, but have adv UBF for flames.
10. P90 sucks, having default m41/2 fits with other leader type, also
gives them a better gun than their underlings.
11. Medkit but in a webbing, its my personal combat webbing load when I
play so its good.
12. PMC Surgeon was horrifically undergeared, they didn't even have a
medhud, gives them basic gear similar to PMC med but with a beret to
tell them apart.
13. ERTs don't have spare batteries to get usually, more staying power
in fights.
14. More options for attachies to further make PMC weapons better, also
gives m41/2 the m41 collapsible stock because it needed it.
15. P90 sucks, support roles getting the m39/2 is cool.
16. Flamer sucks to get as PMC, and adv. UBF as a potential m41/2
attachie makes a full-sized flamer useless too.
17. PMCs could fireman carry, and multi-strip, but did it horrifically
slow, gives them MP level CQC(master for spec, expert for TL)
18. TL getting extra meds is neat, also chem TL had an empty pocket slot
and no meds, thats bad.
19. Sechud-thing for PMC detainers is useful(stops flashbang trolling
for one), giving PMC TL a sensorhud to watch their team's status is also
good.
20. Makes doing event bases for PMCs much easier, too long to post the
specific changes here but look at files for them.

Simplify indented output rendering by using stateful output routines.

This replaces the "pure functional" output style, which took great pains to
build a nested list structure which was only sent to the output device at the
very end.  This required passing around a hidden "tab" parameter in a monadic
fashion, the use of a "next" continuation parameter, and semicolons to ensure
that the tail of a structure was threaded in properly.

Now when you call routines like say, nl, put, and indent, the effects of those
calls are going directly into a file handle or other target as they run.  You
are no longer building up a lazy nested piece of data which is _later_ sent to
an output target.  All the complexity of the "pure" method vanishes like a bad
dream.

This drastically simplifies the code supporting the b15 and index_C tests.
I also use the technique to great advantage in the demo.ray project:

	https://github.com/chkoreff/demo.ray

This illustrates a principle which I title:

	"Pure Functions Sometimes Considered Harmful"

The pure functional style still has its place in certain aspects of a program,
but for input and output it's easier just to cut to the chase and deal with the
machine on its own terms.  In those cases, "var" is your friend -- and it can
even create more opportunities for implementing routines directly in C, as I
did with the parsing primitives in stream.c in the Fexl project.

I am also finding the var technique useful for "throughput".  In one major
project I was passing a single immutable state parameter around everywhere,
and I greatly simplified the code by keeping that state in a handful of vars.

The good thing about "var" is that it is _controlled_ mutability, not the
haphazard and dangerous kind where you modify nested data structures in place.
In Fexl the data structures are still immutable, but you use a var to _point_
to a new version when you make a state change.  I think this strikes the right
balance between pure functions and routines with side effects.

post There's a lot to love about Top 10, which is why I read it for what is at least the third time (likely more). The story is well-crafted, the concept is interesting, it riffs on superhero tropes while breathing new life into them, and the art is full of so many easter eggs for the savvy reader (my favorite is probably the Astérix and Obélix cameo, but there are lots of other great ones). Because I remembered all that, I was surprised by how much of it fell flat this time through. The way that Moore codes orcish/kaiju monsters as Hispanophone and non-human robots as Black rubbed me the wrong way—it's clear that it's supposed to be a metaphor, but it seems clumsy and self-defeating. Likewise, Moore sometimes seems more interested in being edgy and leering with his ideas than in asking whether something is really necessary—or if it could come off as problematic. So, there's  a lot to love about this series, but it's getting easier and easier for me to see its flaws, and I don't know if I'll need to come back to this again.

[jak2] improve loader for jak 2 levels (#2206)

Add a debug window for the loader to show levels and fix an issue with
jak 2 level unloading. I never really thought about how this works for >
2 levels, and there is a chance that you could unload the wrong level in
some cases.

The problem is some combination of merc-only levels not counting toward
the "in use" detection, and the unloader ignoring what the game wants to
load.

I don't remember why using merc models doesn't contribute to "in use"
but I'm afraid to change this for jak 1. Instead, we can have the
unloader avoid unloading levels that the game is telling us are loaded.
This is what we should have done originally, but there was a time when
Jak 1 didn't tell the loader anything, and we had this stupid detection
thing.

I think this is the first step toward just getting rid of the "in use"
detection and trusting the game for everything.

Makes Shake() proc work (#73480)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #72321
Fixes #70388

The shake proc didn't work and hasn't for ages.
I remember it having worked at some point, but it was quite a long time
ago.
I cannot guarantee that the end result here is the same as it was, the
reason here being that I have no idea how this proc ever worked in the
first place. My limited understanding of the `animate` proc implies that
the previous implementation as written would never have acted as you
would expect it to, but clearly at some time in the past it did work. A
mystery.

As a result of the previous, possibly because the proc never _did_ work
as expected and just did something which looked vaguely correct most of
the time, both the default values and the values people were passing
into this proc were completely ridiculous.
Why would anyone ever want to pixel shift an object with a range of _15_
pixels in all directions? That's half a full tile! And why would you
want it to do this for 25 seconds?
So I also changed the values being passed in, because you really want
pretty small numbers passed into here most of the time.

Here's a video of everything that vibrates:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0hoqmaXkKA

The exception is the v8 engine. I left this alone because it seems to
try and start shaking while in your hands, which doesn't work, and I
don't know how to fix that. This has potentially _also_ never worked.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Now you can see intended visual indicators for:
- Lobstrosities charging.
- Beepsky being EMPed.
- The Savannah Ivanov preparing to jump.

in the future.
