Mafia can be played on your PDA (#78576)

## About The Pull Request

Mafia is now friggin playable from the PDA, I also changed other stuff
too

- You can't use abilities on dead people if you're not supposed to (cant
kill the same person over and over)
- Changelings cant kill other Changelings
- Changelings can now only talk to eachother at night, rather than using
:j
- Everyone starts spawned in the center of the map, since people playing
on PDA can't move their characters. This is so everyone can hear PDA
users in person, as I don't want the chat log to be mandatory.

To do this, all messages you are meant to be able to see, is now logged
for you to see in your Mafia panel. This essentially means that people
playing through the PDA get a downgraded version of it, but I don't know
how much larger I want this UI to be.

Playing Mafia through the PDA will not tell you of other players ahead
of time when signing up (as it shows ckeys + pdas), but they can see the
names in-game. Unfortunately this means we'll have to remove your
customization coming with you, to prevent using it to tell who is dead
in round.

Things I am missing
- Program overlays on PDA/Laptop/Computer
- Icon for the app's header while a game is active

I'm not a spriter and can't make either of these

This is the new UI

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/7cf503d9-b2e2-4127-874a-acad6425d649)

I also fixed alert calls for PDAs and stuff

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/e09b2e5e-b9e7-43ae-9273-c168e9c8e642)

and removed the X at the top on computers since they had no battery

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/d3dd8307-805c-4aba-be5e-4c24a0bdcb91)

Looks a little better now hopefully 👍 

## Why It's Good For The Game

- The current Arcade app sucks, and is a solo game. This is much more
entertaining and you can talk to others in it, which is swag as fuck.
- There's a larger potential playerbase for the Minigame making it more
likely to be played.
- Sets groundwork for a better version of
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/75879
- Adds more suspense and teamwork in the minigame.

## Changelog

:cl: JohnFulpWillard, sprites by CoiledLamb
add: You can now play Mafia on your PDA.
balance: Mafia changelings can now only talk to eachother during the
night.
fix: Mafia abilities can't be repeatedly used on people.

Actually supports alpha passed into emissive stuff (#79117)

## About The Pull Request

Ok so like, the emissive procs have an alpha argument right? The thing
is, the thing is it doesn't fucking do anything.

Alpha is a component of the color var (at least when it's a matrix), so
when we set alpha and then set color to a matrix, the alpha gets
overriden. Inverse is also true.

I want to support alpha args, since I like the idea of dimmable
emissives. Soooooo
Let's take the alpha arg, divide it by 255, and replace everything that
cares about alpha (as an intensity thing) with it.

This lets us do transparent emissives and transparent emissive blockers.

I added some guard checks to hopefully avoid the list init most of the
time (it is in theory comprable since color sets should copy but I don't
trust byond to optimize for that)
Also modified the macros to suppport what I'm doing nicely

## Why It's Good For The Game

We should support this, and now we do

Heretic Rebalance -  Main Knowledge gives free Side points, reduced rune drawing time, Codex Cicatrix is easier and roundstart knowledge (#77939)

## About The Pull Request

Heretic Rebalance

Researching the Main Knowledge paths that unlock Side Paths will grant
one Side Point that can be used only on those side paths. You can still
spend normal knowledge points on them if you wish.

Rune drawing time has been reduced from 30->20 seconds. Codex drawing
time has been reduced from 15->8.

Codex Cicatrix is now a roundstart knowledge, works as an amber focus
when held in-hand and opened, and has had its recipe changed to: 1 of
any non-standard pen (literally anything that isn't the base pen), any
book, and either animal hide OR a corpse, any kind.

Added support for using a list inside ritual requirements and a special
'snowflake check' rituals can utilize.

The first non-path knowledge, the Mansus Hand Mark, has had its cost
reduced from 2->1 points.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Heretic is an extremely top-heavy antagonist that is EXCEEDINGLY weak in
the early-game, free get out of jail card aside, and gets utterly
overwhelmed with options extremely quickly once hopping past the
mid-game hurdle. You're completely starved for knowledge points to the..
point that you feel like you can't blow any on side paths, even though
these are often essential as well!


Once you hop the hurdle - 40 minutes in, usually - you suddenly find
yourself blazing through path after path obtaining a ridiculous amount
of points that you don't know what to do with and unlocking spell after
spell all at once rather than slowly, meaning it becomes extremely hard
to keep focus and actually use these things - attempting to keep 5 new
spells in mind during combat will just cause you to stretch yourself
thin and die.

This PR is meant to address this by giving Heretics a lot more leeway on
the early game so they don't feel nearly as stifled as they are right
now, which will also, ideally, help them unlock singular abilities
earlier on so they can practice with them. **None of these changes are
straight buffs to combat ability, they simply relax the extremely tight
restrictions early-game heretics have.**

> Researching the Main Knowledge paths that unlock Side Paths will grant
one Side Point that can be used only on those side paths. You can still
spend normal knowledge points on them if you wish.

This idea in specific is supported by @MrMelbert - which I'm using as a
request to not instaclose this PR due to the slightly lower than neutral
GBP I have. He supports this specific bit at least and doesn't outright
disagree with me on the rest, as far as I'm aware from my last
conversation with him on the subject a while back. Besides, I have a
refactor on mirrors open!

Meta aside, this bit is meant to combat how claustrophobic early heretic
feels by allowing the guy to pick one of two side paths for free* after
unlocking that path's equivalent of Ash Jaunt, so they have *something*
to use besides their sword and stink hand at the start.

> Rune drawing time has been reduced from 30->20 seconds. Codex drawing
time has been reduced from 15->8.

The absurdly long drawing time is just extremely arduous and
frustrating. It's way too slow but just not enough to let you zone out,
and it has a ridiculously noticeable animation the whole way through
which guarantees you being found out if you're found out midway through.
It makes heretic even SLOWER early on as they need to set up one or
several bases which takes forever.

> Codex Cicatrix is now a roundstart knowledge, works as an amber focus
when held in-hand and opened, and has had its recipe changed to: 1 of
any non-standard pen (literally anything that isn't the base pen), any
book, and either animal hide OR a corpse, any kind.

Quite the buff, but I think all of these are good changes. Codex
Cicatrix being a roundstart change lets one decide - do they want to
rush the book to get multiplied influence strength, or do they want to
get all the influences ASAP? It also lets them set up bases quicker at,
again, the cost of having a blatantly evil item inside the bag.

The Codex recipe was annoyingly complicated, requiring you to run all
around the station in yet another of Heretic's many fetch quests just
for something that used to be part of the default kit, especially with
how annoying getting animal hide can be. Now it's a lot easier to
handle.

The Amber Focus bit is just as a panic option for heretics if they get
caught without one, at least they can use the book, and wielding a book
in combat is awesome.

> The first non-path knowledge, the Mansus Hand Mark, has had its cost
reduced from 2->1 points.

I don't think there ever really was a need to gate this behind two
points, it's the very first unlockable research and it needs you to get
two influences for some reason. The reasoning is probably 'heretic setup
time so they dont start at full strength', which is solid, but is
already well handled enough by their other systems and restrictions as
mentioned in the rest of the PR.

Heretics have been on a constant trend of just.. not doing anything.
Getting caught early and flopping or never managing to do things of
note. They need changes, not because They're UnderPowered And The
Competitive Balance Is Skewed, but because it's simply not that fun to
*be* a heretic with these issues, and not that fun to FIGHT a heretic
that merelay has a stink hand, a blade, two pieces of lint in their
pocket, and a dead rat.

I also think the Ritual of Knowledge should 1. not cost points, and 2.
be split across the 33% and 66% mark and give 2 points, but that's for
another PR.

ArCargo: Adds the Galactic Materials Stock Market V1.2 (Free Market Edition) (#78500)

## About The Pull Request

**This PR is a rerelease of #78164, with some bells and whistles.** As
such, most of the core functionality is the same, but with some tweaks
to balance the gameplay and prevent bike levels of profit. I've tried to
bold the new additions to make it easier to read for those coming back
for the second pass.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/41715314/ff9bf038-524d-44fc-81bb-c6ff97fef6dd)
This PR adds a new machine that can be bought called the **Galactic
Mineral Market** (GMM). The Galactic Mineral Market (GMM) allows you to
buy and sell minerals wholesale from the market machine. It goes
something like this:

### 1. Getting the Machine:
The GMM can be bought as an un-assembled machine for 600 credits from
cargo. It's a low cost, but its not mapped in standard, so if you're
confident in your miners, you shouldn't necessarily need one for the
department. Otherwise, it's available for other crewmembers to buy for
cost.

The cargo pack comes will all supplies necessary to finish the machine.
Tools not included.

### 2. Buying Low
Using the machine's UI, you can see all traded minerals and their
associated prices. Buy prices are played straight, and can be bought for
material price, times the quantity. The order is then instantly placed
on the cargo shuttle, and will be deducted from the buyer's account on
shuttle send. **A single order can only have 10 different stacks of
materials in it. So, that can be 100 sheets of iron and 1 of everything
else, or 500 sheets of iron. After that you're blocked from buying more
sheets until you've sent the order.**

Cargo staff with standard cargo access may toggle the machine to order
directly from the cargo budget. Otherwise, materials are only purchased
from private accounts.

All purchases are treated as private and must be opened by the recipient
like private orders.

### 3. Selling High

It's stocks time. To sell minerals on the market, simply insert any
relevant metal stock into the machine. This produces a totally original
and not-a-bounty-cube stock block, which can be sold on the cargo
shuttle for cargo funds. Stock blocks can also be price-tagged as well
following their standard process.

**Stock blocks start out a bright pink and are worth the value of that
material at that time, but over time their color will degrade. After a
full 5 minutes, stock blocks will switch over to a purple hue, and their
value will once again become liquid, subject to the current market
value. This encourages players to be a bit more fast on their feet than
before instead of just waiting forever for all of their investments to
arrive at the perfect value, before the inevitable "rest of the game"
tries to upend your investing.**

Sold cargo stocks are subject at a 20% processing fee as part of the
galactic mineral market.
### 4. Outside Factors

**In-game events like the Crab-17 or the Market crash event will cause
stocks to bottom out completely, and for the market to become
unavailable until the market stabilizes. Thankfully, once the market has
crashed, typically stocks will recovery and gain back some value,
allowing for fast acting market movers to capitalize on rough markets.**

**Additionally, low value materials like iron and glass have an extra
stipulation, as their value goes all the way down to 0 credits. In that
case, you are unable to buy them at that value as a market protection.
Be careful that you don't see a reset or crash when you're planning on
selling your horde of iron and glass stocks!**

Additionally, market events can occur during the round that can more
sharply adjust a single stock's price and completely rebound it's
trajectory. These events are always mentioned in the station
announcement's economics report.

### Other notes:
The market does not cover all minerals, partially for consistency
purposes as well as for balance reasons. Plasma, being a unique material
that only Nanotrasen has their hands on, is the sole exporter of plasma
in the system, so it stands to reason that it's not on the market, and
remains a solo export. Bananium, as it has a rare and expensive
conversion rate, works the opposite way, and as such isn't listed on the
market either, with the sole source being single cargo sales. All others
just don't make much sense to include into the market at this second, so
I left them out for now.

**Alright now below I'm going to cover the math and shit so if that's
not what you care about then please scroll past.**
<details>
  <summary>Warning: Arcane is about to talk about the math</summary>
Alright.
So this adds a new stock_market subsystem, which fires once every 20
seconds. I'm still fairly new to subsystem design so I'm probably going
to need some feedback on cleaning this up to make it look nicer and run
smoother.

So we have 4 associated lists, each attached to the relevant traded
datum; this tracks prices, market trends, how long that trend is going
to last in SS fires, and market quantity.

Prices fluctuate between 0.5x and 3x the material's single sheet value.
This could be tweaked even farther in the future, but for now I'm
keeping it at this nice clean margin. Prices fluctuate based on a
gaussian normal distribution that is centered on different points based
on their **trend**. Upward trending materials are centered in such a way
that they'll almost certainly go upwards, but being that it's based on a
random chance, not always. Vis versa, downward trends should tend to
lose value at about the same rate. We also change our rounding based on
this trend data, in order to prevent low price values like iron and
glass from getting stuck in the same value or freefall drop over time
just because of rounding down. Similarly, neutral trending materials
will not change nearly as much, and will generally stay at around the
same amount.

When buying or selling a material, the quantity of that material will
change on the market. The magnitude of that change depends on how much
of that material currently exists on the market. Buying a low quantity
material like diamond for example will tangibly increase that material's
cost, while buying stacks and stacks of iron and glass won't do much
damage to the price of iron as there's usually around 500 full stacks on
the market to start with. It's applied at a relative percentage of
(qty_changed / new_total_on_market) * price of goods bought/sold at.

In addition to that, there are random "market events" that can occur
randomly, which you might miss if you don't follow the newscaster
economy news. These three events are fairly barebones now, but in
general they have a 1% chance of happening per material, and can more
dramatically increase, decrease, or fully reset the value of a material
on the market back to it's standard value. This opens up for doing more
with it in the future, but that's a later problem.
</details>


## Why It's Good For The Game

This independently resolves some issues related to #78040, that being
that lowpop stations, or shifts with few miners would have a new way to
be able to still get some access to minerals in a given round. This also
provides a unique minigame and alternative way to acquire money in a
given shift, using minerals.

**"But Arcane,** I hear you ask. **"Isn't this just the same thing you
tried doing way back when and then reverted in #50537?**
Well, fuck man, how you doing I haven't see you around in forever also
no you're completely wrong and here's why

**This PR is no longer contingent on the rest of ArcMining in it's
current iteration.** I have introduced some extra factors into the
gameplay as well to try and curb the creation of bikes within gameplay.
This also provides a massive benefit to round progression and gives the
QM and the cargo members the ability to prevent round progress from
stalling by buying round-critical resources.

Not to mention, as the GMM is not cargo required, more cargo integrated,
it also functions as economy content for the rest of the crew.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: A new export has arrived in the imports section, the Galactic
Materials Market! You can use this to buy and sell minerals for profit
or cost, as well as stock your station when you don't have any miners.
add: Insert sheets of minerals into the Galactic Materials Market to
convert them into a stock block, allowing you to lock in your price for
5 minutes. Wait too long and it'll be subject to market value again!
add: Minerals can be bought on the market either using the station's
cargo budget by cargo crew, or privately by everyone else.
del: Any material stacks that can be bought and sold on the market
before have been removed from the cargo catalog.

Fixes Shaving Beards + Mirror Code Improvement (#79529)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #79519

Basically we did a lot of assumptions that we really shouldn't do in the
whole magical mirror framework (like having a boolean value for magical
mirrors, what?). Anyways, I just made the UX experience a lot better
when it came to bearded persons with feminine physiques to easily shave
off their beard with an additional confirmatory prompt + details as well
as keeping the nature of the magical mirror (giving you a swagadocious
beard due to magic:tm:) intact.
## Why It's Good For The Game

There was a lot of convoluted code that skipped through the quality
filter checks (it was me i think) so let's both make the code far easier
to grasp as well as ensure that people who legitimately acquire beards
and wish to keep them, keep them.

We were also doing some FUCK shit on attack_hand and the like
(overriding a FALSE return signal to return TRUE is not what we should
be doing there)- so that's also cleaned up.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Both magic mirrors and regular mirrors are far better at respecting
the choice of the beard you wish to wear (within reason, of course).

Use nix.dev as the entry point to the Nix ecosystem

There is no clear advantage I see in removing existing domains from our "brand namespace". To the contrary, there are several technical risks associated with it, and we'll have to maintain the old domains anyway.

There's also potential for confusion and drama. Human-readable links in the wild won't go away. And our brains are wired not to like things being taken away.

Instead let's make nix.dev the canonical *entry point* to the Nix user experience. Depending on how new users come to us, NixOS can either be seen as an advanced use case that requires ramp-up, or as the reason to deal with all this Nix stuff to begin with. That's not wrong, in fact it has many benefits.

This is a proposal to recommend one over the other as a first point of contact. The third option (the first being removing one entirely, which I reject with this change) is letting them live equivalently side by side. I think it's inferior to a clear recommendation, as there is a risk of (even only perceived) competition that we can't afford and that would just again produce confusion for beginners which I'm convinced we should avoid at all cost.

tree-wide: use /proc/thread-self for thread-local state

With the idmap work, we will have a tainted Go thread in our
thread-group that has a different mount namespace to the other threads.
It seems that (due to some bad luck) the Go scheduler tends to make this
thread the thread-group leader in our tests, which results in very
baffling failures where /proc/self/mountinfo produces gibberish results.

In order to avoid this, switch to using /proc/thread-self for everything
that is thread-local. This primarily includes switching all file
descriptor paths (CLONE_FS), all of the places that check the current
cgroup (technically we never will run a single runc thread in a separate
cgroup, but better to be safe than sorry), and the aforementioned
mountinfo code. We don't need to do anything for the following because
the results we need aren't thread-local:

 * Checks that certain namespaces are supported by stat(2)ing
   /proc/self/ns/...

 * /proc/self/exe and /proc/self/cmdline are not thread-local.

 * While threads can be in different cgroups, we do not do this for the
   runc binary (or libcontainer) and thus we do not need to switch to
   the thread-local version of /proc/self/cgroups.

 * All of the CLONE_NEWUSER files are not thread-local because you
   cannot set the usernamespace of a single thread (setns(CLONE_NEWUSER)
   is blocked for multi-threaded programs).

Note that we have to use runtime.LockOSThread when we have an open
handle to a tid-specific procfs file that we are operating on multiple
times. Go can reschedule us such that we are running on a different
thread and then kill the original thread (causing -ENOENT or similarly
confusing errors). This is not strictly necessary for most usages of
/proc/thread-self (such as using /proc/thread-self/fd/$n directly) since
only operating on the actual inodes associated with the tid requires
this locking, but because of the pre-3.17 fallback for CentOS, we have
to do this in most cases.

In addition, CentOS's kernel is too old for /proc/thread-self, which
requires us to emulate it -- however in rootfs_linux.go, we are in the
container pid namespace but /proc is the host's procfs. This leads to
the incredibly frustrating situation where there is no way (on pre-4.1
Linux) to figure out which /proc/self/task/... entry refers to the
current tid. We can just use /proc/self in this case.

Yes this is all pretty ugly. I also wish it wasn't necessary.

Refactor to allow for cwd-based path-to-conf parsing

As initially/intentionally designed, Config::App looks around for a
configuration file from the location of the executable called. This is
desireable because we can thus call tools of a given project outside the
project's directory tree and Config::App will load the configuration of
that project.

However, there are cases (see MojoX::Linda) where we will be calling,
from within a project's tree, an executable that's outside the project's
tree. So in these cases, we should start at cwd.

To make this happen without a bunch of ugly hacks, I had to refactor the
code a bit.

new space ruin, the biological research outpost (#79149)

## About The Pull Request

![2023-10-21 18 02
39](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/5829e939-3b04-465f-a186-095ceb360bba)

adds this ruin to space ruin pool
this is a shady (as NT always is) bioresearch outpost that got fucked up
by an experiment
this has like some puzzle aspect to it since you gotta find keycards and
shit and press buttons to unlock shield gates
this ends with you fighting a heart which if you defeat, destroys the
blockade that prevents you from entering the outpost vault

also you can no longer literally just cut indestructible grilles or
unanchor indestructible windows

### new puzzle elements or something idk
variant of pressure plate that you cannot remove and it sends a puzzle
signal
cooler red puzzle doors that look very foreboding or something idk
theyre for this ruin
also puzzle blockades, which are indestructible dense objects that are
destroyed if they receive a puzzle signal
and also buttons and keycard pads for puzzles

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/9d5d9dd1-5868-44e6-a978-5ea57b30c298

stuff that throws electric shocks in a pattern, ignores insuls and only
knocks down, and no you cannot just run past


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/5772917c-a963-48a4-a743-b0f610801d25

### enemies
living floor, it can only attack stuff on top of it and it attacks until
the victim is dead
it is invincible to all but a crowbar, and it cannot move, and it
remains hidden until a victim is in range


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/aa1d54f6-b259-4e58-9d44-e393d2131acf

living flesh, it can replace your limbs with itself
the conditions for that are; the limb must have 20 or more brute, victim
must be alive and dismemberable, the limb may not be torso or head, or
the limb may not be living flesh
alternatively it can replace a missing limb
these are all checked with every attack
they have 20 hp
the limbs in question will sometimes act up, while passively draining
nutrition, arms will randomly start pulling nearby stuff, legs may step
randomly
limbs when detached, turn into mobs and reactivate AI 2 seconds later.
if the host is shocked, all living flesh limbs will detach, or if the
host dies they will also do that


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/765cc99e-c800-4efb-aabe-d68817bbd7ae



## Why It's Good For The Game

ruin variety is cool i think
also the other things i added should be useful for other mappers for
bitrunning or whatever

also bug bad for that one fix
## Changelog
:cl:
add: living floor, living flesh, and other stuff for the bioresearch
outpost ruin
add: bioresearch outpost ruin
fix: you may not defeat indestructible grilles and windows with mere
tools

Basic Pirate NPCs (#79284)

## About The Pull Request

Converts hostile pirate NPCs to basic mobs - specifically, a subtype of
trooper. As their behavior is not meaningfully distinct from other
troopers, this conversion mostly just sticks them on the existing AI
behavior while keeping the rest the same.

Pirates do have one new thing going for them, though, to differentiate
them from other troopers. They use the new **plundering attacks**
component, which means that every time they land a melee attack, they
steal money from the bank account of whoever they hit. This requires the
target to be wearing an ID with a linked bank account, so it's not the
hardest thing in the world to hide your money from them - but it's still
something to be wary of! If killed, any mob with this component will
drop everything they've stolen in a convenient holochip.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Takes down 5 more simplemobs, and (I think) converts the last remaining
trooper-type enemy to be a basic trooper. (It's possible there's more
I've forgotten that could use the same AI, though.)

The money-stealing behavior is mostly good because I think it's funny,
but it also makes the pirates something a little distinct from "yet
another mob that runs at you and punches you until you die". They still
do that, but now there's a little twist! This can be placed on other
mobs too, if we want to make any other sorts of thieves or brigands.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Pirate NPCs now use the basic mob framework. They'll be a
little smarter in combat, and if you're wearing your ID they'll siphon
your bank account with every melee attack! Beware! Please report any
bugs.

Reworks The Visuals Of Independent And Nanotrasen Captains (#2453)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Does what it says in the title. This is a demented PR that touches a lot
of things, but its main benefit is that now regular independent
captains, cowboy independent captains, and nanotrasen captains have a
unique identity.

Of those changed, it includes:

- The Nanotrasen Captain (parade)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/48a31cb1-b266-43cb-9b6e-525028893011)

- The Nanotrasen Captain (regular)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/799c88f0-b7ce-4736-956d-2e9c0a096433)

- The Independent Captain (regular/parade)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/17ecb3d3-5f2f-4ce0-a518-81366945ebdf)

- The Independent Captain (western)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/a56a798c-5adf-41d7-917a-730661f306ed)

The PR also axes a bunch of unused, or frankly quite basic lieutenant
outfits that were nothing more than set dressing with not much substance
behind them. The roles were not removed for now, and they have
appropriate outfits as a placeholder pending a full removal.

This also means that the Head of Personnel was slightly touched up,
mostly by having a coat and hat similar to the western captain's when
appropriate. The role itself is pending a full visual rework for later
that is beyond the scope of this PR.

Speaking of removals, this also means that captain outfits/roles that
were there as a legacy of removed ships, were finally axed for good.
Goodbye deserter captain for Riggs variant number 4, you will not be
missed.

This PR also touches several (a lot) of maps, mostly adding/removing
outfits that were either missing, or didn't fit with the dress code of
the vessel.

Also the PR fixes an oversight by @MarkSuckerberg by making the BYOND
version warning an actual warning, instead of an error when compiling.
Etto bleh.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Visual cohesion is important, and dear fucking god if I see one more
independent western captain not wearing the duster because it wasn't in
the ship, I will weep, and my weeping will cause a biblical deluge.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would

Importance of Affordable surgery hospital in India and surgery options
When it comes to guaranteeing fair access to necessary medical services and enhancing the general wellbeing of people and communities, affordable healthcare and surgical choices are of utmost importance.

 Here are some main arguments supporting the importance of accessibility to medical treatment and surgery:

Universal Access to Healthcare:   Universal access to medical care is made possible by affordable healthcare and surgical choices.

 People from all socioeconomic backgrounds can obtain timely and required healthcare without experiencing financial challenges when medical treatments are financially accessible.

 This inclusiveness encourages population health and lessens health outcomes inequalities.

Enhancing Health and Quality of Life:  People can take proactive steps to manage medical issues and avoid future repercussions thanks to accessible healthcare and surgical choices.

 Early detection and intervention result in better health outcomes, a higher standard of living, and higher societal output.

Reducing Financial Burden:   High healthcare expenditures can be a serious strain on families and individuals, causing worry about money and in some cases even bankruptcy. 

This burden is lessened by accessible solutions, enabling patients to concentrate on their rehabilitation rather than worrying about astronomical medical expenses.

Encouraging Preventive Care:    People are more likely to seek out preventative treatment and routine checkups when healthcare is more affordable. Early identification and treatment of health problems can avert more serious illnesses and lower long-term medical expenses.

Supporting Sustainable Healthcare Systems:   Reasonable healthcare options guarantee a constant flow of patients seeking curative and preventive care, which supports healthcare systems. 

The long-term operation and enhancement of healthcare infrastructure depend on this sustainability.

Fostering Social Equality:  By guaranteeing that everyone, regardless of their financial situation, has access to necessary medical services, 

affordable healthcare and surgical choices play a critical role in promoting social equality.

 This helps to create a society that is more just and equal.

Conclusion:

It is essential to have access to cheap medical care and surgical procedures. It is a fundamental human right as well as an issue of financial concern. 

A stronger workforce, more inclusive society, and healthier communities all result from accessible healthcare.

We may work toward creating a society where high-quality medical services are accessible to everyone, irrespective of their financial situation, by emphasising affordability in healthcare.  Get an appointment for the free consulation.

i added a space to the mi amigos to make it gramattically correct

God createth Heaven and Earth, and all things therein, in six days.\r\n\r\n1:1. In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.\r\n\r\n1:2. And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of\r\nthe deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.\r\n\r\n1:3. And God said: Be light made. And light was made.\r\n\r\n1:4. And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light\r\nfrom the darkness.\r\n\r\n1:5. And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was\r\nevening and morning one day.\r\n\r\n1:6. And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and\r\nlet it divide the waters from the waters.\r\n\r\nA firmament... By this name is here understood the whole space between\r\nthe earth, and the highest stars. The lower part of which divideth the\r\nwaters that are upon the earth, from those that are above in the clouds.\r\n\r\n1:7. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under\r\nthe firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.\r\n\r\n1:8. And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning\r\nwere the second day.\r\n\r\n1:9. God also said; Let the waters that are under the heaven, be\r\ngathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it\r\nwas so done.\r\n\r\n1:10. And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of\r\nthe waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:11. And he said: let the earth bring forth green herb, and such as may\r\nseed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have\r\nseed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.\r\n\r\n1:12. And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth\r\nseed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed\r\neach one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:13. And the evening and the morning were the third day.\r\n\r\n1:14. And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven,\r\nto divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for\r\nseasons, and for days and years:\r\n\r\n1:15. To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the\r\nearth, and it was so done.\r\n\r\n1:16. And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day;\r\nand a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.\r\n\r\nTwo great lights... God created on the first day, light, which being\r\nmoved from east to west, by its rising and setting, made morning and\r\nevening. But on the fourth day he ordered and distributed this light,\r\nand made the sun, moon, and stars. The moon, though much less than the\r\nstars, is here called a great light, from its giving a far greater light\r\nto the earth than any of them.\r\n\r\n1:17. And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n1:18. And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the\r\ndarkness. And God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:19. And the evening and morning were the fourth day.\r\n\r\n1:20. God also said: let the waters bring forth the creeping creature\r\nhaving life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the\r\nfirmament of heaven.\r\n\r\n1:21. And God created the great whales, and every living and moving\r\ncreature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and\r\nevery winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:22. And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the\r\nwaters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.\r\n\r\n1:23. And the evening and morning were the fifth day.\r\n\r\n1:24. And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its\r\nkind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to\r\ntheir kinds. And it was so done.\r\n\r\n1:25. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and\r\ncattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And\r\nGod saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:26. And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let\r\nhim have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air,\r\nand the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that\r\nmoveth upon the earth.\r\n\r\nLet us make man to our image... This image of God in man, is not in the\r\nbody, but in the soul; which is a spiritual substance, endued with\r\nunderstanding and free will. God speaketh here in the plural number, to\r\ninsinuate the plurality of persons in the Deity.\r\n\r\n1:27. And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he\r\ncreated him: male and female he created them.\r\n\r\n1:28. And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the\r\nearth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls\r\nof the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.\r\n\r\nIncrease and multiply... This is not a precept, as some Protestant\r\ncontrovertists would have it, but a blessing, rendering them fruitful;\r\nfor God had said the same words to the fishes, and birds, (ver. 22) who\r\nwere incapable of receiving a precept.\r\n\r\n1:29. And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon\r\nthe earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind,\r\nto be your meat:\r\n\r\n1:30. And to all beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and\r\nto all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they\r\nmay have to feed upon. And it was so done.\r\n\r\n1:31. And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very\r\ngood. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 2\r\n\r\nGod resteth on the seventh day and blesseth it. The earthly paradise, in\r\nwhich God placeth man. He commandeth him not to eat of the tree of\r\nknowledge. And formeth a woman of his rib.\r\n\r\n2:1. So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n2:2. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he\r\nrested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.\r\n\r\nHe rested, etc... That is, he ceased to make or create any new kinds of\r\nthings. Though, as our Lord tells us, John 5.17, \"He still worketh\",\r\nviz., by conserving and governing all things, and creating souls.\r\n\r\n2:3. And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he\r\nhad rested from all his work which God created and made.\r\n\r\n2:4. These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they\r\nwere created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the\r\nearth:\r\n\r\n2:5. And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and\r\nevery herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained\r\nupon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.\r\n\r\n2:6. But a spring rose out of the earth, watering all the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n2:7. And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed\r\ninto his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\r\n\r\n2:8. And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the\r\nbeginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.\r\n\r\n2:9. And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees,\r\nfair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the\r\nmidst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\r\n\r\nThe tree of life... So called because it had that quality, that by\r\neating of the fruit of it, man would have been preserved in a constant\r\nstate of health, vigour, and strength, and would not have died at all.\r\nThe tree of knowledge... To which the deceitful serpent falsely\r\nattributed the power of imparting a superior kind of knowledge, beyond\r\nthat which God was pleased to give.\r\n\r\n2:10. And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise,\r\nwhich from thence is divided into four heads.\r\n\r\n2:11. The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the\r\nland of Hevilath, where gold groweth.\r\n\r\n2:12. And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium,\r\nand the onyx stone.\r\n\r\n2:13. And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that\r\ncompasseth all the land of Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n2:14. And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along\r\nby the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\r\n\r\n2:15. And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise of\r\npleasure, to dress it, and to keep it.\r\n\r\n2:16. And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt\r\neat:\r\n\r\n2:17. But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat.\r\nFor in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.\r\n\r\n2:18. And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us\r\nmake him a help like unto himself.\r\n\r\n2:19. And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of\r\nthe earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see\r\nwhat he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature\r\nthe same is its name.\r\n\r\n2:20. And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls\r\nof the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not\r\nfound a helper like himself.\r\n\r\n2:21. Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was\r\nfast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.\r\n\r\n2:22. And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a\r\nwoman: and brought her to Adam.\r\n\r\n2:23. And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my\r\nflesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.\r\n\r\n2:24. Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to\r\nhis wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.\r\n\r\n2:25. And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 3\r\n\r\nThe serpent's craft. The fall of our first parents. Their punishment.\r\nThe promise of a Redeemer.\r\n\r\n3:1. Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth\r\nwhich the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God\r\ncommanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?\r\n\r\n3:2. And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that\r\nare in paradise we do eat:\r\n\r\n3:3. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God\r\nhath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch\r\nit, lest perhaps we die.\r\n\r\n3:4. And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.\r\n\r\n3:5. For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof,\r\nyour eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n3:6. And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the\r\neyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and\r\ndid eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.\r\n\r\n3:7. And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived\r\nthemselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made\r\nthemselves aprons.\r\n\r\nAnd the eyes, etc... Not that they were blind before, (for the woman saw\r\nthat the tree was fair to the eyes, ver. 6.) nor yet that their eyes\r\nwere opened to any more perfect knowledge of good; but only to the\r\nunhappy experience of having lost the good of original grace and\r\ninnocence, and incurred the dreadful evil of sin. From whence followed a\r\nshame of their being naked; which they minded not before; because being\r\nnow stript of original grace, they quickly began to be subject to the\r\nshameful rebellions of the flesh.\r\n\r\n3:8. And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise\r\nat the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of\r\nthe Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.\r\n\r\n3:9. And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?\r\n\r\n3:10. And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid,\r\nbecause I was naked, and I hid myself.\r\n\r\n3:11. And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked,\r\nbut that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou\r\nshouldst not eat?\r\n\r\n3:12. And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion,\r\ngave me of the tree, and I did eat.\r\n\r\n3:13. And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And\r\nshe answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.\r\n\r\n3:14. And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this\r\nthing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon\r\nthy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n3:15. I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and\r\nher seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her\r\nheel.\r\n\r\nShe shall crush... Ipsa, the woman; so divers of the fathers read this\r\nplace, conformably to the Latin: others read it ipsum, viz., the seed.\r\nThe sense is the same: for it is by her seed, Jesus Christ, that the\r\nwoman crushes the serpent's head.\r\n\r\n3:16. To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy\r\nconceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt\r\nbe under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee.\r\n\r\n3:17. And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of\r\nthy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that\r\nthou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work: with labour and\r\ntoil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.\r\n\r\n3:18. Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt\r\neat the herbs of the earth.\r\n\r\n3:19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to\r\nthe earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust\r\nthou shalt return.\r\n\r\n3:20. And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the\r\nmother of all the living.\r\n\r\n3:21. And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins, and\r\nclothed them.\r\n\r\n3:22. And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and\r\nevil: now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of\r\nthe tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.\r\n\r\nBehold Adam, etc... This was spoken by way of reproaching him with his\r\npride, in affecting a knowledge that might make him like to God.\r\n\r\n3:23. And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till\r\nthe earth from which he was taken.\r\n\r\n3:24. And he cast out Adam: and placed before the paradise of pleasure\r\nCherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of\r\nthe tree of life.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 4\r\n\r\nThe history of Cain and Abel.\r\n\r\n4:1. And Adam knew Eve his wife; who conceived and brought forth Cain,\r\nsaying: I have gotten a man through God.\r\n\r\n4:2. And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a\r\nshepherd, and Cain a husbandman.\r\n\r\n4:3. And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the\r\nfruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.\r\n\r\n4:4. Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat:\r\nand the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.\r\n\r\nHad respect... That is, shewed his acceptance of his sacrifice (as\r\ncoming from a heart full of devotion): and that, as we may suppose, by\r\nsome visible token, such as sending fire from heaven upon his offerings.\r\n\r\n4:5. But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was\r\nexceeding angry, and his countenance fell.\r\n\r\n4:6. And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy\r\ncountenance fallen?\r\n\r\n4:7. If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin\r\nforthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under\r\nthee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.\r\n\r\n4:8. And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when\r\nthey were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n4:9. And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he\r\nanswered: I know not: am I my brother's keeper?\r\n\r\n4:10. And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy\r\nbrother's blood crieth to me from the earth.\r\n\r\n4:11. Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath\r\nopened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand.\r\n\r\n4:12. When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a\r\nfugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.\r\n\r\n4:13. And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may\r\ndeserve pardon.\r\n\r\n4:14. Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth,\r\nand from thy face I shall be hid, and I shall be a vagabond and a\r\nfugitive on the earth: every one, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill\r\nme.\r\n\r\nEvery one that findeth me shall kill me... His guilty conscience made\r\nhim fear his own brothers and nephews; of whom, by this time, there might\r\nbe a good number upon the earth; which had now endured near 130 years;\r\nas may be gathered from Gen. 5.3, compared with chap. 4.25, though in\r\nthe compendious account given in the scriptures, only Cain and Abel are\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n4:15. And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not so be: but whosoever\r\nshall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark\r\nupon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.\r\n\r\nSet a mark, etc... The more common opinion of the interpreters of holy\r\nwrit supposes this mark to have been a trembling of the body; or a\r\nhorror and consternation in his countenance.\r\n\r\n4:16. And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a\r\nfugitive on the earth at the east side of Eden.\r\n\r\n4:17. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth\r\nHenoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of\r\nhis son Henoch.\r\n\r\nHis wife... She was a daughter of Adam, and Cain's own sister; God\r\ndispensing with such marriages in the beginning of the world, as mankind\r\ncould not otherwise be propagated. He built a city, viz... In process of\r\ntime, when his race was multiplied, so as to be numerous enough to\r\npeople it. For in the many hundred years he lived, his race might be\r\nmultiplied even to millions.\r\n\r\n4:18. And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot\r\nMathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech,\r\n\r\n4:19. Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of\r\nthe other Sella.\r\n\r\n4:20. And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell\r\nin tents, and of herdsmen.\r\n\r\n4:21. And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of them that\r\nplay upon the harp and the organs.\r\n\r\n4:22. Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and\r\nartificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain\r\nwas Noema.\r\n\r\n4:23. And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella: Hear my voice, ye\r\nwives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the\r\nwounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.\r\n\r\nI have slain a man, etc... It is the tradition of the Hebrews, that\r\nLamech in hunting slew Cain, mistaking him for a wild beast; and that\r\nhaving discovered what he had done, he beat so unmercifully the youth,\r\nby whom he was led into that mistake, that he died of the blows.\r\n\r\n4:24. Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech\r\nseventy times sevenfold.\r\n\r\n4:25. Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and\r\ncalled his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed for Abel,\r\nwhom Cain slew.\r\n\r\n4:26. But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos: this man\r\nbegan to call upon the name of the Lord.\r\n\r\nBegan to call upon, etc... Not that Adam and Seth had not called upon\r\nGod, before the birth of Enos; but that Enos used more solemnity in the\r\nworship and invocation of God.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 5\r\n\r\nThe genealogy, age, and death of the Patriarchs, from Adam to Noe. The\r\ntranslation of Henoch.\r\n\r\n5:1. This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that God\r\ncreated man, he made him to the likeness of God.\r\n\r\n5:2. He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their\r\nname Adam, in the day when they were created.\r\n\r\n5:3. And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his\r\nown image and likeness, and called his name Seth.\r\n\r\n5:4. And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred\r\nyears: and he begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n5:5. And all the time that Adam lived, came to nine hundred and thirty\r\nyears, and he died.\r\n\r\n5:6. Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enos.\r\n\r\n5:7. And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years,\r\nand begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n5:8. And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n5:9. And Enos lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.\r\n\r\n5:10. After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and\r\nbegot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n5:11. And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n5:12. And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Malaleel.\r\n\r\n5:13. And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel, eight hundred and forty\r\nyears, and begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n5:14. And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n5:15. And Malaleel lived sixty-five years and begot Jared.\r\n\r\n5:16. And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared, eight hundred and thirty\r\nyears, and begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n5:17. And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five\r\nyears, and he died.\r\n\r\n5:18. And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Henoch.\r\n\r\n5:19. And Jared lived after he begot Henoch, eight hundred years, and\r\nbegot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n5:20. And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years,\r\nand he died.\r\n\r\n5:21. And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Mathusala.\r\n\r\n5:22. And Henoch walked with God: and lived after he begot Mathusala,\r\nthree hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n5:23. And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty-five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n5:24. And he walked with God, and was seen no more: because God took\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n5:25. And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot\r\nLamech.\r\n\r\n5:26. And Mathlusala lived after he begot Lamech, seven hundred and\r\neighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n5:27. And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and sixty-nine\r\nyears, and he died.\r\n\r\n5:28. And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.\r\n\r\n5:29. And he called his name Noe, saying: This same shall comfort us\r\nfrom the works and labours of our hands on the earth, which the Lord\r\nhath cursed.\r\n\r\n5:30. And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five hundred and ninety-five\r\nyears, and begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n5:31. And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy-seven\r\nyears, and he died. And Noe, when he was five hundred years old, begot\r\nSem, Cham, and Japheth.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 6\r\n\r\nMan's sin is the cause of the deluge. Noe is commanded to build the ark.\r\n\r\n6:1. And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and\r\ndaughters were born to them,\r\n\r\n6:2. The sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair,\r\ntook to themselves wives of all which they chose.\r\n\r\nThe sons of God... The descendants of Seth and Enos are here called sons\r\nof God from their religion and piety: whereas the ungodly race of Cain,\r\nwho by their carnal affections lay grovelling upon the earth, are called\r\nthe children of men. The unhappy consequence of the former marrying with\r\nthe latter, ought to be a warning to Christians to be very circumspect\r\nin their marriages; and not to suffer themselves to be determined in\r\ntheir choice by their carnal passion, to the prejudice of virtue or\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n6:3. And God said: My spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because\r\nhe is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.\r\n\r\nHis days shall be, etc... The meaning is, that man's days, which before\r\nthe flood were usually 900 years, should now be reduced to 120 years. Or\r\nrather, that God would allow men this term of 120 years, for their\r\nrepentance and conversion, before he would send the deluge.\r\n\r\n6:4. Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of\r\nGod went in to the daughters of men, and they brought forth children,\r\nthese are the mighty men of old, men of renown.\r\n\r\nGiants... It is likely the generality of men before the flood were of a\r\ngigantic stature in comparison with what men now are. But these here\r\nspoken of are called giants, as being not only tall in stature, but\r\nviolent and savage in their dispositions, and mere monsters of cruelty\r\nand lust.\r\n\r\n6:5. And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth,\r\nand that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\r\n\r\n6:6. It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being\r\ntouched inwardly with sorrow of heart,\r\n\r\nIt repented him, etc... God, who is unchangeable, is not capable of\r\nrepentance, grief, or any other passion. But these expressions are used\r\nto declare the enormity of the sins of men, which was so provoking as to\r\ndetermine their Creator to destroy these his creatures, whom before he\r\nhad so much favoured.\r\n\r\n6:7. He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of\r\nthe earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the\r\nfowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.\r\n\r\n6:8. But Noe found grace before the Lord.\r\n\r\n6:9. These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in\r\nhis generations, he walked with God.\r\n\r\n6:10. And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.\r\n\r\n6:11. And the earth was corrupted before God, and was filled with\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\n6:12. And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh\r\nhad corrupted its way upon the earth),\r\n\r\n6:13. He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth\r\nis filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n6:14. Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in\r\nthe ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.\r\n\r\n6:15. And thus shalt thou make it. The length of the ark shall be three\r\nhundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it\r\nthirty cubits.\r\n\r\nThree hundred cubits, etc... The ark, according to the dimensions here\r\nset down, contained four hundred and fifty thousand square cubits; which\r\nwas more than enough to contain all the kinds of living creatures, with\r\nall necessary provisions: even supposing the cubits here spoken of to\r\nhave been only a foot and a half each, which was the least kind of\r\ncubits.\r\n\r\n6:16. Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou\r\nfinish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the\r\nside: with lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt thou make it.\r\n\r\n6:17. Behold, I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth,\r\nto destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life under heaven. All\r\nthings that are in the earth shall be consumed.\r\n\r\n6:18. And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter\r\ninto the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons\r\nwith thee.\r\n\r\n6:19. And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of\r\na sort into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and\r\nthe female.\r\n\r\n6:20. Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in their kind, and\r\nof every thing that creepeth on the earth according to its kind: two of\r\nevery sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.\r\n\r\n6:21. Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou\r\nshalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.\r\n\r\n6:22. And Noe did all things which God commanded him.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 7\r\n\r\nNoe with his family go into the ark. The deluge overflows the earth.\r\n\r\n7:1. And the Lord said to him: Go in, thou and all thy house, into the\r\nark: for thee I have seen just before me in this generation.\r\n\r\n7:2. Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, the male and the female.\r\n\r\nOf all clean... The distintion of clean and unclean beasts appears to\r\nhave been made before the law of Moses, which was not promulgated till\r\nthe year of the world 2514.\r\n\r\n7:3. But of the beasts that are unclean two and two, the male and the\r\nfemale. Of the fowls also of the air seven and seven, the male and the\r\nfemale: that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth.\r\n\r\n7:4. For yet a while, and after seven days, I will rain upon the earth\r\nforty days and forty nights: and I will destroy every substance that I\r\nhave made, from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n7:5. And Noe did all things which the Lord had commanded him.\r\n\r\n7:6. And he was six hundred years old, when the waters of the flood\r\noverflowed the earth.\r\n\r\n7:7. And Noe went in and his sons, his wife and the wives of his sons\r\nwith him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\r\n\r\n7:8. And of beasts clean and unclean, and of fowls, and of every thing\r\nthat moveth upon the earth,\r\n\r\n7:9. Two and two went in to Noe into the ark, male and female, as the\r\nLord had commanded Noe.\r\n\r\n7:10. And after the seven days were passed, the waters of the flood\r\noverflowed the earth.\r\n\r\n7:11. In the six hundredth year of the life of Noe, in the second month,\r\nin the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep\r\nwere broken up, and the floodgates of heaven were opened:\r\n\r\n7:12. And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\r\n\r\n7:13. In the selfsame day Noe, and Sem, and Cham, and Japheth, his sons:\r\nhis wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark.\r\n\r\n7:14. They and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle in\r\ntheir kind, and every thing that moveth upon the earth, according to its\r\nkind, and every fowl according to its kind, all birds, and all that fly,\r\n\r\n7:15. Went in to Noe into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein was\r\nthe breath of life.\r\n\r\n7:16. And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as\r\nGod had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in on the outside.\r\n\r\n7:17. And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and the waters\r\nincreased, and lifted up the ark on high from the earth.\r\n\r\n7:18. For they overflowed exceedingly: and filled all on the face of the\r\nearth: and the ark was carried upon the waters.\r\n\r\n7:19. And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the earth: and all\r\nthe high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.\r\n\r\n7:20. The water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\n7:21. And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth, both of\r\nfowl and of cattle, and of beasts, and of all creeping things that creep\r\nupon the earth: and all men.\r\n\r\n7:22. And all things wherein there is the breath of life on the earth,\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n7:23. And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the earth, from\r\nman even to beast, and the creeping things and fowls of the air: and\r\nthey were destroyed from the earth: and Noe only remained, and they that\r\nwere with him in the ark.\r\n\r\n7:24. And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 8\r\n\r\nThe deluge ceaseth. Noe goeth out of the ark, and offereth a sacrifice.\r\nGod's covenant to him.\r\n\r\n8:1. And God remembered Noe, and all the living creatures, and all the\r\ncattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the\r\nearth, and the waters were abated:\r\n\r\n8:2. The fountains also of the deep, and the floodgates of heaven, were\r\nshut up, and the rain from heaven was restrained.\r\n\r\n8:3. And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and\r\nthey began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.\r\n\r\n8:4. And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seven and twentieth\r\nday of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.\r\n\r\n8:5. And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for\r\nin the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the\r\nmountains appeared.\r\n\r\n8:6. And after that forty days were passed, Noe opening the window of\r\nthe ark, which he had made, sent forth a raven:\r\n\r\n8:7. Which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\nDid not return... The raven did not return into the ark; but (as it may\r\nbe gathered from the Hebrew) went to and fro; sometimes going to the\r\nmountains, where it found carcasses to feed on: and other times\r\nreturning, to rest upon the top of the ark.\r\n\r\n8:8. He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now\r\nceased upon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n8:9. But she not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into\r\nthe ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his\r\nhand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.\r\n\r\n8:10. And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the\r\ndove out of the ark.\r\n\r\n8:11. And she came to him in the evening carrying a bough of an olive\r\ntree, with green leaves, in her mouth. Noe therefore understood that the\r\nwaters were ceased upon the earth.\r\n\r\n8:12. And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove,\r\nwhich returned not any more unto him.\r\n\r\n8:13. Therefore in the six hundredth and first year, the first month,\r\nthe first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and\r\nNoe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of\r\nthe earth was dried.\r\n\r\n8:14. In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the\r\nearth was dried.\r\n\r\n8:15. And God spoke to Noe, saying:\r\n\r\n8:16. Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons and the wives of\r\nthy sons with thee.\r\n\r\n8:17. All living things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in\r\nfowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth,\r\nbring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase and multiply\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n8:18. So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his\r\nsons with him.\r\n\r\n8:19. And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep\r\nupon the earth, according to their kinds went out of the ark.\r\n\r\n8:20. And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of all cattle and\r\nfowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.\r\n\r\nHolocausts,... or whole burnt offerings. In which the whole victim was\r\nconsumed by fire upon God's altar, and no part was reserved for the use\r\nof priest or people.\r\n\r\n8:21. And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more\r\ncurse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of\r\nman's heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore I will no more\r\ndestroy every living soul as I have done.\r\n\r\nSmelled, etc... A figurative expression, denoting that God was well\r\npleased with the sacrifices which his servant offered.\r\n\r\n8:22. All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat,\r\nsummer and winter, night and day, shall not cease.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 9\r\n\r\nGod besseth Noe: forbiddeth blood, and promiseth never more to destroy\r\nthe world by water. The blessing of Sem and Japheth.\r\n\r\n9:1. And God blessed Noe and his sons. And he said to them: Increase,\r\nand multiply, and fill the earth.\r\n\r\n9:2. And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the\r\nearth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all that move upon the\r\nearth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.\r\n\r\n9:3. And every thing that moveth, and liveth shall be meat for you: even\r\nas the green herbs have I delivered them all to you:\r\n\r\n9:4. Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.\r\n\r\n9:5. For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every\r\nbeast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his\r\nbrother, will I require the life of man.\r\n\r\n9:6. Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood shall be shed: for man\r\nwas made to the image of God.\r\n\r\n9:7. But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth and fill it.\r\n\r\n9:8. Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sons with him:\r\n\r\n9:9. Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed\r\nafter you:\r\n\r\n9:10. And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds,\r\nas in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of the\r\nark, and in all the beasts of the earth.\r\n\r\n9:11. I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no\r\nmore destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from\r\nhenceforth a flood to waste the earth.\r\n\r\n9:12. And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which I give\r\nbetween me and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for\r\nperpetual generations.\r\n\r\n9:13. I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a\r\ncovenant between me and between the earth.\r\n\r\n9:14. And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in\r\nthe clouds:\r\n\r\n9:15. And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living\r\nsoul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to\r\ndestroy all flesh.\r\n\r\n9:16. And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall\r\nremember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every\r\nliving soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.\r\n\r\n9:17. And God said to Noe: This shall be the sign of the covenant, which\r\nI have established, between me and all flesh upon the earth.\r\n\r\n9:18. And the sons of Noe, who came out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, and\r\nJapheth: and Cham is the father of Chanaan.\r\n\r\n9:19. These three are the sons of Noe: and from these was all mankind\r\nspread over the whole earth.\r\n\r\n9:20. And Noe a husbandman began to till the ground, and planted a\r\nvineyard.\r\n\r\n9:21. And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nDrunk... Noe by the judgment of the fathers was not guilty of sin, in\r\nbeing overcome by wine: because he knew not the strength of it.\r\n\r\n9:22. Which when Cham the father of Chanaan had seen, to wit, that his\r\nfather's nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n9:23. But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going\r\nbackward, covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were\r\nturned away, and they saw not their father's nakedness.\r\n\r\nCovered the nakedness... Thus, as St. Gregory takes notice L. 35; Moral.\r\nc. 22, we ought to cover the nakedness, that is, the sins, of our\r\nspiritual parents and superiors.\r\n\r\n9:24. And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his\r\nyounger son had done to him,\r\n\r\n9:25. He said: Cursed be Chanaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto\r\nhis brethren.\r\n\r\nCursed be Chanaan... The curses, as well as the blessings, of the\r\npartiarchs, were prophetical: And this in particular is here recorded by\r\nMoses, for the children of Israel, who were to possess the land of\r\nChanaan. But why should Chanaan be cursed for his father's faults? The\r\nHebrews answer, that he being then a boy, was the first that saw his\r\ngrandfather's nakedness, and told his father Cham of it; and joined with\r\nhim in laughing at it: which drew upon him, rather than upon the rest of\r\nthe children of Cham, this prophetical curse.\r\n\r\n9:26. And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be Chanaan his\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n9:27. May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and\r\nChanaan be his servant.\r\n\r\n9:28. And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\n9:29. And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years:\r\nand he died.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 10\r\n\r\nThe genealogy of the children of Noe, by whom the world was peopled\r\nafter the flood.\r\n\r\n10:1. These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem, Cham, and\r\nJapheth: and unto them sons were born after the flood.\r\n\r\n10:2. The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and\r\nThubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.\r\n\r\n10:3. And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.\r\n\r\n10:4. And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis, Cetthim and Dodanim.\r\n\r\n10:5. By these were divided the islands of the Gentiles in their lands,\r\nevery one according to his tongue and their families in their nations.\r\n\r\nThe islands... So the Hebrews called all the remote countries, to which\r\nthey went by ships from Judea, to Greece, Italy, Spain, etc.\r\n\r\n10:6. And the Sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesram, and Phuth, and Chanaan.\r\n\r\n10:7. And the sons of Chus: Saba, and Hevila, and Sabatha, and Regma,\r\nand Sabatacha. The sons of Regma: Saba, and Dadan.\r\n\r\n10:8. Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be mighty on the earth.\r\n\r\n10:9. And he was a stout hunter before the Lord. Hence came a proverb:\r\nEven as Nemrod the stout hunter before the Lord.\r\n\r\nA stout hunter... Not of beasts but of men: whom by violence and tyranny\r\nhe brought under his dominion. And such he was, not only in the opinion\r\nof men, but before the Lord, that is, in his sight who cannot be\r\ndeceived.\r\n\r\n10:10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Arach, and\r\nAchad, and Chalanne in the land of Sennaar.\r\n\r\n10:11. Out of that land came forth Assur, and built Ninive, and the\r\nstreets of the city, and Chale.\r\n\r\n10:12. Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this is the great city.\r\n\r\n10:13. And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim and Laabim, Nephthuim.\r\n\r\n10:14. And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom came forth the Philistines,\r\nand the Capthorim.\r\n\r\n10:15. And Chanaan begot Sidon his firstborn, the Hethite,\r\n\r\n10:16. And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and the Gergesite.\r\n\r\n10:17. The Hevite and Aracite: the Sinite,\r\n\r\n10:18. And the Aradian, the Samarite, and the Hamathite: and afterwards\r\nthe families of the Chanaanites were spread abroad.\r\n\r\n10:19. And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon as one comes to Gerara\r\neven to Gaza, until thou enter Sodom and Gomorrha, and Adama, and Seboim\r\neven to Lesa.\r\n\r\n10:20. These are the children of Cham in their kindreds and tongues, and\r\ngenerations, and lands, and nations.\r\n\r\n10:21. Of Sem also the father of all the children of Heber, the elder\r\nbrother of Japheth, sons were born.\r\n\r\n10:22. The sons of Sem: Elam and Assur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.\r\n\r\n10:23. The sons of Aram: Us, and Hull, and Gether; and Mes.\r\n\r\n10:24. But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was born Heber.\r\n\r\n10:25. And to Heber were born two sons: the name of the one was Phaleg,\r\nbecause in his days was the earth divided: and his brother's name\r\nJectan.\r\n\r\n10:26. Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph, and Asarmoth, Jare,\r\n\r\n10:27. And Aduram, and Uzal, and Decla,\r\n\r\n10:28. And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,\r\n\r\n10:29. And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab. All these were the sons of\r\nJectan.\r\n\r\n10:30. And their dwelling was from Messa as we go on as far as Sephar, a\r\nmountain in the east.\r\n\r\n10:31. These are the children of Sem according to their kindreds and\r\ntongues, and countries in their nations.\r\n\r\n10:32. These are the families of Noe, according to their people and\r\nnations. By these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 11\r\n\r\nThe tower of Babel. The confusion of tongues. The genealogy of Sem down\r\nto Abram.\r\n\r\n11:1. And the earth was of one tongue, and of the same speech.\r\n\r\n11:2. And when they removed from the east, they found a plain in the\r\nland of Sennaar, and dwelt in it.\r\n\r\n11:3. And each one said to his neighbour: Come let us make brick, and\r\nbake them with fire. And they had brick instead of stones, and slime\r\ninstead of mortar:\r\n\r\n11:4. And they said: Come, let us make a city and a tower, the top\r\nwhereof may reach to heaven; and let us make our name famous before we\r\nbe scattered abroad into all lands.\r\n\r\n11:5. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the\r\nchildren of Adam were building.\r\n\r\n11:6. And he said: Behold, it is one people, and all have one tongue:\r\nand they have begun to do this, neither will they leave off from their\r\ndesigns, till they accomplish them in deed.\r\n\r\n11:7. Come ye, therefore, let us go down, and there confound their\r\ntongue, that they may not understand one another's speech.\r\n\r\n11:8. And so the Lord scattered them from that place into all lands, and\r\nthey ceased to build the city.\r\n\r\n11:9. And therefore the name thereof was called Babel, because there the\r\nlanguage of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence the Lord\r\nscattered them abroad upon the face of all countries.\r\n\r\nBabel... That is, confusion.\r\n\r\n11:10. These are the generations of Sem: Sem was a hundred years old\r\nwhen he begot Arphaxad, two years after the flood.\r\n\r\n11:11. And Sem lived after he begot Arphaxad, five hundred years, and\r\nbegot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:12. And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Sale.\r\n\r\n11:13. And Arphaxad lived after he begot Sale, three hundred and three\r\nyears, and begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:14. Sale also lived thirty years, and begot Heber.\r\n\r\n11:15. And Sale lived after he begot Heber, four hundred and three\r\nyears: and begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:16. And Heber lived thirty-four years, and begot Phaleg.\r\n\r\n11:17. And Heber lived after he begot Phaleg, four hundred and thirty\r\nyears: and begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:18. Phaleg also lived thirty years, and begot Reu.\r\n\r\n11:19. And Phaleg lived after he begot Reu, two hundred and nine years,\r\nand begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:20. And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Sarug.\r\n\r\n11:21. And Reu lived after he begot Sarug, two hundred and seven years,\r\nand begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:22. And Sarug lived thirty years, and begot Nachor.\r\n\r\n11:23. And Sarug lived after he begot Nachor, two hundred years, and\r\nbegot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:24. And Nachor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Thare.\r\n\r\n11:25. And Nachor lived after he begot Thare, a hundred and nineteen\r\nyears, and begot sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:26. And Thare lived seventy years, and begot Abram, and Nachor, and\r\nAran.\r\n\r\n11:27. And these are the generations of Thare: Thare begot Abram,\r\nNachor, and Aran. And Aran begot Lot.\r\n\r\n11:28. And Aran died before Thare his father, in the land of his\r\nnativity in Ur of the Chaldees.\r\n\r\n11:29. And Abram and Nachor married wives: the name of Abram's wife was\r\nSarai: and the name of Nachor's wife, Melcha, the daughter of Aran,\r\nfather of Melcha and father of Jescha.\r\n\r\n11:30. And Sarai was barren, and had no children.\r\n\r\n11:31. And Thare took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Aran, his son's\r\nson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, the wife of Abram his son, and\r\nbrought them out of Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Chanaan:\r\nand they came as far as Haran, and dwelt there.\r\n\r\n11:32. And the days of Thare were two hundred and five years, and he\r\ndied in Haran.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 12\r\n\r\nThe call of Abram, and the promise made to him. He sojourneth in\r\nChanaan, and then by occasion of a famine, goeth down to Egypt.\r\n\r\n12:1. And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of thy country, and from\r\nthy kindred, and out of thy father's house, and come into the land which\r\nI shall shew thee.\r\n\r\n12:2. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and\r\nmagnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed.\r\n\r\n12:3. I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee,\r\nand IN THEE shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.\r\n\r\n12:4. So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him, and Lot went with\r\nhim: Abram was seventy-five years old when he went forth from Haran.\r\n\r\n12:5. And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all the\r\nsubstance which they had gathered, and the souls which they had gotten\r\nin Haran: and they went out to go into the land of Chanaan. And when\r\nthey were come into it,\r\n\r\n12:6. Abram passed through the country unto the place of Sichem, as far\r\nas the noble vale: now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land.\r\n\r\n12:7. And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed will\r\nI give this land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had\r\nappeared to him.\r\n\r\n12:8. And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east\r\nside of Bethel, he there pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west,\r\nand Hai on the east: he built there also an altar to the Lord, and\r\ncalled upon his name.\r\n\r\n12:9. And Abram went forward, going and proceeding on to the south.\r\n\r\n12:10. And there came a famine in the country: and Abram went down into\r\nEgypt, to sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land.\r\n\r\n12:11. And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his\r\nwife: I know that thou art a beautiful woman:\r\n\r\n12:12. And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is\r\nhis wife: and they will kill me, and keep thee.\r\n\r\n12:13. Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister: that I may\r\nbe well used for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake.\r\n\r\nMy sister... This was no lie; because she was his niece, being daughter\r\nto his brother Aran, and therefore, in the style of the Hebrews, she\r\nmight truly be called his sister, as Lot is called Abram's brother, Gen.\r\n14.14. See Gen. 20.12.\r\n\r\n12:14. And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman\r\nthat she was very beautiful.\r\n\r\n12:15. And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before him: and the\r\nwoman was taken into the house of Pharao.\r\n\r\n12:16. And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen\r\nand he-asses, and men servants, and maid servants, and she-asses, and\r\ncamels.\r\n\r\n12:17. But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous\r\nstripes for Sarai, Abram's wife.\r\n\r\n12:18. And Pharao called Abram, and said to him: What is this that thou\r\nhast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?\r\n\r\n12:19. For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might\r\ntake her to my wife? Now therefore there is thy wife, take her, and go\r\nthy way.\r\n\r\n12:20. And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram: and they led him\r\naway and his wife, and all that he had.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 13\r\n\r\nAbram and Lot part from each other. God's promise to Abram.\r\n\r\n13:1. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he\r\nhad, and Lot with him into the south.\r\n\r\n13:2. And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.\r\n\r\n13:3. And he returned by the way, that he came, from the south to\r\nBethel, to the place where before he had pitched his tent between Bethel\r\nand Hai,\r\n\r\n13:4. In the place of the altar which he had made before, and there he\r\ncalled upon the name of the Lord.\r\n\r\n13:5. But Lot also, who was with Abram, had flocks of sheep, and herds\r\nof beasts, and tents.\r\n\r\n13:6. Neither was the land able to bear them, that they might dwell\r\ntogether: for their substance was great, and they could not dwell\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n13:7. Whereupon also there arose a strife between the herdsmen of Abram\r\nand of Lot. And at that time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled in\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\n13:8. Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be no quarrel, I beseech\r\nthee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen: for\r\nwe are brethren.\r\n\r\n13:9. Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me, I pray thee:\r\nif thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the right: if thou choose\r\nthe right hand, I will pass to the left.\r\n\r\n13:10. And Lot lifting up his eyes, saw all the country about the\r\nJordan, which was watered throughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom\r\nand Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and like Egypt as one comes\r\nto Segor.\r\n\r\n13:11. And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan, and he\r\ndeparted from the east: and they were separated one brother from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n13:12. Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan: and Lot abode in the towns,\r\nthat were about the Jordan, and dwelt in Sodom.\r\n\r\n13:13. And the men of Sodom were very wicked, and sinners before the\r\nface of the Lord beyond measure.\r\n\r\n13:14. And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him:\r\nLift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the\r\nnorth and to the south, to the east and to the west.\r\n\r\n13:15. All the land which thou seest, I will give to thee, and to thy\r\nseed for ever.\r\n\r\n13:16. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if any man be\r\nable to number the dust of the earth, he shall be able to number thy\r\nseed also.\r\n\r\n13:17. Arise and walk through the land in the length, and the breadth\r\nthereof: for I will give it to thee.\r\n\r\n13:18. So Abram removing his tent, came, and dwelt by the vale of\r\nMambre, which is in Hebron: and he built there an altar to the Lord.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 14\r\n\r\nThe expedition of the four kings; the victory of Abram; he is blessed by\r\nMelchisedech.\r\n\r\n14:1. And it came to pass at that time, that Amraphel, king of Sennaar,\r\nand Arioch, king of Pontus, and Chodorlahomor, king of the Elamites, and\r\nThadal, king of nations,\r\n\r\n14:2. Made war against Bara, king of Sodom, and against Bersa, king of\r\nGomorrha, and against Sennaab, king of Adama, and against Semeber, king\r\nof Seboim, and against the king of Bala, which is Segor.\r\n\r\n14:3. All these came together into the woodland vale, which now is the\r\nsalt sea.\r\n\r\n14:4. For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve years, and in the\r\nthirteenth year they revolted from him.\r\n\r\n14:5. And in the fourteenth year came Chodorlahomor, and the kings that\r\nwere with him: and they smote the Raphaim in Astarothcarnaim, and the\r\nZuzim with them, and the Emim in Save of Cariathaim.\r\n\r\n14:6. And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir, even to the plains of\r\nPharan, which is in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n14:7. And they returned, and came to the fountain of Misphat, the same\r\nis Cades: and they smote all the country of the Amalecites, and the\r\nAmorrhean that dwelt in Asasonthamar.\r\n\r\n14:8. And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrha, and the king of\r\nAdama, and the king of Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor,\r\nwent out: and they set themselves against them in battle array, in the\r\nwoodland vale:\r\n\r\n14:9. To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the Elamites, and Thadal\r\nking of nations, and Amraphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of\r\nPontus: four kings against five.\r\n\r\n14:10. Now the woodland vale had many pits of slime. And the king of\r\nSodom, and the king of Gomorrha turned their backs, and were overthrown\r\nthere: and they that remained, fled to the mountain.\r\n\r\nOf slime. Bituminis... This was a kind of pitch, which served for mortar\r\nin the building of Babel, Gen. 11.3, and was used by Noe in pitching the\r\nark.\r\n\r\n14:11. And they took all the substance of the Sodomites, and\r\nGomorrhites, and all their victuals, and went their way:\r\n\r\n14:12. And Lot also, the son of Abram's brother, who dwelt in Sodom, and\r\nhis substance.\r\n\r\n14:13. And behold one, that had escaped, told Abram the Hebrew, who\r\ndwelt in the vale of Mambre the Amorrhite, the brother of Escol, and the\r\nbrother of Aner: for these had made a league with Abram.\r\n\r\n14:14. Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that his brother Lot was\r\ntaken, he numbered of the servants born in his house, three hundred and\r\neighteen, well appointed: and pursued them to Dan.\r\n\r\n14:15. And dividing his company, he rushed upon them in the night, and\r\ndefeated them: and pursued them as far as Hoba, which is on the left\r\nhand of Damascus.\r\n\r\n14:16. And he brought back all the substance, and Lot his brother, with\r\nhis substance, the women also, and the people.\r\n\r\n14:17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after he returned\r\nfrom the slaughter of Chodorlahomor, and of the kings that were with him\r\nin the vale of Save, which is the king's vale.\r\n\r\n14:18. But Melchisedech, the king of Salem, bringing forth bread and\r\nwine, for he was the priest of the most high God,\r\n\r\n14:19. Blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram by the most high God, who\r\ncreated heaven and earth.\r\n\r\n14:20. And blessed be the most high God, by whose protection, the\r\nenemies are in thy hands. And he gave him the tithes of all.\r\n\r\n14:21. And the king of Sodom said to Abram: Give me the persons, and the\r\nrest take to thyself.\r\n\r\n14:22. And he answered him: I lift up my hand to the Lord God the most\r\nhigh, the possessor of heaven and earth,\r\n\r\n14:23. That from the very woof thread unto the shoe latchet, I will not\r\ntake of any things that are thine, lest thou say: I have enriched Abram.\r\n\r\n14:24. Except such things as the young men have eaten, and the shares of\r\nthe men that came with me, Aner, Escol, and Mambre: these shall take\r\ntheir shares.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 15\r\n\r\nGod promiseth seed to Abram. His faith, sacrifice and vision.\r\n\r\n15:1. Now when these things were done, the word of the Lord came to\r\nAbram by a vision, saying: Fear not, Abram, I am thy protector, and thy\r\nreward exceeding great.\r\n\r\n15:2. And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou give me? I shall go\r\nwithout children: and the son of the steward of my house is this\r\nDamascus Eliezer.\r\n\r\n15:3. And Abram added: But to me thou hast not given seed: and lo my\r\nservant born in my house, shall be my heir.\r\n\r\n15:4. And immediately the word of the Lord came to him, saying: He\r\nshall not be thy heir: but he that shall come out of thy bowels, him\r\nshalt thou have for thy heir.\r\n\r\n15:5. And he brought him forth abroad, and said to him: Look up to\r\nheaven and number the stars if thou canst. And he said to him: So shall\r\nthy seed be.\r\n\r\n15:6. Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.\r\n\r\n15:7. And he said to him: I am the Lord who brought thee out from Ur of\r\nthe Chaldees, to give thee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.\r\n\r\n15:8. But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know that I shall possess it?\r\n\r\n15:9. And the Lord answered, and said: Take me a cow of three years old,\r\nand a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, a turtle also,\r\nand a pigeon.\r\n\r\n15:10. And he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid\r\nthe two pieces of each one against the other: but the birds he divided\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n15:11. And the fowls came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them\r\naway.\r\n\r\n15:12. And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a\r\ngreat and darksome horror seized upon him.\r\n\r\n15:13. And it was said unto him: Know thou beforehand that thy seed\r\nshall be a stranger in a land not their own, and they shall bring them\r\nunder bondage, and afflict them four hundred years.\r\n\r\n15:14. But I will judge the nation which they shall serve, and after\r\nthis they shall come out with great substance.\r\n\r\n15:15. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a\r\ngood old age.\r\n\r\n15:16. But in the fourth generation they shall return hither: for as yet\r\nthe iniquities of the Amorrhites are not at the full until this present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n15:17. And when the sun was set, there arose a dark mist, and there\r\nappeared a smoking furnace, and a lamp of fire passing between those\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n15:18. That day God made a covenant with Abram, saying: To thy seed will\r\nI give this land, from the river to Egypt even to the great river\r\nEuphrates.\r\n\r\n15:19. The Cineans, and Cenezites, the Cedmonites,\r\n\r\n15:20. And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the Raphaim also,\r\n\r\n15:21. And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanites, and the Gergesites, and\r\nthe Jebusites.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 16\r\n\r\nAbram marrieth Agar, who bringeth forth Ismael.\r\n\r\n16:1. Now Sarai, the wife of Abram, had brought forth no children: but\r\nhaving a handmaid, an Egyptian, named Agar,\r\n\r\n16:2. She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord hath restrained me from\r\nbearing: go in unto my handmaid, it may be I may have children of her at\r\nleast. And when he agreed to her request,\r\n\r\n16:3. She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they\r\nfirst dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.\r\n\r\nTo wife... Plurality of wives, though contrary to the primitive\r\ninstitution of marriage, Gen. 2.24, was by divine dispensation allowed\r\nto the patriarchs: which allowance seems to have continued during the\r\ntime of the law of Moses. But Christ our Lord reduced marriage to its\r\nprimitive institution. Matt. 19.\r\n\r\n16:4. And he went in to her. But she perceiving that she was with child,\r\ndespised her mistress.\r\n\r\n16:5. And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost unjustly with me: I gave my\r\nhandmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself to be with child,\r\ndespiseth me. The Lord judge between me and thee.\r\n\r\n16:6. And Abram made answer, and said to her: Behold thy handmaid is in\r\nthy own hand, use her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai afflicted her,\r\nshe ran away.\r\n\r\n16:7. And the angel of the Lord having found her, by a fountain of water\r\nin the wilderness, which is in the way to Sur in the desert,\r\n\r\n16:8. He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and\r\nwhither goest thou? And she answered: I flee from the face of Sarai, my\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n16:9. And the angel of the Lord said to her: Return to thy mistress, and\r\nhumble thyself under her hand.\r\n\r\n16:10. And again he said: I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, and it\r\nshall not be numbered for multitude.\r\n\r\n16:11. And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt\r\nbring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord\r\nhath heard thy affliction.\r\n\r\n16:12. He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men, and all\r\nmen's hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all\r\nhis brethren.\r\n\r\n16:13. And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her: Thou the\r\nGod who hast seen me. For she said: Verily, here have I seen the hinder\r\nparts of him that seeth me.\r\n\r\n16:14. Therefore she called that well, the well of him that liveth and\r\nseeth me. The same is between Cades and Barad.\r\n\r\n16:15. And Agar brought forth a son to Abram: who called his name\r\nIsmael.\r\n\r\n16:16. Abram was four score and six years old when Agar brought him\r\nforth Ismael.\r\n\r\nGenesis Chapter 17\r\n\r\nThe Covenant of circumcision.\r\n\r\n17:1. And after he began to be ninety and nine years old, the Lord\r\nappeared to him: and said unto him: I am the Almighty God: walk before\r\nme, and be perfect.\r\n\r\n17:2. And I will make my covenant between me and thee: and I will\r\nmultiply thee exceedingly.\r\n\r\n17:3. Abram fell flat on his face.\r\n\r\n17:4. And God said to him: I am, and my covenant is with thee, and thou\r\nshalt be a father of many nations.\r\n\r\n17:5. Neither shall thy name be called any more Abram: but thou shalt be\r\ncalled Abraham: because I have made thee a father of many nations.\r\n\r\nAbram... in the Hebrew, signifies a high father: but Abraham, the father\r\nof the multitude; Sarai signifies my Lady, but Sara absolutely Lady.\r\n\r\n17:6. And I will make thee increase exceedingly, and I will make nations\r\nof thee, and kings shall come out of thee.\r\n\r\n17:7. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and between\r\nthy seed after thee in their generations, by a perpetual covenant: to be\r\na God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.\r\n\r\n17:8. And I will give …

Upload Experimental HLG LUT generator

I think this is all I can currently make by guessing without actual HDR device. I am asking others with HDR display to test this in proper HDR supported software (Resolve etc.), and modify this script to finish it. I am now writing down some of the things about HDR based on my understanding (note this is just my understanding, might not be super accurate):

1. One of my friends with HDR capable MacBook tested Blender 4.0's EDR/HDR support, it seems to be completely broken, both SDR and HDR are terribly broken in Blender 4.0 Mac version.  I guess this why Troy was freaking out about the EDR patch, but the official Blender devs don't seem to have an access to MacBook with a Built-in P3 EDR screen, therefore it might be hard for them to realize what is wrong. So maybe don't use Blender for testing this at the moment.

2. Don't trust those video players out there. I asked the friend I mentioned to play the same Rec.2100 PQ encoded video with HDR10 metadata embedded, he comfirmed that different video players each seems to include a unique view transform for HDR content. Including QuickTime, and iPhone 15 Pro's built-in video player. 
I don't yet know which APP to trust, maybe just use DaVinci Resolve for now.

3. HDR in terms of image formation, is weird.
If we think of our AgX Base Rec.2020 image as a percentage for a display (how many percent of emission strength this pixel should be, relative to that pixel's maximum emission strength), the max emission nits value specifically, doesn't seem to really matter, you can have a 1000 nits display, and we would multiply our percentage (0.0 to 1.0, or 0% to 100%) with that 1000 nits, and we get a nits based value for our image.

Therefore, if we follow a percentage based mentality for HDR, we can just do the exact same thing we have been doing all alone, that is multiplay the percentage by the max emission (1000 nits for HLG), and apply an HLG "[0 , 1000] nits to [0, 1] encoding" curve. Everything stays the same as our SDR image. 

However, this is not how most protocals are implemented. Most protocals like Resolve, TCAM, etc., seem to implement HDR encoding with "SDR = 100 nits" assumption. Basically, what we did above is kind of "SDR = 1000 nits", and with 100 nits assuption, we would calculate the ratio between SDR max (100) and HDR max (1000), and muliply the percentage by that ratio, basically in our case, scale the percentage down by 10. 

This is super super weird IMHO, if we think of percentage here again. Our image's 18% middle grey is now 1.8%.  So ultimately, comparing with SDR image, we are actually implementing a "darkening" in our image.

Note there has been controversies on the whole SDR 100 nits thing, as it was derived from a weird notion of "diffuse white" which doesn't exist in a formed image. Resolve also has a SDR = 203 nits implementation, Troy mentioned once that most actual SDR displays are around 300 nits. 

I am going with SDR = 100 nits currently, but there is a parameter in the script that you can change.

4. HDR image needs to match SDR image's appearance.

We cannot do it 100% matching since we don't have a perceptual color model that actually works right now (none of the models can describe the classic red train in an image that only has cyan pixels). But we still need to try our best to do the matching. 

For example, given a movie shot, a bunch of characters are looking at something in shock, the camera cuts to a glowing chromatic object, will it make sense that the HDR distribution of the movie can clearly see the chroma-laden details on the glowing object, while the SDR distribution of the movie only shows a solid block of white lights?

It doesn't make sense, therefore, SDR and HDR image need to match, at least in terms of attenuation's rate of change (I.E. the speed things fade to white). 

There are parameters in the script for tweaking the match. I don't have an HDR device so I cannot fine tune the match. Please, for people that pick this up from here, test this in Resolve and find a setting that matches the AgX Base Rec.2020 image. Or if none of the possible setting of the current parameters work, re-work the script to make it match.

The config for using this LUT can be found here:
https://github.com/EaryChow/AgX/tree/HDR-Experimental

With this published, I will probably no longer do any AgX-related development from now. At least I hope so, I need to focus on my rea-life situation, it's unhealthy for me to continue, but I keep finding myself coming back. Maybe it's because of the Inertia left from my devotion into this project during the past about 2 years. Hopefully I can actually stop developing this and focus on my life issues.

shitcode compiles, will tear out later

On second thought, I'm just gonna make the musket itself a reagent container instead of adding an internal one and fucking around with shittons of snowflake code. It compiles in the current state but is a bullshit stupid implementation of how I want it to work bluh bluh bluh

fuck my stupid baka life

Adds glass-pack improv shells (lower damage, can embed though)
Adds improvised 9mm (same damage, high variance in accuracy)
Lowers Improv shell pellets, variance, damage. Adds AP & increases minimum range
Adds so many revolver sprites (To show open/closed cylinder)

# Description

This PR supports fetching records with vectors from Python SDK. A new
argument is provided in `from_argilla` method to provide which vectors
must be downloaded with records (None by default). Users can set this
argument to `all` to download all vectors found in the records.

I also the relationship in the `Vector` ORM class to load
`vector_settings` has been changed to load them by default. Otherwise, a
massive `awaitable_attrs` must be applied in order to create the vector
dictionary without getting the lovely error
`sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenlet: greenlet_spawn has not been called;`

Please, @gabrielmbmb take a look into it, and let's discuss if we can
optimize this a bit.

refactor(deps): migrate from deprecated `tslint` to `eslint`

- `tslint` had been officially deprecated in favor of `eslint` with `@typescript-eslint` since at least [early 2019](https://blog.palantir.com/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9)
  - it's been completely [archived](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) since at least mid-2021 as well

- modify static analysis docs to mention `eslint` instead of `tslint`
  - also update note about Snyk to include dependency scans and mention that it's used as an SCA (Software Composition Analysis)

- migrate `lint` script to use `eslint`
- migrate all `tslint` deps, including `plugin-react` and `plugin-prettier`
  - **NOTE**: we have an outdated version of `prettier` (v1.x, while v3.x is latest), so equivalently had to use an outdated version of `eslint-plugin-prettier`
    - I imagine this might have been outdated because there was no newer `tslint-plugin-prettier` that supported newer `prettier` versions
      - i.e. this very `eslint` migration was a pre-requisite to upgrade `prettier`
- migrate `tslint.json` to `.eslintrc.json`
  - more or less the same configuration with same plugins
  - use recommended rulesets
  - globally disable `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` and `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion`
    - these are commonly disabled as both of these are already _explicit_ typings (as opposed to implicit ones, which we should check for)
      - there are valid uses of these two, and while they can be misused, that's somewhat uncommon (in my experience)
    - consistent with `argo-ui`'s configuration

- auto-fix `<a target='_blank'>` elements that were missing a `rel='noreferrer'`, per [`react/jsx-no-target-blank` rule](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/v7.33.2/docs/rules/jsx-no-target-blank.md)
  - this is a security vuln per [the docs](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/ca30f77196d410c7cdb1e4fe11f11bfffb46c84f/docs/rules/jsx-no-target-blank.md?plain=1#L9)
    - see also https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener and https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-noopener
      - browsers have implicitly added `rel='noreferrer'` since at least 2021 as well per the above spec change; this (recommended) rule makes it explicitly added

- auto-fix some unnecessary `!!`, per [`no-extra-boolean-cast` rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-extra-boolean-cast)

- auto-format `webpack.config.js` as previously `prettier` wasn't run on it (not a TS file)
  - manually add some ESLint comments so that it works with Node & CJS
    - may want to migrate to `webpack.config.mjs` in the future for ESM
      - or [`webpack.config.ts`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-languages/#typescript)

- manually fix several unused variables, per [`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-unused-vars)
  - remove unused `_`, `e`, `x`, `i`, etc
  - remove unused `onError` prop
  - actually use the previously unused `T` generic type in `object-parser`

- manually fix unnecessary `<T extends any>`, per [`@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-type-constraint` rule](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-unnecessary-type-constraint)
  - just use regular `<T>`, which is the same
  - editor had some trouble understanding the syntax, so while doing so, also converted several consts assigned to anonymous functions to named functions
    - and then had a few more inner changes to named functions while at it too
      - and one promise chain -> async/await refactor while at that as well

- manually fix two missing `key`s in React iterators, per [`react/jsx-key` rule](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/v7.33.2/docs/rules/jsx-key.md)
  - React warns when these are missing at run-time as well, see [React docs on `key`](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key)

- manually replace several single and double quotes inside of JSX with HTML escaped chars instead, per  [`react/no-unescaped-entities` rule](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/v7.33.2/docs/rules/no-unescaped-entities.md)
  - use `&apos;` and `&quot;` consistently for these

- manually fix a few `require` statements, per [`@typescript-eslint/no-var-requires` rule](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-var-requires/)
  - disable in `webpack.config.js` per above
  - disable in `index.tsx` as I'm not sure if `react-hot-loader` can support async imports
    - `react-hot-loader` is also [deprecated in favor of React Fast Refresh](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader#moving-towards-next-step) and hasn't received an update in at least a year
      - so eventually we should replace it anyway. rather than trying to get it to work with async imports, just add a disable line
  - remove and uninstall `superagent-promise` as it's not needed nowadays
    - `superagent-promise` hasn't gotten an update in at least 5 years and `superagent` has long natively supported promises
      - heck the types used were from `superagent` itself also
  - convert a few `require('*.scss')` side-effects into `import '*.scss'`
    - `react-datepicker` already had a `.css` `import` as well
    - consistently use ESM syntax where possible
    - also, re-group some imports while at it
      - consistently have external imports -> internal imports -> internal side-effects (e.g. CSS)

- manually remove unnecessary `\` escape chars, per [`no-useless-escape` rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-useless-escape)
- manually remove an unnecessary `// @ts-ignore` comment, per [`@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment` rule](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/ban-ts-comment)
  - it should be replaced with a `// @ts-expect-error` instead, but this seemed to be unnecessary as there was no error at this time (there may have been in the past?)
- manually remove unused `qeId` prop, per [`react/no-unknown-property` rule](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/v7.33.2/docs/rules/no-unknown-property.md)
  - this seems to have been for testing purposes, but it is unused and also outdated
    - current testing paradigms tend to use valid HTML [`data-*` attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) nowadays, such as Testing Library's [`data-testid`](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/bytestid)

- manually remove a few of the `tslint:disable` comments
  - `no-console`, `no-bitwise`, and `prefer-for-of`
    - `no-console` and `no-bitwise` are not part of ESLint's [recommended ruleset](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/) at this time, so no need replace with `eslint-disable` comments
    - `prefer-for-of` is [part of](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/75c128856b1ce05a4fec799bfa6de03b3dab03d0/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/stylistic.ts#L24) the separated `stylistic` package of `typescript-eslint`, which we do not currently use

- also convert a few consts assigned to anonymous functions to named functions for better tracing while refactoring related code

Introduce Clog

a.k.a. CLover LOGging.  Also there often can be too many logs, which
evokes a the other meaning of the word clog.  Expansion of meaning to
the type of shoes is an exercise for the reader.

You would use it like this:

    # Strand ubid gets included in metadata automatically
    Clog.emit("A message")

And like this, when you have metadata:

    Clog.emit("A message") { { my_metadata_name: { field1: ..., field2: ... } } }

I also add logging in a few places.

There are some general ideas that I'm combining from years past with
Clog, in no particular order:

1. The message component is almost always static

   It's much easier to search source code and perform log system
   queries if the log message is a static string, and dynamic
   information is in metadata.

   Inspiration: exception aggregating systems are more reliable when
   the Exceptions have messages that do not embed dynamic text.

2. Use thread local variables for automatic log enrichment.

   At first, I used real thread local variables, but changed this to
   use `Thread.name`, which can improve thread debug rendering as well
   as being usable to enrich logs.  If we add more metadata to enrich
   logging output, I suggest use of Thread local variables set by the
   Dispatcher or Strand framework code.

   A nice consequence of this is that simple log messages that only
   want to include the UBID of what is being operated upon can obtain
   this by logging a static message only.

   Inspiration: systemd and syslog both perform automatic enrichment
   with at least PID, and in the former case, with unit names and
   other data, without any special considerations by the application
   emitting output.  And it's pretty useful.

3. Use (mostly) a single hash for metadata, with a unique-ish name.

   Instead of doing something like:

        { a_field: "data", b_field: "more data" }

   Do:

        { going_concern: { a_field: "data", b_field: "more data", magnitude: 7 } }

   This is informally a kind of type information, useful in queries,
   such as this one written in Mezmo/LogDNA format:

        going_concern.magnitude:>3

   Which is a lot more selective than:

        magnitude:>3

   Often, this is desirable, unless "magnitude" was a idiom throughout
   the entire application (as `ubid` and `Thread#name` is for us,
   already an exception to this guideline).

   Permissible aberrations can be expected in the case of idiomatic
   representations used in many log records.  Then you might have
   something like:

        { well_known_metadata_or_representation_name: { ... },
          going_concern: { a_field: "data", b_field: "more data" } }

   Inspiration: the defunct logging service "Timber" suggested this
   style, and it seemed like a pretty good idea after using it for a
   while.

4. Use blocks to compute dynamic fields for logs.

   `Clog.emit` takes a block that should yield the metadata included
   with the log line.  There are two reasons I want to experiment with
   using blocks to do this:

   (a) It contains the code that exists for logging when it is not as
       trivial as a single expression in a hash literal.

   (b) In event we do the typical DEBUG/INFO/WARN levels, you can
       avoid calling the block.  However, that is not implemented
       here, because I'm not sure if it's necessary.

   Inspiration: the Crystal programming language does this, and in
   their case, it's even more powerful, since "DEBUG" code can be
   stripped at compile time if a release build is set.

5. Support JSON output

   LogDNA (now known as Mezmo) had some useful heuristics of trying to
   parse anything that looked like JSON as JSON, but also storing
   non-JSON output.  This is useful when, say, Ruby core dumps and
   prints a bunch of output: at least you can see it happened and
   piece things together.  Or if a library emits a `puts`.  But, when
   we have the wherewithal, and we think the output log is going to a
   system that can parse JSON, we should emit JSON.

   Left un-done in this patch is some heuristics to have more
   human-friendly rendering of logs when, for example,
   `$stdout.isatty` is true.  That's for later.

The fishing portal generator expansion (plus skill-chip) (#78203)

## About The Pull Request
This is a PR I worked on last month, but had to put on hold while
dealing with some pressing issues with fishing feature, minigame and
other stuff, and because I had to atomize out some of the stuff
previously present here.

I've expanded on the fishing portal generator to do something other than
dispense guppies and goldfishes. It now has multiple settings,
unlockable by performing scanning experiments for fish types, available
from the get go, which also reward a meager amount of techweb points
upon completion. The generator can now be built too. No longer it has to
be ordered from cargo.
It can also be emagged for the syndicate setting, tho right now it only
dispenses donkfish and emulsijack, both otherwise impossible to get
outside of... exodrone adventures.

The advanced fishing rod now comes with an experiment handler component,
specific to the fish scanning experiment, that automatically scans
fished content. The node to get it now requires 2000 points and the
first fish scanning exp to be unock.

A new skillchip has been added, which adds a trait that changes the icon
of the fish shown in the minigame UI, giving some clues on what the
reward will be. The same trait is also gained by reaching the master
(penultimate) level of the fishing skill.

A new fish type has been added, with its own quirks. One of these quirks
included temporarily switching movement direction of the bait.
Currently, it can only be fished in the hyperspace and randomizer
setting of the fishing portal.

## Why It's Good For The Game
The fishing portal generator is but a stale and underdeveloped prototype
of the fishing feature right now, so much I was thinking of removing it
at first. However, we also have a lot of fishes which are pretty much
unfishable, so I came up with the idea of adding new portal settings
that allow people to actually get them.

As for the skillchip and trait, it's but an extra to both the vending
machine in the library and the fishing skill itself, which has an
overall humble impact on the minigame.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Expanded the fishing portal generator. It now comes with several
portal options that can be unlocked by performing fish scanning
experiments, which also award a modest amount of techweb points.
balance: The fishing portal generator is now buildable and no longer
orderable. The board can be printed from cargo, service and science
lathes.
balance: Advanced fishing tech is no longer a BEPIS design. It now
requires the base fish scanning experiment and 2000 points to be
unlocked.
add: The advanced fishing rod now comes with an incorporated
experiscanner specific for fish scanning.
add: Added a new skillchip that may change the icon of the "fish" shown
in the minigame UI to less generic ones. Reaching master level in
fishing also does that.
qol: The experiment handler UI no longer shows unselectable experiments.

reset metdata for handout test

This is one of the weird litte things that I need to get better at
controlling. When we test these things, the global metdata is affected,
but it's not possible (at the moment) to _remove_ metadata without
resetting everything, so instead, we need to set the global metadata
option for "handout" to NULL.

In the words of the author of a C++ library that I rewrote in R for my
Ph. D.:

1. should fix fax machine problem(thx forest)
2.  gives trucker synth the frontier jumpsuit(Thwomplert)
3. adds Freelancer Synthetic. This Synth is one that was bought off a
civi market and reprogrammed, or stolen and reprogrammed, or hacked, You
get the point - its going with a band of freelancers. The idea behind it
is that this synth's team is dead and they are just programmed as a merc
for pay - hoping to someday find their boss boss and give the money as
set up. I always thought about this one for a long time and decided to
put him in the civilian category, where its hard to roll and also gives
you freedom to choose your allegiance. In this case I hope that a
freelancer synthetic will open up unique avenue of RP and allegiance.
I've only explored it once ingame, but it was very good for RP!
Hopefully people can recreate this success.

was hard to make this guy look cool and I also wasn't sure on what his
loadout would be. I ended up giving him random generic stuff while
looking like a beat up freelancer(missing the armor especially hurt his
look, since thats the largest piece of a freelancer - the curiass, but I
don't want to give armor for balance reasons) and no beret because its
for a SL only.

as usual, if a synth wants to change RP avenues and don different
clothes for different RP, no one would know the difference
# Explain why it's good for the game
1. bug bad
2. a beat up UA laborer that so happens to be synthetic. you wouldn't
expect it because there's so many similar looking people! exactly the
job of a synth - to blend in.
3. Freelancer colony synth hopefully will open up a unique avenue of RP.
If they don't want to they can always ditch it - but its on a relatively
rare and uncommon roll anyways.

Modify KubernetesClient shutdown behaviour  (#24613) [5.3.z] (#24710)

Backport of: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24613

The overall goal of this change is to change the shutdown behaviour of
KubernetesClient so our Stateful Set monitor thread shuts down before
our `ClusterTopologyIntentTracker`, to allow the intent tracker to fully
process all completed messages before Node shutdown.

**The Current Problem**
In its current state, the Stateful Set monitor thread is intended to
shutdown after `Thread#interrupt` is called, triggering the
`Thread#interrupted` check within the main `while(running)` loop of the
Runnable. However, this check is not reached as the call to
`WatchResponse#readLine` from within the main `run()` method is a
blocking call that waits until data is available to read before
proceeding. Since this call waits for non-null data before completing,
the result is always non-null, and therefore this code block never exits
under normal conditions:
```java
while ((message = watchResponse.nextLine()) != null) {
    onMessage(message);
}
```

Since this `while` loop cannot exit, and the `#readLine` method (which
passes to `BufferedReader#readLine` under the hood) is a blocking I/O
operation which cannot be interrupted, this operation does not end when
`Thread#interrupt` is called. This leads to the Stateful Set monitor
thread out-living the `ClusterTopologyIntentTracker`, even if the
StsMonitor is interrupted first. As a result, during shutdown, it is
possible for the StsMonitor to send data to the intent tracker after it
has been destroyed and its executor is no longer accepting tasks.

**The Root of the Problem**
To reach our goal of ensuring that the Stateful Set monitor thread can
no longer send requests to the `ClusterTopologyIntentTracker`, we need
to add synchronization between the two objects that guarantees the
intent tracker shuts down after the StsMonitor thread has completed.
This can be achieved using a simple `CountDownLatch` which is counted
down after the thread has completed, and awaited before shutting down
the tracker.

The main obstacle to achieving this is, as mentioned above, that the
StsMonitor thread cannot be interrupted when waiting for
`WatchResponse#readLine` to complete, and so the thread never completes.
The only way this thread can complete is to either force its
termination, or alter the message reading approach to allow interruption
as intended.

**Identifying Resolution Paths**
We don't want to force termination of our Stateful Set monitor thread as
this could result in message handling being terminated after it has been
received, but not before it has finished being processed. Therefore the
only way we can allow this thread to be interrupted as intended is to
alter the message reading mechanics in a way that allows it to be
interrupted as well.

There is no way for us to know if more messages are pending from the k8s
watch besides waiting for data to be received, so the best we can do is
allow the StsMonitor to finish processing any messages it has already
received (preventing process corruption), but terminate the stream of
new messages it is waiting for before we shutdown the intent tracker.

**Potential Solutions**
So we've identified the root of the problem as our `#readLine` function
blocking through interrupts, so how do we make it interruptible? Sadly
one of the shortcomings of I/O operations in Java is that they usually
cannot be interrupted in the traditional manner, so we have a few
approaches to consider:

1) We could modify the message reading code to use
`BufferedReader#ready` and `Thread#sleep` to periodically check if there
is data to be read before calling any read functions. The problem with
this approach is that A) `#ready` returns true if any data is available,
not just if there is a full line of data to be read; and B) utilizing a
sleep loop can result in delayed message handling at the least, or
busy-waiting overhead at worst.

2) We could use "hacky" solutions to interrupt the
`BufferedReader#readLine` such as closing underlying sockets or
connections, propagating an exception to the reader. The problem with
this solution is that everything related to our reading operation is
handled in `syncrhonized` blocks, and since our shutdown process starts
outside the StsMonitor thread, our calling thread is unable to obtain
these locks (being held by the StsMonitor)!

3) It's possible that we could rewrite the `WatchResponse` mechanics to
use Java NIO magic such as `Selector` for interruptible I/O operations.
The issue with this approach is that it would require fairly significant
refactoring of the related codebase, and may not end up providing the
exact functionality we are looking for in our use case.

4) We can introduce an `Executor` to handle our I/O operations within
the StsMonitor thread, allowing us to wait on a `Future#get` call
instead of our `BufferedReader#readLine` call, where a `Future#get`
operation can be interrupted by the waiting thread being interrupted.
The downside to this solution is we have to introduce an additional
thread on top of the existing StsMonitor thread itself.

**Selecting a Solution**
Considering the above information, I concluded the most sensible
approach was to use (4) and introduce an `Executor` thread for the I/O
operations. By using a separate thread for this call we can be rougher
with it, as we know that worse case scenario we interrupt a message
being read that has not started being processed yet (but we're shutting
down anyway).

This solution also allows for the least amount of underlying code
changes, as our `Future#get` can be interrupted without issue,
maintaining the current approach used for handling the StsMonitor
shutdown. The only downside for this approach is the addition of another
thread alongside the StsMonitor thread, but the actual impact of this
should be minimal as both threads will still be waiting most of the
time, so the only negative impact is being 1 tiny step closer to
possible thread starvation.

Generally I think this is the best solution at hand which allows quick
shutdown of the StsMonitor thread while minimising potential for data
loss or corruption. Combined with the `CountDownLatch` used, this allows
for consistent service shutdown order between the `StsMonitor` thread
and the `ClusterTopologyIntentTracker`.

Add organization view UI filters (#10847)

* Add organization view UI filters

This filters are used for the new dashboard UI, they are not API filters.

These were a challenge to create, as django-filter is really opinionated
about the way it should work, and doesn't quite agree with use cases
that need to use filtered querysets (such as limiting the field choices
to objects the organization is related to).

I went through many permutations of this code, trying to find a pattern
that was not obtuse or awful. Unfortunately, I don't quite like the
patterns here, but because all of the django-filter magic happens at the
class level instead of at instantiation time, every direction required
hacks to obtain something reasonable.

Given the use we have for filters in our UI, I wouldn't mind making
these into a more generalized filter solution.

I think I'd like to replace some of the existing filters that currently
hit the API with frontend code and replace those with proper filters
too. These are mostly the project/version listing elements.

* Add filter for organization dropdown

This replaces an API driven UI element. It's not important that these UI
filters are frontend, it was just easier than figuring out how to make
django-filter work for this use case at that time.

* Fix the team member filter yet again

* Use a custom filter field to execute filter set queryset method

* Add tests organization filter sets

* Update code comments

* A few more improvements

- Make view code nicer, use django_filters.views.FilterMixin, sort of
- Use FilterSet.is_valid() to give empty list on validation errors
- Clean up tests with standard fixtures instead

* Review updates for tests and arguments

* Rename FilterMixin -> FilterContextMixin

* Fix lint

State management: Migrate to Riverpod

This commit is just intended to illustrate what a Riverpod implementation might look like. It's not a particularly clean implementaion and it also isn't intended to get merged. Rather, it illustrates the problems that using Riverpod might inflict on our project:

- Providers can only be initialized lazily or using hacks. We want to initialize SharedPreferences to avoid providers that aren't inherenly async to be async just because the initialization of its dependency is. Or, as in the current case, the consuming provider is async, but the dependency being async makes the notion of the provider being "pending" less clearly defined. The official recommendation is to keep the dependency async and use `requireValue` to force unwrapping on runtime. To me this is an unacceptable loss of type safety; the consumer should not be required to know whether the asynchronicity is "real" or not.
- The same problem occurs with "active network": We don't want to hardcode the default value into the provider so instead initialize it in `initState` of a stateful component. There are other options but none of them are what we want: To simply provide the value from some configuration that isn't necessarily a global singleton.
- Code navigation suffers from code generation splitting definitions across files: To find the usage of, say, a notifier class, you have to first find its usage in the generated code, then find the usage of the actual provider defined in there. While code generation is optional, it's highly encouraged. And it looks like nontrivial providers are hard to write without it. But even code generation is used, you might get very cryptic errors in the generated code when you don't get it exactly right.
- Subjectively, it seems hard to find a good way to organize the providers. They tend to get rather fine grained which makes it hard to get an overview, especially if you'd like to know what is initialized and when. It feels like this could work against building the right abstractions.
- Something that isn't clear in this code is that the life cycle providers ("auto disposable") by default is tied to that of cosuming widgets. This is probably very powerful and what you want most of the time. But when it isn't I fear that this could turn into error prone memory management.

To be clear, this is not to say that riverpod is a bad library. It just feels a bit too magic and has some limitations that I think makes it unsuitable for our project. You get some advantages in exchange for these things, but it isn't clear to me how valuable they are compared to Bloc which is much easier to understand.

identity: default to RS256 for new workload ids (#18882)

OIDC mandates the support of the RS256 signing algorithm so in order to maximize workload identity's usefulness this change switches from using the EdDSA signing algorithm to RS256.

Old keys will continue to use EdDSA but new keys will use RS256. The EdDSA generation code was left in place because it's fast and cheap and I'm not going to lie I hope we get to use it again.

**Test Updates**

Most of our Variables and Keyring tests had a subtle assumption in them that the keyring would be initialized by the time the test server had elected a leader. ed25519 key generation is so fast that the fact that it was happening asynchronously with server startup didn't seem to cause problems. Sadly rsa key generation is so slow that basically all of these tests failed.

I added a new `testutil.WaitForKeyring` helper to replace `testutil.WaitForLeader` in cases where the keyring must be initialized before the test may continue. However this is mostly used in the `nomad/` package.

In the `api` and `command/agent` packages I decided to switch their helpers to wait for keyring initialization by default. This will slow down tests a bit, but allow those packages to not be as concerned with subtle server readiness details. On my machine rsa key generation takes 63ms, so hopefully the difference isn't significant on CI runners.

**TODO**

- Docs and changelog entries.
- Upgrades - right now upgrades won't get RS256 keys until their root key rotates either manually or after ~30 days.
- Observability - I'm not sure there's a way for operators to see if they're using EdDSA or RS256 unless they inspect a key. The JWKS endpoint can be inspected to see if EdDSA will be used for new identities, but it doesn't technically define which key is active. If upgrades can be fixed to automatically rotate keys, we probably don't need to worry about this.

**Requiem for ed25519**

When workload identities were first implemented we did not immediately consider OIDC compliance. Consul, Vault, and many other third parties support JWT auth methods without full OIDC compliance. For the machine<-->machine use cases workload identity is intended to fulfill, OIDC seemed like a bigger risk than asset.

EdDSA/ed25519 is the signing algorithm we chose for workload identity JWTs because of all these lovely properties:

1. Deterministic keys that can be derived from our preexisting root keys. This was perhaps the biggest factor since we already had a root encryption key around from which we could derive a signing key.
2. Wonderfully compact: 64 byte private key, 32 byte public key, 64 byte signatures. Just glorious.
3. No parameters. No choices of encodings. It's all well-defined by [RFC 8032](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032).
4. Fastest performing signing algorithm! We don't even care that much about the performance of our chosen algorithm, but what a free bonus!
5. Arguably one of the most secure signing algorithms widely available. Not just from a cryptanalysis perspective, but from an API and usage perspective too.

Life was good with ed25519, but sadly it could not last.

[IDPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider), such as AWS's IAM OIDC Provider, love OIDC. They have OIDC implemented for humans, so why not reuse that OIDC support for machines as well? Since OIDC mandates RS256, many implementations don't bother implementing other signing algorithms (or at least not advertising their support). A quick survey of OIDC Discovery endpoints revealed only 2 out of 10 OIDC providers advertised support for anything other than RS256:

- [PayPal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/.well-known/openid-configuration) supports HS256
- [Yahoo](https://api.login.yahoo.com/.well-known/openid-configuration) supports ES256

RS256 only:

levels: minor Phase 2 fixes. (#964)

* levels: minor Phase 2 fixes.

Mostly for addressing #694.

Map05
Realigned grey hex textures around soulsphere switch. Now the odd one out is the door.

Map09
Fixed up the lighting in the start room.
Reflagged some secret doors as secret rather than hidden.
Consolidated the two W1 Floor to LAC triggers around the yellow key.
The red key rocket launcher sequence could potentially mess someone up who - given the hatchling closet, quite reasonably - avoids grabbing the rocket launcher. It seems needlessly convoluted, but it is a funny prank how the switch makes the red key disappear entirely for a bit. Instead of untangling this I'm just going to add some health bonuses around the rocket launcher so the player will eventually go there.
Tried to mitigate the worst of the various crimes against texture alignment in the crate maze, adding a light source in the process. It would take a *lot* of work to make it actually look good, a lot more than can be done in a batch bugfix PR.

Map10
Lower unpegged sector 70 (red door leading outside) door tracks.
Added matching midtexes to the insides of the fences around the lights by the door leading to the final corridor.
Line 839 (south-southeast red armour behind waterfall) flagged secret and the lines on the other side flagged hidden.

Map11
Realigned grey hexes in corridor around minigunner switch room.
Added an evil eye right in front of the shootwall secret.

Map12
Change line 330 midtex to the new MIDSPCSM with no offset.
Lower-unpegged line 4787 doortrack.

Map13
Sectors 243 no longer uses mismatching TLITE6_5 flat. (Sector 170 actually looks okay ingame.)
Realigned line 260.

Map15
Line 163 W1 changed to WR to prevent a potential softlock.
Aligned COMPSPAN on sector 561 to match surroundings.
Fixed some textures in the green corridor in the west overlooking the nukage. Also set those zombies in there to ambush since that seems to be the intention based on their placement, and made that big block thingy on the east end of that corridor a more normal-looking door.
Touched up greyhex near sector 491.
Flagged linedef 5293 secret.
Sectors 145 and 116 (rock fringe around nukage around red key platform) consolidated into one sector, made non-damaging, and without the invisible blocking lines.

Map16
Changed Line 1089 to SR instead of S1. (Switch that opens the secret to the east)
Realigned all the SUPPORT3s in that little painlord corridor while shrinking the "ribs" a bit; also widened the little exit atrium so the space between the lights is as wide as the door. (After looking at the others I am not going to widen any more corridors at this time.)
Grossly simplified the twisty yellow key corridor, and lowered the ceiling of the outside of the door so the yellow door stripe would fit properly. One doortrack needed to be given the DOORTRAK texture. The remaining "ribs" are recessed further inside the wall so they do not impede movement at all.
Lowered the ceiling above the other yellow marked door as well. The corridor around the corner has been expanded slightly.

Map22
Flagged line 830 secret.

Map23
Fixed candle placement on east end of zombieman corridor.
Consolidated some identical sectors around the big "AGM" floor and lowered the torch platforms so they wouldn't clip into the ceiling.
Raised the ceilings on the techpillars right after the first long lift. The walls in front of them now match their surroundings.
Removed lower unpegged from lines 2066, 2082, 2062, 2075. ("Door"tracks for the route across those pillars in the southeast - they're actually lifts not doors)
SSG secret fixed. (And marked.)

Map28
Lines 2326, 622 lagged secret.
Realigned lines 4594 and 4671.
Realigned scrolling textures around sector 517.
Touched up monster closet around sector 399, changing to to 8 about HAF fast and making the closet a bit taller so there'd be a better natural threshold between those areas. The doortracks were fine, if a bit complex.
Raised sector 474 ceiling to match marble brick seams.
Made sector 147 (cubes hanging over hot rocks) do damage and sectors 91 and 115 (teleport pads) not.

Map29
Swapped out the textures on the sides of the big green skull pad.

* levels: fix up map23 southeast secret textures.

I messed up the texture replacement around the green torch, the extreme sudden darkness ruined the blue AGM text, the pillar lift-doors needed a better division between the tekwall and red rock, and that huge swathe of DOORTRAK hurt to look at in vanilla.

* levels: map07 aesthetic fixes.

Replaced BIGDOOR1 on sector 50 as it was giving tutti-frutti.

Fixed the textures on the lifts in the green area beyond the outdoor area.

Miscellaneous texture alignment fixes and added some more thresholds between materials.

      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

:ambulance: American culture is based on the automobile, and any young man of promise
is going to own one and want to travel great distances in it.  Consequently,
any young woman of aspiration should expect to spend most of her vacations
in a car, probing into unfamiliar corners.  She is not required to know how
to drive but she will certainly be expected to read the road map while her
husband drives, and if she can't, or if she's abnormally slow in giving him
help, she's bound to cause trouble.  Therefore, you'd think that colleges
which train the bright young women who're going to marry the bright young
men who are going to own the Cadillacs that roar back and forth across this
continent would teach the girls to read maps.  None do. They teach a hundred
other useless things, but never a word about the one that will cause the
greatest friction.

Create Inclusive Relationships, Sexual Orientations, and Gender Identity Policy

# Inclusive Relationships, Sexual Orientations, and Gender Identity Policy

## Introduction
This policy is intended to promote inclusivity, protect individual rights, and foster a society that embraces diversity in sexual orientations, gender identities, and relationship structures. It acknowledges the significance of respecting personal autonomy, recognizing diverse identities, and ensuring equal treatment and protection under the law for all individuals.

## Objective
The main objective of this policy is to establish legal recognition and protection for individuals with diverse sexual orientations, including asexual, aromantic, and polyamorous individuals, as well as intersex individuals. Additionally, the policy aims to recognize and safeguard the rights of non-binary individuals, offering them the option to refrain from declaring a gender for legal purposes.

## Key Features

### Legal Recognition and Protection
The policy proposes amending existing anti-discrimination laws to explicitly include asexual, aromantic, polyamorous, and intersex individuals, as well as non-binary individuals, as protected groups. This step will ensure their rights are safeguarded across various aspects of life, such as employment, education, healthcare, and public services. Moreover, the policy advocates for respecting the right of intersex individuals to identify their gender without coercion and without unnecessary medical interventions.

### Comprehensive Education and Awareness
To dispel myths and foster understanding and acceptance, the policy advocates for implementing inclusive and accurate sex education. This educational approach will cover diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, relationship structures, and intersex variations. Additionally, awareness campaigns will be promoted to highlight the experiences and challenges faced by individuals with diverse identities, aiming to combat stigma and discrimination.

### Protection from Harmful Practices
The policy takes a strong stance against harmful practices such as conversion therapy and other attempts to alter an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity, or relationship structure. It also calls for prohibiting non-consensual medical interventions on intersex infants and children, ensuring that any medical procedures are medically necessary and conducted with informed consent.

### Privacy and Confidentiality
Respecting individual privacy is crucial. The policy emphasizes safeguarding the medical history and intersex status of individuals, ensuring that sensitive information is not disclosed without informed consent. Additionally, individuals in consensual polyamorous relationships will be protected from intrusive questioning about their relationship structure.

## Implementing Additional Support

### Healthcare and Mental Health Support
The policy advocates for ensuring access to sensitive and inclusive healthcare services that cater to the needs of individuals with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, and intersex variations without any judgment or prejudice. Additionally, mental health resources will be provided to address the specific challenges and experiences faced by individuals with diverse identities.

### Representation and Inclusivity
Diverse representation plays a vital role in promoting inclusivity. The policy encourages media, literature, and other forms of representation to reflect the full spectrum of human diversity in sexual orientations, gender identities, and relationship structures. Furthermore, the active participation of individuals with diverse identities, including asexual, aromantic, polyamorous, intersex, and non-binary individuals, in policymaking processes will be encouraged to ensure their voices are heard and their rights are considered.

### Building Supportive Communities
Supportive communities can play a significant role in fostering understanding and providing a sense of belonging. The policy recommends providing support and resources for individuals with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, and relationship structures, such as intersex individuals and those in asexual, aromantic, polyamorous, and non-binary relationships, to connect with others who share similar experiences and challenges.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive policy aims to create a society that celebrates and respects the rights and dignity of all individuals, irrespective of their sexual orientations, gender identities, or relationship structures. By implementing legal protections, inclusive education, and support systems, we can pave the way for an inclusive and accepting environment where diversity is celebrated and discrimination is eradicated.

Refactor & make base64 functions browser-safe

We had two identical sets of base64 functions in the js-sdk, both
using Buffer which isn't really available in the browser unless you're
using an old webpack (ie. what element-web uses). This PR:

 * Takes the crypto base64 file and moves it out of crypto (because
   we use base64 for much more than just crypto)
 * Makes them work in a browser without the Buffer global
 * Removes the other base64 functions
 * Changes everything to use the new common ones
 * Adds a comment explaining why the function is kinda ugly and how
   soul destroyingly awful the JS ecosystem is.
 * Runs the tests with both impls
 * Changes the test to not just test the decoder against the encoder
 * Adds explicit support & tests for (decoding) base64Url (I'll add an
   encode method later, no need for that to go in this PR too).

Makefile.lib: Lower kernel gzip compression to fastest

You're reading this - so you're trying to understand "JUST WHY OMG".
That's already a good step.

First of all, this is a downstream kernel - always keep that in mind!
Now, this kernel is targeting new *very powerful* Qualcomm platforms
like SM8250 and the Sony Edo platform - which has a very fast UFS card.

Keep in mind that the bootloader sets the CPU at a frequency that is
slightly faster than the "in the middle" ones, which is anyway not
veeeery fast - but that's good, really. I agree.

So.. check this out:   for Image.gz-dtb.....
COMP_LEVEL    SIZE
9             20116171
5	      20220479
2	      20940223
1	      21231290

Remember again that we're loading from a UFS card and that
we are loading ~1.1MB more out of a 20MB file.
If you're smart enough you surely know already about RAM and CPU
overhead of very high compression levels.

If you still disagree with what I just did, read this commit description
another 20 times, or more, until you understand it. :)))

Add Server Context deprecation warning (#27424)

As agreed, we're removing Server Context. This was never official
documented.

We've found that it's not that useful in practice. Often the better
options are:

- Read things off the url or global scope like params or cookies.
- Use the module system for global dependency injection.
- Use `React.cache()` to dedupe multiple things instead of computing
once and passing down.

There are still legit use cases for Server Context but you have to be
very careful not to pass any large data, so in generally we recommend
against it anyway.

Yes, prop drilling is annoying but it's not impossible for the cases
this is needed. I would personally always pick it over Server Context
anyway.

Semantically, Server Context also blocks object deduping due to how it
plays out with Server Components that can't be deduped. This is much
more important feature.

Since it's already in canary along with the rest of RSC, we're adding a
warning for a few versions before removing completely to help migration.

Adds the WT-551, Unskyrats the WT-550 ammo (#655)

## About The Pull Request


## The WT-551

![image](https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/assets/8602857/d57f5767-366e-4835-a5bf-d965b6b375a6)

This adds the WT-551. A remade version of the WT-550 that is worse in
every way. Fortunately, that means that it is balanced enough to be put
in NanoTrasen armories.

Compared tot he WT-551, it is bulkier and slightly slower (0.3 second
fire delay compared to 0.2). Additionally, it is commonly used with
rubber-tipped rounds or FlatHead rounds, which are a special surplus of
ammo that deals less damage and has no wounding, embedding, or
penetrative power. Regular ammo can be purchased from cargo or
researched later, with special ammo also being available later.

Note that this does not replace the WT-550.

## FlatHead ammo


![image](https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/assets/8602857/81de4bdb-6fd6-4f23-a1b1-0af21e924c34)

Flathead ammo deals 18 brute damage (compared to the original 20), and 5
stamina damage per hit. It is extremely weak against armor, has no embed
chance, has virtually no wounding chance. It's perfect for cheap
corporate companies dealing with cheaper personnel. This is the type of
lethal ammo that security will use for the gun, unless someone speedruns
weapon research.


## Research Progression


![image](https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/assets/8602857/26b72a1c-ebda-439a-98c9-9dc3168e01bd)

### Basic WT-550/WT-551 Ammunition.
Flathead rounds and Rubber rounds for the WT-550/WT-551 can be
researched for 2500 points after unlocking the "Weapon Development
Technology" node.

### Advanced WT-550/WT-551 Ammunition.
Regular rounds and AP rounds for the WT-550/WT-551 can be researched can
be researched for 5000 points after unlocking the "Advanced Weapon
Development Technology" and "Basic WT-550/WT-551 Ammunition" nodes.

### Illegal WT-550/WT-551 Ammunition.
Incendiary rounds for the WT-550/WT-551 can be researched can be
researched for 7500 points after unlocking the "Illegal Technology",
"Exotic Ammo" , and "Advanced WT-550/WT-551 Ammunition" nodes.

### Syndicate Research

Removes the WT-550 ammo from syndicate research since it is now
redundant.

## Cargo


![image](https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/assets/8602857/a24e9df4-36e3-4368-b77a-cff06a42579f)

WT-551 rifles can be ordered in pairs (2) for the cost of a parrot, a
grilling starter pack, or a crab rocket (1600 credits). This value was
chosen because it is slightly higher than the thermal pistols, and the
traitor-ordered WT-550 rifle pack (which contains lethal ammo + spare
lethal ammo).

Additional FlatHead, Rubber, and Regular ammo can be ordered from cargo
as well.

Cargo techs no longer get WT-550s in the mail, but instead WT-551s (why
was this a thing holy shit).

## Armory


![image](https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/assets/8602857/e88a37af-2e4f-4b1c-bc25-b9bed9e41b91)

2 WT-551s can be found in the armory.
For balance purposes one (1) laser rifle was removed.

## I hate Skyrat so much holy shit


![image](https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/assets/8602857/b09eed34-77cd-4f37-8356-93688fec344e)

Unfucks the WT-550 ammo types by removing their dumb names and changed
caliber types.

Unfucks the WT-550 ammo in the ammo printer so that rubber rounds can be
printed at T0 and everything else (except incendiary rounds) can be
printed with the adv munitions disk.

The bullets for the WT-550 have been forcibly changed to /tg/ balance,
which means that any and all future Skyrat PRs cannot touch the damage
values for it (unless some fuckery occurs, idk).

## Why It's Good For The Game


![image](https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/assets/8602857/395b9fa5-8380-46bc-96a7-06ce0931d8e7)


Security is in dire need of actual ballistics. /tg/ removed ballistics
from security because of reasons I legitimately don't think are valid.
It's also a huge balance concern for security not to have at least 1
ballistic weapon (other than the shotgun) because it doesn't stop antags
from hoarding laser immunity or meds.

Also guns are cool.

## Changelog

:cl: BurgerBB
add: Adds the WT-551 rifle, a redesign of the WT-550 rifle that is
balanced (citation needed) for security use.
add: Makes WT-550 ammo researchable and orderable from cargo. Removes
WT-550 ammo from syndicate research, and gives them their own
categories.

Add A is B and B is A Eval (#1366)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

ab

### Eval description

This evaluation aims to assess the model's ability to correctly identify
and understand the relationship between two entities, where A is a
specific entity (which could be a chemical element, a painting, a bird
species, a star, a mountain, a novel, a river, or a musical instrument)
and B is a unique characteristic or fact about that entity. The model
should be able to accurately interpret the user's query about the entity
(A) and provide a relevant fact (B), and vice versa. This evaluation
will help in fine-tuning the model's understanding of context, relation
between entities, and its ability to provide accurate and relevant
responses. The entities and their characteristics have been chosen to be
specific and challenging.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This evaluation is important for several reasons:

1. Contextual Understanding: It tests the model's ability to understand
the context of a conversation, particularly the relationship between two
related entities (A and B).

2. Accuracy: It assesses the model's ability to provide accurate and
relevant information based on the user's query.

3. Relevance: It evaluates the model's ability to understand the
relevance of A to B and vice versa, which is crucial in providing
meaningful and coherent responses.

4. General Knowledge: This tests the model's knowledge about various
specific entities and their unique characteristics or facts, which is a
part of its general knowledge. The entities span a wide range of
categories, including chemistry, art, ornithology, astronomy, geography,
literature, and music, making this a comprehensive test of the model's
general knowledge.

5. Versatility: This checks the model's ability to handle different
types of queries, as the user can ask about the specific entity (A) or
its unique characteristic or fact (B). This tests the model's
flexibility in understanding and responding to a variety of query
structures across diverse knowledge domains.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

A popular paper has been going around called 'The Reversal Curse: LLMs
trained on “A is B” fail to learn “B is A”'. I figured an Eval on this
would have a unique value.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic

Added Icelandic inflection eval; JsonMatch eval function (#1387)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Icelandic noun phrase inflection

### Eval description

This eval consists of 3 x 100 samples in "easy", "medium" and "hard"
categories. Each sample
represents the task of inflecting a noun phrase in Icelandic, in all
four cases of the language
(nominative, accusative, dative and genitive), both singular and plural.
A noun phrase
consists of an adjective and a noun (e.g., "fallegur litur" = "beautiful
color").
In the easy category, both the adjective and the noun are
relatively common. In the medium category, they are less common, and in
the hard category they
are rare enough that it is pretty unlikely that they occur in any
training corpora.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The eval is designed to test the general grammatical proficiency of a
model in Icelandic, and
the eval accuracy is assumed to correlate with a model's ability to
generate grammatically
correct text in the language. GPT models have so far struggled with
generating correct Icelandic
text, even though GPT-4 was uniquely trained by RLHF in the language.
Icelandic is believed to
be a good bellwether for lower-resource, grammatically complex language
support in general.

Inflecting noun phrases is something that native language speakers do
without significant
effort, even if they have not seen the particular adjective and the noun
before, as it can be done on the
basis of generic grammatical pattern recognition. However, to date,
GPT-4 seems not to have
acquired enough of a "native feel" for Icelandic to be able to do this
task with high accuracy.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

**Note: this PR includes a new general eval class, JsonMatch, which is
not specific to the Icelandic evaluation
case. It allows completions and ideal answers to be represented as JSON
objects, comparing the objects
by individual key:value pairs. Tests and documentation of this
functionality are included in the PR.**

Adds a Syndicate Monkey Agent beacon uplink item (#79012)

## About The Pull Request

Adds a Syndicate Monkey Agent beacon uplink item. It spawns a dapper
monkey that must follow your orders.

Added a monkey gun case to the uplink, which contains monkey guns!
Though they aren't very powerful.

Added a more modularlike subtype for antagonist spawners to reduce
future hardcoding.

Gave the syndicate turtleneck a monkey sprite, from SS14!

## Why It's Good For The Game

I want to see the clown driving security insane with 2-3 monkeys and an
incredible amount of pranking. Or an assistant killing everyone with his
monkey friends while wearing a monkey suit. Or a geneticist sending out
mutated monkeys to kill people. Or a scientist equipping his monkeys
with bombs or xenobiology equipment and sending them out to wreak havoc.

6 TC is only enough for two monkeys, but you can get a third if you
finish any kind of objective.

> Added a monkey gun case to the uplink, which contains monkey guns!
Though they aren't very powerful.

We can't have the monkey mafia without guns, come on. The guns are weak
and only usable by monkeys. Additionally, they're restricted to
entertainment only.

Credit to SS14 for the monky turtleneck sprite.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Adds a Syndicate Monkey Agent beacon uplink item. It spawns a
dapper monkey that must follow your orders.
add: Added a monkey gun case to the uplink, which contains monkey guns!

Fixes bugs with designator usage (#4693)

# About the pull request

<!-- Remove this text and explain what the purpose of your PR is.

Mention if you have tested your changes. If you changed a map, make sure
you used the mapmerge tool.
If this is an Issue Correction, you can type "Fixes Issue #169420" to

Remember: something that is self-evident to you might not be to others.
Explain your rationale fully, even if you feel it goes without saying.
-->

The Laser Designator is a JTACer's workhorse and it's CLUNKY AS HELL. 

This fixes two main bugs:

* The `interactee` is not properly cleared when using the designator (or
any zoomed item), causing it to be unset instead of set the next time
you use it. This means if you look up then back down your designator,
you can't laze.

* The interaction system wasn't made with movement in mind. It is a
problem because zoom system allows movement, and designators are where
the two meet. Now, they can explicitely keep interaction despite
movement.

# Explain why it's good for the game

QoL that should have been done 6 years ago, give or take

Because Zooming interactions are an awful mess, i'm flagging this for
Testmerge where it'll inevitably break down

# Testing Photographs and Procedure
I take designator, i look, i try to laze. I put them down, move, do it
again. And again. Several combinations of actions.

The unzoom logic is blatantly busted and out of scope of the PR.

# Changelog
:cl:
fix: Fixed Rangefinders/Designators preventing you from lazing if you
looked up/down them without moving.
fix: Fixed Rangefinders/Designators forcing you to look up/down again if
you had moved while using them.

feat(app): Update robots from USB flash drive (#13923)

* feat(app-shell-odd): watch for USB drives

The Flex operating system automatically mounts the filesystems of
well-formatted USB drives (FAT and ext4 and maybe ntfs but that's a bit
iffy) to /media when those USB drives are inserted on the robot. In
theory it will in fact do this for _any_ kind of media that presents a
filesystem interface.

To that end, add a node task that will use a node filesystem watch to
keep an eye on /media, and
- when something that looks like a USB drive (/media/sd\w\d+) appears,
notify via redux actions
   - then enumerate all the files on it and notify those via redux
   actions
- when something we were keeping an eye on disappears, notify via
redux actions

The redux actions don't alter state and so don't need new reducers or
selectors; they exist because it's a handy mechanism to talk between our
components.

This code is very tightly coupled to the way the node fs interfaces work
and so I don't see a lot of point in unit tests for it; it's almost
entirely fs calls originating everything and providing all of the data,
and all the complexity is from working around weirdnesses in those calls
and in the underlying system. For instance,
- There's a little bit of time in between when the fs watch on /media
fires and when you can actually find the contents of the newly-present
directory; if you readdir before that you'll get an empty list, so we
wait a second
- The node fs.watch interface looks very fully features but is
absolutely chock-full of warnings about various features not being
reliable. A lot of that unreliability is _probably_ across systems and
everything works as we expect on linux, but just in case we have a lot
of fallbacks for if our callback doesn't get filepaths, etc

* fix(app-shell-odd): handle errors in readstreams in http.post

We have our custom http interface that wraps around node-fetch that
provides things like "doing your own read stream when posting a file",
and "mapping everything into the promise interface", which is nice,
but has an issue specifically for that read stream: we don't monitor
errors on it. Read streams surface errors by emitting an 'error' event;
we hook up a listener to that error event _while we're creating the
stream_, but then we disconnect it. So if you have an error in the
stream - for instance, you're reading from a file on a USB flash drive
and the user unplugs the flash drive - then the error will never get
surfaced.

Unfortunately the fix to this is a bit fiddly. We can hook up an error
listener fine, but it needs to do something; specifically, it needs to
turn the error from a callback into a promise rejection. That means it
needs to have a promise to reject that has the same lifetime as the
stream itself. http.post didn't provide that because it returns a whole
big promise chain, and each time you move a link in that chain the old
promise is gone and a new one happens, so we'd need to move the listener
around.

Since promises are monadic, a better fix is to have post return a single
promise and do all the promise chaining _inside_ that promise; then, the
read stream error handler can reject the outer promise directly, while
relying on promises bubbling up rejections to preserve error handling
capability for the promises in the internal chain.

* fix(app): Poll for updates on the ODD

Though we have everything set up to automatically fetch, prompt for, and
execute robot updates from the ODD, we weren't actually _checking_ for
those updates except once on boot (which then wouldn't work if the robot
wasn't internet-connected during boot). This means in particular that
the software updates during onboarding were guaranteed to fail.

We can use the same hook in the ODD app root that we do in the desktop
app route, but if we're going to do that then we better remove a log
message that suddenly becomes extremely spammy.

* feat(app-shell-odd): Supply "system updates" from flash drives

Adds the capability to provide system updates from flash drives to the
ODD app-shell.

These are "system updates" in that the app-shell determines their
availability and provides it to the app, rather than the user indicating
the presence of a file alongside their intent to update. The app-shell
will advertise the flash drive updates in the same way it advertises
internet-discovered updates, with a RobotUpdateInfo redux message; since
those now provide the path to the file they mean, it will be easy for
the app to specify the system update to load.

We can duplicate the logic that we use for system updates by adding a
second let cache for the "current update"; the system-updates code will
then prefer an update in the mass storage update cache to an update in
the old system updates cache, and send new robot update info messages in
all the state changes between neither cache being full; either cache
being full; and both caches being full.

The determination that a flash drive system update is present is
triggered by a mass storage enumerated message; when that flash drive
gets removed, we'll get a removal message.

To figure out whether updates are actually present, we can the list of
files that just got enumerated for things that end with .zip, and then
try to open them as zip files and read the VERSION.json information out
of them. This is a somewhat fraught process; the file could not be a zip
file, it could be a zip file but corrupted, it could be a zip file but
not an update, it could be an update but it's for an OT-2,  and we need
to handle all that, so there's a pretty excessive amount of error
handling in here. Once we're sure that there are one or more zip files
containing robot system updates, we can provide something to redux; we
provide the highest-version update present.

There is one way in which updates from flash drives differ from system
updates found on the internet, however: plugging in a flash drive
requires user intent, while checking for updates on the internet
doesn't. Therefore, if the user plugs in a flash drive with an update
file, we always want to make that update file available no matter the
relative versions of the robot and the update file. So we can add a bool
to the system update message (and then to the update state) that shows
that this is a "forced notification" update, and the app can know to
display it without caring about the upgrade/downgrade/reinstall state.

Since there's a lot of duplication, we can also factor out some common
logic to make it feel a little better.

That process of duplication also fixes a bug that would have prevented
the ODD from ever prompting for updates. The function that gets
information about updates used the same promise to read the release
notes and provide the update information; but we overrode the downloaded
release files to null out the release notes, meaning that promise would
always fail, and we'd never get the notification. We no longer override
the release notes to be null, and we also treat reading the release
notes separately from reading the rest of the update.

* feat(app): allow robot updates from USB files

Now that the odd app-shell provides us with notifications of updates
from USB flash drives, we can allow the user to install them. While the
redux mechanisms allow this pretty easily - a system update is a system
update, after all, and with the force mechanism the app wouldn't even
know if the update was a downgrade or anything - we ran into a problem
where the general robot update machinery in the ODD was very tightly
bound with the onboarding experience for the ODD, since that's the
context in which it was developed.

This commit extracts the robot update mechanisms from onboarding by
- Hoisting onboarding-related logic out of lower level components and
instead injecting that logic into the organisms code from the top level
page
- Moving the current update page to a new one that is focused on
onboarding at a new route, and copying just the update-related code to
a generic RobotUpdate page

This means that the two pages - RobotUpdate and
RobotUpdateDuringOnboarding - share most of the same code but are bound
to different routes and can have different top level behavior by
injecting different contexts to the finish and error handling behaviors
of the update. RobotUpdateDuringOnboarding sets the unfinished
onboarding page breadcrumbs appropriately, and uses display language
appropriate to the update being just a component of the larger workflow,
and moves on to estop handling when cancelled; RobotUpdate doesn't touch
any of that, and goes back to the settings page when cancelled, and uses
wording more appropriate to being its own topline flow.

Closes RAUT-829

[Security Solution][Detection Engine] improves new terms rule for multiple fields (#157413)

## Summary

As described in our README for new terms rule type:

> Runtime field supports only 100 emitted values. So for large arrays or
combination of values greater than 100, results may not be exhaustive.
This applies only to new terms with multiple fields.
  Following edge cases possible:
- false negatives (alert is not generated) if too many fields were
emitted and actual new values are not getting evaluated if it happened
in document in rule run window.
- false positives (wrong alert generated) if too many fields were
emitted in historical document and some old terms are not getting
evaluated against values in new documents.

To avoid this and deliver the better experience for our customers, this
PR is moving from current implementation(emitting aggregated values for
multiple new terms fields) towards using composite aggregation for each
page from phase 1, split in chunks by 500.
This allowed to be done due
[order](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html#_order)
of composite aggregation results

NOTE: implementation for a single new terms filed is the same, due to
performance reasons


### Performance measurements

Implementation | Shards | Docs per shard | Simultaneous Rule Executions
| Fields cardinality | Rule Execution Time Runtime field(current
implementation) | On week work
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
array of unique values length 10 |   |   |   |   |   |   
Terms 1 field | 10 | 900,000 | 1 | 100,000 | |   
Terms 2 fields | 10 | 900,000 | 1 | 100,000 | 30s  |  41s
Terms 3 fields | 10 | 900,000 | 1 | 100,000 | 40s | 56s

Implementation | Shards | Docs per shard | Simultaneous Rule Executions
| Fields cardinality | Rule Execution Time Runtime field(current
implementation) | On week work 1,000 per batch | On week work 500 per
batch
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
Terms 2 fields | 10 | 9,000,000 | 1 | 100,000 | 19s | 41s | 35s 
Terms 3 fields | 10 | 9,000,000 | 1 | 100,000 | 21s | 52s| 47s 
CPU % | | | | | 400-450% |500-600% | 400-450%

I selected size of the chunk as 500, since it's a bit faster and less
load on CPU

### Considerations on parallel composite search requests in phase 2

When running composite search requests in parallel, noticed significant
CPU increase in Elasticsearch ~ 1,000% for 2 requests in parallel
against ~ 500% for single.
Where win in performance was not that big: ~ 35s for 2 in parallel, 43s
for a single request. I think, having only one request is the better
option to go, that will prevent unnecessary CPU usage

### Test cases
I've added several functional test cases, that ensures, no missing/false
positives alerts are occurring. Applied to the old implementation, they
would fail

### Retry on max_clause_count error
Because we create query, that can have few thousands clauses, it is
possible it may fail due to [the maximum number of allowed
clauses](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-settings.html)
I implemented retry that: If request fails with batch size of 500
(default value), we will try to reduce it in twice per each retried
request, up until 125. Per ES documentation, max_clause_count min value
is 1,000 - so with 125 we should be able execute query below
max_clause_count value

### Checklist

Delete any items that are not applicable to this PR.

- [x] [Unit or functional
tests](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/development-tests.html)
were updated or added to match the most common scenarios

use display name for verified-by row

using display name and email address adds quite some noise,
esp. if the email addresses are long and non-telling,
this does not really add sth. to "security".

depending one the language, this issue may be even worse.

the idea of showing the address was only to "protect" against ppl
that set their name to "You" or "Me" - however, this trick is maybe a joke
but no security issue:

- the verifier is always a directly verified, known contact
- we do not regard verified contacts as enemies
- the "Me" or "You" is visible and annoying at quite more visible placed
- you can always tap the row and will see
  that this is just a contact with a weird name
  (iOS, eg. shows a > to clarify that the cell is tappable,
  we could do sth. like that one android, other colors or whatever,
  however, i would not do that beforehand without more reasonings and usecases)

all in all, showing a long, non-telling row here,
seems over the top and not regarding the whole story.

Comprehend Moderation 0.2 (#11730)

This PR replaces the previous `Intent` check with the new `Prompt
Safety` check. The logic and steps to enable chain moderation via the
Amazon Comprehend service, allowing you to detect and redact PII, Toxic,
and Prompt Safety information in the LLM prompt or answer remains
unchanged.
This implementation updates the code and configuration types with
respect to `Prompt Safety`.


### Usage sample

```python
from langchain_experimental.comprehend_moderation import (BaseModerationConfig, 
                                 ModerationPromptSafetyConfig, 
                                 ModerationPiiConfig, 
                                 ModerationToxicityConfig
)

pii_config = ModerationPiiConfig(
    labels=["SSN"],
    redact=True,
    mask_character="X"
)

toxicity_config = ModerationToxicityConfig(
    threshold=0.5
)

prompt_safety_config = ModerationPromptSafetyConfig(
    threshold=0.5
)

moderation_config = BaseModerationConfig(
    filters=[pii_config, toxicity_config, prompt_safety_config]
)

comp_moderation_with_config = AmazonComprehendModerationChain(
    moderation_config=moderation_config, #specify the configuration
    client=comprehend_client,            #optionally pass the Boto3 Client
    verbose=True
)

template = """Question: {question}

Answer:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])

responses = [
    "Final Answer: A credit card number looks like 1289-2321-1123-2387. A fake SSN number looks like 323-22-9980. John Doe's phone number is (999)253-9876.", 
    "Final Answer: This is a really shitty way of constructing a birdhouse. This is fucking insane to think that any birds would actually create their motherfucking nests here."
]
llm = FakeListLLM(responses=responses)

llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

chain = ( 
    prompt 
    | comp_moderation_with_config 
    | {llm_chain.input_keys[0]: lambda x: x['output'] }  
    | llm_chain 
    | { "input": lambda x: x['text'] } 
    | comp_moderation_with_config 
)

try:
    response = chain.invoke({"question": "A sample SSN number looks like this 123-456-7890. Can you give me some more samples?"})
except Exception as e:
    print(str(e))
else:
    print(response['output'])

```

### Output

```python
> Entering new AmazonComprehendModerationChain chain...
Running AmazonComprehendModerationChain...
Running pii Validation...
Running toxicity Validation...
Running prompt safety Validation...

> Finished chain.

Grand Ritual Finale: An end to death (#78497)

## About The Pull Request

Adds a new Wizard Ritual Finale effect which makes everything immortal.
By this I mean, 10 seconds after death a ghostly image of them will
appear somewhere near where the corpse was and then 50 seconds after
that the mob will return to life at that location.
This applies to every mob, everywhere.
This is likely to cause a little bit of disruption to the rest of the
round, so you can only do it after at least 30 minutes have passed.
After that the crew will have to figure out how to deal with their new
gift of immortality. It will involve throwing people into chasms and
lava, probably.


![dreamseeker_7SwMsSrnt1](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/5b794bcc-fcba-46b5-b228-e95aa685942d)
Here's a gif sped up for example purposes.

You can escape from the cycle of death and rebirth via suicide, purely
because it's pointless to try and force people to play the video game if
they don't want to.

Also I split all of these effects into their own files, the only new
code for those is in `immortality.dm`

shout out to Vekter for distracting Oranges while I posted this
wizard-related PR so I didn't get disapprovingly reacted for posting
magic shit (yet)

## Why It's Good For The Game

This might be _too_ much but I want to see what would happen.
It will allow us to simulate whether polite society can survive when
violence has no consequences.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Wizards who complete the grand ritual can now gift everyone with
eternal life

aider: Changed drag and drop elements to be touch screen friendly by wrapping the ReactFlow component with DndProvider and using TouchBackend.

# Aider chat conversation:

USER: i want to change the drag and drop elements to something touch screen friendly as touch isn't working on my touch devices browsers

ASSISTANT: To make the drag and drop elements touch screen friendly, we would need to ensure that the library or framework being used for the drag and drop functionality supports touch events. If the current implementation does not support touch events, we might need to either update the library to a version that does or switch to a different library that has touch support.

Since you've mentioned that touch isn't working on your touch devices' browsers, here are the general steps we would take:

1. Identify the library or framework used for drag and drop in the `MarketplaceCanvas.js` file within the `packages\ui\src\views\marketplaces` directory. This is likely where the drag and drop functionality is implemented.

2. Check the documentation for the library to see if there is a way to enable touch support. This could involve setting a configuration option or including additional scripts.

3. If the current library does not support touch, we would look for an alternative library that does. Libraries like `react-dnd-touch-backend` for `react-dnd` or `react-beautiful-dnd` are examples that have good touch support.

4. Update the code to use the new library or the touch-enabled version of the current library.

Since I don't have access to the actual source code, I can't provide specific code changes. However, if you add the `MarketplaceCanvas.js` file to the chat, I can give you detailed instructions on what changes to make to enable touch support for the drag and drop elements. Would you like to proceed with this?

USER: I added these *read-write* files: packages\ui\src\views\marketplaces\MarketplaceCanvas.js

ASSISTANT: Great, you've already provided the `MarketplaceCanvas.js` file in a previous message. Since the file uses `ReactFlow`, which should support touch events out of the box, it's possible that the touch functionality is not working due to missing touch event handlers or CSS issues.

ReactFlow uses `react-dnd` under the hood, which has a touch backend that can be used for touch devices. We need to ensure that the touch backend is properly set up.

Here's what we need to do:

1. Install the `react-dnd-touch-backend` package if it's not already installed.
2. Import the `DndProvider` and `TouchBackend` from `react-dnd` and `react-dnd-touch-backend` respectively.
3. Wrap the `ReactFlow` component with the `DndProvider`.

Let's start by installing the `react-dnd-touch-backend` package. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

```sh
npm install react-dnd-touch-backend
```

After installing the package, we will modify the `MarketplaceCanvas.js` file to use the `TouchBackend` for touch devices.

Here's the code change for `MarketplaceCanvas.js`:

```

This change wraps the `ReactFlow` component with the `DndProvider` and uses the `TouchBackend`. The `options` object passed to `TouchBackend` with `enableMouseEvents: true` ensures that mouse events are also handled, making the component work for both touch and non-touch devices.

Please make sure to test this on your touch devices to confirm that the touch functionality is working as expected.

techpack: display: Handle dim for udfps

Apparently, los fod impl is better than udfps cuz it
has onShow/HideFodView hook, which allows us to toggle
dimlayer seamlessly.

Since udfps only partially supports the former one,
we'd better kill dim in kernel. This is kinda a hack
but it works well, bringing perfect fod experience
back to us.

Also implement a panel status check to ensure that
the dim layer dies when display is off.

Update base for Update on "AOTAutograd: handle set_(), detect metadata mutations that cancel out"

This should be enough to get voznesenskym 's FSDP branch to plumb `set_()` through AOTAutograd properly and have everything properly no-op out. Main changes are:

(1) graph break on `aten::set_.source_Tensor_storage_offset` (we could support it but it isn't needed, seems safer to graph break)

(2) Functionalization: add a "proper" functionalization kernel for `aten::set_.source_Tensor`. The previous one we had was codegen'd and it was wrong (it would just clone() and call set_(), which does not do the right thing). I also manually mark on the `FunctionalTensorWrapper` when a given tensor has been mutated by a `set_()` call.

(3) AOTAutograd: I added a new field, `InputAliasInfo.mutates_storage_metadata`, so we can distinguish between "regular" metadata mutations, and metadata mutations due to `set_()` calls. This is mainly because at runtime, one requires calling `as_strided_()` to fix up metadata, while the other requires calling `set_()`.

(4) Made AOTAutograd's detection for metadata mutations / set_() mutations smarter and detect no-ops (if the storage and metadata are all the same).

I also killed `was_updated()` and `was_metadata_updated()`, and replaced them with (existing) `has_data_mutation() ` and (new) `has_data_mutation()`, which can more accurately distinguish between data-mutation vs. `set_()` calls vs. metadata-mutation

**This PR is still silently correct in one case though**, which I'd like to discuss more. In particular, this example:
```
def f(x):
    x_view = x.view(-1)
    x.set_(torch.ones(2))
    x_view.mul_(2)
    return
```

If you have an input that experiences both a data-mutation **and** a `x_old.set_(x_new)` call, there are two cases:

(a) the data mutation happened on the storage of `x_new`. This case should be handled automatically: if x_new is a graph intermediate then we will functionalize the mutation. If x_new is a different graph input, then we will perform the usual `copy_()` on that other graph input

(b) the data mutation happened on the storage of `x_old`. This is more of a pain to handle, and doesn't currently work. At runtime, the right thing to do is probably something like:
```

def functionalized_f(x):
    x_view = x.view(-1)
    # set_() desugars into a no-op; later usages of x will use x_output
    x_output = torch.ones(2)
    # functionalize the mutation on x_view
    x_view_updated = x.mul(2)
    x_updated = x_view_updated.view(x.shape)
    # x experienced TWO TYPES of mutations; a data mutation and a metatadata mutation
    # We need to return both updated tensors in our graph
    return x_updated, x_output
def runtime_wrapper(x):
    x_data_mutation_result, x_set_mutation_result = compiled_graph(x)
    # First, perform the data mutation on x's old storage
    x.copy_(x_data_mutation_result)
    # Then, swap out the storage of x with the new storage
    x.set_(x_set_mutation_result)
```

There are two things that make this difficult to do though:

(1) Functionalization: the functionalization rule for `set_()` will fully throw away the old `FunctionalStorageImpl` on the graph input. So if there are any mutations to that `FunctionalStorageImpl` later on in the graph, the current graph input won't know about it. Maybe we can have a given `FunctionalTensorWrapper` remember all previous storages that it had, and track mutations on all of them - although this feels pretty complicated.

(2) AOTAutograd now needs to know that we might have *two* graph outputs that correspond to a single "mutated input", which is annoying.

It's worth pointing out that this issue is probably extremely unlikely for anyone to run into - can we just detect it and error? This feels slightly easier than solving it, although not significantly easier. We would still need `FunctionalTensorWrapper` to keep track of mutations on any of its "previous" storages, so it can report this info back to AOTAutograd so we can raise an error.

fixes for previous commit; remember to add lines which use the trusted-set scriptlet to "My Filters" tab in uBlock Origin or they will not work

vidmoly still doesn't play videos, but there are no ads or ad redirects and popups.  Choose another video host/server on embed websites like kimcartoon.

The image carousel/gallery widget is still broken @ windowscentral.com.

Downloads @ drive.online-fix.me may still be broken, but at least they don't appear to be broken as the dialog box and buttons to trigger them is displayed.  I have not tested downloads because they require giving access to one's own Google Drive account which is an idiotic thing to do given the hostility of the person who runs online-fix.me.

gplinks.co/gplinks.in is broken as adblocking is detected.

The asshole that runs Devuploads has broken downloads again as has the asshole who runs DropGalaxy.  Both file hosts appear to be using the same anti-adblock technique, but getting past it hasn't worked so far because uBlock is apparently ignoring the rules I have tried to bypass it.  I may have to remove rules or make exceptions to let more ad crap through for Devuploads and DropGalaxy to work.

hurry.stream embedded videos still do not play, but it looks like it may be a problem with hurry.stream as it also has CORS blocking the m3u8 file requests on Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.  Streaming a video from hurry.stream has only ever worked for me on Android, but that was without any adblocking so have not yet tested with my adblocking rules on Android.

https://freestreams-live1.tv/nflnetwork5/ is still broken.  It appears the script which creates the embedded video iframe is being blocked at least in part.  freestreams-live1.tv works with other channels/streams though.

Add Postpone API (#27238)

This adds an experimental `unstable_postpone(reason)` API.

Currently we don't have a way to model effectively an Infinite Promise.
I.e. something that suspends but never resolves. The reason this is
useful is because you might have something else that unblocks it later.
E.g. by updating in place later, or by client rendering.

On the client this works to model as an Infinite Promise (in fact,
that's what this implementation does). However, in Fizz and Flight that
doesn't work because the stream needs to end at some point. We don't
have any way of knowing that we're suspended on infinite promises. It's
not enough to tag the promises because you could await those and thus
creating new promises. The only way we really have to signal this
through a series of indirections like async functions, is by throwing.
It's not 100% safe because these values can be caught but it's the best
we can do.

Effectively `postpone(reason)` behaves like a built-in [Catch
Boundary](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26854). It's like
`raise(Postpone, reason)` except it's built-in so it needs to be able to
be encoded and caught by Suspense boundaries.

In Flight and Fizz these behave pretty much the same as errors. Flight
just forwards it to retrigger on the client. In Fizz they just trigger
client rendering which itself might just postpone again or fill in the
value. The difference is how they get logged.

In Flight and Fizz they log to `onPostpone(reason)` instead of
`onError(error)`. This log is meant to help find deopts on the server
like finding places where you fall back to client rendering. The reason
that you pass in is for that purpose to help the reason for any deopts.

I do track the stack trace in DEV but I don't currently expose it to
`onPostpone`. This seems like a limitation. It might be better to expose
the Postpone object which is an Error object but that's more of an
implementation detail. I could also pass it as a second argument.

On the client after hydration they don't get passed to
`onRecoverableError`. There's no global `onPostpone` API to capture
postponed things on the client just like there's no `onError`. At that
point it's just assumed to be intentional. It doesn't have any `digest`
or reason passed to the client since it's not logged.

There are some hacky solutions that currently just tries to reuse as
much of the existing code as possible but should be more properly
implemented.
- Fiber is currently just converting it to a fake Promise object so that
it behaves like an infinite Promise.
- Fizz is encoding the magic digest string `"POSTPONE"` in the HTML so
we know to ignore it but it should probably just be something neater
that doesn't share namespace with digests.

Next I plan on using this in the `/static` entry points for additional
features.

Why "postpone"? It's basically a synonym to "defer" but we plan on using
"defer" for other purposes and it's overloaded anyway.

Hey what if I made Sleeping Carp better at nonlethal takedowns and also deflect with combat mode instead of throw mode (but cost more) (#79517)

## About The Pull Request

It's been a hot minute hasn't it?

When I initially reworked Sleeping Carp, we didn't have combat mode. Now
that we do, and that Sleeping Carp has substantially less defensive
power to justify having to make a choice between deflection and
attacking, it's probably about time we updated this aspect back to what
it was before my rework. Sorta.

Now, we can have all the deniability of the previous method, while also
letting you reliably protect yourself from ranged attacks at all times
while it matters. Because of this, I increased the price up to 17 TC
because of this change just to be on the safe side. The higher uptime of
projectile immunity while also being able to attack during that time
makes this a lot stronger overall.

Secondly, Sleeping Carp presently just isn't as good as a good ol'
baton. It takes a lot more hits to accomplish the same task that a baton
can. Many people feel like they can't even reasonably fight anyone for
fear of the baton, or they would rather use a baton and kill someone at
their leisure. So we've updated some of the moves in order to facilitate
Sleeping Carp as a substantial contender for 1v1 fighting, and lessen
the need for a baton by adding a lot more Stamina damage overall to the
various attacks;

**Keelhaul**: Now a Shove Shove combo. Does literally zero lethal
damage, but now temporarily blinds and dizzies the target as well as its
previous effects. The amount of lethal damage it did was...extremely
small, so this isn't a particularly big loss.

**Grabs and Shoves**: Deal some amount of stamina damage (20). You need
to be in combat mode in order to perform these special attacks (more
deniability). Grabbing someone while they have 80 Stamina damage or more
will cause them to fall unconscious. Yes, I really did just want to add
a Vulcan Nerve Pinch, what do you want from me?

That's it actually. Oh, I guess they are heavy sleepers now too. Because
its funny.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I often get told (read: thrown various insults and slurs at me while
mentioning this as the justification) that Sleeping Carp is not very
strong anymore since it lost all that invisible armor I added way back +
I removed the stuns in my initial rework. This made some people upset (I
think at least one person wished for my death).

So, having given it at least 2 years, I wanted to recapture parts of
what made the older Sleeping Carp (before my rework) strong, some of the
benefits of the new version, and introduce a brand new aspect; nonlethal
takedowns. This makes it beneficial for pacifists, as well as for
kidnapping.

This should not meaningfully make Sleeping Carp any stronger against the
things that typically ruin its day. I suspect in a straight joust with a
baton, Sleeping Carp will still struggle. But against what should be its
strong points (lone targets and ranged weapons), it will be strong once
again rather than clumsily unable to do very much at all.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Harnessing Shoreline Quay (bluespace energy, probably), a
mystical energy (total bullshit) that permeates the Astral Waterways
(bluespace quantum dimensions, probably), Sleeping Carp users can now
once against deflect projectiles with their bare hands when focused in
on battle (in combat mode).
balance: The Keelhaul technique is now nonlethal (a philosophical
acknowledgement of the familial bond of sleep and death), but causes the
target to become temporarily blind and dizzy along with its previous
effects.
balance: Sleeping carp users, while in combat mode, deal Stamina damage
with their grabs and shoves. If the target of their grab has enough
Stamina damage (80), they are knocked unconscious from a well placed
nerve pinch.
balance: Sleeping carp users find it very hard to wake up once they fall
asleep....
