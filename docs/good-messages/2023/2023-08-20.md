Add Postpone API (#27238)

This adds an experimental `unstable_postpone(reason)` API.

Currently we don't have a way to model effectively an Infinite Promise.
I.e. something that suspends but never resolves. The reason this is
useful is because you might have something else that unblocks it later.
E.g. by updating in place later, or by client rendering.

On the client this works to model as an Infinite Promise (in fact,
that's what this implementation does). However, in Fizz and Flight that
doesn't work because the stream needs to end at some point. We don't
have any way of knowing that we're suspended on infinite promises. It's
not enough to tag the promises because you could await those and thus
creating new promises. The only way we really have to signal this
through a series of indirections like async functions, is by throwing.
It's not 100% safe because these values can be caught but it's the best
we can do.

Effectively `postpone(reason)` behaves like a built-in [Catch
Boundary](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26854). It's like
`raise(Postpone, reason)` except it's built-in so it needs to be able to
be encoded and caught by Suspense boundaries.

In Flight and Fizz these behave pretty much the same as errors. Flight
just forwards it to retrigger on the client. In Fizz they just trigger
client rendering which itself might just postpone again or fill in the
value. The difference is how they get logged.

In Flight and Fizz they log to `onPostpone(reason)` instead of
`onError(error)`. This log is meant to help find deopts on the server
like finding places where you fall back to client rendering. The reason
that you pass in is for that purpose to help the reason for any deopts.

I do track the stack trace in DEV but I don't currently expose it to
`onPostpone`. This seems like a limitation. It might be better to expose
the Postpone object which is an Error object but that's more of an
implementation detail. I could also pass it as a second argument.

On the client after hydration they don't get passed to
`onRecoverableError`. There's no global `onPostpone` API to capture
postponed things on the client just like there's no `onError`. At that
point it's just assumed to be intentional. It doesn't have any `digest`
or reason passed to the client since it's not logged.

There are some hacky solutions that currently just tries to reuse as
much of the existing code as possible but should be more properly
implemented.
- Fiber is currently just converting it to a fake Promise object so that
it behaves like an infinite Promise.
- Fizz is encoding the magic digest string `"POSTPONE"` in the HTML so
we know to ignore it but it should probably just be something neater
that doesn't share namespace with digests.

Next I plan on using this in the `/static` entry points for additional
features.

Why "postpone"? It's basically a synonym to "defer" but we plan on using
"defer" for other purposes and it's overloaded anyway.

[no gbp] Adds missing chat feedback to watcher abilities (#77700)

## About The Pull Request

I kept meaning to add this in my last PR and kept thinking "I'll add
that in with these review changes" and then forgot every time. This
should make it clearer what is happening to you and why.

Also I made the gaze ability stun the user for a short period after it
goes off because them shooting you instantly after they stop channeling
_is_ sort of bullshit.
Also while testing this I noticed the AI interrupt one of its actions to
do the other one which is a bit silly so now it cannot do that.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Outlines in the log why something bad just happened to you.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Added some textual feedback to new watcher abilities
balance: Watchers will not attack for a short period following their
gaze attack
fix: Watchers won't interrupt one ability to use the other one

Bruh

I hate what Pogba did to Poland, this is some GFM level event gay shit.
Anyone with half a braincell knows events suck ass, its impossible to make sense of this fucking tree. You need a fucking excel spreadsheet to understand what the fuck is even happening. Like there is straight up no explanation too, in literally every mp game the Poland player just gets stuck with a Silean and Hungarian Puppet and his starting land and cant do shit the entire game because half his country is owned by the ai. Like fucking hell is it really so hard to just make 5 decisions that have an explanation in their description if they are mutually exclusive? Or atleast give a starting event that explains the situation and the paths. This shit is so fucking retarded, whoever made this should kys.

Add positive source filter

Source filtering is a really cool Nix feature that lets us avoid a
lot of rebuilds, which speeds up the iteration cycle a lot in cases
where the relevant source files aren't actually modified.

We used to have a source filter that marked a few files as irrelevant,
but this is the wrong approach, as we have many more files that are
irrelevant. We may call this negative filtering.

This commit switches the source filtering to positive filtering, which
is a lot more robust. Instead of marking which files we don't need
we marked the files that we do need.

It's a superior approach because it is fail safe. Instead of allowing
build performance problems to creep in over time, we require that all
source inputs are declared.

I shouldn't have to explain that declaring inputs is a good practice,
so I'll stop over-explaining here.

I do have to acknowledge that this will cause a build failure when the
filter is incomplete. This is *good*, because it's the only realistic
way we could be reminded of these problems. These events will be
infrequent, so the small cost of extending the filter is worth it,
compared to the hidden cost of longer dev cycles for things like tests,
docker image, etc, etc.

(Also rebuilding Nix for stupid unnecessary reasons makes my blood boil)

Nukies Update 7: Hats (Also massive uplink standardization, weapon kits and ammo changes) (#77330)

## About The Pull Request

Massively overhauls and standardizes the nuclear operative uplink. 

### Weapon Kits

Essentially, all the main weapons of the uplink have been changed to
instead come as 'weapon kits', which are essentially cases containing a
weapon loadout to enable operatives to easily start operating on only
just one item purchase, without the fuss of worrying whether or not
operatives are getting spare ammo, or getting relevant equipment for
success. Consider this a pseudo-loadout, though without necessarily
restricting the purchasing of more weapon kits.

All kits come in three categories: Low Cost (8 TC), Medium Cost (14 TC)
and High Cost (18 TC). This is also matched by categorized ammo costs;
Basic Ammo (2 TC), Hollow Point and Armour Penetrating (4 TC),
Incendiary (3 TC) and Special (or anything that does not easily fit
these categories and does something real extra) (5 TC). Weapons that
lacked these ammos have gained these ammo types to fill the gaps.

<details>
There is may one exception to this in disruptor ammo, which is priced as
basic ammo if only because it isn't _quite_ good enough to justify
pricing at 5 tc and I can see an op wanting to use it as a basic ammo
type instead of normal .50 BMG against, say, a silicon/mech heavy
opposition. Since it cannot kill organics on its own, I'll consider this
mostly basic-adjacent
</details>
The kits have also been labelled based on potential difficulty. This
reflects possible difficulties in using the item, how conducive it is to
success for how much game knowledge needed to actually use it, and how
likely an op is to succeed using it. I don't expect ops to win using
nothing but a rocket launcher, but I think ops should get a fair shake
at trying, yeah?

The kits are as below:
#### **Low-Cost**
_Bulldog (Moderate):_ Shotgun and three magazines of standard ammo.
_Ansem (Easy/Spare):_ Pistol and three spare magazines of standard ammo.
#### **Medium Cost**
_C-20r (Easy):_ SMG and three spare magazines of standard ammo.
_Energy Sword and Shield (Very Hard):_ Energy sword and shield. (Also a
special hat)
_Revolver (Moderate):_ Revolver and three speedloaders of standard ammo.
_Rocket Launcher (Hard):_ Rocket launcher with three spare rockets.
#### **High Cost**
_L6 SAW (Moderate):_ LMG, and that's it. No spare ammo.
_M-90gl (Hard):_ Rifle, two spare magazines of standard ammo and a box
of rubber grenades.
_Sniper (Hard):_ Sniper rifle, two spare magazine of standard ammo, and
one magazine of disruptor ammo. Also suit and tie.
_CQC (Very Hard):_ Comes with a stealth implant and a bandana.
_Double-Energy Sword (Very Hard):_ Double-energy sword, syndicate soap,
antislip module, meth injector and a prisoner jumpsuit.
_**NEW** Grenadier's Kit (Hard):_ Grenadier's belt and grenade launcher
(the one that launchers chem grenades). (I replaced the shit acid
grenade with another flashbang in the belt)

Surplus SMG (Flukie difficulty) has been unchanged. It just now comes
with two rations.

Includes two new revolver ammo types: Phasic, which goes through walls
and armor, but has significantly less damage as a result (I've equalized
the revolver damage and the rifle version's damage to 30 for both). And
Heartseeker, which has homing bullets. Both are Special ammo, and are
priced at 5 TC a speedloader.

### Other Gear

The other items in the uplink have also been consolidated and
standardized in various ways.

#### Grenades

Most now cost 15 TC for three grenades of any given type (including the
full fungal tuberculous). This is pretty much identical to the previous
price, just more consistent overall and front-loaded in cost.

#### Reinforcements

All the various reinforcements now cost 35 TC and all refundable,
equalizing cost to the average across the reinforcements. This is
primarily because I feel like all these options should be weighed
equally, and not one of these options are necessarily worse or better
than the other in their current balance. They're largely inaccessible
for normal ops regardless, and typically come out when there is a
discount or war ops. I took the average value and went with it. Not much
more to say.

#### Mechs

They're just cheaper. These things still suck and they need help.
They've always needed help. A slightly less excessive value for the
mechs may help see people willing to spend the TC on them. I doubt it. I
seriously suggest not buying these still. I keep them in primarily
because they are big stompy mechs and are kind of iconic 'war ops' gear.

#### Bundles

Since I've implemented weapon kits, gun bundles are rather redundant. So
the bulldog weapon and ammo bundle, the c20-r weapon and ammo bundle and
technically the sniper bundle were removed. The sniper bundle is now the
weapon kit, obviously.

Nothing else here really. Except for one....

#### Implants

Not much changed here. I standardized the implant prices to 8 TC a pop.
This is in accordance with traitor implants, which ops also get. So
everything in this category bar a few exceptions (like macro/microbombs)
are around 8 TC. Makes sense to me, really.

Importantly, I made the Implant bundle 25 TC, and I unrandomized the
contents. Who in the right fucking mind would spend 40 TC just to get
five reviver implants is beyond me. But instead, you get one of each of
the cybernetic implants except thermal eyes (you can just buy thermals
and get the benefit of both vision types; x-ray and thermal vision, if
you want to use smokescreens a lot).

#### Base Keys

They're all now 15 TC, except the fridge which is 5 TC. It's weird
they're valued differently when they are taken mostly to do gimmicks
like xenobio and toxins in a hurry before hitting the station. So we've
standardized it.

## Hat Crate

**YES, GOOD SIR, YOU TOO CAN ORDER A HAT CRATE FROM THE SYNDICATE STORE
FOR ONLY 5 TC!**

**NO NEED FOR A KEY, JUST BUY IT AND PULL IT OPEN WITH YOUR STANDARD
ISSUE CROWBAR!**

**ENJOY YOUR NEW CRATE! ENJOY YOUR NEW HAT!**

**PUT IT ON USING THE FREE HAT STABILIZERS WE INCLUDED WITH THE HATS!**

~~**NO REFUNDS IF YOU GET BLOOD ON YOUR HAT!**~~

<details>
There is a 1% chance to instagib people with direct hits from a rocket.
This does the crit effect.
</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game

The uplink needed more spring cleaning and standardization.

With this, I've partially implemented my older idea for ammo consistency
and initial allowance for nukies. Ammo is kind of over-priced and often
where a good chunk of TC goes towards without really pushing nukies
towards meaningful success. And it is often what is tripping up new
players who didn't think to get any. Now, when they get a gun, they get
ammo in their case. On top of this, the weapon kit category is both at
the top of the uplink AND has a little label to say 'Recommend', so that
these new players will hopefully know they should be looking there
first.

In addition, it is the gateway towards a concept that is currently being
worked on. Nuclear operatives having some degree of predefined loadouts
for players to select if they aren't sure what they want, or don't know
what to get. Nukies is very confusing for many players. So giving them a
fighting chance with some premade setups can help ease them into the
role without needing too much player knowledge in how to apply the
items. This is only one step towards that, so that players can identify
what gear they need to help succeed based on their skill.

I wanted to implement a difficulty warning so that players can choose
gear loadouts that are actually conducive to their skill and knowledge.
I based it on how much players would need to know to engage in combat
with it, and how much fiddling is required to get something to work
properly (overly involved reloading is a consideration, for example, as
well as precise button presses). In addition, how much of a force
multiplier some weapons can be for their ease of use.

Most people recognize the c20-r as the most new player friendly weapon,
as an example. So it would be good to steer players towards taking that
gun because of how easy it is to use, understand and succeed with it.

And most importantly of all; Having standards within the uplink is
important. Most of the values in the uplink are just completely random.
Nobody has a good grasp of what is too much or too little. Even just a
hint of consistency, and people will stick to it (see implants for what
I mean). And there is still some work to be done even there. A good
start is weapons. Price for power can be meaningful when decided whether
we want some weapons to come out more often than others. Players do
enjoy making informed decisions and choices, and having affordability be
a draw to some otherwise less powerful weapons (looking at you, Bulldog)
can actually be a worthwhile and meaningful difference.

~~I thought it would tick off the gun nerds to change the calibers on
the guns.~~

~~I also thought adding hats would be funny given the release of TF2's
most recent update.~~

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Standardizes some of the nuclear operative entries to have more
consistent pricing within their respective categories.
add: Adds some new categories so that players have an easier time
navigating the nuclear operative uplink.
balance: Many items have had prices reduced or adjusted to make them
more desirable or more consistent within their category.
add: Weapon kits have replaced almost all the individual weapons in the
uplink. You now buy these instead of the individual weapon. These often
come with spare ammo or relevant gear for success.
add: Most ammo types have been standardized in price.
refactor; Removes a lot of redundant item entry code and tidies up the
actual code part of the nuclear uplink so that it is much easier to find
things within it.
add: Added 40 new cosmetic items to the Syndicate Store. Buy them now
from the Hat Crate, only 5 TC!
code: Updated the nuclear operative uplink files.

Chen And Garry's Ice Cream: Ice Cream DLC (LIZARD APPROVED!) (#77174)

## About The Pull Request

Authored with help and love from @Thalpy 

I scream for ice cream!!


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/10399117/db1e559b-7dab-499b-a076-8f12748ba2e8)

Introduces many new flavours of ice cream:
-Caramel
-Banana
-Lemon Sorbet
-Orange Creamsicle
-Peach (Limited Edition!)
-Cherry chip
-Korta Vanilla (made with lizard-friendly ingredients!)


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/10399117/99a87615-f55c-49be-8caf-2b1ac4c7f03f)

Korta Cones! Now too can Nanotrasen's sanitation staff enjoy the wonders
of ice cream!
You can also substitute custom ice cream flavours with korta milk!
Finally, the meaty ice cream lactose-intolerants asked for is in reach!

## Why It's Good For The Game

I always thought the ice cream vat could use more flavours. The custom
flavour besides, it isn't as intuitive to rename the cone and the added
variety is good. The lack of a banana flavour already was questionable.
All the ice cream flavours used a selection of five sprites, now it's
just one sprite and better supporting more additions.
Some of the flavours don't use milk! You can't do this with the custom
flavour, making it slightly more interesting.

## Changelog
:cl: YakumoChen, Thalpy
add: Chen And Garry's Ice Cream is proud to debut a wide selection of
cool new frozen treat flavours on a space station near you!
add: Chen And Garry's Ice Cream revolutionary Korta Cones allow our ice
cream vendors to profit off the lizard demographic like never before!
code: Ice cream flavours now are all greyscaled similarly to GAGs

Dissection experiments are handled by autopsy surgery. Removes redundant dissection surgery. You can repeat an autopsy on someone who has come back to life. (#77386)

## About The Pull Request

TRAIT_DISSECTED has had the surgical speed boost moved over to
TRAIT_SURGICALLY_ANALYZED.

TRAIT_DISSECTED now tracks if we can do an autopsy on the same body
again, and blocks further autopsies if it is on the mob. A mob that
comes back to life loses TRAIT_DISSECTED. This allows for mobs to be
autopsied once again.

Since it is completely redundant now (and was the whole time TBH),
dissections have been removed in favour of just having the experiment
track autopsies.

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/76775

## Why It's Good For The Game

Today I showed up to a round where someone autopsied all the bodies in
the morgue, not realizing they were using the wrong surgery. Since I
couldn't _redo_ the surgery, this rendered all these bodies useless.
This was not out of maliciousness, they just didn't know better. There
are two autopsies in the surgery list, but only one is valid for the
experiment and doing the wrong one blocks _both surgeries_. Dissection
is completely useless outside of experiments. This same issue also
prevents additional autopsies on the same person, even if they had come
back to life and died again after you had done the initial autopsy.
Surely you would want to do more than one autopsy, right? That's two
separate deaths!

This resolves that by giving you a method of redoing any screwups on the
same corpse if necessary. It only matters if the experiment is available
anyway, so there isn't much reason to punish players unduly just because
they weren't aware science hadn't hit a button on their side (especially
since it isn't communicated to the coroner in any way to begin with). It
also removes a completely useless surgery and ties in the experiment to
what the coroner is already going to be doing. They can dissect their
corpses to their hearts content without worrying about retribution from
science for doing so.

In addition, someone repeatedly dying can continue to have autopsies
done on them over the course of the round. The surgery bonus only
applies once, so the only reason to do autopsies after the first is to
discover what might have killed someone. No reason this should block
further surgeries, just block surgeries when the person remains a
corpse.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: You can do autopsies on people who were revived and died again
after they had already been dissected.
qol: Autopsies have become the surgery needed to complete the dissection
experiments. As a result, the dissection surgery has been removed as it
is now redundant.
qol: A coroner knows whether someone has been autopsied and recently
dissected (and thus hasn't been revived) by examining them.

[MIRROR] Adds a wizard Right and Wrong that lets the caster give one spell (or relic) to everyone on the station [MDB IGNORE] (#22637)

* Adds a wizard Right and Wrong that lets the caster give one spell (or relic) to everyone on the station (#76974)

## About The Pull Request

This PR adds a new wizard ritual (the kind that require 100 threat on
dynamic)

This ritual allows the wizard to select one spellbook entry (item or
spell), to which everyone on the station will be given or taught said
spell or item. If the spell requires a robe, the spell becomes robeless,
and if the item requires wizard to use, it makes it usable. Mostly.

- Want an epic sword fight? Give everyone a high-frequency blade

- One mindswap not enough shenanigans for you? Give out mindswap

- Fourth of July? Fireball would be pretty hilarious...

The wizard ritual costs 3 points plus the cost of whatever entry you are
giving out. So giving everyone fireball is 5 points.

It can only be cast once by a wizard, because I didn't want to go
through the effort to allow multiple in existence

## Why It's Good For The Game

Someone gave me the idea and I thought it sounded pretty funny as an
alternative to Summon Magic

Maybe I make this a Grand Finale ritual instead / in tandem? That's also
an idea.

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
add: Wizards have a new Right and Wrong: Mass Teaching, allowing them to
grant everyone on the station one spell or relic of their choice!

New Mech UI and equipment refactor (#77221)

![bWJlVIDO53](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/d75030b5-59e9-43f6-96b4-1b7564caceef)

## About The Pull Request

Made a new UI and refactored some mech code in the process.

Fixes #66048
Fixes #77051
Fixes #65958 ??? if it was broken
Fixes #73051 - see details below
Fixes other undocumented things, see changelog.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The UI was too bulky and Mechs were too complex for no reason. 
Now they follow some general rules shared between other SS13 machinery,
and there is less magic happening under the hood.

## Detailed Changes

### New Mech UI, Air Tank and Radio as separate modules

Previous UI for comparison:

<img alt="9SScrXAOjy"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/904e3d07-e7d7-4d3a-a062-93e0e35b4b66">

Previously mechs came with radio pre-installed and air canisters
magically pre-filled with air even when you build one in fab.
Radio and Air Tanks are now both utility modules that are optional to
install. Gas RCS thrusters still require Air Tank module to operate.

This made the Mechs more barebones when built, giving you only the basic
functionality.

<img alt="5SDMlXTJxv"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/b9364230-49ac-416b-aa70-e851fbf2050e">

To compensate this change, all mechs got two extra utility module slots.

All other modules got new UI. And ore box now shows the list of ores
inside.

<img alt="SRX5FjvsHA"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/cbe2e98d-1cd4-4667-8dae-2f9227b4b265">

### Mounted Radio

Works as a normal radio, but with subspace transmission. Available from
the basic mech research node and can be printed in fab.

### Cabin Sealing

To compensate for the lack of air tank by default, mechs with enclosed
cabin (e.g. all except Ripley) got an ability to toggle cabin exposure
to the outside air. Exiting the mech makes cabin air automatically
exposed.

When you seal the cabin, it traps some of the outside air inside the
cabin and you can breathe with this air to perform a short space trips.
But the oxygen will run out quickly and CO2 will build up.

Sealing the cabin in space will make the cabin filled with vacuum, and
it will stay there until you return to air environment and unseal the
cabin, letting the breathable air to enter. There are temperature and
pressure sensors that turn yellow/red when the corresponding warning
thresholds are reached.

You could also use personal internals in combination with cabin sealing
for long space travels, so Air Tank is completely optional now and
mostly needed when you need RCS thruster.

### RCS thrusters

They are now available earlier in tech tree and consume reasonable
amount of air (5 times more than human jetpacks), and they don't work
without Mounted Air Tank, unless it's an Ion thruster variant.

### Mounted Air Tank

Available from the basic mech research node and can be printed in fab.
Built model comes empty, and syndicate mechs come with one full of
oxygen.

<img alt="GrFDrH5Hwe"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/b677b705-bda0-4c8c-96c7-d32bf7bf9f28">

Can be switched to pressurize or not pressurize the cabin. Releases gas
only when the cabin is sealed shut. Starts releasing automatically, but
can be toggled to not release if you want to use it just as a portable
canister.

Cabin pressure can now be configured in the module UI instead of
Maintenance UI.

Can be attached to a pipe network when the mech is parked above a
connection port.

Comes with a pump that works similarly to the portable pump. It lets you
vent the air tank contents outside, or suck air from the room to fill
the air tank. Intended to provide an ability to fill the air tank
without the need to bother with pipes.

Also has gas sensors that display gas mix data of the tank and the cabin
(when sealed).

### Stock part changes

All mechs now require a servo motor and they reduce mech movement power
consumption instead of scanning module.

Scanning modules are optional for mech operation (still required to
build) and the lack of one disables the following UI elements:

- Display of mech integrity (you can still see the alerts or examine the
mech to get rough idea)
- Display of mech status on internal damage (and you can't repair what
you can't diagnose)

The rating of scanning module doesn't have any effect as of now.

Cargo mech comes without it roundstart.

<img alt="2vDtt99oqb"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/147144ca-824e-4501-acf5-6ee104f309e7">

Capacitors now also reduce light power usage and raise the overclocking
temperature thresholds (see below).

### Maintenance

Maintenance UI removed, and its logic migrated to other places.

Access modification now managed inside the mech, and anyone who can
control the mech, can adjust the access in the same way as they can set
DNA key.

To open the maintenance panel you just need a screwdriver. It is instant
when the mech is empty and it has a 5 second delay when there is an
occupant to avoid in-combat hacking and part removal. It will alert the
occupant that someone is trying to tinker with their mech.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/1abfca3c-8ba9-44b0-913c-c209564b91fd)

Once the panel is open, you can see the part ratings:


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/404f95bb-9f74-4e5b-a975-5ab6f74bdfa9)

With open panel you can hack the mech wires (roboticists can now see
them):

<img alt="mj205G2qDa"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/44cea0d1-44b4-4b50-b1d3-a97c0056bab3">

There are wires for:
- Enabling/Disabling ID and DNA locks
- Toggling mech lights
- Toggling mech circuits malfunction (battery drain, sparks) 
- Toggling mech equipment malfunction (to repair after EMP or cause
EMP-like effect, disarming mech)
- 3 dud wires that do nothing

The hacker may be shocked if the mech power cell allows.

When the panel is open and the user has access to the mech, they can
remove parts with a crowbar:

<img alt="jR40gyTWtJ"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/b573f5b9-b8ea-412e-b3e0-c872e01e0c23">

Hitting the mech with an ID from outside now toggles the ID Lock on/off
if the ID has sufficient access.

### Power consumption and overclocking

Rebalanced mech power consumption. T4 parts were not working in
Syndicate Mechs, as their effect was not calculated until you manipulate
parts manually. Constructed mechs with t1 parts even had their energy
drain reduced with upgrade to t1.

Now all mechs apply their base step power usage correctly don't ignore
the stock parts.

Servo tier now reduces base power consumption by 0% at t1, 50% at t2,
33% at t3 and 25% at t4
Capacitor tier now reduces base power consumption of mele attacks,
phasing and light by the same amounts.

Gygax leg actuators overload replaced with mech overclocking. Any mech
can be overclocked by hacking wires, but only Gygax has a button for
toggling it from the Cabin.

Now there is an overclock coefficient. 1.5 for Gygax and other mechs, 2
for Dark Gygax.

When overclocked, mechs moves N times faster, but consumes N times more
power.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/01e285fd-6fd6-4558-8277-2ed3abf474d8)

While overclocked, mech heats up every second, regardless of movement,
and starts receiving internal and integrity damage after a certain
temperature threshold. The chance is 0% at the threshold, and 100% at
thresholds * 2. The roll happens every tick. Capacitor upgrades this
threshold, letting you overclock safely for longer periods.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/80d90cea-0d20-4054-9369-a47deb6f52f2)

When you stop overclock, the temperature goes back down.

### Other changes and fixes

Concealed weapon bay now doesn't show up when you examine the mech, so
it's actually concealed now.

New radio module can properly change its frequency, as it didn't work
for previous radio.

Launcher type weapons were ignoring cooldowns and power usage, so you
could spam explosive banana peals, while they should have a 2 second
cooldown:
<img alt="q5GjUsHwGr"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/d102725d-e9e1-4588-9d6c-b9e38b7a6535">

Now this is fixed and all launcher type weapons properly use power and
have their cooldowns working.
And now they have the kickback effect working (when it pushes you in the
opposite direction in zero gravity on throw).

Thermoregulator now heats/cools considering heat capacity instead of
adding/reducing flat 10 degrees. So you can heat up cabin air quicker if
the pressure is low.

There were some other sloppy mistakes in mech code, like some functions
returning too early, blocking other functionality unintentionally. Fixed
these and made some other minor changes and improvements.

Adds Summon Simians & Buffs/QoLs Mutate (#77196)

## About The Pull Request

Adds Summon Simians, a spell that summons four monkeys or lesser
gorillas, with the amount increasing per upgrade. The monkeys have
various fun gear depending on how lucky you get and how leveled the
spell is. If the spell is maximum level, it only summons normal
gorillas.

Added further support for nonhuman robed casting: Monkeys, cyborgs, and
drones can all now cast robed spells as long as they're wearing a
wizardly hat as well.

Made monkeys able to wield things again.

Wizard Mutate spell works on non-human races. It also gives you
Gigantism now (funny). If the Race can't support tinted bodyparts, your
whole sprite is temporarily turned green.

Made Laser eyes projectiles a subtype of actual lasers, which has
various properties such as on-hit effects and upping the damage to 30.

Improved some monkey AI code.

It's criminal we don't have a monky spell, and this is a really fun spin
on it. Total chaos, but total monky chaos. It's surprisingly strong,
but! it can very well backfire if you stay near the angry monkeys too
long and your protection fades away. Unless you become a monkey
yourself!!

> Wizard Mutate spell works on non-human races. 

This spell is great but it's hampered by the mutation's human
requirement, which is reasonable in normal gameplay. Wizards don't need
to care about that, and the human restriction hinders a lot of possible
gimmicks, so off it goes. Also, wizard hulk does't cause chunky fingers
for similar reasons

> Made Laser eyes projectiles a subtype of actual lasers, which has
various properties such as on-hit effects and upping the damage to 30.

Don't really caer about the damage so much, this is more so that it has
effects such as on-hit visuals. Can lower the damage if required, but
honestly anything that competes against troll mjolnir is good.

> Added further support for nonhuman robed casting: Monkeys, cyborgs,
and drones can all now cast robed spells as long as they're wearing a
wizardly hat as well.

SS13 is known for 'The Dev Team Thinks of Everything' and I believe this
is a sorely lacking part of this or something. It's funny.
I want to see a monkey wizard.

> Made monkeys able to wield things again.

I really don't know why this was a thing and it was breaking my axe and
spear wielding primal monkeys. Like, why?

Adds the Storage Implanter to the spy kit. (#77452)

## About The Pull Request

Adds the storage implanter to the spy kit to make it decent.

## Why It's Good For The Game
This PR hopes to bring Spy at least a little more in-line with the rest
of the syndie-kit specials, so it doesn‚Äôt feel like a complete dud to
get.

Spy absolutely sucks as a syndie-kit and getting it is basically
throwing away 20 TC. Not all of them should be equally powerful but all
of them should be at least more satisfying to get. Spy is so bad that
it‚Äôs listed in the official wiki as ‚Äòhonestly not that good‚Äô. It‚Äôs also
_barely_ even above 25 telecrystals as the switchblade is a black market
uplink item, not a syndicate uplink item, and not even that good of an
item at that! And the chameleon kit inside isn‚Äôt even a full chameleon
kit! Pitiful. Compare it to stealth right below it which totals to _36_
telecrystals.

Adding a storage implant adds a relatively useful item to the kit that
still fits with the entire theme of ‚Äòstealth and deception‚Äô, as you can
be searched without having anything on you. To be stealthy, and deceive
people. Like you should. Given the fact that searches are quite common.
It doesn‚Äôt make it TOO overpowered as the rest of the gear is still ‚Äònot
that great‚Äô.

kit to make it decent.

Adds navigation panel to docs site.

Refs #16.

This was an interesting test case. The panel itself is relatively straightforward, with a hierarchy and expand/collapse behavior. I spent more time than I'd like to admit on the CSS animations trying to get an arrow to rotate, though I did eventually figure it out. The arrow does get noticeably blurry when animated, which is very strange. This behavior applies for Chrome and Firefox. Searching the internet, I found countless hacks which claim to fix this, but none of them worked for me. For the time being, I'm calling this a browser bug.

I also tried to animate the reveal of a route's children, however I decided this is not possible as animating to `height: auto;` is generally not feasible today without compromises I wasn't comfotable making. https://css-tricks.com/using-css-transitions-auto-dimensions/

Beyond the CSS, I think `@rules_prerender` did a good job allowing me to shape the structure of how I solved this particular solution. I was able to decouple routes from the `NavPane` component which made for easier testing. HydroActive was also pretty smooth, though it only binds an event listener and not much more. On its own, that was mostly fine. However testing got complicated _fast_. How and what to assert in a `node-html-parser` test is complicated, verbose, and tedious. I can definitely understand the appeal of snapshot testing, even if I don't think that's a good general solution to this problem. Testing the client code is even more complicated due to a separate `test_cases.tsx` file, multiple build targets, and then the WebDriver tests themselves. User code would need to go out of their way to set up WebDriverIO and Jasmine in addition to all this complexity. This could definitely use some streamlining.

Also I wonder if there might be a better testing approach with in-browser testing vs WebDriver testing. Could we render `test_cases.tsx` at build time, then instrument a test runner which serves them with Jasmine loaded in. If it auto-deferred the root component and ran test code inside the browse, we could take advantage of HydroActive test APIs. Need to think more about how viable this is and where tests would be most useful.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

Refactor test suite to make real requests to a real server (#131)

In the course of validating #125, we discovered that using the stdlib's
[`httptest.ResponseRecorder`][0] mechanism to drive the vast majority of
our unit tests led to some slight brokenness due to subtle differences
in the way those "simulated" requests are handled vs "real" requests to
a live HTTP server, as [explained in this comment][1].

That prompted me to do a big ass refactor of the entire test suite,
swapping httptest.ResponseRecorder for interacting with a live server
instance via [`httptest.Server`][2].

This should make the test suite more accurate and reliable in the long
run by ensuring that the vast majority of tests are making actual HTTP
requests and reading responses from the wire.

Note that updating these tests also uncovered a few minor bugs in
existing handler code, fixed in a separate commit for visibility.

P.S. I'm awfully sorry to anyone who tries to merge or rebase local test
changes after this refactor lands, that is goign to be a nightmare. If
you run into issues resolving conflicts, feel free to ping me and I can
try to help!

Buffs Heretic ash ascension (#77618)

## About The Pull Request

Post-Ascension the Nightwatchers Rebirth (Or Fiery Rebirth) has its
cooldown lowered from 60 seconds to 10
Additionally adds bomb immunity to the list of resistances that
ascension provides

## Why It's Good For The Game

Ash ascension kind of sucks when compared to its big brothers flesh,
rust and blade. You do get a couple of cool spells but their impact is
negated by how shitty fire damage is and while you get a ton of
resistances, you don't get stun immunity and have absolutely zero
sustainability in long-term engagements.

Blade has its lifesteal, rust has its leeching walk and flesh has a big
worm that eats arms. And while the laziest solution would be to give ash
stun immunity like those three I think it'd be more fitting if it could
capitalize on one of its more powerful spells. Keeping in the fight by
siphoning health from all those people you lit on fire with your cascade
instead of watching in pain as they completely negate any threat you
have with a fire extinguisher and temp adapt.

Fixes Ticked File Enforcement and Missing Unit Test (and makes said Unit Test Compile) (and genericizes the C&D list to the base unit test datum) (#77632)

Closes #77631

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

Ticked File Enforcement simply wasn't catching files that were missed.
That's a bit stupid, so I decided to look into what the issue might be,
and whoopsie daisies I did double periods back in #76592
(020ac2405308eab83f314282499dfe777aba5874).

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/6023afe8-313d-4550-9a60-58a8bc211b4f)

I also added some debug info and some more checks to prevent such a
break from happening again on runtime of this script. I thought it was a
weird string concatenation issue (and not the simple break I thought it
was), so I rewrote how it adds `glob`s. I think it's cleaner so I'll
keep it anyhow

This PR also corrects the oversight of the missing unit test (introduced
in #77218 (69827604c46952dd4393db8617cd494ade17bea2)) by reticking it in
the `_unit_tests.dm` file, and also makes it compile because it didn't
do that.

I also then had to do some more work to get the unit test to work.
* Genericizes the Create-and-Destroy "ignore" list to be a static list
on `/datum/unit_test` to allow it to be shared between these types of
tests that we need to test.
* Adds that list to C&D and the broken unit test regarding fantasy
bonuses
* Fixes some actually broken that the unit test was made to catch (beam
rifles, butterdogs and other slippery items, random ingredient boxes).
* Adds cases for things that the unit test and overall framework really
shouldn't be altering anyways (mythril), and was likely causing
inappropriate stack traces on master

## Why It's Good For The Game

Unit Tests WORK. Tools WORK.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/9a59c0db-7a33-4546-918b-c73372a5b867)


## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Beam rifles will no longer inappropriately retain any bonuses they
may gain from wizardry.
fix: Inappropriate stack traces over bonuses being applied to components
that gain bonuses innately (like Mythril stacks) should cease.

Version 20.3.7 - Gossip Stones Clock (#75)

* somewhat debugged text editor

fixes - multiple control bytes have now been fixed to be successfully read by the program

bugged - as it turns out if you try to edit ID 20D2 in the dialogue, things just break! it doesn't register properly at all

* Gossip Stone Clock feature implemented

....mostly. can't fully test until the SetMessage function has been debugged.

* update v20.3.7

planned to have my extra feature of having the Gossip Stones also have a regular day clock in addition to the time to moonfall clock

delayed until SetMessage function is debugged; current state prevents editing of the necessary dialogue ID for my feature

* fixed a couple female pronoun errors

There may be more, but i'm not doing that shit rn

* Finally. It's working.

Version 20.3.7 is ready to roll

The database optimisation work is done. I am pretty confident this is going to make a significant different to at least the general responsiveness of the UI. I am going to decribe the jounrney I went on to get here, in case I've broken anything, and to record a technique I used to discover where the problems were.

We started off needing the reduce these repeated and uncached queries, many of which run many hundreds of times as you navigate around the UI. The log fragment below shows the ones that seem to accumulate very quickly up into the thousands after less than a  minute of moving around the UI.

```

```

These logs were obtained using the p6spy JDBC intercepting driver, which is better than the mariadb general query log, as we can easily apply filters locally and so narrow down the queries logged.

p6spy also allowed another very useful technique to actually track down where these queries coming from (our code, somewhere in spring / hibernate etc). It allows you to define a custom logger. I simply did so, and added conditions such as ..

```java
if(logText.startsWith("select session")) {
   System.out.println("Break!"); // <-- set breakpoint here
}
```

By setting a breakpoint here, I can see the full stack when that SQL query is about to be sent to the server. This ability has been absolutely essential.

As for the actual changes that result from this knowledge, there was no magic-bullet to fix it, there was no single cause for these. Each had to be analysed and dealt with appropriately.

One of these issues is the (over)use of `FetchType.EAGER`. It is now know that eager fetching defeats hibernate caching. In general, this is considered a code smell and indicates a design problems. Given enough time, all of these could probably be designed out, but that is not practical for this work. So instead I dealt with a couple of these in key places that were causing performance degradation.

The first of these was `AuthenticationScheme.allowedRoles` and `AuthenticationScheme.deniedRoles`. These are now using `FetchType.LAZY`. For this to work, a number of places that accessed these collections had to be changed to ensure that they were accessed in the context of a transaction. Fortunately there weren't too many of these.

Another use of eagar featch was in `Principal.suspensions`. This field was not used at all, so doesn't need eagar fetching anyway. It's possible that earlier versions did use this field, but I didn't persue it to find out what.

The remainder of the changes all either added or adjusted caching behaviour.

The first of these was `RealmService.getDefaultRealm()`. For some reason this wasn't being cached by hibernate, and it was difficult to see why. But this method was getting hit a lot, so I could add caching there. The cached default realm is cleared if the realm is changed or deleted. Caching this affects most page loads.

Another is `FileUploadService.getFileUpload`. The resulting `FileUpload` objects are now cached by UUID which is how they are nearly always accessed. Caching this particularly helps the user list page (with all its icons).

`PermissionService.getPersonalRole` is called a lot, and personal role objects were not being cached. They now are, with the cache being invalidated when the user or realm is deleted. Personal roles appear to be mostly immutable. Caching this affects most page loads.

`ConfigurationServiceImpl` now has a cache region for storing configuration. This one is not going to make a big as a difference as the others. I did see a number of occasions where hibernate cache was not working, but many cases where it was. It's still worth doing I think, as retrieving from our own cache will be a little faster than the more complex algorithm hibernate caching uses. Caches are invalidated when configuration changes or realm deletion.

If I now repeat that same log analysis from earlier in this post, we end up with this ..

```
979 select session0_.id as id1_93_0_, session0_.created as created2_93_0_, session0_.deleted as deleted3_93_0_, session0_.legacy_id
1046 select session0_.id as id1_93_0_, session0_.created as created2_93_0_, session0_.deleted as deleted3_93_0_, session0_.legac
1115 select session0_.id as id1_93_0_, session0_.created as created2_93_0_, session0_.deleted as deleted3_93_0_, session0_.legac
2623 select session0_.id as id1_93_0_, session0_.created as created2_93_0_, session0_.deleted as deleted3_93_0_, session0_.legac
```

A big improvement! But ... as you can see there is still one more table to go. This is to do with `Session` and `SessionServiceImpl.isLoggedOn()`. The problem here is that `SessionRepository.refresh()` is being called, which explicitly will always retrieve from the database. `isLoggedOn()` will get called at least once per request, so a single page load (with all of its resources) can potentially happen 100s of times.

This cannot be fixed by adding our own cache, and its not related to eager fetching. As far as I can make out, the refreshing is necessary because we store `Session` objects in the `HttpSession` (making them long lived), but potentially other places might alter the `Session`, e.g. logging it off, so we MUST ensure we have an up to date object for such important state. I believe this can be fixed by not storing the actual `Session` object in such cases, but instead storing it's ID. The session can then be looked up when it's needed, and hibernate caching will deal with ensuring it is fresh. I haven't done anything with this yet, as I could do with a 2nd opinion.

As I mentioned elsewhere, I have added a cache statistics pages. This will help us determine if caching is efficient. It would be interesting to see the hit/miss %ages on a busy system. A single user just navigating around the UI should show cache efficiency close to 100%, but I would expect the more users there are this will start to go down as the cache fills up to it's maximum size (100000 items) and things have to start being evicted. We do not currently have a way to tune the cache sizes, which would be useful for big systems, and would mean "throw more memory at it" starts to become a valid fix.

And let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

So aye (aye), we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks
If you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are
Oh, my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh, my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

Polymorphic Inverter tweaks (#77675)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #77649

You can no longer use the belt to turn into any kind of carbon mob,
sorry gamers it was a cool dream but it leads to too many problems.
Also I made space dragon "there's an alive guy in my stomach" code now
work on signals instead of on Life tick which is slightly more efficient
and also resolves an issue with the funny belt.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Too much room for weird edge cases as a result of doing this (messing
with monkey DNA, producing infinite xeno organs, blocking legit xeno
queens from being created) which had no graceful solution.
Moving stuff off Life if it can be event based is nice.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Turning into a space dragon with the polymorphic inverter will no
longer leave you existing in two places
balance: You can no longer use the belt to transform into monkeys or
xenomorphs, for technical reasons.

Settler Quirk: Tame the Outdoors! Have trouble with tall shelves... (#77654)

## About The Pull Request

Adds the Settler quirk. This gives you bonuses to taming animals and
fishing, as well as making you gain hunger slower than others.

However, you are quite a bit slower than most people, and have trouble
with vaulting objects. You do, however, suffer significantly less from
equipment slowdown. (to the point that it is almost zero)

Settler riders are faster on their mounts than others if they're at
least sane. They start to slow down if they're less sane.

You are also shorter than most people.

</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game

I wanted to add a lightweight quirk that was kind of the 'opposite' of
Spacer, but a little more focused on interacting with elements of the
game world that would enjoy some attention. So, I thought 'what about an
outdoorsman quirk?'

So, I based it around being from people who lived out on the rim, under
unideal circumstances (and probably heavier gravity than Earth), and
taming the land. The slower movespeed encourages finding an animal to
tame that you can ride, and the bonuses to taming should help make that
a bit easier. The other additions just made sense for someone living it
a bit rough in the wilderness.

Having a bunch of settlers taming cows and riding around on them all
shift just kind of sounds hilarious to me.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Settler quirk! Conqueror the great outdoors....in space. Just make
sure nobody asks you to get anything from the top shelf.

Refactors Regal Rats into Basic Mobs (more titles edition) (#77681)

## About The Pull Request

I literally can't focus on anything nowadays, so I just did this to
break a never-ending chain of distress. Anyways, regal rats! These
fellas are mostly player controlled, but did have _some_ AI capabilities
(mainly tied to their actions), so that was incorporated too. Everything
should work as-expected (as well as look a shitload cleaner).

Instead of doing weird and awful conditional signals being sent out, I
made the `COMSIG_REGAL_RAT_INTERACT` (not the actual name) have a return
value so we can always rely on that working whenever we have that signal
registered on something we attack. I also cleaned up pretty much every
proc related to regal rats, gave them AIs to reflect their kingly nature
(and action capabilities (as well as move the action to
`mob_cooldown`)).

Since I thought they needed it, Regal Rats now get a special moniker!
This is stuff like "the Big Cheese" and what-not, like actual regents in
history. That's nice.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Two more off the list. Much better code to read. Way smarter rats with
spawning their army as part of a retaliatory assault (war). More sovl
with better regal rat names. The list goes on.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Regal Rats have been refactored into basic mobs. They should
be a bit smarter and retain their docility (until attacked, in which
case you should prepare to get rekt by summoned rats), and properly flee
when they can instead of just sit there as you beat them to death. The
framework for them interacting with stuff (i.e. opening doors while
slobbering on food) is a bit more unified too, now. They also have
cooler names too!
/:cl:

FYI: Beyond a few code touchups, I haven't touched the actions at all. I
do not believe myself to be enthusiastic about fixing anything involving
the actions code as of this moment so that this PR is more overbloated
unless it's unbelievably stupid or easy to fix.

Feat: hot pursuit (elliptic)

Not to be confused with the similar-sounding apparel beloved of
certain players, 'hot pursuit' is a new mechanic to encourage fun
lines of play.

A Brief History
---------------

When in a very nasty spot (low on HP and next to a tough foe), players
have historically been able to 'pillar-dance', wasting time (both the
game's and theirs) to get time to heal. This is both unfun to do and
narratively unsatisfying. When in a tight spot, players should pull out a
cool trick (a spell, god ability or consumable), fight, and/or die!

We first tried to fix this by adding 'random energy', which unfortunately
fixed nothing. Then we tried 'attacks of opportunity', letting monsters
attack when the player moved away. These worked somewhat, but had several
disadvantages, including:

- They were very complex. The list of special cases for which monsters
  could attack the player and when was very long, and it was hard for
  players to track.
- They were very binary. If a monster was next to the player, danger was
  vastly higher than if they were 2 tiles away. If a monster was as fast
  as the player, danger was vastly higher than if they were just a bit
  slower.
- They had odd and unintuitive interactions with polearms (which didn't
  launch reaching attacks of opportunity).
- They were frustrating. Players felt profoundly unhappy when they were
  killed by attacks of opportunity - it felt like the game becoming more
  hostile.

So, let's try something a bit gentler

Hot Pursuit
-----------

When the player moves away from a monster, if that monster then moves
toward the player, they have a one in ten chance of putting on a 'burst
of speed', moving ~25% faster (move delay 0.8) for the next ~20ish turns.
This speed bonus affects the move that triggered it, so players walking
away from an adjacent yak have a 2% chance of getting a surprise bap
from them.

The intent is to again discourage 'pillar-dancing' and other fiddly
stalling tactics (e.g. running across the entire level to get to stairs)
in a 'softer', fuzzier way, without the hard binaries of attacks of
opportunity.

Wu Jian martial manuevers and Serpent's Lash again give immunity to
this effect.

Let's try it out!

working on ampir but almost nothing else.
Still cleaning up the parsing since the example was easy and being lazy...
uses shlex to tokenise that shit.
What I have seen so far seems not impossible to parse.
Just not easy.
Parsing multiple tests but will do one
Dealing with stupid tests that want inputs from other module runs is just
too annoying at present. Fug that. I always thought modules were supposed
to be modular but what would I know compared to these real bioinformaticians.

Zombie Rework (#4060)

# About the pull request

The goal for this PR is to rework zombies into being a fast and
numerous, but weaker, entity. As it stands a zombie has too many
advantages where a hold against them is essentially a fool's errand.

CURRENT PLAN (Will adjust as needed)
Zombies will be FASTER but much weaker than current iteration, with
weaker attacks. They will be designed around being a foe that can be
taken down quicker but if they close the distance, the threat of
infection spells a death sentence.

# Explain why it's good for the game

This will be hard to balance, and as such will be taking feedback before
I submit this for review. This is current position of Zombies:

- Tough: Extreme (25% ?!) brute modifier, with fire modifier on top,
making them very tanky and requiring clips to take down one
- self-revive: They WILL come back up, coupled with toughness, they are
a feared opponent.
- Strength: Claws inflict superslow at 40 brute damage, one of the
highest damage levels.
- Numerous: They have the numbers to put lesser drones and even entire
hives to shame

Overall, they are very overtuned and makes playing against them not that
fun. My plan is to have it so they are much weaker, with their threat
being from infections.

# Testing Photographs and Procedure
<details>
<summary>Screenshots & Videos</summary>

Put screenshots and videos here with an empty line between the
screenshots and the `<details>` tags.

</details>


# Changelog
:cl:
balance: Zombie attacks deal less damage and only slow down targets (not
superslow as they currently do)
balance: Zombie resistances have been reduced heavily, making them far
more susceptible to brute damage. Their speed has been doubled to
compensate
balance: Black goo on tiles now requires you to not wear shoes to have
chance for infection
fix: Zombie attacks now only apply effects such as slow and infection if
the attack is valid (if the zombie is able to attack)

North Star Science Rework And More (#77439)

## About The Pull Request
I fixed a few miscellaneous issues and also redid science (mainly
genetics, cytology, and xenobiology)
This is genetics, it's basically the same but moneky have bananas and I
rotated it so they'll be visible from the front desk.

![geneticsnew](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/73589390/7c10d75b-2a7a-47b2-a6ca-a30354d713c3)

Holy fuck it's Cytology as a proper area. It now has main hall access
and a public access petting zoo. Now you can show off all your new
creatures (it also has some items cytologists generally want)

![cytonew](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/73589390/7d9256c9-b39a-4502-b599-9226a2ca5cd8)

Upstairs is Xenobio, which is now much larger and soulless. Instead of a
normal holding cell there's a prefilled room of oxygen and BZ (the
holding room, why is BZ invisible?)

![xenonew](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/73589390/5dc28dba-a051-4858-a9fc-16d51e987c33)

I also gave Ordnance 5 TTVs, same as other maps.
Also the coroner no longer has an unreachable box of bodybags
Also sec now has 2 secways + 2 keys for their usage
## Why It's Good For The Game
I'm forcing xenobiologists to be closer to a hall so they might actually
interact with people, and giving cytologists a reason to do anything
ever because they have a petting zoo to show their creatures off in. Oh
yeah also cytology gets equipment they should just have (a botany tray,
tools to butcher with, a shitty old laser gun to kill experiments gone
wrong)
Genetics is just better because people from the hall can see the
Geneticists working so they can bug them for stuff.

A few of the fixes are very tiny, like moving a few areas by the service
hall and adding a single pipe to the AI SAT
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: North Star's Cytology and Xenobiology are now significantly more
usable.
add: North Star's Genetics has been tweaked.
fix: The North Star's AI SAT has a working vent and it's service hall
has a working lightswitch

bevy_audio: ECS-based API redesign (#8424)

# Objective

Improve the `bevy_audio` API to make it more user-friendly and
ECS-idiomatic. This PR is a first-pass at addressing some of the most
obvious (to me) problems. In the interest of keeping the scope small,
further improvements can be done in future PRs.

The current `bevy_audio` API is very clunky to work with, due to how it
(ab)uses bevy assets to represent audio sinks.

The user needs to write a lot of boilerplate (accessing
`Res<Assets<AudioSink>>`) and deal with a lot of cognitive overhead
(worry about strong vs. weak handles, etc.) in order to control audio
playback.

Audio playback is initiated via a centralized `Audio` resource, which
makes it difficult to keep track of many different sounds playing in a
typical game.

Further, everything carries a generic type parameter for the sound
source type, making it difficult to mix custom sound sources (such as
procedurally generated audio or unofficial formats) with regular audio
assets.

Let's fix these issues.

## Solution

Refactor `bevy_audio` to a more idiomatic ECS API. Remove the `Audio`
resource. Do everything via entities and components instead.

Audio playback data is now stored in components:
- `PlaybackSettings`, `SpatialSettings`, `Handle<AudioSource>` are now
components. The user inserts them to tell Bevy to play a sound and
configure the initial playback parameters.
- `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of special
magical "asset" types. They are inserted by Bevy when it actually begins
playing the sound, and can be queried for by the user in order to
control the sound during playback.

Bundles: `AudioBundle` and `SpatialAudioBundle` are available to make it
easy for users to play sounds. Spawn an entity with one of these bundles
(or insert them to a complex entity alongside other stuff) to play a
sound.

Each entity represents a sound to be played.

There is also a new "auto-despawn" feature (activated using
`PlaybackSettings`), which, if enabled, tells Bevy to despawn entities
when the sink playback finishes. This allows for "fire-and-forget" sound
playback. Users can simply
spawn entities whenever they want to play sounds and not have to worry
about leaking memory.

## Unsolved Questions

I think the current design is *fine*. I'd be happy for it to be merged.
It has some possibly-surprising usability pitfalls, but I think it is
still much better than the old `bevy_audio`. Here are some discussion
questions for things that we could further improve. I'm undecided on
these questions, which is why I didn't implement them. We should decide
which of these should be addressed in this PR, and what should be left
for future PRs. Or if they should be addressed at all.

### What happens when sounds start playing?

Currently, the audio sink components are inserted and the bundle
components are kept. Should Bevy remove the bundle components? Something
else?

The current design allows an entity to be reused for playing the same
sound with the same parameters repeatedly. This is a niche use case I'd
like to be supported, but if we have to give it up for a simpler design,
I'd be fine with that.

### What happens if users remove any of the components themselves?

As described above, currently, entities can be reused. Removing the
audio sink causes it to be "detached" (I kept the old `Drop` impl), so
the sound keeps playing. However, if the audio bundle components are not
removed, Bevy will detect this entity as a "queued" sound entity again
(has the bundle compoenents, without a sink component), just like before
playing the sound the first time, and start playing the sound again.

This behavior might be surprising? Should we do something different?

### Should mutations to `PlaybackSettings` be applied to the audio sink?

We currently do not do that. `PlaybackSettings` is just for the initial
settings when the sound starts playing. This is clearly documented.

Do we want to keep this behavior, or do we want to allow users to use
`PlaybackSettings` instead of `AudioSink`/`SpatialAudioSink` to control
sounds during playback too?

I think I prefer for them to be kept separate. It is not a bad mental
model once you understand it, and it is documented.

### Should `AudioSink` and `SpatialAudioSink` be unified into a single
component type?

They provide a similar API (via the `AudioSinkPlayback` trait) and it
might be annoying for users to have to deal with both of them. The
unification could be done using an enum that is matched on internally by
the methods. Spatial audio has extra features, so this might make it
harder to access. I think we shouldn't.

### Automatic synchronization of spatial sound properties from
Transforms?

Should Bevy automatically apply changes to Transforms to spatial audio
entities? How do we distinguish between listener and emitter? Which one
does the transform represent? Where should the other one come from?

Alternatively, leave this problem for now, and address it in a future
PR. Or do nothing, and let users deal with it, as shown in the
`spatial_audio_2d` and `spatial_audio_3d` examples.

---

## Changelog

Added:
- `AudioBundle`/`SpatialAudioBundle`, add them to entities to play
sounds.

Removed:
 - The `Audio` resource.
 - `AudioOutput` is no longer `pub`.

Changed:
 - `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of assets.

## Migration Guide

// TODO: write a more detailed migration guide, after the "unsolved
questions" are answered and this PR is finalized.

Before:

```rust

/// Need to store handles somewhere
#[derive(Resource)]
struct MyMusic {
    sink: Handle<AudioSink>,
}

fn play_music(
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    audio: Res<Audio>,
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mut commands: Commands,
) {
    let weak_handle = audio.play_with_settings(
        asset_server.load("music.ogg"),
        PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5),
    );
    // upgrade to strong handle and store it
    commands.insert_resource(MyMusic {
        sink: audio_sinks.get_handle(weak_handle),
    });
}

fn toggle_pause_music(
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mymusic: Option<Res<MyMusic>>,
) {
    if let Some(mymusic) = &mymusic {
        if let Some(sink) = audio_sinks.get(&mymusic.sink) {
            sink.toggle();
        }
    }
}
```

Now:

```rust
/// Marker component for our music entity
#[derive(Component)]
struct MyMusic;

fn play_music(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
) {
    commands.spawn((
        AudioBundle::from_audio_source(asset_server.load("music.ogg"))
            .with_settings(PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5)),
        MyMusic,
    ));
}

# Description

I've been investigating the [issue
mentioned](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9976#issuecomment-1673290467)
in my prev pr and I've found that plugin.nu file that is used to cache
plugins signatures gets overwritten on every nushell startup and that
may actually mess up with the file content if 2 or more instances of
nushell will run simultaneously.

To reproduce:
1. register at least 2 plugins in your local nushell
2. remember how many entries you have in plugin.nu with `open
$nu.plugin-path | find nu_plugin`
3. run 
    - either `cargo test` inside nushell repo
- or run smth like this `1..100 | par-each {|it| $"(random integer
1..100)ms" | into duration | sleep $in; nu -c "$nu.plugin-path"}` to
simulate parallel access. This approach is not so reliable to reproduce
as running test but still a good point that it may effect users actually
4. validate that your `plugin.nu` file was stripped

# Solution

In this pr I've refactored the code of handling the `register` command
to minimize code duplications and make sure that overwrite of
`plugin.nu` file is happen only when user calls the command and not on
nu startup

Another option would be to use temp `plugin.nu` when running tests, but
as the issue actually can affect users I've decided to prevent
unnecessary writing at all. Although having isolated `plugin.nu` still
worth of doing

# User-Facing Changes
<!-- List of all changes that impact the user experience here. This
helps us keep track of breaking changes. -->
It changes the behaviour actually as the call `register <plugin>
<signature>` now doesn't updates `plugin.nu` and just reads signatures
to the memory. But as I understand that kind of call with explicit
signature is meant to use only by nushell itself in the `plugin.nu` file
only. I've asked about it in
[discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/601130461678272522/615962413203718156/1140013448915325018)

Actually, I think the way plugins are stored might be reworked to
prevent or mitigate possible issues further:
- problem with writing to file may still arise if we try to register in
parallel as several instances will write to the same file so the lock
for the file might be required
- using additional parameters to command like `register` to implement
some internal logic could be misleading to the users
- `register` call actually affects global state of nushell that sounds a
little bit inconsistent with immutability and isolation of other parts
of the nu. See issues

convert the eyeball a basic monster (#77411)

## About The Pull Request
I have created a basic eyeball monster with new abilities and behaviors.
The eyeball has a unique power that allows it to glare at humans and
make them slow for a short period. However, this ability only works if
the human can see the eyeball monster. If a person is blind or unable to
see the eyeball, the ability won't affect them. Also, if someone turns
their back to the eyeball, it cannot use the ability on them. But be
cautious because the eyeball will try to position itself in front of the
person's face to use its power.

The eyeball is hostile towards all humans except for the blind ones and
those with significant eye damage. It has a compassionate side too, as
it loves to help people with eye damage by providing small healing to
their eyes.

Furthermore, the eyeball has a fondness for eating carrots, which not
only satisfies its appetite but also grants it a small health boost. To
add to its appearance, I've given it a new, larger, and scarier sprite.
However, I am open to changing it back to the old sprite if the player
prefers it that way.

Additionally, the eyeball displays emotions, and if you hit it, it will
cry tears as a sign of pain or sadness.

## Why It's Good For The Game
the eyeball now have more depth and character to his behavier.

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: the eyeball is a basic monster, please report any bugs
sprites: the eyeball now is bigger and scarier and now he will cry when

Laser pointer update: Shining Through Walls Edition (feat. fixes!) (#77007)

# _PR PSA_


![augh](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/75863639/6dc87fc7-65a3-4b7c-9b8d-a1432cacbe93)


## About The Pull Request
Cleans up code for laser pointers, fixing some bugs like the
forever-charging state or affecting dead cats along the way.
Remaining charge is now available upon examine.
Canonizes #45834 by implementing an upgrade to the laser pointers:
installing a bluespace crystal into a laser with tier 3 or higher laser
diode lets it shine through walls. Using an upgraded laser uses twice
the charge of a normal one. Of course, you can only shine it on
something if you can see the target behind the wall, like via x-ray or
thermals. Mesons don't count, however.
If one tries to jam a crystal into a pointer with a tier 1/2 laser (or a
tier 1/2 laser in a pointer with an installed crystal), _something_ will
get teleported, crushing the crystal.
You can uninstall the crystal with wirecutters or a hemostat. The
pointer will _hint_ on closer examination (`examine_more`) at a
possibility of a crystal being installed if you upgrade the laser
(different messages for tier 1/2/3,4).
Removes one stupid 1% increase for a recharge chance per process tick if
your laser was in a full recharge state because it was insignificant and
irrelevant.

i've had a branch for this for almost 9 months and i was always laying
it off for some day later. today i just completely fucked the branch.
whoops. i'm not even sure at this point what else did i fix while here,
double whoops

## Why It's Good For The Game
Closes #45834 - Canonizes a bug into a feature.
Fixes #77003 - lol
Cleaner code, possibly more robust even.
Seeing the remaining charge was not available at all and the only hint
was when you tried shining the pointer on something. That sucks.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: you can upgrade laser pointers with a bluespace crystal to let them
shine through walls at double the power cost, if the laser in the
pointer is of tier 3 or higher.
qol: laser pointer charge can be seen by examining it
fix: fixed laser pointers luring dead cats when shone upon
code: laser pointer code cleaned up a tad

[MIRROR] Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into gibtonite [MDB IGNORE] (#22990)

* Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into gibtonite (#77385)

## About The Pull Request

Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into

There's not enough time to react, the mining scanner is surprisingly
slow sometimes and it means you drill straight into gibtonite, which
primes it the first drill and blows it up the second, which is a lot
more of a pain than it sounds because drilling is night-instant. These
explosions are usually enough to crit you, and if they don't, the stun
and area clear means any fauna can wander in and finish you off.

The auto-disable still makes it an annoyance to stumble upon gibtonite,
but it won't round end you for using modsuits.

Martian Food: A Taste of the Red Planet (#75988)

## About The Pull Request
Adds a selection of new foods and drinks based around Mars.
More information on Mars can be found here:
https://github.com/tgstation/common_core/blob/master/Interesting%20Planets/Human%20Space/The%20Sol%20System.md
To summarise for the general audience, Mars is a vital colony of the
Terran Federation, having been primarily settled (at least originally)
by Cybersun Industries to harvest its lucrative supplies of plasma, the
second largest in human space behind Lavaland. This has given Mars a
diverse culture evolving from the mostly East Asian colonists, and their
food reflects this.

Thanks to Melbert for their work on the soup portion of this PR.

The food:
Martian cuisine draws upon the culinary traditions of East Asia, and
adds in fusion cuisine from the later colonists. Expect classics such as
ramen, curry, noodles and donburi, as well as new takes on the formula
like the Croque-Martienne, Peanut Butter Ice Cream Mochi, and the
Kitzushi- chilli cheese and rice inside a fried tofu casing. Oh, and
lots of pineapple. The Martians love pineapple:

Also included are some foods for Ethereals, which may or may not be
hinting at something I've got planned...

The drinks:
Four new base drinks make their way to the game, bringing with them a
host of new cocktails: enjoy new ventures in bartending with Coconut
Rum, Shochu/Soju, Yuyake (our favourite legally-distinct melon liqueur),
and Mars' favourite alcoholic beverage, rice beer. Each is available in
the dispenser, as well as bottles in the booze-o-mat:

The recipes:
To make your (and the wiki editors) lives easier, please find below the
recipes for both foods and drinks:
Food: https://hackmd.io/@EOBGames/BkVFU0w9Y
Drinks: https://hackmd.io/@EOBGames/rJ1OhnsJ2
## Why It's Good For The Game
Another lot of variety for the chef and bartender, as well as continuing
the work started with lizard and moth food in getting Common Core into
the game in a tangible and fun way.
## Changelog
:cl: EOBGames, MrMelbert
add: Mars celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Martian Concession
this year, and this has brought Martian cuisine to new heights of
popularity. Find a new selection of Martian foods and drinks available
in your crafting menu today!

text,widget: [API] implement consistent, controllable line height

This commit ensures that any given paragraph of text shaped by Gio will use a single
internal line height. This line height is determined (by default) by the text size,
rather than the fonts involved. This is a breaking change, as previously we would
blindly use the largest line height of any font in a line for that line, leading to
lines within the same paragraph with extremely uneven spacing. This commit also
updates some test expectations in package widget.

I thought pretty hard about how to implement line spacing, and consulted a few sources:

[0] https://www.figma.com/blog/line-height-changes/
[1] https://practicaltypography.com/line-spacing.html
[2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height

There is no single, universal way to think about line spacing. Fonts internally specify
a line height as the sum of their ascent, descent, and gap, but the line height of two
fonts at the same pixel size (say 20 Sp) can vary wildy (especially across writing systems).
There are two strategies we could pursue to establish the line height of a paragraph of text:

- derive the line height from the fonts involved (our old behavior, and the behavior of
  many word processors)
- derive the line height from the requested text size provided by the user (the behavior of the
  web).

The challenge with the first option is that for a given piece of text in the UI, there can
be a silly number of fonts involved. If a label dispays user-generated content, the user can
put an emoji in it, and emoji fonts have different line heights from latin ones. This can cause
unexpected and nasty layout shift. Gio would previously do exactly this, on a line-by-line basis,
resulting in unevenly spaced lines within a paragraph depending on which fonts were used on
which lines. Choosing one of the fonts and enforcing its line height would make things consistent,
but it isn't clear how to choose that canonical font. There is no 1:1 mapping between the input
text.Font provided in the shaping parameters and a single font.Face. Instead, that mapping depends
upon the runes being shaped.

I think the only sane way to implement the first option would be to synthesize some text in the
provided system.Locale (mapping the language to a script and then generating a rune from that
script), shape that single rune, and then enforce the line height of the resulting face on the
entire paragraph. This would require doing a fair bit more work per paragraph than Gio does today,
so I've opted not to do it.

Instead, the second option allows us to choose a line height based on the size of the text that
the user wants to display. While this can potentially interact poorly with unusually tall fonts,
it means that text will always have a consistent line height.

I've provided two knobs to control line height:

- text.Parameters.LineHeight lets you set a specific height in pixels with a default value of
  text.Parameters.PxPerEm.
- text.Parameters.LineHeightScale applies a scaling factor to the LineHeight, allowing you to
  easily space out text without hard-coding a specific pixel size. The default value here
  (drawn from the recommendations of [1]) is 1.2, which looks pretty good across many fonts.

I've chosen this two-value API because many users will want to set one or the other value. I
considered instead a single value field and a "mode" that would specify how it was used, but
that felt uglier. Also, you *can* set both of these two fields and get predictable results.

I'd like to revisit using the line height of the chosen fonts in the future, but it seems a
little too complex to be worthwhile right now. An interesting option would be making the
select-a-face-using-locale strategy described above an opt-in feature, though some users
might instead want to just use the tallest line height among fonts in use. Something like
this Android API might be appropriate:

[3] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/android.widget.textview.fallbacklinespacing?view=xamarin-android-sdk-13

I'd like to thank Dominik Honnef for some good discussion around this feature, and for pointing
me to some good sources on the subject.

Adds a new positive quirk, "Spacer Born".  (#76809)

## About The Pull Request

Adds a new 7 point positive quirk, "Spacer Born". Totally not inspired
by The Expanse, don't look at the branch name.

You were born in space, rather than on a planet, so your physiology has
adapted differently.
You are more comfortable in space, and way less comfortable on a planet.

Benefits:
   - You are slightly taller. (No mechanical effect)
   - You take 20% less damage from pressure damage.
   - You take 20% less damage from cold environments. 
- You move 10% faster while floating (NOT drifting, this is zero gravity
movement while beside a wall).
- You drift 20% faster (Drifting through zero gravity, untethered to
anything)
- While in space (z-level-wise, not turf wise), you lose some disgust
overtime.
- While experiencing no-gravity for an extended period of time, you will
start regenerating stamina and reduce stuns at a very low rate.
- If you are assigned to shaft miner (or the map is Icebox), you are
awarded with a 25% wage bonus (hazard pay).

Downsides:
- While on a planet (Yes, this includes Icebox and planetary maps), you
gain gravity sickness:
- Passive accrue disgust (slightly lessened on Icebox) (Capped at low
levels)
      - Choking, after extended periods (disabled on Icebox)
      - Slower movement 
      - Weaker stamina (disabled on Icebox)
- Suffocation from extended periods (disabled on Icebox) (Lungs aren't
adapted)
      - Mood debuff

(Effects not final)

## Why It's Good For The Game

I'd figure I throw my hat in with the Positive Quirk Curse. 

This is a quirk that improves your ability in a niche circumstance (low
gravity / dangerous pressure), with some downsides that are only
generally in effect if you play a few roles (or it's Icebox).

Because of this I think it'll provide an interesting niche, where Spacer
Born engineers are slightly better than their counterparts due to their
origin (moving faster in space without a jetpack, withstanding
pressure). However, at the same time, if the mining outpost sustains
damage and needs repairs... suddenly your buff over your cohorts
disappears, and you have to brave somewhere hostile to your body.

Ultimately, the goal of the quirk is to encourage people to approach
situations a bit differently.
Or take it as a challenge and play shaft miner. 

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
add: Adds a new 7 point positive quirk, "Spacer Born". You were born in
space, and as a result your body's adapted to life in artificial
gravity, making you much more effective and comfortable in lower
gravity. However, travelling planet-side is quite a chore, especially if
you're assigned to work there.
add: Adds a chemical: Ondansetron, created by Oil + Nitrogen + Oxygen +
Ethanol catalyst. A powerful Antiemetic (lowers disgust).

Refactors Morphs into Basic Mobs (there is now a swag action for morphification) (#77503)

## About The Pull Request

I was bored, so did this. Probably one of the neatest refactors I've
done, sorry if there's some oddities because I was experimenting with
some other stuff in this so just tell me to clean them up whenever I
can.

Anyways, morphs are basic mobs now. We are able to easily refactor the
whole "eat items and corpses" stuff in the basic mob framework, but the
whole "morph into objects and people" turned out to be a bit trickier.
That was easily rectified with a datum mob cooldown action and
copy-pasting the old code into that code, as well as doing some nice
stuff with traits and signals to ensure the one-way communication from
the action to the mob.

Old Morph AI didn't seem to be existant whatsoever, they inappropriately
leveraged some old procs and I have no idea how to make it work with new
AI. They DEFINITELY don't spawn outside of admin interference/ the event
anymore, and will always be controlled by a player, so this shouldn't be
too bad of an issue. I gave them something to seem alive just in case
though, but I think adding legitimate prop-hunt AI would be such a
laborious task that I am unwilling to do it in this PR.
## Why It's Good For The Game

If admins want to add the ability for Ian to assume the form of the HoP,
they can do that now! The datum action cooldown is quite nice for simple
and basic mobs... but it is currently not compatible with carbons. That
is not within scope for this PR, but I am dwelling on ways to extend it
to carbon but they all sound really awfully bad.

Also morphs are smarter, and we tick another simple animal in need of
refactoring off the list.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Morphs are now basic mobs with a nice new ability to help you
change forms rather than the old shift-click method, much more
intuitive.
admin: With the morph rework comes a new ability you can add to mobs,
"Assume Form". Feel free to add that to any simple or basic mob for le
funnies as Runtime turns into a pen or something.
/:cl:

~~Does anyone know if there's a (sane) way to alias a cooldown action as
a keypress? I can't think of a good way to retain the old shift-click
functionality, because that does feel _kinda_ nice, but I think it can
be lived without.~~ I added it. Kinda fugly but whatever.

patch 9.0.1776: No support for stable Python 3 ABI

Problem:  No support for stable Python 3 ABI
Solution: Support Python 3 stable ABI

Commits:
1) Support Python 3 stable ABI to allow mixed version interoperatbility

Vim currently supports embedding Python for use with plugins, and the
"dynamic" linking option allows the user to specify a locally installed
version of Python by setting `pythonthreedll`. However, one caveat is
that the Python 3 libs are not binary compatible across minor versions,
and mixing versions can potentially be dangerous (e.g. let's say Vim was
linked against the Python 3.10 SDK, but the user sets `pythonthreedll`
to a 3.11 lib). Usually, nothing bad happens, but in theory this could
lead to crashes, memory corruption, and other unpredictable behaviors.
It's also difficult for the user to tell something is wrong because Vim
has no way of reporting what Python 3 version Vim was linked with.

For Vim installed via a package manager, this usually isn't an issue
because all the dependencies would already be figured out. For prebuilt
Vim binaries like MacVim (my motivation for working on this), AppImage,
and Win32 installer this could potentially be an issue as usually a
single binary is distributed. This is more tricky when a new Python
version is released, as there's a chicken-and-egg issue with deciding
what Python version to build against and hard to keep in sync when a new
Python version just drops and we have a mix of users of different Python
versions, and a user just blindly upgrading to a new Python could lead to
bad interactions with Vim.

Python 3 does have a solution for this problem: stable ABI / limited API
(see https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html). The C SDK limits the
API to a set of functions that are promised to be stable across
versions. This pull request adds an ifdef config that allows us to turn
it on when building Vim. Vim binaries built with this option should be
safe to freely link with any Python 3 libraies without having the
constraint of having to use the same minor version.

Note: Python 2 has no such concept and this doesn't change how Python 2
integration works (not that there is going to be a new version of Python
2 that would cause compatibility issues in the future anyway).

---

Technical details:
======

The stable ABI can be accessed when we compile with the Python 3 limited
API (by defining `Py_LIMITED_API`). The Python 3 code (in `if_python3.c`
and `if_py_both.h`) would now handle this and switch to limited API
mode. Without it set, Vim will still use the full API as before so this
is an opt-in change.

The main difference is that `PyType_Object` is now an opaque struct that
we can't directly create "static types" out of, and we have to create
type objects as "heap types" instead. This is because the struct is not
stable and changes from version to version (e.g. 3.8 added a
`tp_vectorcall` field to it). I had to change all the types to be
allocated on the heap instead with just a pointer to them.

Other functions are also simply missing in limited API, or they are
introduced too late (e.g. `PyUnicode_AsUTF8AndSize` in 3.10) to it that
we need some other ways to do the same thing, so I had to abstract a few
things into macros, and sometimes re-implement functions like
`PyObject_NEW`.

One caveat is that in limited API, `OutputType` (used for replacing
`sys.stdout`) no longer inherits from `PyStdPrinter_Type` which I don't
think has any real issue other than minor differences in how they
convert to a string and missing a couple functions like `mode()` and
`fileno()`.

Also fixed an existing bug where `tp_basicsize` was set incorrectly for
`BufferObject`, `TabListObject, `WinListObject`.

Technically, there could be a small performance drop, there is a little
more indirection with accessing type objects, and some APIs like
`PyUnicode_AsUTF8AndSize` are missing, but in practice I didn't see any
difference, and any well-written Python plugin should try to avoid
excessing callbacks to the `vim` module in Python anyway.

I only tested limited API mode down to Python 3.7, which seemes to
compile and work fine. I haven't tried earlier Python versions.

2) Fix PyIter_Check on older Python vers / type##Ptr unused warning

For PyIter_Check, older versions exposed them as either macros (used in
full API), or a function (for use in limited API). A previous change
exposed PyIter_Check to the dynamic build because Python just moved it
to function-only in 3.10 anyway. Because of that, just make sure we
always grab the function in dynamic builds in earlier versions since
that's what Python eventually did anyway.

3) Move Py_LIMITED_API define to configure script

Can now use --with-python-stable-abi flag to customize what stable ABI
version to target. Can also use an env var to do so as well.

4) Show +python/dyn-stable in :version, and allow has() feature query

Not sure if the "/dyn-stable" suffix would break things, or whether we
should do it another way. Or just don't show it in version and rely on
has() feature checking.

5) Documentation first draft. Still need to implement v:python3_version

6) Fix PyIter_Check build breaks when compiling against Python 3.8

7) Add CI coverage stable ABI on Linux/Windows / make configurable on Windows

This adds configurable options for Windows make files (both MinGW and
MSVC). CI will also now exercise both traditional full API and stable
ABI for Linux and Windows in the matrix for coverage.

Also added a "dynamic" option to Linux matrix as a drive-by change to
make other scripting languages like Ruby / Perl testable under both
static and dynamic builds.

8) Fix inaccuracy in Windows docs

Python's own docs are confusing but you don't actually want to use
`python3.dll` for the dynamic linkage.

9) Add generated autoconf file

10) Add v:python3_version support

This variable indicates the version of Python3 that Vim was built
against (PY_VERSION_HEX), and will be useful to check whether the Python
library you are loading in dynamically actually fits it. When built with
stable ABI, it will be the limited ABI version instead
(`Py_LIMITED_API`), which indicates the minimum version of Python 3 the
user should have, rather than the exact match. When stable ABI is used,
we won't be exposing PY_VERSION_HEX in this var because it just doesn't
seem necessary to do so (the whole point of stable ABI is the promise
that it will work across versions), and I don't want to confuse the user
with too many variables.

Also, cleaned up some documentation, and added help tags.

11) Fix Python 3.7 compat issues

Fix a couple issues when using limited API < 3.8

- Crash on exit: In Python 3.7, if a heap-allocated type is destroyed
  before all instances are, it would cause a crash later. This happens
  when we destroyed `OptionsType` before calling `Py_Finalize` when
  using the limited API. To make it worse, later versions changed the
  semantics and now each instance has a strong reference to its own type
  and the recommendation has changed to have each instance de-ref its
  own type and have its type in GC traversal. To avoid dealing with
  these cross-version variations, we just don't free the heap type. They
  are static types in non-limited-API anyway and are designed to last
  through the entirety of the app, and we also don't restart the Python
  runtime and therefore do not need it to have absolutely 0 leaks.

  See:
  - https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#changes-in-the-c-api
  - https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.9.html#changes-in-the-c-api

- PyIter_Check: This function is not provided in limited APIs older than
  3.8. Previously I was trying to mock it out using manual
  PyType_GetSlot() but it was brittle and also does not actually work
  properly for static types (it will generate a Python error). Just
  return false. It does mean using limited API < 3.8 is not recommended
  as you lose the functionality to handle iterators, but from playing
  with plugins I couldn't find it to be an issue.

- Fix loading of PyIter_Check so it will be done when limited API < 3.8.
  Otherwise loading a 3.7 Python lib will fail even if limited API was
  specified to use it.

12) Make sure to only load `PyUnicode_AsUTF8AndSize` in needed in limited API

We don't use this function unless limited API >= 3.10, but we were
loading it regardless. Usually it's ok in Unix-like systems where Python
just has a single lib that we load from, but in Windows where there is a
separate python3.dll this would not work as the symbol would not have
been exposed in this more limited DLL file. This makes it much clearer
under what condition is this function needed.

fix: Improve nvim detection (#1946)

* Improve nvim detection:

Don't rely on the shell specific `exists", instead run `nvim -v`.
Additionally, if there's unexpected output, for example if your shell is
configured wrongly to output something when run in non-interactive mode,
it will tell you so, instead of failing with very strange errors later.

The `neovim-bin` argument has also been changed to always require the
binary to exist, instead if falling back to `nvim` as that's probably
not what the user wants. If `nevoim-bin` contains path separators the
binary will be tried directly, otherwise `which` will be used to find
the correct executable.

The which command has also been changed to always use the which crate
first to avoid shell specific issues (for example nushell).

The output is printed directly to stderr instead of the log, for a more
user friendly experience. Furthermore, the maybe disown call has been
moved so that the user actually has a chance to see the errors in the
console.

* fix(command): correct typos and clarify help message

* fix: preliminarly restore forking behavior

This however also loses possible error messages at startup about the
nvim binary not being found.

* codestyle: calm rustfmt

* fix(command): make error message about missing/errornous nvim visible

add alpaca gpt4 dataset (#2610)

The inputs can be quite a lot of different versions of `no input`,
therefore don't use the `input` column for that.
In some cases the text in `input` is already in the instruction, in
these cases, we also don't use the `input` column.

I am not quite sure how to concatenate the `instruction` and the `input`
column. In most cases it seems fine to just replace last appearance of
`.`, `!` or `?` with a colon, e.g.:
Instruction: `Identify the odd one out.`
Input: `Twitter, Instagram, Telegram`
or 
Instruction: `How dense is a given material?`
Input: `Steel`

But we also have some questions like:
Instruction: `Given the following synopsis, what is the moral lesson of
this story?`
Input: `Once upon a time, there was a poor young boy who wanted some
candy. He begged his father for money to buy it, but his father said no
and ordered him to go to bed. As he was going to bed, the boy saw a
five-dollar bill on the counter, which he took and bought the candy.`

Where this might not be the best case. Either way, I think the this one
token will not make significant difference the model and therefore I

Rework temporary file handling

View with whitespace diff off for an easier time (--ignore-all-space).

This turned out to be a lot more work than I thought. Really should have
been a branch, but I misjudged this horribly, then it kept growing...
Also not sure how feasible this would be to have as a branch without
breaking dev.

Wrye Bash's temporary files handling was actually a complete mess. There
were *three* different ways that random pieces of code were using it:
 - bass.getTempDir/newTempDir/rmTempDir
 - Path.temp and Path.untemp
 - Just use Path.baseTempDir/tempDir or even tempfile directly and do
   it completely manually.

These all had problems:
 - The bass APIs were very implicit - you would extract something to the
   'bass temp dir' and then access it via getTempDir in some other
   function, then remove the directory via rmTempDir in another
   function. XXX I'm still not done tracking this implicit mess down
   (see converters.py).
 - Path.temp did not guarantee that the file would be unique. This isn't
   really a problem for Wrye Bash right now, but would become a big
   problem if we ever wanted to allow multiple instances to run at the
   same time (which we do). Path.untemp also did some really weird I/O
   stuff that doesn't seem necessary at all and would just cost us a
   bunch of syscalls.
 - Path.baseTempDir/tempDir and tempfile required you to keep track of
   all the path manipulation and logic manually. After going through all
   this refactoring, trust me when I say that you do *not* want to do
   this manually. These places were few, thankfully, and none seem to
   have messed it up.

The new API (wbtemp.py) exposes two ways to do it:
 - Use TempDir or TempFile in a context manager. This is extremely
   simple and works very well. It guarantees that the file will be
   cleaned up, even if your logic becomes very complex or an exception
   occurs.
 - Use new_temp_dir/new_temp_file to create a temporary dir/file and
   manually clean it up via cleanup_temp_dir/cleanup_temp_file. These
   should be used *very sparingly*, only where absolutely needed.
   Right now we only have a single usage of manual temp files in
   dialogs.UpdateNotification and two usages of manual temp dirs (one in
   InstallerArchive.unpackToTemp and one in env.shellMakeDirs).

It also has other advantages:
 - Complexity is encapsulated to a single file.
 - Works even during (very) early boot (though doesn't seem to be
   needed right now?).
 - Should work perfectly with multiple instances of WB running at the
   same time (which isn't possible yet, but is a goal for the future).

There's one ugly wart. barb wants to extract archives to a temporary
folder, which then needs to survive a restart of WB, whereupon it will
be handled by the boot '--restore' handler. wbtemp, by design, does not
allow this and will clean up all created directories and files on exit.
To handle this, I used manual tempfile fiddling. Perhaps a future
refactoring of barb could fix this, but for now I think it's an
acceptable tradeoff for the massive improvements this commit brings us.

Some random stuff that got stuck in here:

Note that I got rid of the utf-8-sig encodings passed to 7z, the docs
say:

  Notes: The list file in Unicode charset can start with the BOM (byte
  order mark) character (U+FEFF). In that case 7-Zip checks that
  encoding of BOM corresponds to encoding specified with this switch
  (for UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE).

and:

  Default charset is UTF-8.

From https://7-zip.opensource.jp/chm/cmdline/switches/charset.htm
Very happy to see some of these terrible BOMs disappear from the
codebase.

Some minor warning fixups in gui_fomod

Utumno:
Refactor compress7z:

The time is ripe for dropping the rel_dest param - note this drops a
couple of FName imports.

[4.14.323/v53391] update glibc(2.38) and kernel(4.14.323)

- i updated glibc because these guys decided to add strlcpy and strlcat.
  so then i made the choice to recompile anything that used these
  functions (from libbsd). so a lot of stuff that was linked to libbsd
  is now linked without it (except frr because i forgot)

-  kernel 6.1 seems like a no go. it's too big. i could remove tcpdump
   but the problem is it's still going to be a tight fit, and i'd have
   to probably remove other things. i don't know. plus i've lost the
   appetite to update the kernel after linux kernel devs decided they're
   bigger than gLIBC with their 64 bit time crap.
        -now if you build glibc for kernels 5.0 and newer, there will
        probably be userspace breakage for any programs compiled on
        earlier versions, which defeats the entire principle of glibc.

        -so since the linux development team thinks they're bigger than
        the library that makes them, i don't think i should invest any
        more time in trying to stay up to date.

i've had a top build for over 4 years as of this september,
        - with all the buttons working, and the LEDs.
        - if that support fizzles out in the next year or two, i don't
        think it'll be a bad thing.
                -in fact, i thought this update may be pointless, since
                the previous build seems great.
                        -BUT since some of you guys just love to update
                        your stuff, i decided to spin the build anyways.

i was busy taking over the "redneck swap" so that's why i also haven't
updated. anyways i'm getting bored because i've done too many things and
mitt STILL think he's "the math guy" with "the business sense". i
haven't seen mitt do a fraction of what i have. all i've seen mitt do is
hold a picket sign SUPPORTING the vietnam war

https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/us/politics/at-stanford-romney-stood-ground-on-vietnam.html

and his followers think he's the "Mormon John Lennon"

cool world--sorry, i mean GLOBAL ECKANAMY, bro.

P.S. I DID NOT TEST THIS BUILD BUT I DON'T SEE WHY IT WOULDN'T WORK. i
am at 41 days uptime and i'm trying to keep ti going.

Manually copy trailing attributes on a resize (#12637)

## THE WHITE WHALE

This is a fairly naive fix for this bug. It's not terribly performant,
but neither is resize in the first place.

When the buffer gets resized, typically we only copy the text up to the
`MeasureRight` point, the last printable char in the row. Then we'd just
use the last char's attributes to fill the remainder of the row.

Instead, this PR changes how reflow behaves when it gets to the end of
the row. After we finish copying text, then manually walk through the
attributes at the end of the row, and copy them over. This ensures that
cells that just have a colored space in them get copied into the new
buffer as well, and we don't just blat the last character's attributes
into the rest of the row. We'll do a similar thing once we get to the
last printable char in the buffer, copying the remaining attributes.

This could DEFINITELY be more performant. I think this current
implementation walks the attrs _on every cell_, then appends the new
attrs to the new ATTR_ROW. That could be optimized by just using the
actual iterator. The copy after the last printable char bit is also
especially bad in this regard. That could likely be a blind copy - I
just wanted to get this into the world.

Finally, we now copy the final attributes to the correct buffer: the new
one.  We used to copy them to the _old_ buffer, which we were about to
destroy.

## Validation

I'll add more gifs in the morning, not enough time to finish spinning a
release Terminal build with this tonight.
