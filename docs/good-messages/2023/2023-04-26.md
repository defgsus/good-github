Fixes spoon overlay not updating every time (#74687)

## About The Pull Request

After bludgeoning myself one too many times with a spoon, here we are.

The spoon overlay wasn't updating to reflect that soup had been
consumed, which led to trying to eat it again and then pain.

Why do spoons hurt so much?

## Why It's Good For The Game

Less spoon related injuries.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: spoon overlays will now update when you eat from them to reflect
that food = gone. it really is gone, you can stop beating yourself with
the spoon. oh god please stop--

http: support CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR

The CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS (and matching CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS) flag was
deprecated in curl 7.85.0, and using it generate compiler warnings as of
curl 7.87.0. The path forward is to use CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR, but we
can't just do so unilaterally, as it was only introduced less than a
year ago in 7.85.0.

Until that version becomes ubiquitous, we have to either disable the
deprecation warning or conditionally use the "STR" variant on newer
versions of libcurl. This patch switches to the new variant, which is
nice for two reasons:

  - we don't have to worry that silencing curl's deprecation warnings
    might cause us to miss other more useful ones

  - we'd eventually want to move to the new variant anyway, so this gets
    us set up (albeit with some extra ugly boilerplate for the
    conditional)

There are a lot of ways to split up the two cases. One way would be to
abstract the storage type (strbuf versus a long), how to append
(strbuf_addstr vs bitwise OR), how to initialize, which CURLOPT to use,
and so on. But the resulting code looks pretty magical:

  GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE allowed = GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE_INIT;
  if (...http is allowed...)
	GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_APPEND(&allowed, "http", CURLOPT_HTTP);

and you end up with more "#define GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE" macros than
actual code.

On the other end of the spectrum, we could just implement two separate
functions, one that handles a string list and one that handles bits. But
then we end up repeating our list of protocols (http, https, ftp, ftp).

This patch takes the middle ground. The run-time code is always there to
handle both types, and we just choose which one to feed to curl.

Malfunctioning AIs get a discount on the Doomsday equipment by hacking Head of Staff APCs (#74225)

## About The Pull Request
Reduces the price of the Doomsday equipment by 20 PT for each APC hacked
in a Head of Staff office, as well as the Vault.
## Why It's Good For The Game
See #71404 for the prior PR and my full reasoning.

Long-story short, activating the Doomsday before having a plan in place
is suicide, and it takes 13 APCs to unlock. Since there are few well
hidden APCs in general, you'll usually be gathering APCs after going
loud (such as with a borg machine). 13 APCs is 13 minutes, and by the
time you've gathered your malfbux, you're either already dead or have
already taken full control.

I had intended to give Doomsday a flat 70 PT price, but concerns were
raised that an AI could conceivably hack only APCs on their sat (and
perhaps one on the Lavaland outpost) and Doomsday without ever really
touching the station*. So a compromise was proposed, we instead give the
AI discounts by hacking Head of Staff areas, and the Vault, which are
usually situated in well-traveled areas, and also have some fluff
reasoning.

*I still think it'd be suicide to do this, but it's not a hill I want to
die on.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Malf AIs that hack Head of Staff and Vault APCs will now find a
discount issued on Doomsday.

Blink is no longer a forbidden school spell?? (#74487)

## About The Pull Request

Turns blink's school from forbidden to translocation. This has some
incredibly minor changes nobody is going to notice:
- Changes the blink's invocations when mixed with a CERTAIN spell
- If you were very specifically a chaplain with the holy crusade sect
and you casted blink, before it would excommunicate you, now it will
just smite you, as translocation spells are seen as less bad than
forbidden magic
- probably some more niche interactions but that's all I can remember

## Why It's Good For The Game

Guys, I know blink is a very annoying spell but come on now it's not
forbidden magic, that's for heretics and super duper evil stuffs

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: blink is now a translocation spell

Icemoon Hermit Ruin Active Turf Fix - For Real This Time (#74476)

In #74306, I _thought_ I knew what the cause was, and I both attempted a
potential fix _and_ made tracking it easier. The fruits of my labor paid
off, I know exactly what caused it now.

Basically, the demonic portal will scrape away all turfs in a 5-tile
radius on its `Initialize()`, and if a spawner spawned right next to the
hermit ruin... it would count it as a mineral turf and scrape it away as
well. That's so fucking silly. At least we know now.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The fix is to just make those tiles unscrapeable, which is accomplished
via another turf_flag and filtering those out in the `Initialize()` of
the demonic portals.

I also cleaned up the calls to scrapeaway being `null`, which is really
weird because it just defaulted to the normal proc behavior. Naming the
arguments instead does the same thing (I checked)

[MIRROR] Makes Black Market Uplinks more easily craftable, adds them to uncommon maint loot pool [MDB IGNORE] (#20602)

* Makes Black Market Uplinks more easily craftable, adds them to uncommon maint loot pool (#74744)

## About The Pull Request

Replaced the subspace amplifier in the Black Market Uplink's crafting
recipe with a signaller and a microlaser.

Added the Black Market Uplink to the maintenance loot pool.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The BMU is an _extremely_ rare device to find in rounds. It can quite
literally ONLY be found via the crafting recipe, and with how stupidly
bloated the crafting lists are, it isn't something many people know
about. All this means that a very unique and engaging gimmick item is
tragically extremely obscured.

To add to this, the recipe requires a _subspace amplifier_. These items
are UNBELIEVABLY rare - they need you to vend them from a techfab with
bluespace communication technology researched, which is fair to say is
not a common thing. Sometimes maps have them in tech storage, but even
then you have to break and enter which can be quite risky at times and
an annoying blockade the other times.

The black market items are not worth this much hassle. They are all
small cute gimmicky objects that do not heavily impact the round. By
making it not only easier to craft with common items, but also appear in
the maintenance loot pool, this will make assistants find out about it
more often, which can further incentivize them to utilize the **cargo
bounty system** to get enough money to buy their funny gadgets.

Another idea would be to make the uplink appear as a bounty item, which
would be a great way to tell players it exists and encourage them to mix
both systems together. The system for getting items is also
unnecessarily, miserably awful - your item either gets literally thrown
into space from a random direction, or it is teleported silently without
warning in 60 seconds onto a completely random place which can very much
include Security, Command, the Vault, or other high-security areas.
Needing to B&E into these areas to get your durathread vest is, uh. Not
worth it. However these aren't part of this PR, unless they're given the
A-OK. (also maybe make it cargo purchasable?)
## Changelog

balance: Makes Black Market Uplinks more easily craftable, adds them to
uncommon maint loot pool

The North Star Expeditionary Vessel - A Second Wind (#74371)

## About The Pull Request
A new map for TGstation, in the works! It has 4 fucking Z levels, a
massive expansive maintenance with unique designs, and some unique code
features in the works.

To Do:
- [x] Update the Map to Modern TG
- [x] Local Tests
- [x] Work on Map Optimizations
- [x] Run Live Tests

Fikou has greatly helped with creating an important flavour aspect of
this map, Trek Uniforms on anyone who joins! See the forum thread for
more. This includes the framework for innate station traits, station
traits loaded as long as it's in a map's json

Here's the forum dev thread there are screenshots there.

### Mapping March
Ckey to receive rewards: Cheshify

## Why It's Good For The Game
So, this is the North Star. An effort taking multiple mappers and of 9~
months of hard work. This map was not initially designed for TGstation,
but always designed for TGstation code. The process of retooling the map
for TGstation was an absolute joy and I feel like the map definitely has
it's niche as a massive and unique experience for it's players.

I adore this map, it's gorgeous, has a unique aesthetic, and a number of
very funny interactions with multi-Z. The PR comes packed with unique
mechanics for future mappers (innate station traits!), a number of
map-fitting shuttles, and a fun spacefaring uniform gimmick for the
crew.

**This is my second attempt at bringing this map into rotation. It was
initially closed due to concerns about maptick and performance, as I
wasn't willing to push for a map to be added to the repository if it
didn't function to my own standards. I've been informed by a number of
coders far better than I that optimizations are arriving and enroute, so
I think it's time to dust her off and set sail for another journey.**

**Quick Disclaimer: Due to some design decisions disagreed upon by the
headcoder team and myself, the map will not be featuring unique
roundstart uniforms, and despite my design intentions, the innate
station trait features will be shelved for now.**

## Changelog
:cl: Cheshify, Fikou, Blue-Berry, Zytolg, InfiniteGalaxies, Striders,
Sylphet, Riggle, Soal, Andry, Crit, Deranging, and Pumpkin0.
add: Nanotrasen's Newest Exploratory Vessel is now available! Meet the
North Star!
add: More landmines, and a landmine random spawner.
add: energy barriers now have a regenerative subtype, fit for permanent
installations.
code: Raised the number of possible level render to 4, check your
preferences if needed to be reduced.

Hologram Touchup (Init savings edition) (#74793)

## About The Pull Request

### Polishes and Reworks Holograms

Hologram generation currently involves a bunch of icon operations, which
are slow.
Not to mention a series of get flats for the human models, which is even
worse.

We lose 0.05 seconds of init to em off just the 2 RCD holograms. it
hurts man.

So instead, let's use filters and render steps to achive the same
effect.

While I'm here I'll dim the holo light and make it blue, make the
hologram and its beam emissive (so they glow), and do some fenangling
with move_hologram() (it doesn't clear the hologram off failure anymore,
instead relying on callers to do that) to ensure holocalls can't be
accidentially ended by moving out of the area.

Ah and I added RESET_ALPHA to the emissive appearance flags, cause the
alpha does override and fuck with color rendering, which ends up looking
dumb. If we're gonna support this stuff it should be first class not
accidential.

### Makes Static Not Shit

While I'm here (since holograms see static) lets ensure the static plane
is always visible if you're seeing through an ai eye.

The old solution was limited to applying it to JUST ais, which isn't
satisfactory for this sort of thing and missed a LOT of cases (I didn't
really get how ai eyes worked before I'ma be honest)

I'm adding a signal off the hud for it detecting a change in its eye
here.
This is semi redundant, but avoids unneeded dupe work, so I'm ok with
it.

The pipeline here is less sane then I'd like, but it works and that's
enough

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Holograms glow now, pokes at the lighting for holocalls in general
a bit to make em nicer.

Fixes Active Turf Scenario on Tramstation (#74354)

## About The Pull Request

On the tin. Basically whenever `atmoscilower_2.dmm` would invoked
`atmoscilower_attachment_a_2.dmm`, it would trigger an active turf in
this location since it doesn't have a "ceiling". (as well as there being
an "aired" turf mingling with airless turfs)

This caused the following report:
```txt
 - All that follows is a turf with an active air difference at roundstart. To clear this, make sure that all of the turfs listed below are connected to a turf with the same air contents.
 - In an ideal world, this list should have enough information to help you locate the active turf(s) in question. Unfortunately, this might not be an ideal world.
 - If the round is still ongoing, you can use the "Mapping -> Show roundstart AT list" verb to see exactly what active turfs were detected. Otherwise, good luck.
 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (163,80,2) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Lesser Starboard Maintenance (163,81,2) (/area/station/maintenance/starboard/lesser). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (164,80,2) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Lesser Starboard Maintenance (164,81,2) (/area/station/maintenance/starboard/lesser). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (165,80,2) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/misc/asteroid/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Lesser Starboard Maintenance (165,81,2) (/area/station/maintenance/starboard/lesser). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (166,81,2) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Lesser Starboard Maintenance (165,83,2) (/area/station/maintenance/starboard/lesser). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/iron/smooth. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (165,83,3) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/openspace/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Z-Level 2 has 8 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level 3 has 1 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level trait Station has 9 active turf(s).
 - End of active turf list.
```

This is what it looked like when it was reproduced on my machine:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/228689991-d9cc87c3-f931-4513-8399-928c93def605.png)


Surprisingly not that hard to debug, albeit tedious. At least I know
that this was the issue with 100% confidence.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Ate up 0.1 seconds of init on my machine. That's silly.

Organ Unit Tests & Bugfixes (#73026)

## About The Pull Request

This PR adds a new unit test for all organs, a new unit test for lungs,
and includes improvements for the existing breath and organ_set_bonus
tests. Using the tests, I was able to root out bugs in the organs. This
PR includes an advanced refactor of several developer-facing functions.
This PR certainly represents a "quality pass" for organs which will make
them easier to develop from now on.

### Synopsis of changes:
1. Fixed many fundamental bugs in organ code, especially in
`Insert()`/`Remove()` and their overrides.
2. Added two new procs to `/obj/item/organ` named `on_insert` and
`on_remove`, each being called after `Insert()`/`Remove()`.
3. Added `organ_effects` lazylist to `/obj/item/organ`. Converted
`organ_traits` to lazylist. 2x less empty lists per organ.
4. Adding `SHOULD_CALL_PARENT(TRUE)` to `Insert()`/`Remove()` was very
beneficial to stability and overall code health.
5. Created unit test `organ_sanity` for all usable organs in the game.
Tests insertion and removal.
6. Created unit test `lungs_sanity` for
`/obj/item/organ/internal/lungs`.
7. Improved `breath_sanity` unit tests with additional tests and
conditions.
8. Improved `organ_set_bonus_sanity` unit tests with better
documentation and maintainable code.

---

### Granular bug/fix list:

- A lot of organs are overriding `Insert()` to apply unique
side-effects, but aren't checking the return value of the parent proc
which causes the activation of side-effects even if the insertion
technically fails. I noticed the use-case of applying "unique
side-effects" is repeated across a lot of organs in the game, and by
overriding `Insert()` the potential for bugs is very high; I solved this
problem with inversion-of-control by adding two new procs to
`/obj/item/organ` named `on_insert` and `on_remove`, each being called
after `Insert()` and `Remove()` succeed.
- Many organs, such as abductor "glands", cursed heart, demon heart,
alien hive-node, alien plasma-vessel, etc, were not returning their
parent's `Insert()` proc return value at all, and as a result those
organs `Insert()`s were always returning `null`. I have been mopping
those bugs up in my last few PRs, and now the unit test reveals it all.
Functions such as those in surgery expect a truthy value to be returned
from `Insert()` to represent insertion success, and otherwise it
force-moves the organ out of the mob.
- Fixed abductor "glands" which had a hard-del bug due to their
`Remove()` not calling the parent proc.
- Fixed cybernetic arm implants which had a hard-del bug due to
`Remove()` not resetting their `hand` variable to `null`.
- Fixed lungs gas exchange implementation, which was allowing exhaled
gases to feedback into the inhaled gases, which caused Humans to inhale
much more gas than intended and not exhale expected gases.

### Overview of the `organ_sanity` unit test:

- The new `organ_sanity` unit test gathers all "usable" organs in the
game and tests to see if their `Insert()` and `Remove()` functions
behave as we expect them to.
- Some organs, such as the Nightmare Brain, cause the mob's species to
change which subsequently swaps out all of their organs; the unit test
accounts for these organs via the typecache `species_changing_organs`.
- Some organs are not usable in-game and can't be unit tested, so the
unit test accounts for them via the typecache `test_organ_blacklist`.

### Overview of the `lungs_sanity` unit test:

- This unit test focuses on `/obj/item/organ/internal/lungs` including
Plasmaman and Ashwalker lungs. The test focuses on testing the lungs'
`check_breath()` proc.
- The tests are composed of calling `check_breath` with different gas
mixes to test breathing and suffocation.
- Includes gas exchange test for inhaled/exhaled gases, such as O2 to
CO2.

### Improvements to the `breath_sanity` unit tests:

- Added additional tests for suffocation with empty internals, pure
Nitrogen internals, and a gas-less turf.
- Includes slightly more reliable tests for internals tanks.

## Why It's Good For The Game

**Organs and Lungs were mostly untested. Too many refactors have been
submitted without the addition of unit tests to prove the code works at
all.** Time to stop. _Time to get some help_. Due to how bad the code
health is in organs, any time we've tried to work with them some sort of
bug caused them to blow up in our faces. I am trying to fix some of that
by establishing some standard testing for organs. These tests have
revealed and allowed me to fix lot of basic developer errors/oversights,
as well as a few severe bugs.

## Changelog

:cl: A.C.M.O.
fix: Fixed lungs gas exchange implementation, so you always inhale and
exhale the correct gases.
fix: Fixed a large quantity of hard-deletes which were being caused by
organs and cybernetic organs.
fix: Fixed many organs which were applying side-effects regardless of
whether or not the insertion failed.

[MIRROR] Moves revolution code of out of flash code, fixes April Fool conversion forcesay never working in any cirumstances [MDB IGNORE] (#20358)

* Moves revolution code of out of flash code, fixes April Fool conversion forcesay never working in any cirumstances (#74411)

## About The Pull Request

- Signallizes head revolutionary flash conversion code, moving it out of
core flash code.
- Removes "tacticool" flashing from head revs, but they can still
convert from any direction

- Fixes April Fools "You son of a bitch! I'm in" force say never
working.
   - Revs are muted on conversion so they couldn't talk.
       - Fixed by only muting revs on non-holidays
   - Cultists are unconscious on conversion so they couldn't talk
       - Fixed by only unconscious-ing cultists on non-holidays
- Brainwash victims are more often than not unconscious / asleep so they
couldn't talk
       - Just left this one.

- Reduced the chance of them occurring and limits it to April Fools only
- A 1% chance of the force says ocurring means they will happen pretty
much once a week, given multiple rev / cult rounds happen every week and
on average like, 20 people are converted. A little absurd, it's good
that it never worked?

## Why It's Good For The Game

Antag code in core item code is bad

It's funny this meme has existed for like 2, 3 years now? No one's
tested it, it's never worked

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
refactor: Removes Rev code from core flash code
fix: Getting converted on April Fools now triggers the meme force say as
always intended
del: The meme force say can no longer trigger on any day (it didn't work
before anyways)

[MIRROR] Goliath-Infused Tendril Hammer uses an internal cooldown for the its special attack instead of a universal click cooldown [MDB IGNORE] (#20092)

* Goliath-Infused Tendril Hammer uses an internal cooldown for the its special attack instead of a universal click cooldown (#74159)

## About The Pull Request

Rather than using a click cooldown, the tendril hammer instead can make
its special heavy attack every 2 seconds.

## Why It's Good For The Game

In my newfound quest to try and eliminate universal click cooldowns or
weird non-interactivity timers as balancing factors, this definitely is
one of the biggest standout offenders. Lemme make an argument for
universal click cooldowns increases being an ineffective limitation.

I'll use the problems presented by the tendril hammer to highlight some
of those problems, as well as unique problems to the tendril hammer
itself.

<details>
  <summary>da big discussion</summary>

A) The functionality of the hammer actively inhibits all in-game handuse
interaction for several seconds, without explaining this to a player. As
a player, you won't know why this is happening, as universal click
cooldown is not present as a UI element.

B) Since universal click cooldowns are not visible to players, it might
feel more like the game is malfunctioning rather than being a deliberate
mechanic. Even if click cooldowns were visible, players probably would
think that the cooldown applies to the hammer, and not handuse
interactivity with the game world as a whole for several seconds.

C) The functionality of the hammer could work fine as an internal
cooldown on the hammer, only relevant to the hammer. This ensures that
its special effects are exclusive, without the need to interrupt player
interaction as a whole.

D) Since we're talking about miners. If someone is concerned about the
hammer being used on the station against carbon players; you need
someone to help mutate you into goliath mutant, which cannot be bypassed
whatsoever. An excellent example of something similar is the chainsaw
arm, created right next door to genetics in robotics, which does even
more force than the arm and is sharp. With the limitations that exist, I
think it probably discourages most powergaming, if that was even a
realistic concern (it really isn't).

E) You lose both a hand AND your gloves slot when you get the hammer. No
modsuits, no glove equipment, no two-handed equipment, and you now have
to juggle everything with one hand assuming you're not on your, once
again, universal click cooldown for several precious seconds. Miners
live or die in their rapid response to problems. This is also the total
sum of what you lose as a miner. That's a steep cost and it just doesn't
justify its own value compared to what you lose.

</details>

TL;DR - There is no offset to the cost of this weapon, it is strictly a
detriment because of poorly conceived implementation.

This is maybe one of the coolest ideas conceptually for the infusions so
far, heavily hampered by what seems to be an intense fear of the
mutation being _too useful_. So it was made _borderline masochistic to
willingly seek out and use_.

I want to see this actually be useful. I can't see this with the
restrictions it has. Hopefully this is enough to make it worthwhile
getting.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Changes the universal click cooldown of the tendril hammer from
the goliath infusion into an internal cooldown just for the special
heavy attack.

[MIRROR] Microing var/static times (~0.015 seconds of init) [MDB IGNORE] (#20688)

* Microing var/static times (~0.015 seconds of init) (#74769)

## About The Pull Request

Moth and I came up with an affront to god and man, and used it to track
the time spent creating /static (and in theory /global) variables (this
happens right at the start of init)
They cost as a sum about 0.05 seconds btw, at least currently.

```
/datum/timer
    var/key

/datum/timer/New(file, line)
    src.key = "[file]:[line]"

/datum/timer/proc/operator*(x)
    rustg_time_reset(key)
    return x

/datum/timer/proc/operator+(x)
    var/time = rustg_time_microseconds(key)
    world.log << "TIMER: [key]: [time]"
    return x

Regex:
var/static/([\w/]+) =
-> var/static/$1 = (new /datum/timer(__FILE__, __LINE__)) * (new /datum/timer(__FILE__, __LINE__)) +
```

Output on moth's pc looks like this, time in microseconds

[output_sorted.csv](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/files/11241900/output_sorted.csv)

Most of this is either icon_states() memes (which appears to be cached
btw, that's interesting), or a variation on typecacheof()
There is one get_asset_datum call, but that is ALREADY cached and so is
just redundant. That's a good 0.01 seconds saved.

The rest of the time here is slightly more interesting.

The majority of typecacheof() is iterating the output of typesof(), a
byond internal proc that returns a list of types that either are or are
the child of the passed in type.
A decent chunk of time here (0.005 seconds, or 10% of the proc) can be
saved by unrolling the arguments to the proc.
It takes an arbitrary amount of typepaths as input, but we can't like
use arglist() here (cause this is an internal "proc"), so instead we try
a window of args, passing in null if we start to try and take in too
much.
Window size matters, zebra fits better into 4 then 5, especially because
of how grouping needs to work to make this effect happen.
We save about 0.001 for zebra btw, which is around about 7%. It's lower
cause we need to group the paths beforehand I think.

The speedup is minor, but it DOES exist. Plus it's fun.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Microing is a hell of a drug

Healer Balance Changes (#2896)

# About the pull request
This pull request addresses the boring and low-risk gameplay of the
Healer drone, who spends half the round sitting next to recovery nodes
and recovering her health so she may use it again, rinse and repeat
until a rine notices said drone has purple on it and booms her.

First, by changing her health from 600 to 500, Healer can spend more
time healing her sisters than sitting through another 100 health to heal
herself. Though this makes her less tanky than before, healing classes
are not known to be tanks. To ensure Healer can still heal five times
without depleting too much of her health whilst still giving her sisters
a decent amount of heals, I made her ability cost 75 health instead of
100, and also made her ability cost 200 plasma. Since Healer replenishes
plasma much more quickly than her health, she can still put herself into
crit if she heals too frequently. Due to this buff, her heals had a
slight nerf, being 10 damage a second for ten seconds instead of 12
damage per second for ten seconds for a total of 20 less damage healed
per application overall.

In addition to these changes, I'm giving Healer a better plasma transfer
for when she has nobody else to heal/nowhere else to weed and she has an
opportunity to assist her sisters. While a normal drone transfers 50
plasma with a delay of 20, Healer transfers 100 with a delay of 15,
which is nowhere near Hivelord's gargantuan 200 plasma with a delay of
5, but it still is better than a normal drone.

Finally, to give the huggers and larva some love, Healer will
specifically heal little ones 1.5 health per second for 10 seconds for
15 of her own health and 30 plasma.

# Explain why it's good for the game
Healer drone isn't fun. You run around and heal a bunch of T3s, then sit
out for half the battle trying to heal that massive 600 heath while you
wonder why you take so long to heal even though you have Strong
pheromones. You cry to mom for help, but she doesn't have time to heal a
drone who can't build walls and has no need to weed at the moment. You
think, 'screw it, I'm going to make a recovery node and camp here until
I heal', but by the time you finish healing, several T3s and a silly
rouny just suicided into a wall of talls and destroyed your recovery
node, so you run off and make another one. But oh, someone noticed you
have purple on your carapace and decide your location is precisely where
a shell should land, right as you're building one.

No more. These changes allow Healer to move around at her leisure and
makes Healer more engaging by allowing her to be a more front-line
participant and actively run around and heal her sisters without having
to incur such a harsh penalty.

Let this be a testmerge, please.

[MIRROR] Fixes a runtime in simple_animal/hostile [MDB IGNORE] (#20588)

* Fixes a runtime in simple_animal/hostile (#74706)

## About The Pull Request

Attempting to fix this flaky test that has been cropping up from the
Icebox tests. It is annoying.

From what I can tell, the mob was getting qdeleted while it was doing
its loop of finding a target. This can happen at any time, because many
simple mobs (including the one causing the issues) get qdeleted on
death.

Added some more checks to make sure we don't do certain actions if the
mob gets qdeleted midway through execution of its AI routine. It really
could happen anywhere so we must be vigilant.

```
create_and_destroy: [02:24:31] Runtime in stack_trace.dm,4: addtimer called with a callback assigned to a qdeleted object. In the future such timers will not be supported and may refuse to run or run with a 0 wait (code/controllers/subsystem/timer.dm:583)
proc name:  stack trace (/proc/_stack_trace)
src: null
call stack:
stack trace("addtimer called with a callbac...", "code/controllers/subsystem/tim...", 583)
addtimer(/datum/callback (/datum/callback), 300, 8, null, "code/modules/mob/living/simple...", 595)
the demonic watcher (/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/asteroid/ice_demon): GainPatience()
the demonic watcher (/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/asteroid/ice_demon): GiveTarget(the mi-go (/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/netherworld/migo))
the demonic watcher (/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/asteroid/ice_demon): FindTarget(/list (/list))
the demonic watcher (/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/asteroid/ice_demon): AIShouldSleep(/list (/list))
the demonic watcher (/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/asteroid/ice_demon): handle automated action() at stack_trace.dm:4
```

On top of that, there is signal handling in place to LoseTarget() when a
mob that is already a target gets qdel'd and sends
`COMSIG_PARENT_QDELETING`. Shown below.

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/4c48966ff80915ee0b4f796994a0ab6616cab31b/code/modules/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/hostile.dm#L655-L666

However there is nothing stopping a target that is not null but that has
been qdeleted from being considered as a target in the first place.

This PR just aims to fix that problem by making sure that a) a hostile
ai that gets qdeleted midway through does not keep doing stuff that can
cause issues and b) an atom that is being qdeleted never makes its way
into the targets list of a hostile ai.

Simple mobs/AI are due for a wider refactor honestly but this really
ought to be done in the meantime so we don't get spammed by CI failures
over nonsense.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Bugfix, stops the icebox test from failing as much.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: fixes hostile mobs sometimes being able to target an atom that has
been marked for deletion and then becoming confused, and in a similar
vein fixes mobs sometimes still running their AI while being marked for
deletion.

Stops station blueprints from expanding areas of non atmos adjacent turfs. (#74620)

## About The Pull Request
Fixes #74605

the problem starts with `detect_room()` proc. This proc returns turfs
even those with `atmos_adjacent_turfs` = null. This means it returns
turfs that has a wall, airlock, window etc i.e. whatever that stops air
from flowing through it. This coupled together with `create_area()`
causes some wierdness.

Let's take an example
![Screenshot
(154)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110812394/230769831-e84819f2-31b2-4a67-a8bb-5e07e1c5a1cc.png)

Area A is well defined i.e. it has been created via the station
blueprints and is highlighted in green, Area B however is only
theoretical i.e. we haven't created it yet or we are about to create it.
Now you might be thinking Area A is completely walled & sealed off, it
should be physically impossible to expand it unless we broke down one of
it's walls and so since we are standing in Area B it shoudn't even give
me the option to expand area A Right? right? r.i.g.h.t?
![Screenshot
(155)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110812394/230770056-169cbab3-4516-4da7-ae2c-4f40b50be9ba.png)
Well PHFUUK. The area editor completely ignores the laws of physics and
allows me expand Area A anyway. This could cause some real power gaming
shit because if you create an area next to an area having an APC you
could use that area power without even making your own apc by simply
expanding that area(like using someone else's wifi from outside their
house without them even knowing)

#73850 accidently built on top of this as it relied on this to detect
duplicate APC's but the checks became way too strict as it would check
areas of surrounding walls for apc's and throw the conflicting apc
error. You can now build room's next to each other even if they have
fuctioning apc's however you still can't build rooms in space on top of
shuttle walls because that's been the default behaviour for years and
hasn't been touched one bit.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: station blueprints no longer expands & detects areas of non atmos
adjacent turfs.

Refactors Suiciding Variable Into Trait (#74150)

## About The Pull Request

Firstly, this var was on `/mob`, even though only `/mob/living` and
`/mob/dead` could have ever used it, so who knows how much needless
memory it was consuming on stuff such as `oranges_ear` that would never
ever ever use something like this.

Edit: okay instead of memory it just polluted variable edit windows for
all /mob when it didn't need to. I like having a slim VV window

Secondly, it's a technical improvement over the previous system as we
are able to "track" where a suicide originates from, and how we can
track that from mob-to-mob-to-mob. Previously, the boolean `suiciding`
would only inform us if they had ever been connected to a mob that had
ever committed suicide, but now we are able to precisely determine which
mob gave them the trait that they must now apparently bear until the

## Why It's Good For The Game

Less memory usage, more indepth ability to track suicides in case you
really need that dexterity. Currently no implemented code could benefit
from using it, but it would be pretty neat if someone could figure out a
way to have someone be guilt-tripped whenever they look into a mirror
and seeing the reflection of their past life? This PR won't actually
help you code that and it'll probably require a bit more work, but it's
a possibility of some cool interactions you can do when you have this
information available to you.

## Changelog

:cl:
refactor: Some aspects of how we track suicides from your living mob to
your observer have changed- please do let us know if anything has broken
via a GitHub Issue Report.
/:cl:

There's probably some technical improvements that can be made in some
parts of the code I reworked to accommodate this change, do let me know
if you spot any easy ones (or fuckups). a lot of excess comes from the
fact that any step in the TRAIT framework trusts that you are passing in
a valid datum (or subtype) so that's a thing

Wintercoats can now be zipped and unzipped through alt-click and separates the hood sprites from the jacket sprites (#74886)

## About The Pull Request
The title says it all, really.

~~Initially, I was only going to do it for all wintercoats, but then I
figured I might as well bring it down to all of `/hooded`, just so other
suits could benefit from it, since that behavior came from there anyway.
Does that mean that it does nothing for some of them? Yes, it does. Does
that justify having another variable to tell whether or not that should
be possible? In my humble opinion, not really, but I'm not against it if
it's requested.~~

~~That functionality was intentionally removed from the Void Cloak, as
there would be balance implications (since bringing up the hood makes
the whole cloak invisible, which you could skirt by just "zipping" it,
which also makes it invisible.~~

~~The sprites were already there, so this change was very simple to do.
Simply unties the zipped up look from the fact that the hood is up.
However, toggling the hood forces the zipping/unzipping, just so there's
no balance implications involved. It's just simpler that way.~~

So, I ended up going back and changing the sprites so that the hoods
would no longer be baked into the jacket's sprites, so that they could
be done as overlays instead, which ended up solving my problem with
hoods not being there on zipped-up versions.

For now, it's been made on winter coats only, but it shouldn't be that
difficult to bring it back down to the `/hooded` level. I just didn't
want to bother touching up the sprites down there, as it already took me
like 2-3 hours touching up the sprites of the winter coats alone.

I also took the decision to make it so EVA winter coats used the regular
winter coat's sprites, because they had special ones that just looked
like worse versions of the original, without anything special going on
for them. It was just a straight downgrade compared to the base sprite,
in my opinion.

There's still issues with the custom winter coat, in that the hood isn't
made into an overlay for it yet (and that'll require an extra bit of
logic to make it work, too), but it was already an issue before, the
hood is always present on the current version of the custom winter coat.

There's still a handful (sadly, most) of the winter coats that don't
properly reflect on their obj sprites when they're opened versus when
they're closed, but that's due to an initial spriter oversight, and not
to my doing. The open versions were just left as closed on many of them,
and I simply don't have the patience nor the appropriate skills to edit
that many coats that way.

fix: Use commonmark_x spec for Vimwiki2HTML

I've been scratching my head over why Pandoc doesn't respect list
formatting like Markdown-Preview.nvim; finally figured out the reason:
Most tools actually use commonmark to parse Markdown!

I'll stick to best-practices for raw Markdown I share with others (e.g.
project README.md and DOC.md), but for personal notes, Markdown's lists
are nonsensical compared to CommonMark's natural format
(https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#example-266).

For example, here's the same text in Markdown and Commonmark:

=== CommonMark ===

Contact:
- Shit office hours in the early morning
- Zoom calls on Thursdays
- Doesn't use phone
- Prefers email
	- Checks emails slowly on Tuesdays and Thursdays due to classes

Professor:
- Gay
- Self-deprecating humor
- Divorcee(?)

Process Writing:
- Save drafts of everything.
- Feedback may be slow

The CommonMark is readable, groups related information together, and
doesn't waste space. Moreover, its spec is much less ambiguous.

Even More Improvements for Getbib (Including Prior)

I have used and benefited from the "getbib" script and the instructions on LaTeX from Luke for a long time. So, I have put a lot of thought into this script, since I am very interested in academia. Hope you all like this.

Justifications for Improvements

This script stands out as a highly valuable (at least in my opinion) and efficient tool for managing and fetching BibTeX entries for DOIs found in PDF files or provided directly. The robust design and comprehensive functionality make it an indispensable asset for researchers. The main reasons for its superiority are as follows:
- Exceptional time-saving: By automating the process of extracting DOIs and fetching BibTeX entries, the script drastically reduces the manual effort involved in managing citations, thereby saving users an incredible amount of time and energy.
- Outstanding versatility: The script's ability to handle various input types, including directories containing PDF files, single PDF files, and DOIs, sets it apart from other solutions. This adaptability allows users to process numerous scenarios with ease, making it the go-to tool for all their citation needs.
- Unparalleled consistency: The script ensures that DOIs are uniformly processed and normalized, improving the consistency of the entries in the BibTeX file. This feature is crucial for maintaining a clean and professional bibliography that adheres to high academic standards. It inserts an empty line between entries inside the BIB_FILE, as well as, making the author name lower case. It also removes any special characters and the first 2 numbers of the year from the first line. So it is easier to read, maintain and easier to use inside a LaTeX document. Normalizing also helps to check for duplicate entries. It prevents some weird entries escaping from getting caught as a duplicate.
- Remarkable duplicate prevention: The script's built-in functionality to check for duplicate entries before appending them to the BibTeX file demonstrates a keen attention to detail. This feature ensures that the bibliography remains free of redundancies, streamlining the citation management process.
- The use of functions and modular design in the script makes the code highly readable, maintainable, and extendable. This strong foundation allows for seamless adaptation to future changes and requirements.
- Provides users with an exceptional level of automation, versatility, and reliability.
- You can provide the DOI address even in very wrong forms and get a correct output. You can even feed it a website URL such as: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-00968-y and all of the DOI handling is done by a single "sed" command.
- Robust notification system to learn more about the errors or other types of feedback.
- The "curl" output is in red in order to separate the output and the notification better and to improve readability.

Details
BIB_FILE: The path to the BibTeX file where entries will be saved.
CORRECTION_METHOD: A very powerful sed command to extract and correct the DOI from the input even in harsher cases.
get_doi_from_pdf function: Extracts a DOI from the provided PDF file using pdfinfo and pdftotext commands.
If pdfinfo doesn't find a DOI, it uses pdftotext to extract it from the first page of the PDF.
normalize_doi function: Normalizes the DOI by converting it to lowercase.
process_doi function: Fetches the BibTeX entry for the given DOI using the Crossref with a curl command.
Prints the output of the curl command in red using ANSI escape codes.
Checks if the fetched BibTeX entry is valid and not empty.
If the fetched BibTeX entry is not in the BIB_FILE, it appends the entry to the file.
The script processes input arguments, which can be a directory, a PDF file, or a DOI:
    a) If it's a directory, the script processes all PDF files in the directory.
    b) If it's a PDF file, the script processes the single PDF file.
    c) If it's a DOI, the script processes the DOI directly.

More details on the correction method (sed command), from my prior pull request
Very Detailed Explanation (I realized that escaped backslashes do not appear. There is a backslash if you see nothing.)
(For people who wonder about it, or try to learn. It could take a tremendous amount of time to learn all of it without explanation, so it would be better to explain):

sed The sed command is a stream editor that can be used to perform basic text transformations on an input file or from a pipeline. You can see Luke uses it a lot in his videos. It can also modify files' content if you want for other purposes. That function is used a lot for bootstrapping scripts for changing config files automatically if necessary.

-n This option tells sed not to print lines by default. We'll only print lines when we specify the p command in the script.

-E This option enables the use of extended regular expressions, which allows for more readable and flexible regex patterns.

's/ This starts the sed script and defines the s command (substitute). It is used to find a regex pattern in the input and replace it with a specified string.

.* This regex pattern matches any character (except a newline) zero or more times. In this case, it matches all characters before "doi" or "DOI".

( This paranthesis opens a capturing group, which allows us to refer back to the matched text later in the script.

(DOI|doi) This regex pattern matches either "DOI" or "doi". The | symbol is used as an OR operator in regular expressions.

( This next paranthesis opens another capturing group.

(.(org))? This regex pattern matches an optional ".org". The . is an escaped period, and (org) matches the string "org". The ? following the group makes it optional. Escaping is needed for most of non-alphanumeric characters. You can test and practice them on vim, trying to use the "substitute" function to change some text.

/? This regex pattern matches an optional "/", with the ? making it optional. The prior backslash is for escaping. Again, some characters need to be escaped to be able to used in commands. Escaped means they have ** before them. Spaces may be the most escaped characters.

| This symbol, later, also acts as an OR operator, indicating that the pattern before or after it can be matched.

**:? *** This regex pattern matches an optional colon (":") followed by zero or more spaces. The ? makes the colon optional, and ***** matches zero or more spaces.

) This closes the capturing group started earlier.

) This closes the outer capturing group.

([^: ]+[^ .]) This regex pattern matches any character except colons and spaces one or more times ([^: ]+) Plus symbol here shows one or more times. If it is a star then it means zero or more times. It is then followed by a single alphanumeric character ([^ .]) Single because there are no plus or star symbol next to it. This part as a whole ensures that the last character of the matched text is alphanumeric.

.* This regex pattern matches any character (except a newline) zero or more times. In this case, it matches all remaining characters in the input line.

/ This delimiter separates the regex pattern from the replacement string in the s command. s command needs a separator that is a forward slash.

doi:\6 This is the replacement string. The text "doi:" is followed by the 6th captured group from the regex pattern, which contains the characters after "doi" or "DOI" and the colon, "/", or space(s).

/p This delimiter separates the replacement string from the p command, which tells sed to print the modified line if a substitution has been made. The substitution mentioned here is the change of ".org/" to ":". This helps turning URLs into doi addresses.

; This separates different commands within the sed script.

T This command branches to the end of the script if no substitution was made since the last input line was read or conditional branch was taken. In this case, it ensures that the q command is only executed if a matching line has been found and a substitution was made. This is one of the most important parts to get the doi address from the urls such as "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-00968-5". Because we don't always have URLs for doi addresses. In this way, this function only works when we work with URLs. So in this case it helps changing .org/ with : This makes the part of the doi address as this: "doi:" rather than this: "doi.org/".

q This command tells sed to quit processing after the first match, ensuring that only the first matching line in the file is processed. Otherwise, we would get all doi addresses in a scientific study because there are lots of doi addresses in them.

' This closes the other '

TL;DR:
Basically this whole command ensures that the output we get starts with "doi:", then it can have every type of character in it except spaces and ".org/" , then it will end with an alphanumeric character [A-Z, a-z or 0-9]. That ensures removing the trailing dots from some doi addresses that have them.

fix/fix: Just use an ext. instead of changing spec

As it turns out, other people already experienced my same frustration
over Markdown's nonsense lists and it was just a built-in extension I
could enable.

As much as I like the idea of CommonMark for its unambiguous spec, it
suffers from one killer feature that I naively thought I could solve in
ten minutes: Lack of support for whitespaces in links.

Some alternative solutions (for if you *really* want CommonMark +
Vimwiki):
- Hack together a Lua filter for Pandoc to replace " " with "%20"
- Revive the stale PR to add angle bracket escaping to Vimwiki

However, I just wanted better lists, so I'm just gonna stick to the
extension.

feat: unify error responses (#3607)

This PR implements the first version of a suggested unification (and
documentation) of the errors that we return from the API today.

The goal is for this to be the first step towards the error type defined
in this internal [linear
task](https://linear.app/unleash/issue/1-629/define-the-error-type
'Define the new API error type').

## The state of things today

As things stand, we currently have no (or **very** little) documentation
of the errors that are returned from the API. We mention error codes,
but never what the errors may contain.

Second, there is no specified format for errors, so what they return is
arbitrary, and based on ... Who knows? As a result, we have multiple
different errors returned by the API depending on what operation you're
trying to do. What's more, with OpenAPI validation in the mix, it's
absolutely possible for you to get two completely different error
objects for operations to the same endpoint.

Third, the errors we do return are usually pretty vague and don't really
provide any real help to the user. "You don't have the right
permissions". Great. Well what permissions do I need? And how would I
know? "BadDataError". Sick. Why is it bad?

... You get it.

## What we want to achieve

The ultimate goal is for error messages to serve both humans and
machines. When the user provides bad data, we should tell them what
parts of the data are bad and what they can do to fix it. When they
don't have the right permissions, we should tell them what permissions
they need.

Additionally, it would be nice if we could provide an ID for each error
instance, so that you (or an admin) can look through the logs and locate
he incident.

## What's included in **this** PR?

This PR does not aim to implement everything above. It's not intended to
magically fix everything. Its goal is to implement the necessary
**breaking** changes, so that they can be included in v5. Changing error
messages is a slightly grayer area than changing APIs directly, but
changing the format is definitely something I'd consider breaking.

So this PR:

- defines a minimal version of the error type defined in the [API error
definition linear
task](https://linear.app/unleash/issue/1-629/define-the-error-type).
- aims to catch all errors we return today and wrap them in the error
type
-   updates tests to match the new expectations.

An important point: because we are cutting v5 very soon and because work
for this wasn't started until last week, the code here isn't necessarily
very polished. But it doesn't need to be. The internals can be as messy
as we want, as long as the API surface is stable.

That said, I'm very open to feedback about design and code completeness,
etc, but this has intentionally been done quickly.

Please also see my inline comments on the changes for more specific
details.

### Proposed follow-ups

As mentioned, this is the first step to implementing the error type. The
public API error type only exposes `id`, `name`, and `message`. This is
barely any more than most of the previous messages, but they are now all
using the same format. Any additional properties, such as `suggestion`,
`help`, `documentationLink` etc can be added as features without
breaking the current format. This is an intentional limitation of this
PR.

Regarding additional properties: there are some error responses that
must contain extra properties. Some of these are documented in the types
of the new error constructor, but not all. This includes `path` and
`type` properties on 401 errors, `details` on validation errors, and
more.

Also, because it was put together quickly, I don't yet know exactly how
we (as developers) would **prefer** to use these new error messages
within the code, so the internal API (the new type, name, etc), is just
a suggestion. This can evolve naturally over time if (based on feedback
and experience) without changing the public API.

## Returning multiple errors

Most of the time when we return errors today, we only return a single
error (even if many things are wrong). AJV, the OpenAPI integration we
use does have a setting that allows it to return all errors in a request
instead of a single one. I suggest we turn that on, but that we do it in
a separate PR (because it updates a number of other snapshots).

When returning errors that point to `details`, the objects in the
`details` now contain a new `description` property. This "deprecates"
the `message` property. Due to our general deprecation policy, this
should be kept around for another full major and can be removed in v6.

```json
{
  "name": "BadDataError",
  "message": "Something went wrong. Check the `details` property for more information."
  "details": [{
    "message": "The .params property must be an object. You provided an array.",
    "description": "The .params property must be an object. You provided an array.",
  }]
}
```

Fixes #73985
Kidnapping was looping through mob contents to find items to remove from
you, rather than equipped items. It was then forcemoving them out of
you, destroying the functionality of implants and nodrop items.

Being kidnapped will now only remove equipped items from you (not
everything inside you) and will not forcemove nodrop items out of your
inventory (so it won't confiscate your chaplain armblade).
Additionally, anything you picked up in the kidnapping area was being
sent to nullspace on exit, I changed this to have them drop on the
ground instead.

However, due to this long-standing convention we now have an expectation
that items are not trivially moved in or our of the kidnapping area, so
it also loops through any storage implants you may have and dumps their
contents too.
There are still ways around this (cavity implantation, for instance) but
they seem uncommon and restrictive enough that they're probably not a
big deal.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Kidnapping another traitor destroying their implants was an annoying and
unpleasant experience (especially if it was their uplink implant), and
does not seem to have been intended.
Also removes weird behaviour where your arm blade might fall off because
you got kidnapped.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Implants and items which you cannot drop will no longer be forced
out of your character when you are kidnapped.
fix: Objects you try to take back from the kidnapping location as
souvenirs will drop to the ground when you leave instead of being
destroyed, except shirts and shoes (make sure to pick up your
monographed synidcate T-shirt).

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].

Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

refreshes syndi-kits and syndicate surplus crates, introduces shared limited stock (#71869)

## About The Pull Request

After all, the Syndicate loves a good throwback.


![C6O47fPhAB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/207737104-3d24574f-02e0-433d-8ea7-6825ca4cb970.png)

This PR does a few things with the goal of reimplementing and
revitalizing syndicate traitor kits and the syndicate surplus crate.
Of note is that I have added in a way for limited stock items to share
their limited stock.

Following maintainer guidance the syndicate traitor kits have increased
in price and as a result some of the lower value ones have been
adjusted. I've given all active bundles current TC costs per item
knowing full well they will be inaccurate eventually.

<details>
  <summary>Changes as a result of my audit of syndikits</summary>
    
### UNCHANGED
Recon, Spai, Stealthy, Screwed, Sniper, Nukie Meta, Implants
Mad Scientist, Bees

Lord Singuloth is also unchanged and disabled, I think that it should
turn into a new supermatter themed kit maybe. outside of current scope.

### Gun Kit
Replaced emag with doorjack and gave it a chameleon holster, literally
moved 1 tc elsewhere

### Murderer
replaced emag again, no additions its a lot of tc and Just Good

### Hacker
added doorjack, otherwise unchanged

### Sabotage
no changes other than adding in extra bombs it didnt have

### James Bond
gave him some gadgets with the freedom implant, emp flashlight, and one
x4. also a cyanide pill and deck of cards for fun

### Ninja
Added in miner Jump Boots, smoke spell, and doorjack. dont just want it
to be space ninja

### Dark Lord
Added in new lightning bolt spell granter and made the desword default
to red. probably overbudget.

### White Whale
dehydrated carp added so you can ride it alongside the ones you grenade
out. hard to imagine changing this

### Mr Freeze
changed temperature gun to be cryo only so that i could give him the
cryo thermal pistol. cold attacks only.

### 2006 Traitor
doorjack.

</details> 

tl;dr theyre all about 30 tc worth of shit more or less some are more
but thats what rarity should be for
you can only buy from one type of syndicrate per round


![QOF1WO7CC6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/207739417-00ae6b81-b6aa-4774-a4bb-f2d880988ff4.gif)

Next up is the return of the surplus crate. 
Crate is generated, gives you gear **based on your progression at the
time of buying the crate**, you can use it all at the start and get some
chameleon kits and not a lot of dangerous weapons or wait till later.
I've changed the weight on some items here and there and given weight to
role and species locked items, though I will admit that latter is
unimportant because I set moth lanterns to be unable to appear in these
two crates.


![dreamseeker_t8abXysKqK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/206761978-96e2a51e-f9a5-48e4-a863-a9198fa15ea2.gif)

But who cares about that your eyes instantly went to the United Surplus
Crate and the United Surplus Key lets be honest.

The united surplus crate is 80 TC worth of uplink items relative to your
current progression when you purchase it and gives you a locked box. It
**will explode if you try to break it** so be careful with it. It gives
you 80 TC and costs 20 TC because it is impossible to open without key.
The rub of course is that the Syndicate forbids agents from buying more
than one surplus item of any kind, you need to find another traitor and
make them buy you a key to open your box. Or I guess you can share the
box?


![dreamseeker_ts0AZeiyfy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/207740388-3f688bba-5d71-48d2-8079-671bbed7e54e.gif)

Regardless, if the crate is opened with any other means it doesn't spawn
its contents, you need 2 traitor uplinks.
Both of these items have a 30 minute timer because you don't want a
crate that has 5 emp flashlights in it. You at least want one energy
sword.

I did a lot of code shit and changed various things to be proc based to
allow for more editing and interjection of things, as I wrote in code
comments making a crate thats locked to a specific set of progression
just means changing the proc that generates a list of valid uplink items
to check items' progression values to a specified value instead of your
characters progression.

Ok I think that goes over everything more or less????

## Why It's Good For The Game

I've heard that people liked these and I think they are quite fun, being
able to go from "i dunno what to do as a traitor" to "ah, of course, I
will become the Bombler" is a fun thing to be able to have, and people
like to get a bunch of random shit in the mail. Some of it even feels
free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Brain points go up!!!

The division of procs allows for more creativity with this system than
existed before as well as other possibilities for interacting with the
uplink handler in funny ways.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: the syndicate is once again distributing syndi-kits, some now with
new technology
add: a fresh batch of syndicate surplus crates have been sent out,
though they seem a bit lighter than before
add: in an effort to encourage cooperation, a traitor can now purchase
either the new United Surplus Syndicate Crate or its key, but not both
add: lightning bolt book granter for wizard event and one syndie-kit
bundle
add: temperature gun that only makes things colder for one syndie-kit
bundle
code: it is now possible to have uplink items share limited stock
bal: role-restricted items no longer can be delivered by the stray
syndicate drop pod event

Gatfruit will no longer drop from ice portals. (#72048)

## About The Pull Request

For some god-forsaken reason, somebody decided that ice portals should
be able to drop one of the most disruptive items in the game. This PR
amends this by removing it from the drop pool.

## Why It's Good For The Game

In 2013 gatfruit was introduced in the following PR #2000 . This was
almost a decade ago at this point, repeatedly through the PR the creator
states his belief that this item should only ever be obtainable through
admin intervention due to its ridiculous capabilities. At the time
everyone in the PR agreed it was a reasonable item to add **as it was
unobtainable without admin intervention**. Over the years, it has crept
its way to become more prevalent and openly obtainable, the most
offensive of these options is the ice moon portal. As is, there is a 1
in 28 chance of obtaining the seeds, this sounds pretty inoffensive
right? That's just 3.44% probability. Now, let us search the instances
of the portal that spawns this.

That is a big number, a lot of chances to get that seed packet and other
gamer looters. Now, let's take a look at the probability of being able
to get these seeds, assuming you wipe out all of the portals.

92.8% chance to be able to get these seeds each shift if you focus
entirely on gaming the portals. That's a pretty insane probability of
being able to obtain the gatfruit seeds.

While I dislike people who sprint to the seed vault, there is at least
the possibility of a pod person telling them to fuck off when they
demand their _free_ gamer seed. There is also the fact that the ruin
isn't a guaranteed spawn every shift.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Gatfruit seeds will no longer drop from ice portals.

*hand, or That /One/ Emote You Always Felt Was Missing (#71600)

## About The Pull Request
It's happened to me _repeatedly_ that I'd see someone down on the floor,
and wanted to just, give them a hand, so they could take it and get up
that way, without just, directly clicking on them, since that's a little
bland. I've also wanted to just, offer my hand to someone so they could
grab it, so that I could pull them alongside me, rather than just
targeting one of their arms and ctrl-clicking them.

I've had this idea for a _long_ time, and only just decided to do this
today.

Now, I know what you might say. "Golden, that's a lot of code for
something this simple!" You're not wrong. _However_. I decided to go
along and to give some more love to the `/datum/status_effect/offering`
status effect and the offering-related alerts, to make them a lot more
versatile and a lot less hardcoded. Hence the whole "refactoring" part
of this.

Of course, when I add something, I don't do it half-way. So, the way the
emote works is much like the `*slap` emote, except that:

- When you click on someone, it does the exact same as if you were
offering the item to them, except that it's targeted (much like
ctrl-shift-click).
- If there's nobody directly adjacent to you, it won't do anything.
- If there's at least one person lying down around you, you will offer
them your help to get up. Should they take your hand and let you help
them up, you will both receive a simple memory about being helped up (or
helping up), as well as a 45-seconds-long small mood buff, because it
feels nice to be on either end of such a friendly gesture. If they get
up, they automatically get disqualified from being offered some help
standing up, and likewise, if you lie down, that offer goes away as
well.
- If there's at least one person around you, you will instead extend
your hand in their direction, for them to grab onto it. Should they do
so, you will then grab them by their arms and pull them.

I reworked the offering status effect to no longer have a hardcoded
`can_hold_items()` check, so that kisses and the hand offering would no
longer need you to have free hands to complete. The logic here is that
you can still pull someone even with both hands filled, so I figured I'd
leave it this way.

Note: If anyone would like to give the item a better sprite, by all
means, go ahead, that'd be amazing. I'm just not really a great spriter
and couldn't be bothered to waste hours making a very _meh_ hand.

## Why It's Good For The Game
It's fluff, and nice fluff at that. It makes it easier for people to be
nice to one-another without having to necessarily spend so long writing
up an emote that the person on the floor will already have gotten back
up. I'm sure the MRP folks will like it, and I'm certain the HRP
downstreams will love it too ;)

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Added the *hand emote, which you can offer to someone standing up
in order to give them the possibility to grab onto your hand and let you
drag them away, or to someone lying down to help them back up, which
always makes everyone involved a little happier!
refactor: De-hardcoded and genericized a lot of the offering status
effect and alert code, to make it require a lot less copy-paste to
handle new cases.
fix: Offering a kiss no longer requires the receiver to have free hands
to accept said kiss!

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

Adds the Pillbottle-Class Locust Carrier, a ship that hauls around 8
Pills. It is intended as an adminspawn ship mainly for stresstesting
subshuttles (and being asked for). It's fairly resource starved, and has
frankly terrible engines. The expectation is that it will utilize its 8
pods to gather resources and return to the mothership. Or fly off and
die horribly. It has slots for 10 prisoners (that's like 3 pills and one
third of a 4th).
This pr also edits the pill, blackpill, and superpill to be subshuttles
(compatible with the subshuttle system) by cutting out most of their
equipment, converting their maps to shuttle datums, and giving them
docking ports.

Add emotional intelligence evaluation (#589)

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Emotional Intelligence

### Eval description
Evaluates GPT's ability to understand and manage emotional situations
using modified versions of the well-validated, public (i.e.
license-unrestricted) tests first developed by MacCann & Roberts (2008).
Items have actually here been aggregated across three different scales--
the STEU and STEM adult measures, along with a dozen questions from the
youth measure.

Keep in mind that there is not expectation that AI models like GPT-4
should be able to process emotions, so applying any emotional
intelligence test to them should be taken with a grain of salt. These
tests can only measure the AI's ability to understand and analyze
emotional information, not the AI's emotional intelligence in the human
sense.

### What makes this a useful eval?
This eval is useful because it assesses the AI model's ability to
navigate complex or ambiguous emotional situations, which is an
important aspect of human-like communication and problem-solving. By
evaluating the model's performance in this unique domain, we can
identify areas for improvement and better understand its limitations
when it comes to handling emotional contexts. This is particularly
important when considering AI applications that involve interactions
with humans, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and customer support
systems. A better understanding of emotional intelligence can
potentially lead to more natural and effective interactions between AI
models and their users.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This Emotional Intelligence eval provides a unique value because by
testing GPT's capacity to understand and manage emotions, we can gain
insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in a more
human-centric context. Relatedly, this eval also emphasizes the
importance of empathy and emotional understanding in AI systems that are
designed to interact with humans. By evaluating GPT's performance in
this way, we can contribute to the ongoing development of AI models that
are more attuned to human emotions and can provide better support in
emotionally charged situations, such as mental health counseling, crisis
management, and conflict resolution. Moreover, this Emotional
Intelligence eval can serve as a foundation for further research and
development in the field of AI and emotional understanding, paving the
way for more sophisticated AI models capable of handling complex human
emotions and fostering more effective communication.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval
(data is publicly available on OSF, and does not have usage
restrictions)

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

**_I already have access to the 8k GPT-4 API, but I am kindly requesting
access to the 32k as soon as it becomes available._**

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Performance:
GPT-4: accuracy=0.48

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Heart Disease Prediction (#538)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Heart Disease Prediction

### Eval description

This eval tests the models ability to correctly predict the probability
of a patient to have heart disease. The dataset is constructed from the
[Heart Failure Prediction
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
on Kaggle. The data includes the patient's age, sex, and a number of
medical signals relevant to the diagnosis of heart disease.

The data is provided under the Open Database License (ODbL). 

```
fedesoriano. (September 2021). Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. Retrieved [Mar 31, 2023] from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction.
```

### What makes this a useful eval?

This assesses the model's ability to correctly predict adverse medical
events. Correctly predicting heart disease shows the model's capability
for a strong understanding of medicine. The GPT-3.5-turbo models
currently receives an accuracy of 0.778.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

As far as I can tell, this is the only eval so far related to making
medical diagnoses. To make sure it was a high quality eval, I tried to
find a dataset with a lot of observations and created by doctors with
the relevant expertise.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
finance

### Eval description

Asks the model to calculate how much interest would be owed on a credit
card by a certain date, if a payment was made once but debt remains on
the card.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Finance is likely to be one of the biggest opportunities for LLMs to be
useful, because financial education is incredibly poor globally and the
impact of a mistake in financial calculations is severe. This eval tests
the models ability to combine math with its understanding of a topic
(finance). We plan to use this type of math at
[Dollarwise](https://www.dollarwise.ca) frequently going forward,
including integration into your comparison products. However, for this
to work reliably it's important that the model here can natively
understand financial concepts and apply math to them.

Add SVG understanding eval (#786)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
`svg_understanding`

### Eval description

The model is provided with the contents of an SVG path (anywhere from
~1000 to ~8000 characters) of a simple object (eg `frog`, `banana`) and
is asked to provide the label.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a test of visual understanding and mental modeling. A motivated
human could succeed on these evals with enough time and a piece of graph
paper: in theory, a sufficiently advanced LLM could have the in-context
capacity to do this on the fly.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This uniquely tests the ability to incrementally build visual models:
eg, the ability of the LLM to both "draw" and visualize that "drawing".

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

I18NMessageTest needs to reset I18NBundle static state. (#7101)

* Mark PauseableThread as excluded on GWT.

* Minor typo corrections.

* Fix atan2() when it should produce 0f.

Without this small change (which has essentially no performance impact that I could measure), calling atan2() with a point on the x-axis would produce a small but non-zero result, which is incorrect.

* Add atan, atan2, asin, acos for degrees.

This also includes atan2Deg360(), which in my opinion is the most useful of these because it does something differently from Math.atan2(), and can often save some effort.

* Approximations for tan() and tanDeg().

Sorry this is so long-winded, but the error isn't as straightforward to express as with sin() or cos().

* Apply formatter

* Add to MathUtilsTest.

* Apply formatter

* Stop trying to load defaults from wrong dir.

This old behavior broke Flame's effect-open dialog when any particle effect used the default billlboard or model particle. Now Flame tries to load a file given its absolute path (like before), but if it fails, it falls back to trying the default filenames as internal files.

* I18NMessageTest needs to reset I18NBundle state.

If you run I18NSimpleMessageTest and then I18NMessageTest without this PR, then the first test will have called I18NBundle.setSimpleFormatter(true), but the second test needs it to be set to false.

Because the tests are still perfectly usable if you run them on their own (or use LWJGL2, I think, because it might not share static state), this is not at all a priority to merge; it just makes running many tests in one session not throw an Exception.

Botany Balance Pass (#1783)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
First came the content, now comes the hammer.

- Nukes Megaseed servitors from orbit. 
- Plants now age much, much slower and produce half as quickly.
Ruins that had them now have a ruined seed vendor that can be salvaged
for random seeds(and danger).
Ships that had one now have a crate with some thematic starting seeds,
and a Strange Seed.
Ghostrole Ruins that relied on having all seeds locally now have a
special biogenerator variant that can print a random seed for biomass.

- Adds Genesis Serum. This can be splashed on a tile to make natural
grass and some flora. Green your ship!
Genesis Serum was made a while ago, on request for a way to add natural
grass and flora to your ship. Since I had it lying around fully coded, I
thought I might as well pr it with botany changes.

- Gatfruit found in the seed vault have been replaced with Strange
Seeds.

- The chance to get Gatfruit from a demonic portal(plant variety) has
dropped from 15% to 5%.

- Corpse flowers now have liquid gibs and formaldehyde again. 

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Okay, hear me out

With this and Gardens, botany ships go from a "sit in your vessel for 2
hours" experience to an "explore and forage" one that better fits our
feature arc. It goes without saying that this **shouldn't be merged till
Overmap 4.2 is**, since it facilitates getting seeds from planets as
part of exploration.

Gatfruit are funny, but it takes exactly one seed getting into the hands
of a ship with a dna manipulator and the weapon balance is eradicated
from the game completely(for the round, at least.)
This is more problematic here then it was on TG, since our rounds tend
to be 5 hours long rather then 1.
This has been long coming. I'll reverse this if we ever get that
Plantlock variant we wanted a while ago.

Corpse flowers even have formaldehyde and gibs on tg, not sure what
happened there.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl: 
add: Ruined megaseed servitors can now be found on the frontier,
carrying a bounty of seeds for intrepid adventurers.
balance: the time it takes for plants to reach a lethal age has been
increased massively.
balance: Plant production time increased a bit to compensate.
balance: megaseed servitors have been removed from ships and ruins.
Ships that carried one now have a crate with some starting seeds.
balance: removes gatfruit from the seed vault pool.
balance: reduces the chance of getting gatfruit from a plant-themed
demonic portal significantly.
balance: corpse flowers once again have formaldehyde and liquid gibs.
add: Adds Genesis Serum, a reagent that transforms tiles into natural
grass on splash, then causes some natural flora objects to grow. Turn
your ship green!

Allow kernel squashfs / extfs mount to be disabled in singularity.conf (release-3.11)

In singularity.conf, add two directives `allow kernel squashfs` and
`allow kernel extfs` which default to 'yes'. When set to 'no', these
directives prevent a squashfs mount or extfs mount from being
performed through the kernel. Note that this only happens in setuid
mode / as root.

squashfs and extfs mounts are added from the various locations that
handle loopback mounting of a filesystem image. The image could be a
container rootfs, an overlay, or an image bind. In each case the image
may be a standalone file or embedded in a SIF.

The simplest place to gate these mounts is in mount.AddImage, via the
existing check that the fs type is authorized as the source for an
image mount.

Authorized filesystems for image mounts are held in a package var. At
the start of container creation we now explicitly authorize squashfs
and extfs, unless disabled by singularity.conf.

Relying on a package scope variable isn't ideal. We have multiple
processes at container creation, so the authorization must be
performed in the right place. e2e tests have been added to verify
overlay, image bind, and container rootfs image flows.

Gating the filesystems earlier in the `PrepareConfig` portion of the
runtime is, in my opinion, more liable to errors as the checks would
have to be replicated in the multiple places that images are handled.

Ideally the mount.System could perhaps hold the list of allowed /
disallowed filesystems, that could be set when it is created. However,
this would require a large amount of refactoring to complex and
critical code.

kmod: add init function to usermodehelper

About 6 months ago, I made a set of changes to how the core-dump-to-a-pipe
feature in the kernel works.  We had reports of several races, including
some reports of apps bypassing our recursion check so that a process that
was forked as part of a core_pattern setup could infinitely crash and
refork until the system crashed.

We fixed those by improving our recursion checks.  The new check basically
refuses to fork a process if its core limit is zero, which works well.

Unfortunately, I've been getting grief from maintainer of user space
programs that are inserted as the forked process of core_pattern.  They
contend that in order for their programs (such as abrt and apport) to
work, all the running processes in a system must have their core limits
set to a non-zero value, to which I say 'yes'.  I did this by design, and
think thats the right way to do things.

But I've been asked to ease this burden on user space enough times that I
thought I would take a look at it.  The first suggestion was to make the
recursion check fail on a non-zero 'special' number, like one.  That way
the core collector process could set its core size ulimit to 1, and enable
the kernel's recursion detection.  This isn't a bad idea on the surface,
but I don't like it since its opt-in, in that if a program like abrt or
apport has a bug and fails to set such a core limit, we're left with a
recursively crashing system again.

So I've come up with this.  What I've done is modify the
call_usermodehelper api such that an extra parameter is added, a function
pointer which will be called by the user helper task, after it forks, but
before it exec's the required process.  This will give the caller the
opportunity to get a call back in the processes context, allowing it to do
whatever it needs to to the process in the kernel prior to exec-ing the
user space code.  In the case of do_coredump, this callback is ues to set
the core ulimit of the helper process to 1.  This elimnates the opt-in
problem that I had above, as it allows the ulimit for core sizes to be set
to the value of 1, which is what the recursion check looks for in
do_coredump.

This patch:

Create new function call_usermodehelper_fns() and allow it to assign both
an init and cleanup function, as we'll as arbitrary data.

The init function is called from the context of the forked process and
allows for customization of the helper process prior to calling exec.  Its
return code gates the continuation of the process, or causes its exit.
Also add an arbitrary data pointer to the subprocess_info struct allowing
for data to be passed from the caller to the new process, and the
subsequent cleanup process

Also, use this patch to cleanup the cleanup function.  It currently takes
an argp and envp pointer for freeing, which is ugly.  Lets instead just
make the subprocess_info structure public, and pass that to the cleanup
and init routines

powerpc/pci: Add ppc_md.discover_phbs()

[ Upstream commit 5537fcb319d016ce387f818dd774179bc03217f5 ]

On many powerpc platforms the discovery and initalisation of
pci_controllers (PHBs) happens inside of setup_arch(). This is very early
in boot (pre-initcalls) and means that we're initialising the PHB long
before many basic kernel services (slab allocator, debugfs, a real ioremap)
are available.

On PowerNV this causes an additional problem since we map the PHB registers
with ioremap(). As of commit d538aadc2718 ("powerpc/ioremap: warn on early
use of ioremap()") a warning is printed because we're using the "incorrect"
API to setup and MMIO mapping in searly boot. The kernel does provide
early_ioremap(), but that is not intended to create long-lived MMIO
mappings and a seperate warning is printed by generic code if
early_ioremap() mappings are "leaked."

This is all fixable with dumb hacks like using early_ioremap() to setup
the initial mapping then replacing it with a real ioremap later on in
boot, but it does raise the question: Why the hell are we setting up the
PHB's this early in boot?

The old and wise claim it's due to "hysterical rasins." Aside from amused
grapes there doesn't appear to be any real reason to maintain the current
behaviour. Already most of the newer embedded platforms perform PHB
discovery in an arch_initcall and between the end of setup_arch() and the
start of initcalls none of the generic kernel code does anything PCI
related. On powerpc scanning PHBs occurs in a subsys_initcall so it should
be possible to move the PHB discovery to a core, postcore or arch initcall.

This patch adds the ppc_md.discover_phbs hook and a core_initcall stub that
calls it. The core_initcalls are the earliest to be called so this will
any possibly issues with dependency between initcalls. This isn't just an
academic issue either since on pseries and PowerNV EEH init occurs in an
arch_initcall and depends on the pci_controllers being available, similarly
the creation of pci_dns occurs at core_initcall_sync (i.e. between core and
postcore initcalls). These problems need to be addressed seperately.

Fix low priority issues (#7413)

Thanks @svetkereMS for bringing this up, driving, and testing.

This fixes two interconnected issues.
First, if a process starts at normal priority then changes to low priority, it stays at normal priority. That's good for Visual Studio, which should stay at normal priority, but we relied on passing priority from a parent process to children, which is no longer valid. This ensures that we set the priority of a process early enough that we get the desired priority in worker nodes as well.

Second, if we were already connected to normal priority worker nodes, we could keep using them. This "shuts down" (disconnects—they may keep running if nodeReuse is true) worker nodes when the priority changes between build submissions.

One non-issue (therefore not fixed) is connecting to task hosts that are low priority. Tasks host nodes currently do not store their priority or node reuse. Node reuse makes sense because it's automatically off always for task hosts, at least currently. Not storing low priority sounds problematic, but it's actually fine because we make a task host—the right priority for this build, since we just made it—and connect to it. If we make a new build with different priority, we disconnect from all nodes, including task hosts. Since nodeReuse is always false, the task host dies, and we cannot reconnect to it even though if it didn't immediately die, we could, erroneously.

On the other hand, we went a little further and didn't even specify that task hosts should take the priority assigned to them as a command line argument. That has been changed.

svetkereMS had a chance to test some of this. He raised a couple potential issues:

conhost.exe launches as normal priority. Maybe some custom task dlls or other (Mef?) extensions will do something between MSBuild start time and when its priority is adjusted.
Some vulnerability if MSBuild init code improperly accounts for timing
For (1), how is conhost.exe related to MSBuild? It sounds like a command prompt thing. I don't know what Mef is.
For (2), what vulnerability? Too many processes starting and connecting to task hosts with different priorities simultaneously? I could imagine that being a problem but don't think it's worth worrying about unless someone complains.

He also mentioned a potential optimization if the main node stays at normal priority. Rather than making a new set of nodes, the main node could change the priority of all its nodes to the desired priority. Then it can skip the handshake, and if it's still at normal priority, it may be able to both raise and lower the priority of its children. Since there would never be more than 2x the "right" number of nodes anyway, and I don't think people will be switching rapidly back and forth, I think maybe we should file that as an issue in the backlog and get to it if we have time but not worry about it right now.

Edit:
I changed "shuts down...worker nodes when the priority changes" to just changing their priority. This does not work on linux or mac. However, Visual Studio does not run on linux or mac, and VS is the only currently known customer that runs in normal priority but may change between using worker nodes at normal priority or low priority. This approach is substantially more efficient than starting new nodes for every switch, disconnecting and reconnecting, or even maintaining two separate pools for different builds.

[MIRROR] Config Flag to Save Generated Spritesheets to Logs [MDB IGNORE] (#20738)

* Config Flag to Save Generated Spritesheets to Logs (#74884)

## About The Pull Request

I was helping someone debug some weird bug with spritesheets a bit ago,
and I didn't like having to manually comment out all of the `fdel()`
stuff in order to help visualize what the potential issue might have
been with the spritesheets on either their DM-side generation or their
TGUI-level display. I decided to add a compile-time level flag that will
automatically copy over any generated spritesheet assets (css and pngs)
to the round-specific `data/logs` folder for analysis when a developer
should need it.

I also had to switch around some vars and make a few new ones to reduce
how copy-pasta it might get and ensure standardization/readability while
also being 0.001 times faster since we benefit from the string cache
(unprovable fact).
## Why It's Good For The Game

It's incredibly useful to see the actual flattened spritesheet itself
sometimes when you're doing this type of work and you keep getting odd
bugs here and there. Also saves headache from having to clear out the
temp `/data/spritesheets` folder every time you comment shit out, as
well as having an effective paper trail for A/B testing whatever
bullshit you've got going on.

New Agda syntax highlighting extension for VSCode (#562)

I've written an improved Agda syntax-highlighting extension for VSCode
called _agda-syntax_
([GitHub](https://github.com/fredrik-bakke/agda-syntax-vscode), [VSCode
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FredrikBakke.agda-syntax)).
Although it is still in preview, my opinion is that it is already a
significant improvement over the previously used extension. Therefore, I
propose that we migrate our development environment (for VSCode users)
to use this new extension.

### Some highlights of the extension
Compared to the previously used extension, this new extension
- injects into markdown syntax, so that the markdown code can be
highlighted as markdown code as well
- highlights all variable declarations (with some bugs still), module
names, wildcard symbols, all reserved keywords (and only recognizes
reserved keywords as reserved keywords)
- Recognizes the appropriate token-boundaries
- Highlights line comments properly

Please understand that the grammar framework that has to be used to
write the extension is highly limited, so not all highlighting
functionality can be implemented. For instance, the parsing must be done
in a single pass, and the functionality to match over multiple lines is
very limited. Hence, for example, matching the left-hand side of an
equals sign is very gnarly (although I have one idea left to try with
regard to this).

Still, I would greatly appreciate any feedback, either if it is a bug or
a feature request, which is another reason why I want to introduce it
into our defined development environment at this point.

If you want to try out the extension right now, follow the VSCode
Marketplace link:

.emacs: ace-window: initial dispatch actions

Haven't wanted most of the default dispatch
actions yet, plus there's decent odds of me
tripping over some of them on accident in
frustrating ways.

The only action I actually want is going back to
the previously focused window (called "flip" in
ace-window, I guess because it's an ergonomic way
for flipping between two windows repeatedly), and
I'm moving that to "o" for maximum accessibility
and speed (starting from my current " o" binding).

I've left in "?" because there's good enough odds
that it proves unexpectedly desirable later, it
seems unlikely to trip me up (worst it does is
widen the minibuffer to show the options in it),
and there's a funny quirk where if it's not bound
then you get the error message

    ace-select-window: Wrong type argument: listp, restart

instead of the correct "error" message

    No such candidate: ?, hit ‘C-g’ to quit.

like for any other unbound character.

Added "q" because I'm getting increasingly used to
quitting that way (though, delightfully, Esc works
out-of-the-box along with Ctrl-g). Using `aw--done`
instead of `keyboard-quit` for that binding, even
though the latter is named as if it's private,
since it appears that's what C-g and Esc get bound
do during ace-window dispatch and that results in
a subtly different behavior (no beep/bell/vibrate).

Display generic tabular icon

Current thumbnail was using a tag lib to
re-render some tabular data from the
dataset. However, this gets in trouble
as actual dataset_embed.html template
leverages gn-map.js to replace gn-container

The tabular data is hacked in HTML so it
would be PITA to do this in a script tag.
The 'right' way to render tabular data
instead of a preview map would be to add
gn-tabular.js which does the preview similar
to gn-map.js and friends.

For now, it should be sufficient to rendere
an SVG as the actual data is previewed
as data content anyway.

Builds logic that manages turfs contained inside an area (#70966)

## About The Pull Request

Area contents isn't a real list, instead it involves filtering
everything in world
This is slow, and something we should have better support for.

So instead, lets manage a list of turfs inside our area. This is simple,
since we already move turfs by area contents anyway

This should speed up the uses I've found, and opens us up to using this
pattern more often, which should make dev work easier.

By nature this is a tad fragile, so I've added a unit test to double
check my work

Rather then instantly removing turfs from the contained_turfs list, we
enter them into a list of turfs to pull out, later.
Then we just use a getter for contained_turfs rather then a var read

This means we don't need to generate a lot of usage off removing turf by
turf from space, and can instead do it only when we need to

I've added a subsystem to manage this process as well, to ensure we
don't get any out of memory errors. It goes entry by entry, ensuring we
get no overtime.
This allows me to keep things like space clean, while keeping high
amounts of usage on a sepearate subsystem when convienient

As a part of this goal of keeping space's churn as low as possible, I've
setup code to ensure we do not add turfs to areas during a z level
increment adjacent mapload. this saves a LOT of time, but is a tad
messy

I've expanded where we use contained_turfs, including into some cases
that filter for objects in areas. need to see if this is sane or not.

Builds sortedAreas on demand, caching until we mark the cache as
violated

It's faster, and it also has the same behavior

I'm not posting speed changes cause frankly they're gonna be a bit
scattered and I'm scared to.
@Mothblocks if you'd like I can look into it. I think it'll pay for
itself just off `reg_in_areas_in_z` (I looked into it. it's really hard
to tell, sometimes it's a bit slower (0.7), sometimes it's 2 seconds
(0.5 if you use the old master figure) faster. life is pain.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Less stupid, more flexible, more speed

It had 3 lists of queries, but they all had their own current_run style
list to support mc_tick_check (as it was already being done before with
the undeleted query check, so i can understand why they ~~cargo culted~~
mirrored the behavior) This was silly and confusing and unneeded given
two of those loops can only process at most 25 items at a time on
default config, plus these were cheap operations (ask rustg to start
thread, ask rustg to check on thread).

Because of the confusingness of the 6 lists for 3 query states, The code
to run pending/queued queries immediately during world shutdown was
instead looking at the current_run list for active queries, **meaning
those queries got ran twice.**

The queued query system only checked the current active query count in
fire(), meaning even when there was nothing going on in this subsystem
new queries had to wait for the next fire() to run (10 ticks, so 500ms
on default config)

Those have all been fixed.

the config `BSQL_THREAD_LIMIT` has been renamed to
`POOLING_MAX_SQL_CONNECTIONS` and its default was lowered to match
MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES .

added a new config `POOLING_MIN_SQL_CONNECTIONS`, allowing you to
pre-allocate a reserve of sql threads.

The queue processing part of SSdbcore's fire() has been made to not obey
mc_tick_check for clarity and to make the following change easier to do:

If there is less than `MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES` in the active queue, new
queries activate immediately.

(its ok that there are two configs that kinda do the same thing,
POOLING_MAX_SQL_CONNECTIONS maps to max-threads in the mysql crate, and
it seems to only be a suggestion, meanwhile MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES can't
do anything during init, which is when the highest amount of concurrent
queries tend to happen.)

:cl:
config: database configs have been updated for better control over the
connection pool
server: BSQL_THREAD_LIMIT has been renamed to
POOLING_MAX_SQL_CONNECTIONS, old configs will whine but still work.
fix: fixed rare race condition that could lead to a sql query being ran
twice during world shutdown.
/:cl:

I have not tested this pr.

Adds admin alert for revs created through traitor panel (#74862)

## About The Pull Request

So like, using traitor panel to make revs doesn't work. 

Revolutions live and die, currently, by the revolution ruleset datum
dynamic creates. It manages the hostile environment and also processes
to check whether either side should be winning or not.

This means that the revolutionary buttons in the traitor panel are kind
of noob-admin-bait. You press it for a funny revolution and then you
realize it's screwed when all the heads are dead and everyone's
stumbling around cluelessly

This has a proper solution, albeit somewhat difficult - separate out the
revolution from the ruleset, make admin spawned revs create a
revolution. I can do this but it's a lot of effort and this works in the
meanwhile

Pops up a TGUI alert when an admin presses "add revolutionary" in
traitor panel when there is no ongoing revolution. Simply enough, gives
them an alert that it will not work correctly. Lets them decide whether
they want to deal with that. (Because you can manually deal with it via
proc calls, if you've got code smarts.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Stops admins from stumbling into the same trap without warning.

Can be removed in the future easily when revs are coded better. 

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
admin: Adds a warning that spawning revs via traitor panel will not
function as expected.
