Basic blob mobs (#78520)

## About The Pull Request

I remembered today that blob code is ass, especially blob spores.
There's still a lot to improve but I cleaned up _some_ of it by
converting these mobs.
Now they use a newer framework and more signal handling as compared to
circular references.

I _expect_ the behaviour here to largely be the same as it was or
similar. I haven't added anything fancy or new.

This is a reasonably big PR but at least all of the files are small?
Everything here touched every other thing enough that it didnt make
sense to split up sorry.

Other things I did in code:
- Experimented with replacing the `mob/blob` subtype with a component.
Don't know if this is genius or stupid.
- AI subtree which just walks somewhere. We've used this behaviour a lot
but never given it its own subtree.
- Blob Spores and Zombies are two different mobs now instead of being
one mob which just changes every single one of its properties.
- Made a few living defence procs call super, because the only thing
super does was send a signal and we weren't doing that for no reason.
Also added a couple extra signals for intercepts we did not have.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Blob spores will respond to rallies more reliably (it won't runtime
every time they try and pathfind).
fix: Blobbernaut pain animation overlays should align with the direction
the mob is facing instead of always facing South
refactor: Blob spores, zombies, and blobbernauts now all use the basic
mob framework. They should work the same, but please report any issues.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Removes debug species from magic mirror (#7889)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/78541
-----
## About The Pull Request

Tallboys strike again
Fixes #78538
Removes "Tall Boys" from the magic mirror, again.
Also gives the two fucked up monkey species names and removes _them_
from the magic mirror.
When the magic mirror was looping through available species it was
finding these monkey subtypes with fucked up limbs, noting that they
were not forbidden, then adding them to the assoc list.
Because all of them were called "monkey" it would overwrite "monkey"
with "monkey who has human arms and torso" which is... not what you
wanted to turn into.

Additionally I made external organ feature name fall back to the species
default if not provided because I kept getting a runtime on monkey tail
insertion (nobody has a monkey tail feature in their prefs or DNA) which
I originally thought was the cause of this bug, until I fixed it and
learned that actually it was something much stupider.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Selecting "Monkey" on a magic mirror will now once again turn you
into a Monkey rather than a disgusting freak of nature.
fix: Tall Boys have once again been barred from joining the Wizard
Federation.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Removes `CANPUSH` status flag from lavaland basic mobs (#7891)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/78531
-----
## About The Pull Request

Title. This makes it so every lavaland mob is now unable to be pushed by
moving into them while on combat mode. Namely this helps with watchers,
as they have gained this vulnerability when they've got the basic bitch
treatment — it caused their _look away_ ability to be easily cancellable
by just pushing them. ~~you can still just fuckin' grab them to do that
and i think it's fair game~~
 
Lobsters and brimdemons are also affected, which i'm not sure how
exactly this affects their gameplay... but it is what it is.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Previous behavior restored, mobs stop being bullied by literally running
into them.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: you can no longer push watchers (and any other lavaland basic mob)
around by running into them

mm: vmscan: fix extreme overreclaim and swap floods

commit f53af4285d775cd9a9a146fc438bd0a1bee1838a upstream.

During proactive reclaim, we sometimes observe severe overreclaim, with
several thousand times more pages reclaimed than requested.

This trace was obtained from shrink_lruvec() during such an instance:

    prio:0 anon_cost:1141521 file_cost:7767
    nr_reclaimed:4387406 nr_to_reclaim:1047 (or_factor:4190)
    nr=[7161123 345 578 1111]

While he reclaimer requested 4M, vmscan reclaimed close to 16G, most of it
by swapping.  These requests take over a minute, during which the write()
to memory.reclaim is unkillably stuck inside the kernel.

Digging into the source, this is caused by the proportional reclaim
bailout logic.  This code tries to resolve a fundamental conflict: to
reclaim roughly what was requested, while also aging all LRUs fairly and
in accordance to their size, swappiness, refault rates etc.  The way it
attempts fairness is that once the reclaim goal has been reached, it stops
scanning the LRUs with the smaller remaining scan targets, and adjusts the
remainder of the bigger LRUs according to how much of the smaller LRUs was
scanned.  It then finishes scanning that remainder regardless of the
reclaim goal.

This works fine if priority levels are low and the LRU lists are
comparable in size.  However, in this instance, the cgroup that is
targeted by proactive reclaim has almost no files left - they've already
been squeezed out by proactive reclaim earlier - and the remaining anon
pages are hot.  Anon rotations cause the priority level to drop to 0,
which results in reclaim targeting all of anon (a lot) and all of file
(almost nothing).  By the time reclaim decides to bail, it has scanned
most or all of the file target, and therefor must also scan most or all of
the enormous anon target.  This target is thousands of times larger than
the reclaim goal, thus causing the overreclaim.

The bailout code hasn't changed in years, why is this failing now?  The
most likely explanations are two other recent changes in anon reclaim:

1. Before the series starting with commit 5df741963d52 ("mm: fix LRU
   balancing effect of new transparent huge pages"), the VM was
   overall relatively reluctant to swap at all, even if swap was
   configured. This means the LRU balancing code didn't come into play
   as often as it does now, and mostly in high pressure situations
   where pronounced swap activity wouldn't be as surprising.

2. For historic reasons, shrink_lruvec() loops on the scan targets of
   all LRU lists except the active anon one, meaning it would bail if
   the only remaining pages to scan were active anon - even if there
   were a lot of them.

   Before the series starting with commit ccc5dc67340c ("mm/vmscan:
   make active/inactive ratio as 1:1 for anon lru"), most anon pages
   would live on the active LRU; the inactive one would contain only a
   handful of preselected reclaim candidates. After the series, anon
   gets aged similarly to file, and the inactive list is the default
   for new anon pages as well, making it often the much bigger list.

   As a result, the VM is now more likely to actually finish large
   anon targets than before.

Change the code such that only one SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX-sized nudge toward the
larger LRU lists is made before bailing out on a met reclaim goal.

This fixes the extreme overreclaim problem.

Fairness is more subtle and harder to evaluate.  No obvious misbehavior
was observed on the test workload, in any case.  Conceptually, fairness
should primarily be a cumulative effect from regular, lower priority
scans.  Once the VM is in trouble and needs to escalate scan targets to
make forward progress, fairness needs to take a backseat.  This is also
acknowledged by the myriad exceptions in get_scan_count().  This patch
makes fairness decrease gradually, as it keeps fairness work static over
increasing priority levels with growing scan targets.  This should make
more sense - although we may have to re-visit the exact values.

Supermatter Delamination Balance Changes (Real) (#77996)

## About The Pull Request

lord forgive me I fucked up the merge conflict

The supermatter delamination countdown timer (how long it takes to go
boom-boom after hitting 0 integrity) has been lowered from 30 seconds to
13 seconds.
Removing a sliver from the supermatter, the traitor objective, will
further lower that down to 3 seconds.
Changes the wording on the mood effects from the supermatter
delaminating slightly.
The crystal uses SPAN_COMMAND on its final countdown, which means it
talk bigger.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Currently I feel that the supermatter delamination countdown overstays
its welcome. Ideally it provides tension to get the hell out, or perhaps
to make a risky last second play to try and save the supermatter.
However right now its at 30 seconds, which gives no danger of staying in
engineering right up to integrity 0, and keeps the tension at a high
note for too long, almost to the point of awkwardness. 13 seconds is a
good balance between get-the-fuck-out while still giving some leeway for
engineers to escape and crewmembers to jump in lockers, and feels quick
enough to give that danger that the supermatter should provide.
Additionally, removing a sliver from the supermatter lowers the cooldown
to 3 seconds. Right now this is one of the harder tasks a traitor can be
tasked with, while giving relatively little payoff sabatoge-wise. To the
point where I have seen engineers just let the traitor do it, as the
debuff it gives to the supermatter is minor. Now it makes the
supermatter delaminate almost immediately after hitting 0 integrity,
which means it will likely catch some engineers in the blast if a
traitor did it stealthy. This also makes it more risky to try and fix a
delamination if the engineering/security team did not stop the sliver
from being removed. All meaning succeeding at this task should be more
rewarding and damaging.
Finally the mood descriptions for the mood effects you get when a
supermatter delaminates have been changed. Currently they are pretty
gamey, and represent what the player might be thinking more than their
character. Additionally they were not very descriptive of where they
came from, which could be confusing.

## Changelog

:cl: Seven
balance: The supermatter delamination countdown has been lowered from 30
to 13 seconds
balance: Removing a sliver from the supermatter further lowers that down
to 3 seconds
balance: The supermatter crystal uses bigger text on its final countdown
spellcheck: Some supermatter delamination related mood descriptions have
been edited to explain the mood effect better

Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms (#78121)

## About The Pull Request

Remade from #77961 because coders dont like bloat in prs

Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms. Paramedics don't get
one.

You can now swear the Hippocratic oath with these busts! It'll give you
pacifism but nothing else. The process is reversible.

There's a very small chance that the Hippocrates bust was once wielded
by a certain German doctor. This chance is increased for coroner
heirlooms.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms. Paramedics don't get
one.

I got this idea and I just couldn't get it out of my head, it's too
funny. Paramedics don't get one because they're powergamers and laugh at
the Oath, and also it doesn't feel like a paramedic thing.

> You can now swear the Hippocratic oath with these busts! It'll give
you pacifism but nothing else. The process is reversible.

This is just a little fun thing you can choose to do, i think it'd be
cute to see doctors swearing the oath in medbay. Plus it's reversible
which can be even funnier depending on the occassion.

> There's a very small chance that the Hippocrates bust was once wielded
by a certain German doctor. This chance is increased for coroner
heirlooms.

We DO already have precedent for references with the entrenching tool
after all. The buff isn't all that special in reality, getting a medical
hud while in your hand is... basically irrelevant for the roles that
literally spawn with a med hud? It's just for accuracy and rule of
cool's sake.

## Changelog

Indexing features for modules (#347)

* Indexing features for modules

This commit introduces indexing for module references. It currently
will only work for files to which we have the source code, turns them
into AST and then applies one or more "extractors" on it. An extractor
runs over AST and indetifies things it's looking for, and then emits
entries, which will be used to build a searchable index.

Currently, there is one extractor implemented: Module references. This
does a fairly exhaustive search for module references, wherever
they're hiding. It then uses the aliases module to find the original
source module.

Note that most of the higher level functions are just placeholders. An
indexing strategy needs to find things inside of .exs files as well as
.ex files, and we currently have no way to index core elixir (this
will be highly dependent on how elixir was installed and if we can get
the source code to the version we're running on).

* Performance fixes / code improvements

Turns out `Aliases.at()` was super slow --especially since we called
it so much when resolving aliases during indexing. This was due to it
having to re-parse the document multiple times for each alias
reference. Moving to sourceror and allowing the AST to be sent in cut
the indexing time for lexical and all its deps from 60 seconds to 10.


* ETS based storage / Fuzzy matching

This commit has ETS based file storage and a fuzzy matching system.
I was having a lot of trouble coming up with an efficient way to perform
fuzzy matching against a corpous of subjects efficiently using the data
stores. ETS is... ets, and it appears that it's impossible to use it for
any type of detailed string matching. SQLite had similar problems. While
it had a lot more complicated and helpful utilities, it just couldn't do
what I wanted when it comes to fuzziness.

Then I thought, hey, why not just store the subjects in memory with all
the places that they appear? Then you just keep that up to date, and you
remove a lot of duplication, which improves performance a lot.

Prior to this, ETS was taking around 300ms to do simple-ish matching,
and SQLite was taking around 180ms. Fuzzy can do it in 14ms. Better yet,
building a fuzzy from scratch only takes 40ms for lexical and all its
deps. This includes doing much more interesting matching.

I think we have a winner.

pseudo: Fix to work with glibc 2.38

This adds a horrible hack to get pseudo working with glibc 2.38. We can't
drop _GNU_SOURCE to something like _DEFAULT_SOURCE since we need the defines
the gnu options bring in. That leaves using internal glibc defines to disable
the c23 versions of strtol/fscanf and friends. Which would break pseudo
build with 2.38 from running on hosts with older glibc.

We'll probably need to come up with something better but this gets glibc 2.38
and working and avoids autobuilder failures.

xfs: reserve less log space when recovering log intent items

Wengang Wang reports that a customer's system was running a number of
truncate operations on a filesystem with a very small log.  Contention
on the reserve heads lead to other threads stalling on smaller updates
(e.g.  mtime updates) long enough to result in the node being rebooted
on account of the lack of responsivenes.  The node failed to recover
because log recovery of an EFI became stuck waiting for a grant of
reserve space.  From Wengang's report:

"For the file deletion, log bytes are reserved basing on
xfs_mount->tr_itruncate which is:

    tr_logres = 175488,
    tr_logcount = 2,
    tr_logflags = XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES,

"You see it's a permanent log reservation with two log operations (two
transactions in rolling mode).  After calculation (xlog_calc_unit_res()
adds space for various log headers), the final log space needed per
transaction changes from  175488 to 180208 bytes.  So the total log
space needed is 360416 bytes (180208 * 2).  [That quantity] of log space
(360416 bytes) needs to be reserved for both run time inode removing
(xfs_inactive_truncate()) and EFI recover (xfs_efi_item_recover())."

In other words, runtime pre-reserves 360K of space in anticipation of
running a chain of two transactions in which each transaction gets a
180K reservation.

Now that we've allocated the transaction, we delete the bmap mapping,
log an EFI to free the space, and roll the transaction as part of
finishing the deferops chain.  Rolling creates a new xfs_trans which
shares its ticket with the old transaction.  Next, xfs_trans_roll calls
__xfs_trans_commit with regrant == true, which calls xlog_cil_commit
with the same regrant parameter.

xlog_cil_commit calls xfs_log_ticket_regrant, which decrements t_cnt and
subtracts t_curr_res from the reservation and write heads.

If the filesystem is fresh and the first transaction only used (say)
20K, then t_curr_res will be 160K, and we give that much reservation
back to the reservation head.  Or if the file is really fragmented and
the first transaction actually uses 170K, then t_curr_res will be 10K,
and that's what we give back to the reservation.

Having done that, we're now headed into the second transaction with an
EFI and 180K of reservation.  Other threads apparently consumed all the
reservation for smaller transactions, such as timestamp updates.

Now let's say the first transaction gets written to disk and we crash
without ever completing the second transaction.  Now we remount the fs,
log recovery finds the unfinished EFI, and calls xfs_efi_recover to
finish the EFI.  However, xfs_efi_recover starts a new tr_itruncate
tranasction, which asks for 360K log reservation.  This is a lot more
than the 180K that we had reserved at the time of the crash.  If the
first EFI to be recovered is also pinning the tail of the log, we will
be unable to free any space in the log, and recovery livelocks.

Wengang confirmed this:

"Now we have the second transaction which has 180208 log bytes reserved
too. The second transaction is supposed to process intents including
extent freeing.  With my hacking patch, I blocked the extent freeing 5
hours. So in that 5 hours, 180208 (NOT 360416) log bytes are reserved.

"With my test case, other transactions (update timestamps) then happen.
As my hacking patch pins the journal tail, those timestamp-updating
transactions finally use up (almost) all the left available log space
(in memory in on disk).  And finally the on disk (and in memory)
available log space goes down near to 180208 bytes.  Those 180208 bytes
are reserved by [the] second (extent-free) transaction [in the chain]."

Wengang and I noticed that EFI recovery starts a transaction, completes
one step of the chain, and commits the transaction without completing
any other steps of the chain.  Those subsequent steps are completed by
xlog_finish_defer_ops, which allocates yet another transaction to
finish the rest of the chain.  That transaction gets the same tr_logres
as the head transaction, but with tr_logcount = 1 to force regranting
with every roll to avoid livelocks.

In other words, we already figured this out in commit 929b92f64048d
("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction
reservation"), but should have applied that logic to each intent item's
recovery function.  For Wengang's case, the xfs_trans_alloc call in the
EFI recovery function should only be asking for a single transaction's
worth of log reservation -- 180K, not 360K.

Quoting Wengang again:

"With log recovery, during EFI recovery, we use tr_itruncate again to
reserve two transactions that needs 360416 log bytes.  Reserving 360416
bytes fails [stalls] because we now only have about 180208 available.

"Actually during the EFI recover, we only need one transaction to free
the extents just like the 2nd transaction at RUNTIME.  So it only needs
to reserve 180208 rather than 360416 bytes.  We have (a bit) more than
180208 available log bytes on disk, so [if we decrease the reservation
to 180K] the reservation goes and the recovery [finishes].  That is to
say: we can fix the log recover part to fix the issue. We can introduce
a new xfs_trans_res xfs_mount->tr_ext_free

{
  tr_logres = 175488,
  tr_logcount = 0,
  tr_logflags = 0,
}

"and use tr_ext_free instead of tr_itruncate in EFI recover."

However, I don't think it quite makes sense to create an entirely new
transaction reservation type to handle single-stepping during log
recovery.  Instead, we should copy the transaction reservation
information in the xfs_mount, change tr_logcount to 1, and pass that
into xfs_trans_alloc.  We know this won't risk changing the min log size
computation since we always ask for a fraction of the reservation for
all known transaction types.

This looks like it's been lurking in the codebase since commit
3d3c8b5222b92, which changed the xfs_trans_reserve call in
xlog_recover_process_efi to use the tr_logcount in tr_itruncate.
That changed the EFI recovery transaction from making a
non-XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for one transaction's worth of log
space to a XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for two transactions worth.

Fixes: 3d3c8b5222b92 ("xfs: refactor xfs_trans_reserve() interface")
Complements: 929b92f64048d ("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction reservation")

[Eval] An array of Liar Paradox-based evals (#883)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
logic-liar-paradox

### Eval description

An array of Liar Paradox-based evals, examining the model's proficiency
in navigating linguistic nuances and logical reasoning within
self-referential statements.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval is particularly useful because it delves into complex, nuanced
logical concepts and self-referential statements, which have
historically posed challenges for AI models. By exploring various
contexts, alternative logical frameworks, and modifications to
statements, this eval helps assess the model's ability to adapt to
different perspectives, grasp subtleties in language, and engage in
flexible reasoning. The ability to understand and navigate paradoxes is
an essential aspect of human-like reasoning, and improving an AI model's
performance in this area would significantly enhance its overall
usefulness and reliability in real-world applications. Additionally,
showcasing the model's improved proficiency in handling paradoxes would
not only make for a compelling marketing angle (as paradoxes are
understood by a much broader range of people than other difficult tasks
such as pure maths or quantum mechanics) but it would also demonstrate
the progress made in AI's capacity to think and reason more like humans.
It also adds paradox-absorbing crumple zones.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

- [x] Addresses complex logical reasoning: The eval focuses on AI's
ability to comprehend and navigate paradoxes, self-referential
statements, and context switching, which are important aspects of
human-like reasoning. By testing the model's proficiency in these areas,
we can identify areas for improvement and work towards enhancing AI's
overall capacity to think and reason more like humans.
- [x] Demonstrates adaptability and flexibility: The eval showcases the
model's ability to switch between contexts, alter premises, and engage
with different dimensions of inferred logic. This will help assess the
model's adaptability and flexibility in diverse real-world situations,
making it more reliable and useful.
- [x] Contributes to AI safety and understanding: By identifying the
model's weaknesses and limitations in handling paradoxes and complex
logical constructs, the eval can contribute to AI safety and enable
researchers to better understand the challenges faced by large language
models in these areas.
- [x] Engaging and appealing: An eval that delves into paradoxes and
complex thought exercises is not only intellectually stimulating but
also adds an appealing element to showcase the model's capabilities,
making it more attractive for both researchers and end-users.

### Unique eval value

- [x] Encourages creativity and lateral thinking: The eval, by focusing
on paradoxes and complex logical constructs, encourages both the AI and
its developers to think creatively and approach problem-solving from
unconventional angles. This can lead to the discovery of novel solutions
and a better understanding of the model's capabilities.
- [x] Aligns with human values and expectations: An AI that can
successfully navigate paradoxes and complex logic is more likely to
align with human values and expectations. By addressing these challenges
in the eval, we strive to develop AI systems that understand and respect
the nuances of human thought and communication.
- [x] Addresses a broad range of applications: Improved reasoning and
context-switching abilities can have a significant impact on various AI
applications, including natural language understanding, decision-making,
and problem-solving in domains such as law, philosophy, ethics, and
more.
- [x] Fosters interdisciplinary collaboration: The exploration of
paradoxes and complex logic often draws upon insights from multiple
disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and computer
science. This eval can help foster interdisciplinary collaboration,
leading to richer and more diverse perspectives on AI development and
its potential impact on society.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

statement is true, then it is neither true nor false, which contradicts
its truth. If the statement is false, then it is not the case that it is
neither true nor false, which implies that it is either true or false,
again leading to a contradiction. The paradox arises due to
self-reference and the inability to assign a consistent truth value to
the statement."}

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
`svg_understanding`

### Eval description

The model is provided with the contents of an SVG path (anywhere from
~1000 to ~8000 characters) of a simple object (eg `frog`, `banana`) and
is asked to provide the label.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a test of visual understanding and mental modeling. A motivated
human could succeed on these evals with enough time and a piece of graph
paper: in theory, a sufficiently advanced LLM could have the in-context
capacity to do this on the fly.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
[Insert Eval name here]

### Eval description

[Insert a short description of what your eval does here]

### What makes this a useful eval?

[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [ ] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [ ] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [ ] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [ ] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [ ] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [ ] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [ ] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [ ] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [ ] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [ ] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

<details>
  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>

Fixup of #13542: Do not call IA2 install and uninstall code from NVDA itself (#15517)

Fixup of #13542

Summary of the issue:
In #13542, we introduced support for multi thread IA2 initialization. As part of that, the signature of the install- and uninstallIA2Support functions were changed. Somehow, it was an oversight from my end that these functions were also called from NVDAHelper.py. This causes:

NVDA to always log a debug warning on exit, saying that it was unable to unregister IA2 support.
NVDA to call installIA2Initialize without a thread Id. It is actually a miracle that the segfault we're now seeing in preliminary PY3.11 work didn't hurt us earlyer. That said, I think I've seen cases were NVDA played the startup sound and then silently crashed. I think this should be the case.
As per point 2, given the risk of NVDA calling a code path that results in undefined behavior and possible segfaults, I strongly recommend to merge this into beta.

Description of user facing changes
No crashes during NVDA startup.

Description of development approach
Removed the calls from NVDAHelper.py and no longer export the functions from NVDAHelper. The calls in NVDA core were actually obsolete, as IA2 support is registered by injection_initialize and injection_terminate. Note that the install and uninstall IA2 functions aren't called in de 64 bit loader of NVDAHelper, yet IA2 works as expected in X64 applications. Also, installIA2Support is no longer C friendly anyway. Note that an add-on author should never call these functions, therefore I don't consider this as an API breaking change.

docs: Update README with new Lightyear link (#421)

Hello @kagkarlsson!

Nearly three years on from when we first started using db-scheduler, the
library has scaled beautifully along with us, never causing a headache!

Now, we're a big-boy startup with the root domain lightyear.com. As a
result, the old link will soon be obsolete.

Thank you once again for creating this library. We're planning to launch
in Norway soon—just to get you onboard as a VIP customer! 😄

Polymorph belt blacklists several biotypes instead of allowing only organics [MDB IGNORE] (#23620)

* Polymorph belt blacklists several biotypes instead of allowing only organics (#78229)

## About The Pull Request

Title; this makes the belt able to morph into _more_ mobs, but _less
problematic/abusable_ mobs hopefully. It still only functions on
basic/simple_animals, however.

~~Headslugs get a `MOB_UNDEAD` bioflag to prevent morphing into them
completely. Though catching a sentient ling slug and morphing everyone
into it is funny, it's only funny the first 5 times someone does it.
(disclaimer: this is an approximation, i did not actually see a
polymorph belt in-game because i currently play miner and like 10 games
a week tops)
Arguably, this isn't ideal, but it's the closest we get unless we rename
`MOB_EPIC` or something into `MOB_SPECIAL` and let that one be the go-to
bioflag for mobs we don't want **fun** things happen to.~~
`MOB_EPIC` is now `MOB_SPECIAL`. Headslugs get that.
I think the alternative methow could use whatever the gold cores use to
determine what to spawn but that would shift the mobs available for the
belt even more and I can't be assed to figure out how _much_ of a shift
that would be. Dragons or slimes or lavaland mobs would be out, for
example. Don't really vibe with that.

Fixes headslug's description bit that discerns a sentient slug from an
AI one showing up on a dead slug. It can't move while it's dead, no
matter its mind/AI.

Also adds simple dmdoc comments to the defines to help discern a few of
them more easily. Non-quip text suggestions welcome.

## Why It's Good For The Game
- Resolves #77756
- Resolves #78227

More mobs available for the funny belt but less _fun_ mobs should allow
for more stable use of the damn thing. Arguably, some of the mobs that
have been found to be incompatible with the belt are simply lacking a
`MOB_ORGANIC` flag, some of them with no apparent reason. However,
blacklisting potentially problematic biotypes should be easier to design
the unwanted mobs around.
Also consistency, less all-ling stations, code clarity. Whatever.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: polymorph belt now blacklists mobs that are undead, humanoid,
robotic or spiritual (in nature, not religiously), as well as megafauna
balance: however, this means that it works with more mobs that it should
logically work with, like slimes/bugs/lightgeists etc
fix: fixed headslug shenanigans with the polymorph belt hopefully for
good this time
fix: fixed headslug description mentioning its movement despite the slug
being dead

* Polymorph belt blacklists several biotypes instead of allowing only organics

[MIRROR] Light eater is now indestructible [MDB IGNORE] (#23339)

* Light eater is now indestructible (#77903)

## About The Pull Request

This means a nightmare going into an emagged recycler will no longer be
fucked by their lack of a light eater.
Oh yeah, also moved the ACID_PROOF flag to the correct bitflag.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Bugfix good, you're not supposed to be able to delete an external limb
generated by an internal one, such as implants and such. Pretty sure
reimplanting the heart would make the light eater reappear, too, but
that's night impossible to get done as a nightmare.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Light eaters can no longer be eaten by their higher-grade brothers,
the trash eaters. (recyclers)
/:cl:

* Light eater is now indestructible

Minor Layout Adjustment to Archaic Temple and Statue Component Bugfix (#6019)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

1. **Makes Layout Adjustments to Archaic Temple POI.**
2. **Adds New Ranged Trap Subtype.**
3. **Adds Female Statue Side and Back Sprites.**
4. **Bugfixes Unobserved Actor Component.**

## Why It's Good For The Game

1. _Minor adjustments to the POI that I don't want to describe in the PR
due to their connection to the mechanics. Repair of the door icons,
minor housekeeping._
2. _Having the traps fire non-stop is a little unfun. Even if they can
be jammed, sometimes it's neat to give them a limited chain of blasts._
3. _The male had side and back sprites but the female didn't. I just
kinda tweaked the male to fit._
4. _It was discovered that Ghosts able to see a statue were counting as
observers for the unobserved actor component, effectively crippling the
statue._

## Changelog

Tweaks the BEPIS category of the bitrunning order console (#78560)

## About The Pull Request

The bitrunner PR has removed the BEPIS machine, but kept two BEPIS disks
as a possible reward. However, the base BEPIS disks may contain
duplicate data. Originally, the BEPIS dispensed a Reformatted version of
the disks, which on spawn remove their tech from the spawn list,
ensuring that any future BEPIS disks would not contain duplicates of
this purchased data. Therefore, I have removed the cheaper version,
after discussing this with jlsnow301.

Of course, your expensive disk can still contain data that was in a base
disk found in space, or worse, mailed to a scientist, and eventually,
you will run out of techs to purchase, but these are separate issue.

I have also added the orphaned minor rewards to the same console, with
prices suggested by @ArcaneMusic, who has also suggested that I should
set all prices to be derived from the crew paycheck define, however,
none of the product vendors use this, so I think I would like to do all
of those in one go in a separate PR.

The reasoning behind the prices:

- Survival Pen: Not too disruptive, it just lets you dig. 150, lets
round it up. Worth 100, or 1 star when not express ordered.
- Spray on gloves: prevents shocks 10 times, cleaning also uses up
charges, uses up glove slots. Potentially disruptive item. 750 or 500
when not express ordered.
- Party pod: Mainly drugs, beer and recolouring chems, with potential of
poisoning. 750 or 500 when not express ordered as while it is something
silly you can do during downtime, you should do a bit of hunting for
crates before you get this.
- Polycircuit: Actually very good item for engineers, so they have to
carry less stuff around. They would still get bleed from using it, if
someone interrupts them, but that doesn't matter much. 8 uses of
circuits, adds up to little more than half sheet of materials, which is
vastly smaller than the mineral amounts you get from the crates. 150, or
100 when not expressed ordered, just because of the versatility, and
taking up only one slot in the inventories. Much cheaper than the
original proposed one.

Still thinking about how to reintroduce the "Make Buck" Doe, I will try
to reintroduce them in a different PR.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Its bad when a bitrunner buys an expensive disk, only to realize its
contents are the same as the cheaper disk they bought due to RNG.

The silly items from the BEPIS shouldn't be lost. The prices are fair
because you are giving up your precious domain loot points that you
could use to give a gun to your avatar to buy a silly spray-on glove.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Added the BEPIS' minor rewards as purchasable products to the
bitrunning order console.
del: Removed the base BEPIS disk from the bitrunner console

Introduction In the world of software management there exists a dreaded place called “dependency hell.” The bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this pit of despair.  In systems with many dependencies, releasing new package versions can quickly become a nightmare. If the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable). Dependency hell is where you are when version lock and/or version promiscuity prevent you from easily and safely moving your project forward.  As a solution to this problem, we propose a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existing widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software. For this system to work, you first need to declare a public API. This may consist of documentation or be enforced by the code itself. Regardless, it is important that this API be clear and precise. Once you identify your public API, you communicate changes to it with specific increments to your version number. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes increment the major version.  We call this system “Semantic Versioning.” Under this scheme, version numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next.  Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer) The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public API. This API could be declared in the code itself or exist strictly in documentation. However it is done, it SHOULD be precise and comprehensive.  A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.  Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.  Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.  Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it changes.  Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.  Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.  Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY also include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor versions MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.  A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92, 1.0.0-x-y-z.–.  Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata MUST be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85, 1.0.0+21AF26D3—-117B344092BD.  Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered.  Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not figure into precedence).  Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically.  Example: 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1.  When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal version:  Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0.  Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and patch version MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier from left to right until a difference is found as follows:  Identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically.  Identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort order.  Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers.  A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal.  Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0.

This is not a new or revolutionary idea. In fact, you probably do something close to this already. The problem is that “close” isn’t good enough. Without compliance to some sort of formal specification, version numbers are essentially useless for dependency management. By giving a name and clear definition to the above ideas, it becomes easy to communicate your intentions to the users of your software. Once these intentions are clear, flexible (but not too flexible) dependency specifications can finally be made.  A simple example will demonstrate how Semantic Versioning can make dependency hell a thing of the past. Consider a library called “Firetruck.” It requires a Semantically Versioned package named “Ladder.” At the time that Firetruck is created, Ladder is at version 3.1.0. Since Firetruck uses some functionality that was first introduced in 3.1.0, you can safely specify the Ladder dependency as greater than or equal to 3.1.0 but less than 4.0.0. Now, when Ladder version 3.1.1 and 3.2.0 become available, you can release them to your package management system and know that they will be compatible with existing dependent software.  As a responsible developer you will, of course, want to verify that any package upgrades function as advertised. The real world is a messy place; there’s nothing we can do about that but be vigilant. What you can do is let Semantic Versioning provide you with a sane way to release and upgrade packages without having to roll new versions of dependent packages, saving you time and hassle.  If all of this sounds desirable, all you need to do to start using Semantic Versioning is to declare that you are doing so and then follow the rules. Link to this website from your README so others know the rules and can benefit from them.  FAQ How should I deal with revisions in the 0.y.z initial development phase? The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at 0.1.0 and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release.  How do I know when to release 1.0.0? If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you’re worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.  Doesn’t this discourage rapid development and fast iteration? Major version zero is all about rapid development. If you’re changing the API every day you should either still be in version 0.y.z or on a separate development branch working on the next major version.  If even the tiniest backwards incompatible changes to the public API require a major version bump, won’t I end up at version 42.0.0 very rapidly? This is a question of responsible development and foresight. Incompatible changes should not be introduced lightly to software that has a lot of dependent code. The cost that must be incurred to upgrade can be significant. Having to bump major versions to release incompatible changes means you’ll think through the impact of your changes, and evaluate the cost/benefit ratio involved.  Documenting the entire public API is too much work! It is your responsibility as a professional developer to properly document software that is intended for use by others. Managing software complexity is a hugely important part of keeping a project efficient, and that’s hard to do if nobody knows how to use your software, or what methods are safe to call. In the long run, Semantic Versioning, and the insistence on a well defined public API can keep everyone and everything running smoothly.  What do I do if I accidentally release a backwards incompatible change as a minor version? As soon as you realize that you’ve broken the Semantic Versioning spec, fix the problem and release a new minor version that corrects the problem and restores backwards compatibility. Even under this circumstance, it is unacceptable to modify versioned releases. If it’s appropriate, document the offending version and inform your users of the problem so that they are aware of the offending version.  What should I do if I update my own dependencies without changing the public API? That would be considered compatible since it does not affect the public API. Software that explicitly depends on the same dependencies as your package should have their own dependency specifications and the author will notice any conflicts. Determining whether the change is a patch level or minor level modification depends on whether you updated your dependencies in order to fix a bug or introduce new functionality. We would usually expect additional code for the latter instance, in which case it’s obviously a minor level increment.  What if I inadvertently alter the public API in a way that is not compliant with the version number change (i.e. the code incorrectly introduces a major breaking change in a patch release)? Use your best judgment. If you have a huge audience that will be drastically impacted by changing the behavior back to what the public API intended, then it may be best to perform a major version release, even though the fix could strictly be considered a patch release. Remember, Semantic Versioning is all about conveying meaning by how the version number changes. If these changes are important to your users, use the version number to inform them.  How should I handle deprecating functionality? Deprecating existing functionality is a normal part of software development and is often required to make forward progress. When you deprecate part of your public API, you should do two things: (1) update your documentation to let users know about the change, (2) issue a new minor release with the deprecation in place. Before you completely remove the functionality in a new major release there should be at least one minor release that contains the deprecation so that users can smoothly transition to the new API.  Does SemVer have a size limit on the version string? No, but use good judgment. A 255 character version string is probably overkill, for example. Also, specific systems may impose their own limits on the size of the string.  Is “v1.2.3” a semantic version? No, “v1.2.3” is not a semantic version. However, prefixing a semantic version with a “v” is a common way (in English) to indicate it is a version number. Abbreviating “version” as “v” is often seen with version control. Example: git tag v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3", in which case “v1.2.3” is a tag name and the semantic version is “1.2.3”.  Is there a suggested regular expression (RegEx) to check a SemVer string? There are two. One with named groups for those systems that support them (PCRE [Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, i.e. Perl, PHP and R], Python and Go).  See: https://regex101.com/r/Ly7O1x/3/  ^(?P<major>0|[1-9]\d*)\.(?P<minor>0|[1-9]\d*)\.(?P<patch>0|[1-9]\d*)(?:-(?P<prerelease>(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)(?:\.(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))*))?(?:\+(?P<buildmetadata>[0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?$ And one with numbered capture groups instead (so cg1 = major, cg2 = minor, cg3 = patch, cg4 = prerelease and cg5 = buildmetadata) that is compatible with ECMA Script (JavaScript), PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, i.e. Perl, PHP and R), Python and Go.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Tweaks the BEPIS category of the bitrunning order console (#7921)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/78560
-----
## About The Pull Request

The bitrunner PR has removed the BEPIS machine, but kept two BEPIS disks
as a possible reward. However, the base BEPIS disks may contain
duplicate data. Originally, the BEPIS dispensed a Reformatted version of
the disks, which on spawn remove their tech from the spawn list,
ensuring that any future BEPIS disks would not contain duplicates of
this purchased data. Therefore, I have removed the cheaper version,
after discussing this with jlsnow301.

Of course, your expensive disk can still contain data that was in a base
disk found in space, or worse, mailed to a scientist, and eventually,
you will run out of techs to purchase, but these are separate issue.

I have also added the orphaned minor rewards to the same console, with
prices suggested by ArcaneMusic, who has also suggested that I should
set all prices to be derived from the crew paycheck define, however,
none of the product vendors use this, so I think I would like to do all
of those in one go in a separate PR.

The reasoning behind the prices:

- Survival Pen: Not too disruptive, it just lets you dig. 150, lets
round it up. Worth 100, or 1 star when not express ordered.
- Spray on gloves: prevents shocks 10 times, cleaning also uses up
charges, uses up glove slots. Potentially disruptive item. 750 or 500
when not express ordered.
- Party pod: Mainly drugs, beer and recolouring chems, with potential of
poisoning. 750 or 500 when not express ordered as while it is something
silly you can do during downtime, you should do a bit of hunting for
crates before you get this.
- Polycircuit: Actually very good item for engineers, so they have to
carry less stuff around. They would still get bleed from using it, if
someone interrupts them, but that doesn't matter much. 8 uses of
circuits, adds up to little more than half sheet of materials, which is
vastly smaller than the mineral amounts you get from the crates. 150, or
100 when not expressed ordered, just because of the versatility, and
taking up only one slot in the inventories. Much cheaper than the
original proposed one.

Still thinking about how to reintroduce the "Make Buck" Doe, I will try
to reintroduce them in a different PR.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Its bad when a bitrunner buys an expensive disk, only to realize its
contents are the same as the cheaper disk they bought due to RNG.

The silly items from the BEPIS shouldn't be lost. The prices are fair
because you are giving up your precious domain loot points that you
could use to give a gun to your avatar to buy a silly spray-on glove.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Added the BEPIS' minor rewards as purchasable products to the
bitrunning order console.
del: Removed the base BEPIS disk from the bitrunner console
/:cl:

Removes TTS voice disable option (Skyrat: Actually makes a functional "None" voice option this time) [MDB IGNORE] (#22283)

* Removes TTS voice disable option (#76530)

## About The Pull Request
Removes the TTS voice disable option, which was already unavailable on
TG as it was set to off by default. The reason this was added was so
that downstreams could toggle the config on or off.

## Why It's Good For The Game
I think this option fundamentally undermines the TTS system because it
allows individual players to disable their voice globally, meaning that
players who have TTS enabled will not be able to hear them.

This worsens the experience for players who have TTS enabled and it's
not something I want to include as an option. If players don't like
their voice, they can turn TTS off for themselves so that they don't
hear the voices. If players don't want to customize their voice, they
can quickly choose a random voice, and we can take directions in the
future to make voice randomization consistent with gender so that a male
does not get randomly assigned a female voice and vice versa.

This option is already unavailable on TG servers because it was
primarily added for downstreams, but I don't think giving downstreams
the option to undermine the TTS system is the right direction to take.
Downstreams are still completely free to code this option on their own
codebase.

## [Ste1io/PetaPoco](https://github.com/Ste1io/PetaPoco)@[8fd5cb7983...](https://github.com/Ste1io/PetaPoco/commit/8fd5cb79838466eed26d5574da2f539ac803e29c)
#### Wednesday 2023-09-27 17:38:46 by Stelio Kontos

I hate my life:
- QueryMultiple tests use an MSSQL-specific statement for concatonating possibly-null strings
- each dbms uses their own flavor of string concatonation: "+", "||", and "CONCAT(...)"
- they also use different syntax (and placement) for limiting results: TOP n, FIRST n, LIMIT n
- postgres requires the passed-in parameter type to match the column type: "1" != 1

Solution:
- move tests back to MSSQL
- create failing test in base class to force implementation in each derived class
- churn out 28 f'ing test overrides
- change Id data type for "JoinableX" tables (ms access only) to int, since I was derping when I changed it to GUID

Result: life still sucks
- 8 of 28 QueryMultiple tests fail

Pushing this commit to remote anyway with the faint hope that some sql genius smarter than myself has a couple pennies to toss my direction on this. Failing tests have failure reason above them in "// FIXME:" comments:
- Firebird (multiple statements in a single command)
- MS Access (possible bad syntax)

Add Postpone API (#27238)

This adds an experimental `unstable_postpone(reason)` API.

Currently we don't have a way to model effectively an Infinite Promise.
I.e. something that suspends but never resolves. The reason this is
useful is because you might have something else that unblocks it later.
E.g. by updating in place later, or by client rendering.

On the client this works to model as an Infinite Promise (in fact,
that's what this implementation does). However, in Fizz and Flight that
doesn't work because the stream needs to end at some point. We don't
have any way of knowing that we're suspended on infinite promises. It's
not enough to tag the promises because you could await those and thus
creating new promises. The only way we really have to signal this
through a series of indirections like async functions, is by throwing.
It's not 100% safe because these values can be caught but it's the best
we can do.

Effectively `postpone(reason)` behaves like a built-in [Catch
Boundary](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26854). It's like
`raise(Postpone, reason)` except it's built-in so it needs to be able to
be encoded and caught by Suspense boundaries.

In Flight and Fizz these behave pretty much the same as errors. Flight
just forwards it to retrigger on the client. In Fizz they just trigger
client rendering which itself might just postpone again or fill in the
value. The difference is how they get logged.

In Flight and Fizz they log to `onPostpone(reason)` instead of
`onError(error)`. This log is meant to help find deopts on the server
like finding places where you fall back to client rendering. The reason
that you pass in is for that purpose to help the reason for any deopts.

I do track the stack trace in DEV but I don't currently expose it to
`onPostpone`. This seems like a limitation. It might be better to expose
the Postpone object which is an Error object but that's more of an
implementation detail. I could also pass it as a second argument.

On the client after hydration they don't get passed to
`onRecoverableError`. There's no global `onPostpone` API to capture
postponed things on the client just like there's no `onError`. At that
point it's just assumed to be intentional. It doesn't have any `digest`
or reason passed to the client since it's not logged.

There are some hacky solutions that currently just tries to reuse as
much of the existing code as possible but should be more properly
implemented.
- Fiber is currently just converting it to a fake Promise object so that
it behaves like an infinite Promise.
- Fizz is encoding the magic digest string `"POSTPONE"` in the HTML so
we know to ignore it but it should probably just be something neater
that doesn't share namespace with digests.

Next I plan on using this in the `/static` entry points for additional
features.

Why "postpone"? It's basically a synonym to "defer" but we plan on using
"defer" for other purposes and it's overloaded anyway.

Conjure Unholy PromiseOfPower Grimoire

    In the dark annals of forbidden knowledge, a new eldritch creation takes form—PromiseOfPower.
    Crafted in the accursed language of SwiftUI, this abomination serves as a dread companion
    to those who dare partake in the Eldritch Horror board game.

    Unspeakable Additions:

    - Scribed malevolent mock data into the Book of Shadows, breathing life into artifacts, assets, conditions,
      spells, and unique assets.

    - Unveiled the horrors of other dimensions, allowing the cursed to traverse these realms by merely
      swiping their fingers upon the screen—each cursed slide met with uncanny haptic reverberations.

    - The mere touch upon these digital talismans now blurs the visage, revealing yet another layer of
      the unfathomable—accompanied by ominous tactile vibrations.

    - A grim sigil now lurks in the screen's uppermost corner, tempting users to refine their dark journey
      by traits—whether seeking 'ally', 'item', 'service' or other sinister archetypes.

    - The accursed words "Brought to you by GalacticCoders" appear as if whispered by unseen entities,
      their message accompanied by a spine-chilling melody of dread.

    Inscribe these words into your consciousness: this grotesque app aims to serve as a looking glass
    into otherworldly terrors and unnameable wonders. It shrouds the user in the velvety darkness of
    the Lovecraftian cosmos, and imbues the experience with a veneer of interactive dread.

Gun kits don't need cable coil or tools, halved crafting time (#78419)

## About The Pull Request

Crafting R&D guns from gun kits no longer requires tools or cable coil.
The decloner and energy crossbow still need reagents.

Halved R&D gun crafting time. 20->10 seconds.

## Why It's Good For The Game

These changes were made a long, long while ago and honestly while I
understand gun kits I don't understand why it was made So. Annoying. To
make the fucking guns once you got everything ready. It makes it a total
annoyance. You spent 40 minutes getting all the tech for it, you
shouldn't have to also get tools and cables and wait 20 seconds standing
still.

Anyone who has played ingame like any time after that change can attest
how underused any R&D gun is now. X-ray laser guns still DESTROY blobs
but people don't even THINK about them because of the dumb annoying
recipe (alongside RnD being a pain now).

Simply put this just. Makes life easier for security officers. And
reduces tool dependency.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Crafting R&D guns from gun kits no longer requires tools or cable
coil. The decloner and energy crossbow still need reagents.
qol: Halved R&D gun crafting time. 20->10 seconds.

Rounded supermatter delamination times to 5 seconds, restored old mood messages (#78335)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Makes the supermatter delaminate in 15 seconds instead of 13 and 5
seconds instead of 3 if a sliver has been taken from it, mainly to
please perfectionists (me and some others who commented on the PR) as
well as giving people at least a chance to escape delam round removal.

I don't like it when flavorful text is replaced by bland and
not-as-funny alternatives.
Also, how the hell is it gamey for staff to know the engineers are in
charge of the power?
It's honestly more gamey for them to know what a resonance cascade or
supermatter delamination is, so I'd say you've done the opposite of what
the goal was with the message changes on top of making them less fun in
general. I disapprove.

Oh, yeah, and the SM now reports the times correctly due to it reporting
them every 5 seconds, meaning people would only see the 10 second
announcement. Now there is going to be a 15 second announcement as well.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

Watering down messages to be bland is just, like, less fun, ya know?
I didn't see a single person in support of the message changes apart
from the PR author, everyone else was just complaining about them,
including myself.

Also, several people mentioned the fact it could just be 15 instead of
13 for a nice round number, including myself. I also made the sliver
delamination time 5 seconds instead of 3 seconds because you pretty much
can't get out in time, especially if the game is laggy. 3 - 5 people
being round removed because of one traitor objective with no chance to
escape it is just bad gameplay.

Oh, and, bugfix good, I suppose.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
balance: Supermatter now takes 15 seconds to delaminate normally and 5
if a sliver has been taken from it. Gives a little more time to escape
in the case of the sliver and also evens out the times to please
perfectionists.
fix: Supermatter now accurately reports it's detonation time.
spellcheck: Supermatter mood descriptions have been reverted back to
their old, more flavorful selves.
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

The lead in a pistol, the lead in a gun, the gunpowder around the bullets that are lodged in that so-gun. It would take on a very different chemical composition then say a human pole which is a light fixture in your community currently holding up the police activity "second-watch," the necessary surveillance of what this community needs in its society and what is then taking place. For it records the ongoing activity 24/7/365/3600 and of what we so choose and the community thinks that the local police are then watching our every move after watching the millions of hours of recorded video'tape across this nation and they are only in select questionable often suspicionable areas of the your community"'you know the hoods which are the ghettos stricken with poverty and various human openings for any type of violence, gun crime, physical crime.

As I stand as an example as I would long be dead if it wasn't for these same protective forces that keep me alive, I'm Jesus. So moving on. Once we scientifically diagnosis each chemical composition of any form of criminal human weapon that can be used: vis' a ve'. Hitherto, the system must be able to decipher the very difference of a natural form of composition rather than the composition, that this system has determined, to be; a weapon that can take a family members life away from:us.

lufia2ac: new features, bug fixes, and more (#1549)

### New features

- ***Architect mode***
  Usually the cave is randomized by the game, meaning that each attempt will produce a different dungeon. However, with this new feature the player can, between runs, opt into keeping the same cave. If activated, they will then encounter the same floor layouts, same enemy spawns, and same red chest contents as on their previous attempt.   

- ***Custom item pool***
  Previously, the multiworld item pool consisted entirely of random blue chest items because, well, the permanent checks are blue chests and that's what one would normally get from these. While blue chest items often greatly increase your odds against regular enemies, being able to defeat the Master can be contingent on having an appropriate equipment setup of red chest items (such as Dekar blade) or even enemy drops (such as Hidora rock), most of which cannot normally be obtained from blue chests.
  With the custom item pool option, players now have the freedom to place any cave item into the multiworld itempool for their world.

- ***Enemy floor number, enemy sprite, and enemy movement pattern randomization***
  Experienced players can deduce a lot of information about the opposition they will be facing, for example: Given the current floor number, one can know in advance which of the enemy types will have a chance to spawn on that floor. And when seeing a particular enemy sprite, one can already know which enemy types one might have to face in battle if one were to come in contact with it, and also how that enemy group will move through the dungeon.
  Three new randomization options are added for players who want to spice up their game: one can shuffle which enemy types appear on which floor, one can shuffle which sprite is used by which enemy type, and one can shuffle which movement pattern is used by which sprite.

- ***EXP modifier***
  Just a simple multiplier option to allow people to level up faster. (For technical reasons, the maximum amount of EXP that can be awarded for a single enemy is limited to 65535, but even with the maximum allowed modifier of 500% there are only 6 enemy types in the cave that can reach this cap.)


### Balance change

- ***proportionally adjust chest type distribution to accommodate increased blue chest chance***
  One of the main problems that became apparent in the current version has to do with the distribution of chest contents. The game considers 6 categories, namely: consumable (mostly non-restorative), consumable (restorative), blue chest item, spell, gear, and weapon. Since only blue chests count as multiworld locations, we want to have a mechanism to customize the blue chest chance.
  Given how the chest types are detetermined in game, a naive implementation of an increased blue chest chance causes only the consumable chance to be decreased in return. In practice, this has resulted in some players of worlds with a high blue chest chance struggling (more than usual) to keep their party alive because they were always low on comsumables that restore HP and MP.
  The new algorithm tries to avoid this one-sided effect by having an increase in blue chest chance resulting in a decrease of all other types, calculated in such a way that the relative distribution of the other 5 categories stays (approximately) the same.


### Bug fixes

- ***prevent using party member items if character is already in party***
  This should have been changed at the same time that 6eb00621e39c930f5746f5f3c69a6bc19cd0e84a was made, but oh well... 

- ***fix glitched sprite when opening a chest immediately after receiving an item***
  When opening a chest right after receiving a multiworld item (such that there were two item get animations in the exact same iteration of the game main loop), the item from the chest would display an incorrect sprite in the wrong place. Fixed by cleaning up some relevant memory addresses after getting the multiworld item.

- ***fix death link***
  There was a condition in `deathlink_kill_player` that looked kinda smart (it checked the time against `last_death_link`), but actually wasn't smart at all because `deathlink_kill_player` is executed as an async task and the main thread will update `last_death_link` after creating the task, meaning that whether or not the incoming death link would actually be passed to the game seems to have been up to a race condition. Fixed by simply removing that check.


### Other

- ***add Lufia II Ancient Cave (and SMW) to the network diagram***
  These two games were missing from the SNES sector.

- ***implement get_filler_item_name***
  Place a restorative consumable instead of a completely random item. (Now the only known problem with item links in lufia2ac is... that noone has ever tested item links. But this should be an improvement at least. Anyway, now #1172 can come ;)
  And btw., if you think that the implementation of random selection in this method looks weird, that's because it is indeed weird. (It tries to recreate the algorithm that the game itself uses when it generates a replacement item for a chest that would contain a spell that the party already knows.)

- ***store all options in a dataclass***
  This is basically like using #993 (but without actual support from core). It makes the lufia2ac world code much nicer to maintain because one doesn't have to change 5 different places anymore when adding or renaming an option.

- ***remove master_hp.scale***
  I have to admit: `scale` was a mistake. Never have I seen a single option value cause so many user misconceptions. Some people assume it affects enemies other than the Master; some people assume it affects stats other than HP; and many people will just assume it is a magic option that will somehow counterbalance whatever settings combination they are currently trying to shoot themselves in the foot with.
  On top of that, the `scale` mechanism probably doesn't provide a good user experience even when used for its intended purpose (since having reached floor XY in general doesn't mean you will have the power to deplete XY% of the Masters usual HP; especially given that, due to the randomness of loot, you are never guaranteed to be able to defeat the vanilla Master even when you have cleared 100% of the floors).
  The intended target audience of the `master_hp` option are people who want to fight the Master (and know how to fight it), but also want to lessen (to a degree of their choosing) the harsh dependence on the specific equipment setups that are usually required to win this fight even when having done all 99 floors. They can achieve this by setting the `master_hp` option to a numeric value appropriate for the level of challenge they are seeking. Therefore, nothing of value should be lost by removing the special `scale` value from the `master_hp` option, while at the same time a major source of user confusion will be eliminated.

- ***typing***
  This (combined with the switch to the option dataclass) greatly reduces the typing problems in the lufia2ac world. The remaining typing errors mostly fall into 4 categories:
  1. Lambdas with defaults (which seem to be incorrectly reported as an error due to a mypy bug)
  1. Classmethods that return instances (which could probably be improved using PEP 673 "Self" types, but that would require Python 3.11 as the minimum supported version)
  1. Everything that inherits from TextChoice (which is a typing mess in core)
  1. Everything related to asar.py (which does not have proper typing and lies outside of this project)

(Don't Fear) The Reaper

All our times have come
Here, but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun, or the rain

(We can be like they are)
Come on, baby
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby, I'm your man

La, la la, la la
La, la la, la la

Valentine is done
Here, but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
(Romeo and Juliet)

40,000 men and women every day
(Like Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women every day
(Redefine happiness)
Another 40,000 coming every day

(We can be like they are)
Come on, baby
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby, I'm your man

La, la la, la la
La, la la, la la

Love of two is one
Here, but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on

Then the door was open, and the wind appeared
The candles blew, and then disappeared
The curtains flew, and then he appeared
(Saying, "Don't be afraid")

Come on, baby
(And she had no fear)
And she ran to him
(Then they started to fly)
They looked backward, and said goodbye

(She had become like they are)
She had taken his hand
(She had become like they are)
Come on, baby
(Don't fear the reaper)

Burnin' for You

Home in the valley
Home in the city
Home isn't pretty
Ain't no home for me

Home in the darkness
Home on the highway
Home isn't my way
Home I'll never be

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason to put up a fight

I'm living for givin' the devil his due
And I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you

Time is the essence
Time is the season
Time ain't no reason
Got no time to slow

Time everlasting
Time to play b sides
Time ain't on my side
Time I'll never know

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I'm not the one to tell you what's wrong and what's right
I've seen suns that were freezing and lives that were through
But I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason to put up a fight
I'm living for givin' the devil his due
And I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
And I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you

More Than a Feeling 🫂❣️

I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away

It's more than a feeling
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away

🤍🛡️🧠 Veteran of the Psychic Wars 🧠🛡️🤍

You see me now, a veteran
Of a thousand psychic wars
I've been living on the edge so long
Where the winds of limbo roar
And I'm young enough to look at
And far too old to see
All the scars are on the inside

I'm not sure if there's anything left of me

Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
It's time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating up our brains
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on

You ask me why I'm weary
Why I can't speak to you
You blame me for my silence
Say it's time I changed and grew
But the war's still going on, dear
And there's no end that I know
And I can't say I'm forever

I can't say if we're ever gonna be free

Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
It's time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating up our brains
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on

You see me now a veteran
Of a thousand psychic wars
My energy's spent at last
And my armor is destroyed
I have used up all my weapons
And I'm helpless and bereaved
Wounds are all I'm made of

Did I hear you say that this is victory?

Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
Send me to the rear
Where the tides of madness swell
And been sliding into Hell
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on

Improve documentation relating to `Frustum` and `HalfSpace` (#9136)

# Objective

This PR's first aim is to fix a mistake in `HalfSpace`'s documentation.

When defining a `Frustum` myself in bevy_basic_portals, I realised that
the "distance" of the `HalfSpace` is not, as the current doc defines,
the "distance from the origin along the normal", but actually the
opposite of that.

See the example I gave in this PR.

This means one of two things:
1. The documentation about `HalfSpace` is wrong (it is either way
because of the `n.p + d > 0` formula given later anyway, which is how it
behaves, but in that formula `d` is indeed the opposite of the "distance
from the origin along the normal", otherwise it should be `n.p > d`)
2. The distance is supposed to be the "distance from the origin along
the normal" but when used in a Frustum it's used as the opposite, and it
is a mistake
3. Same as 2, but it is somehow intended

Since I think `HalfSpace` is only used for `Frustum`, and it's easier to
fix documentation than code, I assumed for this PR we're in case number
1. If we're in case number 3, the documentation of `Frustum` needs to
change, and in case number 2, the code needs to be fixed.

While I was at it, I also :
- Tried to improve the documentation for `Frustum`, `Aabb`, and
`VisibilitySystems`, among others, since they're all related to
`Frustum`.
- Fixed documentation about frustum culling not applying to 2d objects,
which is not true since https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/7885

## Remarks and questions

- What about a `HalfSpace` with an infinite distance, is it allowed and
does it represents the whole space? If so it should probably be
mentioned.
- I referenced the `update_frusta` system in
`bevy_render::view::visibility` directly instead of referencing its
system set, should I reference the system set instead? It's a bit
annoying since it's in 3 sets.
- `visibility_propagate` is not public for some reason, I think it
probably should be, but for now I only documented its system set, should
I make it public? I don't think that would count as a breaking change?
- Why is `Aabb` inserted by a system, with `NoFrustumCulling` as an
opt-out, instead of having it inserted by default in `PbrBundle` for
example and then the system calculating it when it's added? Is it
because there is still no way to have an optional component inside a
bundle?

smaps: use vm_normal_page_pmd() instead of follow_trans_huge_pmd()

We shouldn't be using a GUP-internal helper if it can be avoided.

Similar to smaps_pte_entry() that uses vm_normal_page(), let's use
vm_normal_page_pmd() that similarly refuses to return the huge zeropage.

In contrast to follow_trans_huge_pmd(), vm_normal_page_pmd():

(1) Will always return the head page, not a tail page of a THP.

 If we'd ever call smaps_account with a tail page while setting "compound
 = true", we could be in trouble, because smaps_account() would look at
 the memmap of unrelated pages.

 If we're unlucky, that memmap does not exist at all. Before we removed
 PG_doublemap, we could have triggered something similar as in
 commit 24d7275ce279 ("fs/proc: task_mmu.c: don't read mapcount for
 migration entry").

 This can theoretically happen ever since commit ff9f47f6f00c ("mm: proc:
 smaps_rollup: do not stall write attempts on mmap_lock"):

  (a) We're in show_smaps_rollup() and processed a VMA
  (b) We release the mmap lock in show_smaps_rollup() because it is
      contended
  (c) We merged that VMA with another VMA
  (d) We collapsed a THP in that merged VMA at that position

 If the end address of the original VMA falls into the middle of a THP
 area, we would call smap_gather_stats() with a start address that falls
 into a PMD-mapped THP. It's probably very rare to trigger when not
 really forced.

(2) Will succeed on a is_pci_p2pdma_page(), like vm_normal_page()

 Treat such PMDs here just like smaps_pte_entry() would treat such PTEs.
 If such pages would be anonymous, we most certainly would want to
 account them.

(3) Will skip over pmd_devmap(), like vm_normal_page() for pte_devmap()

 As noted in vm_normal_page(), that is only for handling legacy ZONE_DEVICE
 pages. So just like smaps_pte_entry(), we'll now also ignore such PMD
 entries.

 Especially, follow_pmd_mask() never ends up calling
 follow_trans_huge_pmd() on pmd_devmap(). Instead it calls
 follow_devmap_pmd() -- which will fail if neither FOLL_GET nor FOLL_PIN
 is set.

 So skipping pmd_devmap() pages seems to be the right thing to do.

(4) Will properly handle VM_MIXEDMAP/VM_PFNMAP, like vm_normal_page()

 We won't be returning a memmap that should be ignored by core-mm, or
 worse, a memmap that does not even exist. Note that while
 walk_page_range() will skip VM_PFNMAP mappings, walk_page_vma() won't.

 Most probably this case doesn't currently really happen on the PMD level,
 otherwise we'd already be able to trigger kernel crashes when reading
 smaps / smaps_rollup.

So most probably only (1) is relevant in practice as of now, but could only
cause trouble in extreme corner cases.

Let's move follow_trans_huge_pmd() to mm/internal.h to discourage future
reuse in wrong context.

Urgent Security Fix

Last night Aperture (donatarigov) force-merged a code change, bypassing the vote-based system. This is the equivalent of Jeff right-click banning someone in Discord, bypassing the Ban Court.

This is his 2nd offense. The first time he did it I explained to him that even though he has admin access to the repo and can therefore force-merge any PR bypassing the voters, that this is a loophole and should not be done. This rules out that he somehow didn't know or realize. He knows damn well. None of the other voters have ever done this. They all know better. So does Aperture.

He did it in the dead of night, at 2:30 AM Eastern.

He himself was part of the original voters who agreed on a 24h minimum time to pass any code change. The time limit is enforced automatically by a GitHub Action that we installed called "democracy". Aperture abused his admin powers to bypass this system.

One of the first things we did after the vote-based system was installed was to set the 24h minimum. It stops people from passing a PR in the middle of the night. It creates a relaxed non-tactical atmosphere where voters get that guaranteed 24h to consider their vote, change their mind, suggest changes, etc. Just like the minimum timer in Ban Court. It stops 3 voters from banning someone in the dead of night.

Question from those who aren't familiar with GitHub: "could this have been a mistake? Maybe he unknowingly slipped up"
Answer: unfortunately it's not possible. When the automated checks including the vote system are all in a passing state, the Merge button turns bright green and gets larger. It's extremely salient. To bypass the voting system, he had had to click a small greyed out Merge button with a red X near it. He then had to click through a secondary warning that warns him the checks haven't passed yet. There's no possibility this was an accident.

Question: is this just pedantic rule enforcement? Does this actually matter?
Answer: Yes! The problem with someone who shows they won't respect the 24h minimum is he could pass a change that adds discord.delete() in the dead of night. 10 seconds later the change would be auto-deployed and the entire discord would be permanently deleted forever. By the time other voters got up in the morning to vote against the change, it would be too late. This is therefore an URGENT security matter.

# Description
Hi. Basically, this is a continuation of the work that @fdncred started.
Given some nice discussions on #9463 , and [merged uutils
PR](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/pull/5152) from @tertsdiepraam
we have decided to give the `cp` command the `crawl` stage as it was
named.

> [!NOTE] 
Given that the `uutils` crate has not made the release for the merged
PR, just make sure you checkout latest and put it in the required place
to make this PR work.

The aim of this PR is for is to see how to move forward using `uutils`
crate. In order to getting this started, I have made the current
`nushell cp tests` pass along with some extra ones I copied over from
the `uutils` repo.

With all of that being said, things that would be nice to decide, and
keep working on:

Crawl:
- Handling of certain `named` flags, with their long and short
forms(e.g. --update, --reflink, --preserve, etc), and using default
values. Maybe `-u` can already have a `default_missing_value`.
- Should we maybe just support one single option `switch` flags (see
`--backup` in code) as a contrast to the other named args.
- Complete test coverage from `uutils`. They had > 100 tests, and I
could only port like 12 as they are a bit time consuming given they
cannot be straight up copy pasted. Maybe we do not need all >100, but
maybe the more relevant to what we want.
- Refactor this code

Walk:
- Non fatal errors on `copy` from `utils`. Currently it just sends it to
stdout but errors have no span
- Better integration 

An added possibility is the addition of `SyntaxShape::OneOf()` for
`Named` arguments which was briefly mentioned in the discord server, but
that is still to be decided. This could greatly improve some of the
integration. This would enable something like `cp --preserve [all
timestamp]` or `cp --preserve all` to both work.

I did not want to keep holding on this, and wait till I was happy with
the code because I think its nice if everyone can start up and suggest
refactors, but the main important part now was getting it out the door,
as if I take my sweet time this will take way longer :stuck_out_tongue:

[no gbp] Adds missing chat feedback to watcher abilities (#77700)

## About The Pull Request

I kept meaning to add this in my last PR and kept thinking "I'll add
that in with these review changes" and then forgot every time. This
should make it clearer what is happening to you and why.

Also I made the gaze ability stun the user for a short period after it
goes off because them shooting you instantly after they stop channeling
_is_ sort of bullshit.
Also while testing this I noticed the AI interrupt one of its actions to
do the other one which is a bit silly so now it cannot do that.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Outlines in the log why something bad just happened to you.

## Changelog

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Initial hacks to get e2e working in OpenShift CI

* Allow privileged pods in OpenShift test namespaces

The way the e2e test suite is set up, there are several pods that are
to running with more privilege than our "restricted" SCC provides.
Long-term I don't think there is anything in here that *requires* the
privilege, but we'll need to do some testing and find out.

In the mean time, this injects an adjusted pod admission policy into
each test namespace via the centralized namespace creation helper
function so that those privileged pods can run in the test namespaces.

* Specify securityContext for privileged e2e pods

The e2e test suite here is used to running in a "vanilla kube"
environment that does not have OpenShift/OpenShift CI restrictions. This
becomes a problem when one of the test containers attempts to do
something privileged (like bind to a privileged port) and is denied.

This just adds securityContexts to the pods that require privilege so
that they can get assigned a proper SCC and successfully run. The
securityContext addition is limited to only the tests that OpenShift
runs (internal, sequential, cpu/memory/kafka scalers) because we haven't
tested the others.

* Allow e2e test image overrides for OpenShift CI

The e2e test suite references multiple images spread across multiple
public registries (ghcr.io,docker.io,k8s.io) and some of those
registries have pull limits, which will cause our tests to fail.

We also cache some of these upstream images in our CI system, and so it
is beneficial to be able to reference our cached copy rather than have
to pull it from "the internet" every time.

Anyway, the way that the e2e tests are set up, all those images are
hard-coded in each of the manifests, which are just vars that exist in
each test's .go file. They are not templated. There is, however a
central helper function that applies all these resources (using
kubectl).

So, in order for us to be able to override the image list for CI, this
temporarily:
- adds an image rewrite map that specifies replacement images for
  images we might have difficulty pulling
- adds a helper function that will let those replacement images be
  specified by environment variables for use in CI
until we can figure out a more elegant refactor.

* Account for OpenShift CI in Prometheus build test

There is a test in the prometheus sequential suite that checks the git
commit hash of the current code and compares it to the containers
running in the test to make sure that the test version matches the code
version.

This version is injected as GIT_COMMIT during the docker builds
in the Makefile, but it does not get injected when the containers are
build in OpenShift CI. I would like to find a way to inject it via CI,
but until then we are supplying a dummy string "dummy-ci-commit-value"
that is at least "yes you are running against a CI payload we built, and
not one that you pulled from upstream".

Eventually when we figure out how to make all the variables available in
CI and inject them, this can go away because then the commits will
match.

looks humanoid.
This means yes: Corgis, Goliaths, ~~Syndicate mobs~~ not those because
they spawn human corpses and delete themselves.
No: Slimes, Ghosts, General Beepsky.

Splits revival surgery into a subtype used for "mobs" and a subtype for
"mobs with brains" as the former don't have any brains to damage.

Additionally by special request, Ian can now wear an eyepatch and will
automatically put one on if he is brought back from death.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Currently you revive dead pets either by creating a magical reagent out
of holy water or by buying a mining item which also brainwashes them,
however reasonably our skilled medical team should be able to put a dog
back together and now can.
When you fuck up one of the stages of Tend Wounds on a kitten and stab
it to death with your scalpel, now you can fix it.
Expands the possibilities of vetinerary roleplay.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Many kinds of mobs can now be brought back to life through revival
surgery.
add: Dogs can wear eyepatches.

PlayerState collider restructure (#643)

A recently decompiled function found that `s32 D_80072BD0[8][9]` was
actually an array of Collider. This PR updates that to be correct.

It looks like the struct member right after it should be grouped in to
have `colliders[22]` but for whatever reason that doesn't seem to work
so I'm leaving it. Given that the struct size matches and everything, we
probably have `colliders[8]` and then `colliders2[14]` but without more
evidence I don't want to mark this down yet.

Some of these lines come out pretty long like if
`((g_Player.colliders[1].effects & (EFFECT_SOLID_FROM_BELOW +
EFFECT_SOLID)) == EFFECT_SOLID ||`. Here is what that looks like after I
run the formatter:

![image](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/assets/15314202/833aa657-9e11-40e6-bbcf-5ec09f768f26)


Personally, I think the original code is a lot more readable since
everything is stacked up. You can see the [1][2][3] much more easily
than when the lines are interwoven with each other. This isn't the most
egregious example of lines being broken apart, but it's not ideal. I
think we should seriously talk about what we're going to do about the
80-column limit and how it impacts our work. It seems like people are
open to expanding it to 120 columns or something, which would help a
lot. Another alternative would be to remove `EFFECT_` from this enum so
we just have `SOLID_FROM_BELOW` and `SOLID_` (because right now, the
three instances of `EFFECT_` are eating 21 characters right away). We
need to either expand the limit, shrink the names, or be okay with our
code becoming ugly.

Anyway, if I should just run the formatter and call it good for now, let
me know, otherwise we can keep this PR staged as a "once we resolve the
column limit, then we put this one in".

[No GBP] Fixes the secret bottomless pit in the ethereal pirate shuttle (#78138)

## About The Pull Request

I DIDNT NOTICE THAT ALL THE DIRT IN THE ETHEREAL SHUTTLE HAD CHASM
BASETURFS FUCK FUCK FUCK


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/63932673/ba5f7b02-7577-48ad-b2bc-b8b1c0e4192f)

(Also rebalances the ship a bit by adding some more turrets and cleans
up the wonky turf decals and engines)
## Why It's Good For The Game

God's strongest mapper needs to get some sleep asap I'm so fucking tired

A few people also pointed out that only having two turrets was extremely
punishing even for the playstyle I was trying to encourage, so it makes
sense to add a little wiggle room.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Gave the bluespace geode pirates 4 more teleporter bolt
turrets.
fix: The bluespace geode pirates no longer have a bluespace portal to
the bottomless pit dimension.
add: Station-safe dirt tiles for all your mapping needs, but surely no
station maps use the chasm baseturf ones, right? Right?

Included ES6 Alternative set up

Love MSW and the ideas behind it. The community seems pretty cool to 😎.

I believe my dev experience with MSW would have been better had something like this been included in the docs.

The set up described before this change caused errors for me. Nesting the import(path/to/browser.ts) did not behave in the same way that a require would, and `import * as name from` wasn't possible in an if condition.

While this change might not be crucial, I really think it will be helpful to new users coming to MSW.

Hope you can consider it. Happy to edit it if there are layout issues.
