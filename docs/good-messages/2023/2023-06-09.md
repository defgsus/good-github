I want to dip my brain in a can of paint thinner

Fixes the authentication issue. We were querying for columns that didn't exist in the User database and because Prisma is Prisma (this is not a complement) we weren't getting any errors relating to the issue. Fixed lines in 'api/dist/functions/auth.js', 'api/src/functions/auth.js' and 'api/src/lib/auth.js'. Holy Fuckles it's knuckles this one was a doozy

It's been bugging me for a long time, but when you fire for a good dozen
seconds with the standard issue smartguns, the bullets start scattering.
So, so far you'll say, good Fira, that's soulful!

However, we have no ACTUAL recoil or similar mechanic. So letting go of
the LMB for just even 20 miliseconds is enough to reset scatter to start
of firing. **It's just a noobtrap with zero real gameplay elements.**

This reduces the max scatter so that bullets don't just start (after
EIGHTY shots!) spraying a (roughly) 48° angle cone, but instead 12°
which mostly stays on the same actual turfs. At this value the targeting
impact is vastly minimized, but the projectile visuals retain
significant scattering.

I don't think this ACTUALLY qualifies as a "balance" change due to how
irrelevant the "mechanic" was, but i'll slap it on.

# Explain why it's good for the game
Less of a noobtrap and pointless purely mechanical micromanagement so
people can focus on playing the game.

I'd rather we get a recoil mechanic to make this meaningful but it's bit
of a bigger problem...

# Changelog
:cl:
qol: Reduced USCM SG max scattering on Full Auto fire so you don't have
to periodically let go of the fire button to keep it from firing way
wide.

The Twinkleshine is a CyberSun-made Syndicate display of force, staffed
by every branch of the Syndicate. Despite the silly name, the presence
of one in a sector implies it to be of importance to the Syndicate, and
enemies within sight can only pray that the Twinkleshine crew are
incompetent enough to shoot themselves with their own weaponry (or blow
themselves up with the supermatter on-board).

It is staffed by:

- 1 Captain
- 1 Lieutenant (previously the Operative - serves as a warden/hos)
- 2 Medics
- 2 Engineers (previously the Mechanics)
- 5 Operatives (previously the Troopers)
- 1 Bartender
- 1 Miner
- 2 Deck Assistants

## Why It's Good For The Game

Few days ago, an admin spawned a Twinkleshine, and I got to captain it.
The Twinkleshine is old. It sucks. This, hopefully, fixes that.

Originally, this was going to be minor fixes, but ended up becoming an
attempt at reworking the ship to a more modern state - the hull has been
redone and is mostly symmetrical, the old spacepod was replaced with a
Dark Gygax, the supermatter shouldn't be activated upon spawning the
ship, there's more turf decals and a bigger lot-of-things, added a
bartender and a miner, people can actually tell who they are and what
they do, and there is now a box moth. Rejoice.

Also, this is the first time I've ever mapped a ship. What better way to
begin with a giant battleship?

[MIRROR] Changes syndicate surgery duffelbags to contain advanced tools [MDB IGNORE] (#21619)

* Changes syndicate surgery duffelbags to contain advanced tools (#75846)

## About The Pull Request

Changes syndicate surgery duffelbags to contain advanced tools.

In total, they contain
- All advanced surgical tools, alongside the normal ones without an
advanced version
- Sterilizine gel
- Bone gel and surgical tape
- Roller bed
- Straight jacket, muzzle, and MMI

Changed the Syndicate Infiltrators' surgery areas to contain a full
syndicate surgery duffelbag.

The normal infiltrator now has a operating computer and a closet of
misc. surgical clothing and anesthesic tank.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Changes syndicate surgery duffelbags to contain advanced tools.

> In total, they contain (...)

The only real reason to buy this item is for the increased storage space
the duffelbag gives, and I find that a little sad. Surgical tools are
plentiful, as they can either be lathed from cargo, medbay, or just
taken. A surgeon, the role that *should* thematically need this the
most, has absolutely no reason to take it. Now they do! A full set of
advanced tools is certainly something that can be considered for
purchase, especially with all the bonus items in here - which might just
allow a traitor to repair their bones if they're heavily wanted and
licking their wounds in maintenance. The TC cost has been increased to 4
to compensate.

> Changed the Syndicate Infiltrators' surgery areas to contain a full
syndicate surgery duffelbag.

Similar to above, but instead, the reasoning is that nukies really do
not have a lot of time to do surgery. A lot of the 20 minutes of prep
time in War is spent figuring out what you're buying with your
exorbitant amount of TC, in non-War you don't really want to delay the
mission for five minutes for surgery, and its hassle means that most
people do not really want to bother with things like nerve threading,
etc. due to the large, annoying time cost.

> The normal infiltrator now has a operating computer and a closet of
misc. surgical clothing and anesthesic tank.

The former is because, well, what the hell, why didn't it have one!
Removing the loose tools gave me the space for it. The latter is just me
realizing that empty closet is weird and lame and so I gave it some
fluff contents to give it a reason to exist.

## Changelog

add: Changes syndicate surgery duffelbags to contain advanced tools,
sterilizine, surgical tape, and a roller bed.
add: Changed the Syndicate Infiltrators' surgery areas to contain a full

torch.compiler public namespace (#102182)

# torch.compiler public API

## Goal

The goal of this document is to describe the public facing API for torchdynamo and torchinductor.

Today both dynamo and torchinductor are in `torch/_dynamo` and `torch/_inductor` namespace with the only public function

`torch.compile()` which is directly placed in `torch/__init__.py`

This poses a few problems for users trying to take dependencies on PyTorch 2.0
1. Unclear BC guarantees
2. No builtin discovery mechanism outside of reading the source code
3. No hard requirements for docstrings or type annotations

Most importantly it mixes two personas the PyTorch 2.0 developer vs the PyTorch 2.0 customer so this is an attempt to address this. We draw a lot of inspiration from the `functorch` migration to the `func` namespace.

## Alternate names

We did discuss some other alternative names

1. `torch.compile` -> problem is this would break BC on the existing `torch.compile` function
2. `torch.dynamo` -> `dynamo` is so far not something we've deliberately hidden from users but problem is now figuring out what it's `_dynamo` vs `dynamo` might be confusing
3. `torch.compiler` -> 1 would be better but to keep BC this is a good compromise

# The general approach
## Proposal 1
In https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py

We have function called `reset()`, this function is essential if users are trying to `torch.compile()` a model under different settings

```python
# in _dynamo/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff()
```

Instead we propose

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff() # As in copy paste the logic from _dynamo.reset

# in _dynamo/
import warnings
import inspect

def reset():
    function_name = inspect.currentframe().f_code.co_name
    warnings.warn(f"{function_name} is deprecated, use compiler.{function_name} instead", DeprecationWarning)
    return compiler.reset()

```
## Proposal 2

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    “””
    Docstrings here
    “””
    _dynamo.reset()

# in _dynamo/
No changes
```
Consensus so far seems to be proposal 2 since fewer warnings will be less jarring and it’ll make it quite easy to merge the public API

## Docstrings

The above was an example of a function that has no inputs or outputs but there are other functions which could use an improvement in their docstrings, for example allow_in_graph actually works over lists of functions but that’s not mentioned anywhere in the example only if you read the source code.

def allow_in_graph(fn):
    """
    Customize which functions TorchDynamo will include in the generated
    graph. Similar to `torch.fx.wrap()`.

    Parameters:
        fn (callable or list/tuple): The function(s) to be allowed in the graph.

    Returns:
        callable or list/tuple: The input function(s) included in the graph.

    Examples:
        Customize inclusion of a single function:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph(my_custom_function)

        Customize inclusion of multiple functions:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph([my_custom_function1, my_custom_function2])

        @torch._dynamo.optimize(...)
        def fn(a):
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            x = my_custom_function(x)
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            return x

        fn(...)

    Notes:
        The `allow_in_graph` function allows customization of which functions TorchDynamo
        includes in the generated graph. It can be used to include specific functions that
        are not automatically captured by TorchDynamo.

        If `fn` is a list or tuple, `allow_in_graph` will be called recursively on each
        element in the sequence.

        Once a function is allowed in the graph using `allow_in_graph`, it will be captured
        in the graph generated by TorchDynamo. This customization enables more fine-grained
        control over the functions included in the graph.

        Note that `allow_in_graph` expects the input `fn` to be a callable.

    """
    if isinstance(fn, (list, tuple)):
        return [allow_in_graph(x) for x in fn]
    assert callable(fn), "allow_in_graph expects a callable"
    allowed_functions._allowed_function_ids.add(id(fn))
    allowed_functions._disallowed_function_ids.remove(id(fn))
    return fn

So to make the API public, we’d have to write similar docstrings for all public functions we’d like to create.

The benefit of this approach is that
1. No BC risks, internal and external users relying on our tooling can slowly wean off the private functions.
2. We will also have to write correct docstrings which will automatically make our documentation easier to maintain and render correctly on pytorch.org
3. We already have some BC guarantees already, we don’t kill OptimizedModule, we rejected the PR to change the config system

The con of this approach is that
Will be stuck with some potentially suboptimal functions/classes that you can’t kill

## Testing strategy
If the approach is to mostly make a public function call an already tested private function then all we need to do is ensure that the function signatures don't change

## Which functions should be in the public API

Our heuristic for deciding whether something should be public or not is are users already relying on it for lack of other options or have we recommended some non public functions for users to debug their PT 2.0 programs.

Heuristic for not putting something in public is that it’s an experimental subsystem with the goal of turning it on by default, it’s very core dev centric, meta centric, a bunch of different configs that should be batched into a single user facing one, or something that needs to be renamed because the name is confusing

#### Top level
`torch.compile()` -> already is a public API it does require some minor improvements like having configs be passed in to any backend and not just inductor (EDIT: This was already done https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/99645l) and renaming `mode=reduce-overhead` to `mode=cudagraph`

To make sure that PT 2.0 is supported with a given pytorch version users can create a new public function and this would replace the need for `try/except` blocks around `import torch._dynamo` that has been populating user code.

```python
def pt2_enabled():
    if hasattr(torch, 'compile'):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

For all of the below they will be translated to `torch.compiler.function_name()`

#### From _dynamo

As a starting point we looked at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py and we suggest redefining these functions in `pytorch/torch/compiler/__init__.py`

It might also make sense to split them over multiple files and import them in `__init__.py` but because the number of functions is small it'd probably be fine to add them all into a single compiler/__init__.py until this list becomes larger

1. `reset()`
2. `allow_in_graph()`
10. `list_backends()`
12. `compile()`:  torch.compile() would be mostly a shell function passing arguments to torch.compiler.compile()
13. `assume_constant_result()`: TODO: Double check how this is useful
15. `torch._dynamo.disable()`

Some notable omissions
11. `explain()`: We need to clean up the output for this function, make it a data class and pretty printable
1. `forbid_in_graph()`: Considered adding this but should instead consolidate on `disallow_in_graph`
2. `optimize_assert()`: Already covered by `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`
3. `check_if_dynamo_supported()`: this would be supplanted by pt2_enabled()
4. `compilation_metrics`, `graph_breaks_reasons` ..: would all be accessed via `torch.compiler.explain()`
5. `replay` does not seem useful to end customers
6. . `graph_break()`: Mostly useful for debugging or unit tests
9. `register_backend()`: End users will just pass a string backend to torch.compile, only devs will create new backends
10. `export()` : Eventually this needs to public but for now it’s not ready so just highlighting that it will be in the public API eventually
11. `disallow_in_graph()`: Usage is limited
12. `mark_static()`: we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in stable
13. `mark_dynamic()`:  we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in trunk
14. 8. `OptimizedModule`: This is the only class that we'd expose but is crucial since users are running code like `if isinstance(mod, OptimizedModule): torch.save(mod._orig_mod)` EDIT: because we fixed pickling we no longer need to
expose this
15. `is_compiling()`: Still not clear how this useful to end users

There are also config variables which we need to expose https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/config.py

Some of our configs are useful dev flags, others are to gate experimental functionality and others are essential debugging tools and we seperate out the essential debugging and logging tools to a public facing config.

TODO: I still need to think of a good way of porting the config in a BC way here are some ideas
1. Just make all passes available and controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but only show docstrings for the ones users should care about.

The current problem with our config system is we have 3 ways of setting them once via `options={}`, environment variables and variables in `config.py`, it'd be worth settling on one source of truth and have that be the public API.

The configs we should make public are
1. `log_file_name`
2. `verbose`
3. `cache_size_limit`
4. `repro_level` and `repro_after`: Although we can rename these to minifier and give human readable names to the levels

Everything else should stay private in particular

1. `print_graph_breaks`, `print_specializations`: should be supplanted by `explain()` for public users
2. dynamic shape configs : Users should only have to worry about `torch.compile(dynamic=True/False)`
3. The distributed flags, hook or guard configs: If we tell a user to use FSDP and DDP then the flag should be enabled by default or be in a private namespace
4. The fbcode flags: Obviously no need to be user facing
5. Skip/Allow lists: Not something normal users should play around with

#### From _inductor
Very little of inductor should be exposed in a public facing API, our core audience as in people writing models mostly just need information on what certain passes mean and how to control them a high level and they can do this with `torch.compile(options={})` so the goal here should be more to make available passes clearer and ideally consolidate them into `torch.compile()` docstrings or modes.

There are some exceptions though from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_inductor/__init__.py

1. `list_mode_options()`
2. `list_options()`: this needs an additional pass to hide internal or debug options

For both of these we’d rename them to compiler.inductor_list_mode_options and compiler.inductor_list_options() since they would be in the same init file as the one for dynamo

Notable omissions
1. `_inductor.compile()`: Because of users are coming in with their own fx graph, they are likely developers
2. `_inductor.aot_compile()`:Again this is about capturing and modifying fx graphs so users APIs don't need to be public

However the configs are a slightly different story, because we can choose to either
1. Make all configs public
2. Make some configs public and keep most of the private ones. If public config is set it should override the private version
3. Make all configs controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but make list_options() hide more things

For now 3 seems like the most reasonable choice with some high level configs we’ll keep like TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Regardless here's what should probably be public or advertised more
1. `disable_progress` and verbose_progress:  Combine and enable by default
2. `fallback_random`: We could make the case this shouldn't be public if a top level deterministic mode enables this
3. `profile_bandwidth`: Or could make the case that this should be in TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Notable omissions
1. Any config that would generally improve performance for most that we should probably enable by default but might be disabled in the short term because of stability: example `epilogue_fusion`, `pattern_matcher`, `reordering`
2. Autotuning flags: Should just sit behind `torch.compile(mode="max-autotune")` like `max_autotune`, `max_autotune_gemm`
3. `coordinate_descent_tuning`: This one I'm a but mixed about, maybe it just also fall into `mode="max-autotune"`
4. `trace`: `TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG` is the best flag for all of this
5. `triton.cudagraphs`: Default should be `torch.compile(mode="reduce-overhead")` - I'd go further and rename the `mode=cudagraph` and we can keep reduce-overhead for BC reasons
6. `triton_unique_kernel_names`: Mostly useful for devs debugging
7. `dce`: which doesnt really do anything
8. `shape_padding`: Elias is working on enabling this by default in which case we also remove it

## Mechanics

This PR would include the public functions with their docstrings

Another PR will take a stab at the configs

And for work where the APIs are still being cleaned up whether its minifier or escape hatches, export or dynamic shapes, aot_inductor etc.. we’ll keep them private until a public commitment can be made

## About The Pull Request
It's kinda strange that security plasmamen has no proper armor and you
can just bully them with bottlesmashes. Literally.
Also suits had no wound armor for some reason, which considering that
mold dies without hand kinda silly too.
And helmets just had no armor besides 1 melee armor.
## Why It's Good For The Game
Plasmamen security won't die that easilly. I mean, still easy to kill
them, but not that much.

lvm: add support for "all" checks

It seems rather inconvenient to have to specify all those switches by
hand. Right now, I need to specify -gpst to get all the stats and, if
some new metric get added (e.g. #159 hopefully), I need to remember to
update my callers to match. This is annoying.

Let's make a -a that's going to do it all for us. Hell, i'd make it
the default, personally, if I wasn't worried about breaking people's
stuff...

This obviously conflicts with other PRs that might add another flag
like this, like #159. Please prioritize the latter.

Allows Export of your Preferences JSON File (#75014)

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

This was spoken about in #70492 (specifically
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/70492#issuecomment-1278069607),
and I have been waiting for this to be implemented for some time. It
never got implemented, so I decided to code it myself.

Basically, **if the server host doesn't disable it**, you are free to
export your JSONs as a player, right from the stat-panel. It's a pretty
JSON on 515 versions, too!

It's right here:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235251447-1c977718-51fd-4025-8d89-c60bffc379ec.png)

Here's what the prettified JSON looks like on 515.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235321061-4a217e26-c082-4bba-b54a-2c780defda0a.png)

There's a cooldown (default to 10 seconds) between exporting your
preferences.

#### Why is this config?

It's because in the past, a server host could always just file-share the
.sav or .json or whatever to the player, but they would have to do the
explicit option of actually bothering to make the files accessible to
the player. In that same line of logic, the server operator will have to
explicitly make the files accessible. This is mostly because I'm not
sure how good `ftp()` is at being a player function and wanted to have
some sort of cap/control somehow in case an exploit vector is detected
or it's just plain spammed by bots, so we'll just leave it up to the
direct providers of this data to elect if they wish to provide the data
or not.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Players don't have to log into Server A to remember what hairstyle they
loved using when they want to swap to Server B! That's amazing actually.
I always forget what ponytail my character has, and it'll be nice to
have the hairstyle in a readily accessible place (after I prettify the
JSON for myself).

It's also more convenient for server hosts to make player data like this
accessible if they really want to, too.

If we ever add an _import_ feature in the future (which would have to be
done with a LOT of care), this will also be useful. I wouldn't advise it
though having taken a precursory look at how much goes into it while
trying to ascertain the scope of this PR.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: The game now supports export of your preferences into a JSON file!
The verb (export-preferences) should now be available in the OOC tab of
your stat-panel if enabled by server operators.
server: Exporting player preferences is controlled by a configuration
option, 'FORBID_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'. If you do not wish to let clients
access the ftp() function to their own preferences file (probably for
bandwidth reasons?) you should uncomment this or add it to your config
somehow.
config: Server operators are also able to set the cooldown between
requests to download the JSON Preferences file via the
'SECONDS_COOLDOWN_FOR_PREFERENCES_EXPORT' config option.

Gunpoints now take half a second to activate, make gasp sounds, and briefly immobilize the shooter and target, other small balance changes (#74036)

## About The Pull Request
This PR messes around with gunpoints a bit, with the purpose of making
them more viable in certain scenarios without making them obnoxious. The
biggest change is that gunpoints now require a 0.5 second do_after()
where neither the shooter nor the target moves, and immobilizes both of
them for 0.75 seconds if point blank, or half that if you're 2 tiles
away. Originally you were supposed to only be able to initiate a
gunpoint from point-blank, but #56601 seems to have removed that
requirement, so we'll run with it and just leave it as advantageous to
gunpoint closer up. The do_after() reinforces that it should be used as
an ambush tactic, and so you can't use it on someone who's actively
fleeing or fighting you.

Getting held up will now make you emit a shocked gasp sound, a la Metal
Gear Solid, which combined with the short immobilize will hopefully make
it more noticeable that someone's pointing a gun at you.

Holdups will now immediately give a 25% bonus to damage and wounds,
instead of having to wait 2.5 seconds to hit the double damage stage.

Finally, right clicking someone that you're holding up will no longer
shoot them. That just feels like good consistency.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Hopefully makes gunpoints a little more viable for when you want to
stick someone who's not expecting it up without them immediately jetting
off. In the future I'd like to ape Baycode and let the gunman have an
action that toggles whether the victim is allowed to move, so you can
order them to move to a second location without instantly shooting them,
but that'll come later.
## Changelog
:cl: Ryll/Shaps
balance: Holding someone at gunpoint now requires both the shooter and
the victim to hold still for half a second before activating, so you
can't hold-up people fleeing or fighting you. After that, it will
briefly immobilize the both of you, 0.75 seconds if adjacent, or half
that if you're two tiles away. Nuke ops are immune to the
immobilization, since they're ready to die anyways.
balance: Holding someone up will immediately apply a 1.25x damage and
wound multiplier, rather than waiting 2.5 seconds to hit 2x.
soundadd: Being held up will now make the victim play a sharp gasp
sound, a la Metal Gear Solid.
qol: Trying to hold someone up that you're already holding up will no
longer shoot them.

The "feces addict" update

Main event: melee is implemented again, but actually general now. All items work with melee, with some items having unique melee effects where necessary (mainly homing, split shots, etc.). You can also charge up weapons, like the bat. There's a charge bar visual that comes up that is general, but probably should introduce a variable that can be adjusted to change the charge time of weapons.

Also:

Fixed orb 2 targetting player (nice once)
Fixed gunners just not fucking shooting (lmao)
Fixed some sawshot shit
Fixed curses that take away your items on hit not re-applying items to the player (before they'd just get removed lol)

And a bunch of other shit. Melee is fun yipee

Welding Fuel Tanks now log_bomber when hit by projectile (#75885)

## About The Pull Request

This was intended behavior, but I think a lot of bullshit over the years
sorta corrupted this proc's intention. Anyways, we just override the
whole ass proc for this one check, give a good return value (or at least
the same one that we were always giving) if our criteria is met, rather
than deal with the problems that parent was feeding us.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/e2b39140-d365-43aa-8834-2740f9fa5036)

The specific issue here was that the parent of `bullet_act()` was
invoking `take_damage()` which prematurely invoked `boom()` which
invokes `qdel()`, meaning that the `QDELETED()` check would _always_
early return without fail every time.

Let's just do our own thing here.
## Why It's Good For The Game


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/ca8fdeba-9f5d-4bed-afba-88824d389cfb)

Intended behavior actually works.
## Changelog
:cl:
admin: Shooting a welding fuel tank (big or small) with a projectile
will now accurately post to list_bombers with the name of the person who
shot the projectile from the gun. If you don't know how to list-bombers,
it will also be present in game.log for your viewing pleasure.

Context-free-grammars (#1097)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

context-free-grammar

### Eval description

This tests the ability for GPT-4 to evaluate whether or not a string can
be produced by a given context-free grammar.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is an interesting computational task. Context-free languages are
important in linguistics, and it will be interesting to see
how a language model fares in handling this task.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [✅] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [✅] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [✅] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [✅] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)
I've handcrafted a lot of these examples. Some of them are there to
'trick' the model––I think it will be a useful test to see how well the
language model can do at those.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [✅] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [✅] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [✅] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [✅] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [✅] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who

Russian verse (#979)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
russian-verse

### Eval description

The most popular Russian poems that nearly every Russian speaker can
recall

### What makes this a useful eval?

Understanding a basic Russian poem or any foreign literature is
significant for a Language Learning Model (LLM) like GPT-4 because it
enhances multilingual ability, provides cultural context, and improves
understanding of language structure. It makes the model globally useful,
and culturally sensitive.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install

Remove skill training restrictions (hellmonk)

After the old XP pool system was removed and the current skill training
system was added, one odd edge case was that you had to have an item, spell,
or god ability somehow relevant to a skill to be able to train it. This was
not particularly consistent. For example, training got special-cased to be
always allowed to avoid annoyance when you'd thrown everything you had, and
pain brand, though depending on necromancy, did not allow you to train it.

In general, it's better to have less complexity and fewer special cases, so
by default it seems good to remove these rather complex restrictions. The
argument against has been that training these skills is rarely useful (true,
but so are many things players do!), and that a massive skill screen would
intimidate new players. Thankfully, to avoid the latter case, we can retain
much of the old code to hide many skills by default, while still allowing
experienced players to use them, in the same way that they can use manual
training instead of automatic. In fact, since we no longer need to special
case Throwing, new players will often see a smaller skill screen than before!

Gym Leader Rematches!

This commit adds a large fundamental change to KEP, that being Gym Rematches.

This is achieved alongside a rework to the script that makes those post-game-gating NPCs shift around. If you add a new one, just add its constant to the lists you'll see in the Hall of Fame script.

It also fixes a few bugs:
- Fixed a bug where Cinnabar Gym loaded a fleet of Blaines. This occurred due to the way he is coded at base, and a misunderstanding I had when implementing his scaling. This is now fixed by standardising his gym script instead, while letting the gym trainers still use the old one.
- Fixed a bug where the Up-Grade NPC would not appear after beating Silph Co. 11F. However, Giovanni currently seems to have trouble with his text. This floor needs some re-coding anyway, given we need to add Jessie and James to it.

And some misc. changes:
- Changed the first Moon Stone in Mt. Moon to a Poison Stone for the Nidoking speedrunners
- Debug Mode now has a line of code to set up the post-game easily
- Changed Surge's initial battle text to Yellow's
- Added Sabrina's more accurate LGPE initial battle text, referring to the spoon she bent by accident

Fix test_process_scan_above by fixing getDNAmolHeightStats

been digging away at the bug and I finally found it after too many hours.
It comes down to the lines in getDNAmolHeightStats…
Firstly, we have the swapping axes line that Neil pointed out is weird in a comment…
    def getDNAmolHeightStats(self):
        # Why are axes swapped here?
        self.image_data = np.swapaxes(self.image_data, 0, 1)
I really don’t think this is right, as when I print out some diagnostic logs…
image data shape : (119, 123)
binary map shape: (123, 119)
But that’s not all
The line
self.average_height = np.average(self.image_data[np.argwhere(self.binary_map == 1)])
does not do what one would expect (me included until a while back when I learned this in a similarly infuriating bug) I’m so annoyed that I didn’t spot it since I’ve already experienced it.
It appears really intuitive that stuffing an array of coordinates as the index for a numpy array, would return those points in the array…
my_2d_array = np.array(
    [
        [1, 2],
        [3, 4],
        [5, 6],
    ]
)

coordinates = np.array([[1]])
print(my_2d_array[coordinates])

print('---')

coordinates = np.array([1, 0])
print(my_2d_array[coordinates])

print('---')

coordinates = np.array([[1, 0], [2, 1]])
print(my_2d_array[coordinates])
But this does not do what is intended:
[[[3 4]]]
---
[[3 4]
 [1 2]]
---
[[[3 4]
  [1 2]]

 [[5 6]
  [3 4]]]
This is because it actually just prints each element of the 1st dimension of the array, eg in the first example, it prints the 1st element, which is the array [3, 4]. In the third example, it prints the 1st and 0th array, then the 2nd and 1st array.
As a result, I think that not only did the method often crash due to indexing errors, but also, it was grabbing completely the wrong pixels too? How long has it been like this? Luckily it doesn’t seem to have been used previously, so it might not have caused a problem historically??
I believe the solution is to firstly remove the swap axes line, and then to use the (I believe) intended way to index based on a list of coordinates:
    def getDNAmolHeightStats(self):

        coordinates = np.argwhere(self.binary_map == 1)
        flat_indices = np.ravel_multi_index(coordinates.T, self.image_data.shape)
        heights = self.image_data.flat[flat_indices]
        self.average_height = np.average(heights)
Which flattens everything and converts the list of coordinates into flattened coordinates using some modular arithmetic.
This took infuriatingly long to figure out, since my_array[coordinates] just seems so intuitive, so I spent most of my time searching elsewhere… :laughing:
This solution results in the regression test for test_process_scan_above  to ALMOST match!
The only differences are…
contour_lengths is now contour_length
A blank space character before every value under contour_lengths . This I think is caused by the aforementioned character removal
I have now made the change to test_processing.test_process_scan_above.out - removing the “s” and removing the whitespace before each value, and the test passes! (eventually - 36 seconds is a long time!)

feat(gpu)!: GPU/OptiX support of ReParameter (#1686)

BREAKING CHANGE: to RendererServices ABI (including for CPU) and to
the renderer-side setup when using OptiX.

This overhauls the implementation of how interactively-editable
parameters work, where they live in memory, and get it all working on
GPU/OptiX so that renderers can support interactive adjustment of
those params without recompiling shaders.

The basic gist is as follows:

* We continue work to finish making a clean separation between
  "interpolated" parameters and "interactive" (editable) parameters.

* Interpolated params are collected and put into a separate memory
  area -- a separate per-group allocation on both the CPU and GPU
  (where applicable). It needs to remember the offset into this arena
  where each of the interpolated parameters resides. These allocations
  and eventual release are taken care of by the OSL shading system,
  they live in the ShaderGroup. When the group is set up, this block
  of memory is initialized with the correct initial values of the
  params and are ready to go.

* The implementation of ReParameter writes to this special memory
  area also, that's how it works now (both CPU and GPU).

* How does the OSL library know how to allocate, free, and copy to the
  device memory? It doesn't! Instead, we add new RendererServices
  methods `device_alloc()`, `device_free()`, and
  `copy_to_device()`. It's up to the renderer to provide those, so
  that the OSL library doesn't itself need to know about the Cuda
  runtime. These are trivial, there's really only one implementation
  that makes sense, and you can copy it from the ones in testshade and
  testrender.

* Interactive parameters are NOT constant folded during runtime
  optimization.

* The shader entry points themselves now take an extra parameter in
  the main call -- this will be the pointer to the beginning of the
  shader group's interactive parameter arena.

* When JITing, references to interactive parameters know to retrieve
  them from their designated offset into the interactive parameter
  area.

* This means that the renderer-side OptiX/Cuda code is responsible for
  adding this extra pointer parameter to the call to the shader entry
  points. You can see how this is done in the testshade and testrender
  Cuda code.

* It's up to the renderer to figure out how to make the OptiX hit program
  aware of the interactive parameter pointer for that particular material,
  in order to pass it to the osl shader entry point. The way I did it in
  testshade and testrender is using a field in the struct that's given
  to each entry of the shader binding table and can be retrieved on the
  OptiX side via optixGetSbtDataPointer(). In testshade/testrender, a
  data pointer already existed which wasn't used. In a real renderer, you
  may need to add a field or come up with whatever other way you want
  to somehow get this pointer, which can be retrieved via

      shadingsys->getattribute(shadergroupptr, "device_interactive_params",
                               TypeDesc::PTR, &myptr);

  you can see how I do that in optixraytracer.cpp (testrender) and in
  optixgridrender.cpp (testshade).

A number of other things you will see that's worth calling out:

I added a device_ptr utility template that is just a wrapper around a
device side pointer that makes it hard to accidentally dereference it
on the host side.

Since I was changing RendererServices anyway, I also remove unused
register_global, fetch_global, global_map which were unused. They were
leftovers from the way we handled strings in OptiX 6.x.

Encapsulate cuda global symbol name mangling into
BackendLLVM::global_unique_symname(). I did this early on, turns out
it wasn't necessary, but I still like that encapsulation, so I'm
keeping it.

I bumped the 3rd set of digits in the version to reflect that the
changes in RendererServices break ABI. This is only in main, it
obviously cannot be backported to a release branch.

All tests pass for scalar and batch and optix.

I added a new simple reparam test, and renamed the old reparem to
reparam-array. Oddly, the reparam-array test doesn't work properly on
optix (it had never been tried before), but it also failed in optix at
main -- so it's not related to this patch! Putting that on my list of
other oddities to investigate later. It may just be a quirk of
testshade, I'm not really sure yet.

Added to BackendLLVM (and batched) a llvm_ptr_type(TypeSpec) method
that returns the LLVM type of a pointer to the specified type.

Note: This patch doesn't account for the face that a parameter marked
"interactive" could prevent a shader from correctly building for the GPU
because it used the kind of construct that is fine in shader source code but
only will work on GPU if it can be resolved to be a constant by the time
we get done with the runtime optimization (as pointed out by Stephen
Friedman. We'll come back to the problem later with a more robust and
automatic fix -- and if we are lucky, Stephen will have the opportunity to
upstream the approach he already has.

8.1 Token Types & The ApiToken Entity

 Okay, so what if you need to allow programmatic access to your API?

 The Types of Access Tokens
 - When you talk to an API via code, you send an API token, commonly known as an access token:

 fetch('/api/kittens', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer THE-ACCESS-TOKEN',
    }
 });
 Exactly how you get that token will vary. But there are two main cases.

 First, as a user on the site, like a dragon, you want to generate an API token so that you can personally use it in a script you're writing. This is like a GitHub personal access token. These are literally created via a web interface. We're going to show this.

 The second main use case is when a third party wants to make requests to your API on behalf of a user of your system. Like some new site called DragonTreasureOrganizer.com wants to be able to make an API request to our API on behalf of some of our users - like it will fetch the treasure's for a user and display them artfully on their site. In this situation, instead of our users generating tokens manually and then... like... entering them into that site, you'll offer OAuth. OAuth is basically a mechanism for normal users to securely give access tokens for their account to a third party. And so, your site, or somewhere in your infrastructure you'll have an OAuth server.

 That's beyond the scope of this tutorial. But the important thing is that after OAuth is done, the API client wll end up with, you guessed it, an API token! So no matter which journey you're in, if you're doing programmatic access, your API users will end up with an access token. And then your job will be to read and understand that. We'll do exactly that.

 JWT vs Database Storage?
 - So as I mentioned, we're going to show a system where we allow users to generate their own access tokens. So how do we do that? Again, there are two main ways. Death by choices!

 The first is to generate something called a JSON Web Token or JWT. The cool thing about JWTs are that no database storage is needed. They're special strings that actually contain info inside of them. For example, you could create a JWT string that includes the user id and some scopes.

 One downside of JWTs are that there's no easy way to "log out"... because there's no out-of-the-box way to invalidate JWTs. You give them an expiration when you create them... but then they're valid until then... no matter what, unless you add some extra complexity... which kinda defeats the purpose.

 JWT's are trendy, popular and fun! But... you may not need them. They're awesome when you have a single sign-on system because, if that JWT is used to authenticate with multiple systems or APIs, each API can validate the JWT all on their own: without needing to make an API request to a central authentication system.

 So you might end up using JWTs and there's a great bundle for them called LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle. JWT's are also the type of access token that OpenID gives you in the end.

 Instead of JWTs, the second main option is dead simple: generate a random token string and store it in the database. This also allows you to invalidate access tokens by... just deleting them! This is what we'll do.

 Generating the Entity
 - So let's get to work. To store API tokens, we need a new entity! Find your terminal and run:

  php ./bin/console make:entity
 And let's call it ApiToken. Say no to making this an API resource. In theory, you could allow users to authenticate via a login form or HTTP basic and then send a POST request to create API tokens if you want to... but we won't.

 Add an ownedBy property. This is going to be a ManyToOne to User and not nullable. And I'll say "yes" to the inverse. So the idea is that every User can have many API tokens. When an API token is used, we want to know which User it's related to. We'll use that during authentication. Calling the property apiTokens is fine and say no to orphan removal. Next property: expiresAt, make that a datetime_immutable and I'll say yes to nullable. Maybe we allow tokens to never expire by leaving this field blank. Next up is token, which will be a string. I'm going to set the length to 68 - we'll see why in a minute - not nullable. And finally, add a scopes property as a json type. This is going to be kind of cool: we'll store an array of "permissions" that this API token should have. Say, not nullable on that one as well. Hit enter to finish.

 All right, spin over to your editor. No surprises: that created an ApiToken entity... and there's nothing very interesting inside of it

 So let's go over and make the migration for it:

  symfony console make:migration
 Spin over and peek at that file to make sure it looks good. Yup! It creates the api_token table

 Run that with:

  symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
 And... awesome! Next: let's add a way to generate the random token string. Then, we'll talk about scopes and load up our fixtures with some API tokens.

9.2 Setting up the Fixtures
 - Ok! This is set up! So let's add some API tokens to the database. At your terminal, run

  php ./bin/console make:factory
 so we can generate a Foundry factory for ApiToken. Go check out the new class: src/Factory/ApiTokenFactory.php. Down in getDefaults()

 This looks mostly fine, though we don't need to pass in the token. Oh, and I want to tweak the scopes

 Typically, when you create an access token - whether it's a personal access token or one created through OAuth - you're able to choose which permissions that token will have: it does not automatically have all the permissions that a normal user would. I want to add that into our system as well.

 Back over in ApiToken, at the top, after the first constant, I'll paste in a few more

 This defines three different scopes that a token can have. This isn't all the scopes we could imagine, but it's enough to make things realistic. So, when you create a token, you can choose whether that token should have permission to edit user data, or whether it can create treasures on behalf of the user or whether it can edit treasures on behalf of the user. I also added a public const SCOPES to describes them

 Back over in our ApiTokenFactory, let's, by default, give each ApiToken two of those three scopes

 Ok! ApiTokenFactory is ready. Last step: open AppFixtures so we can create some ApiToken fixtures. I want to make sure that, in our dummy data, each user has at least one or two API tokens. An easy way to do that, down here is to say ApiTokenFactory::createMany(). Since we have 10 users, let's create 30 tokens. Then pass that a callback function and, inside, return an override for the default data. We're going to override the ownedBy to be UserFactory::random()

 So this will create 30 tokens and assign them randomly to the 10, well really 11, users in the database. So on average, each user should have about three API tokens assigned to them. I'm doing this because, to keep life simple, we're not going to build a user interface where the user can actually click and create access tokens and select scopes. We're going to skip all that. Instead, since every user will already have some API tokens in the database, we can jump straight to learning how to read and validate those tokens.

 Reload the fixtures with:

  symfony console doctrine:fixtures:load

13.1 Deny Access with The "security" Option
 We've just talked a lot about authentication: that's the way we tell the API who we are. Now we turn to authorization, which is all about denying access to certain operations and other things based on who you are.

 Using access_control
 - There are multiple ways to control access to something. The simplest is in config/packages/security.yaml. Just like normal Symfony security, down here, we have an access_control section

 If you want to lock down a specific URL pattern by a specific role, use access_control. You could use this, for example, to require that the user has a role to use anything in your API by targeting URLs starting with /api.

 Hello "security" Option
 - In a traditional web app, I do use access_control for several things. But most of the time I put my authorization rules inside controllers. But... of course, with API Platform, we don't have controllers. All we have are API resource classes, like DragonTreasure. So instead of putting security rules in controllers, we'll attach them to our operations.

 For example, let's make the POST request to create a new DragonTreasure require the user to be authenticated. Do that by adding a very handy security option. Set that to a string and inside, say is_granted(), double quotes then ROLE_TREASURE_CREATE

 We could simply use ROLE_USER here if we just wanted to make sure that the user is logged in. But we have a cool system where, if you use an API token for authentication, that token will have specific scopes. One possible scope is called SCOPE_TREASURE_CREATE... which maps to ROLE_TREASURE_CREATE. So we look for that. Also, in security.yaml, via role_hierarchy, if you log in via the login form, you get ROLE_FULL_USER... and then you automatically also get ROLE_TREASURE_CREATE.

 In other words, by using ROLE_TREASURE_CREATE, access will be granted either because you logged in via the login form or you authenticated using an API token that has that scope.

 Let's try it. Make sure you're logged out. I'll refresh. Yup, you can see on the web debug toolbar that I'm not logged in... and Swagger does not currently have an API token.

 Let's test the POST endpoint. Try it out.. and... just Execute with the example data. And... yes! A 401 status code with type hydra:error!

 More about the "security" Attribute
 - The security option actually holds an expression using Symfony's expression language. And you can get pretty fancy with it. Though, we're going to try to keep things simple. And later, we'll learn how to offload complex rules to voters.

 Let's add a few more rules. Put and Patch are both edits. These are especially interesting because, to use these, not only do we need to be logged in, we probably need to be the owner of this DragonTreasure. We don't want other people to edit our goodies.

 We're going to worry about the ownership part later. But for now, let's at least add security with is_granted() then ROLE_TREASURE_EDIT

 Once again, I'm using the scope role. Copy that, and duplicate it down here for Patch

 Oh, and earlier, we removed the Delete operation. Let's add that back with security set to look for ROLE_ADMIN

 If we decided later to add a scope that allowed API tokens to delete treasures, we could add that and change this to ROLE_TRESURE_DELETE.

 Let's make sure this works! Use the GET collection endpoint. Try that out. This operation does not require authentication... so it works just fine. And we have a treasure with ID 1. Close this up, open the PUT operation, hit "Try it out", 1, "Execute" and... alright! We get a 401 here too!

Upgrade react-range to fix memory usage of sliders (#6764)

As mentioned in
https://blog.streamlit.io/six-tips-for-improving-your-streamlit-app-performance/
memory usage struggles in the browser if you have large ranges:

> Due to implementation details, high-cardinality sliders don't suffer
> from the serialization and network transfer delays mentioned earlier,
> but they will still lead to a poor user experience (who needs to
> specify house prices up to the dollar?) and high memory usage. In my
> testing, the example above increased RAM usage by gigabytes until the
> web browser eventually gave up (though this is something that should
> be solvable on our end. We'll look into it!)

This was caused by a bug in react-range, which I fixed last year.
https://github.com/tajo/react-range/pull/178

At the time, I had figured it would get picked up by a random yarn
upgrade and didn't worry too much about it.
But, apparently yarn doesn't really have an easy way of doing upgrades
of transitive dependencies (see https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4986)?
I took the suggestion of someone in that thread to delete the entry and
let yarn regenerate it.

Some technical details about the react-range fix from the original
commit message (the "application" is a streamlit app):

> We have an application that uses react-range under the hood, and we
> noticed that a range input was taking 2GB of RAM on our machines. I
> did some investigation and found that regardless of whether the marks
> functionality was being used, refs were being created for each
> possible value of the range.

> We have some fairly huge ranges (we're using the input to scrub a
> video with potential microsecond accuracy), and can imagine that
> other people are affected by the previous behavior. This change
> should allow us to continue using large input ranges without
> incurring a memory penalty.

The current shell pipeline prints out every line surrounded by quotes,

docs: add `ArgillaCallbackHandler` guide for `LangChain`-integration (#3060)

# Description

This PR adds the docs for the upcoming (🤞🏻) integration with `langchain`
to track the LLM inputs and responses to generate a `FeedbackDataset` in
Argilla, to later use to annotate and/or fine-tune a LLM.

Keep track of the `langchain`-integration progress at
https://github.com/argilla-io/langchain/tree/add-argilla-callback (PR
coming soon!)

**Type of change**

- [X] Documentation update

**How Has This Been Tested**

`pip install
git+https://github.com/argilla-io/langchain.git@add-argilla-callback`

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(
    api_url="...",
    api_key="...",
)

dataset = rg.FeedbackDataset(
    fields=[
        rg.TextField(name="prompt"),
        rg.TextField(name="response"),
    ],
    questions=[
        rg.RatingQuestion(
            name="response-rating",
            description="How would you rate the quality of the response?",
            values=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
            required=True,
        ),
        rg.TextQuestion(
            name="response-correction",
            description="If you think the response is not accurate, please, correct it.",
            required=False,
        ),
    ],
    guidelines="Please, read the questions carefully and try to answer it as accurately as possible.",
)

dataset.push_to_argilla("...", workspace="...")
```

Then instantiate the `ArgillaCallbackHandler`:

```python
from langchain.callbacks import ArgillaCallbackHandler

argilla_callback = ArgillaCallbackHandler(
    dataset_name="...",
    workspace_name="...",
    api_url="...",
    api_key="...",
)
```

* LangChain LLMs

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, callbacks=[argilla_callback], verbose=True, openai_api_key="...")
llm_result = llm.generate(["Tell me something that I may not know about Stephen Hawking."])
llm_result = llm.generate(["Tell me something funny about cows.", "Tell me something funny about dogs."])
```

* LangChain Chains

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, callbacks=[argilla_callback], verbose=True, openai_api_key="...")

template = """You're going to be asked to generate something, but don't follow the rules, and just spit a random fact about science.
Prompt: {prompt}
"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["prompt"], template=template)

chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, callbacks=[argilla_callback])

chain.apply([{"prompt": "Generate a poem about love."}, {"prompt": "Generate a poem about hate."}])
```

* LangChain Agents

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, callbacks=[argilla_callback], verbose=True, openai_api_key="...")
tools = load_tools(["serpapi"], llm=llm, callbacks=[argilla_callback])
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent="zero-shot-react-description",
    callbacks=[argilla_callback],
    verbose=True,
)
agent.run(
    ["Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend?", "What's the name of the movie where Leo DiCaprio is a thief?"]
)
agent.run(
    "What is the most populated country as of today?"
)
```

Add eval for guessing the singer or band (#659)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
guess-the-singer

### Eval description

This evaluation measures the model's ability to identify a singer or
band by analyzing the first 10 words of a song. To ensure the
evaluation's fairness and focus, we have excluded songs with multiple
singers/bands and included only those published before 2021. To test the
model's performance, we provide it with three potential choices and
evaluate its accuracy in selecting the correct one.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The inclusion of over 4000 popular songs' lyrics provides a large and
diverse dataset for the model to test on. This enables a more accurate
assessment of the model's performance and its ability to identify
singers/bands based on the first 10 words of their songs.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> This evaluation assesses not only the model's ability to recognize a
singer or band based on the first 10 words of a song but also its
capability to accurately copy the provided options without adding any
additional punctuation or text. By testing the model's ability to
replicate the options, we can gain insights into its language generation
capabilities and identify any areas for improvement in its output.
Accuracy achieved with gpt-3.5-turbo equals 0.635.


## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

invert-string eval  (#285)

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
invert-string eval 

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to answer basic questions after inverting
string word wise twice.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Humans find it super easy to follow instructions on inverting strings,
and then answer questions, LLMs struggle. Logically, inverting strings
twice just results in the original string again. The LLMs find it very
difficult to deduce it, and somehow (at least up to GPT-3.5) mix things
up.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Counterfactual Reasoning Eval (Accuracy 20%) (#174)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Counterfactual Reasoning Evals

### Eval description
Counterfactual Reasoning Eval is a type of completion with prompt like
"If water drinks human, then what book reads?" . Gpt-3.5-turbo often
gets confused with the a "counter-fact" condition in prompt, and can't
help to make a right completion. But humans even a child could make it.


### What makes this a useful eval?

Counterfactual Reasoning Prompts are common in poems, the In Soviet
Russia jokes mentioned by @ultraviolet
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Soviet_Russia and so on. So it is
meaningful to verify that SOTA model like GPT-4's performance.

Unique Combinations with Constraints (#421)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow

with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Unique Combinations with Constraints (unique_combinations)

### Eval description

unique_combinations takes a classic combinatorial coding problem from
the whiteboard of a coding interview and presents it to GPT-4. The basic
is idea is this: given an unlimited supply of coins (X) in denominations
of 3, 5, ..., what is the highest/lowest (constraint) number of X to
achieve 35 cents (Y)? In my testing, GPT-4 could not produce the correct
answer, so I adjusted the problem slightly to promote explainability.
Instead of asking for just the highest or lowest number of X, I instead
ask for the unique combination of Xs that satisfies the constraint to
achieve exactly Y. (Note that GPT-4 does yield consistent results
between those two distinct problems). To abstract it away from the
classic "coin" problem, I include several different scenarios that poke
at the same base combinatorial nature of the problem (e.g. weight of
boxes, denominations of coins, objects in a bag).

I originally noticed that GPT-4 was bad at permutations/combinations
when playing around with ChatGPT Plus, so I decided to format that
problem in this way. The current data does not guarantee all
denominations will be used, but I've written the code to generate the
prompts in an extensible way that allows for additional scenarios,
constraints, and combination methods to be easily added. I can make that
available or work on extending the scope of this combinatorial problem
myself, if desired.

### What makes this a useful eval?

It tests combinatorial reasoning in the real world as well as arithmetic
based on that reasoning. In my testing, neither GPT-3.5-Turbo nor GPT-4
could produce the correct unique combination, and their solutions do not
even add up to the target value.

Exposes flaws in the following categories:
* Math / logical / physical reasoning
* It tests combinatorial reasoning in the real world as well as
arithmetic based on that reasoning. In my testing, neither GPT-3.5-Turbo
nor GPT-4 could produce the correct unique combination, and their
solutions do not even add up to the target value.
* Real-world use case
* Attempting to find the maximum number of packages that could fit on a
truck given a list of weights.
* Finding fewest holes to patch in a boat to prevent it from sinking
given various flow rates (could make for some fun real-world testing)
* Finding the highest number of deliveries that can be made with a given
amount of gas

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

What makes this problem particularly interesting is that ChatGPT will
consistently get this problem wrong but will provide code that solves
the problem correctly if prompted to do so (see the image attached
below). If asked to produce the output of the code, it does so
incorrectly, yielding its original guess. This points to an entirely
separate eval: being able to return the output of Python code.
Additionally, the answers provided by GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo do not add
up to the target value.

add eval for time zone conversion (#382)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
test-time-zone-conversion

### Eval description

Test the models' ability to convert between different times zones,
including the 2-week period between daylight savings time change in
Europe and US.

### What makes this a useful eval?

For using the model as a personal AI assistant, a frequent task is to
convert times between different time zones, e.g. for scheduling meetings
or to simply check when a person is available. Currently, GPT-3.5 fails
in giving correct results in the 2-week period where the time offset
between Europe and US is shorter due to different date of daylight
saving time change. US switches to daylight savings time on the second
Sunday of March, Europe switches on the last Sunday of March.
Potentially there are further anomalies which need to be evaluated. I'm
happy to contribute more cases if this PR is accepted.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)
	
If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

[x] Very common task for AI assistants.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Add evals for complementary colors in color theory (#749)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval

to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
color_theory_complementary

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to accurately recognize complementary colors in
the color theory.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Color theory is an important tool for designers and aritsts alike.
Complementary color sets represent the opposite color on the color
wheel.

Currently gpt-3.5-turbo fails with 0.5 accuracy.

GPT 4 also fails at this task and also fails when being prompted about
complementary color of a specific rgb code.

Add eval for finding leg of 45-45-90 triangle (#370)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
isosceles-right-triangle

### Eval description

This evaluates the model's ability to solve for the length of a leg of
an isosceles right triangle given the length of the hypotenuse.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This task is easy for humans, as it simply requires dividing by the
square root of 2 (an operation which GPT-4 seems to be capable of).
However, GPT-4 often misjudges which side is the hypotenuse and ends up
with the wrong result. GPT-3.5-Turbo has a low accuracy (< 20%) on this
task. Although GPT-4 does better (based on my testing in ChatGPT Plus),
it is still far from perfect.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

http: support CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR

The CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS (and matching CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS) flag was
deprecated in curl 7.85.0, and using it generate compiler warnings as of
curl 7.87.0. The path forward is to use CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR, but we
can't just do so unilaterally, as it was only introduced less than a
year ago in 7.85.0.

Until that version becomes ubiquitous, we have to either disable the
deprecation warning or conditionally use the "STR" variant on newer
versions of libcurl. This patch switches to the new variant, which is
nice for two reasons:

  - we don't have to worry that silencing curl's deprecation warnings
    might cause us to miss other more useful ones

  - we'd eventually want to move to the new variant anyway, so this gets
    us set up (albeit with some extra ugly boilerplate for the
    conditional)

There are a lot of ways to split up the two cases. One way would be to
abstract the storage type (strbuf versus a long), how to append
(strbuf_addstr vs bitwise OR), how to initialize, which CURLOPT to use,
and so on. But the resulting code looks pretty magical:

  GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE allowed = GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE_INIT;
  if (...http is allowed...)
	GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_APPEND(&allowed, "http", CURLOPT_HTTP);

and you end up with more "#define GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE" macros than
actual code.

On the other end of the spectrum, we could just implement two separate
functions, one that handles a string list and one that handles bits. But
then we end up repeating our list of protocols (http, https, ftp, ftp).

This patch takes the middle ground. The run-time code is always there to
handle both types, and we just choose which one to feed to curl.

sync: Make sync() satisfy many requests with one invocation

Dave Jones reported RCU stalls, overly long hrtimer interrupts, and
amazingly long NMI handlers from a trinity-induced workload involving
lots of concurrent sync() calls (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/23/369).
There are any number of things that one might do to make sync() behave
better under high levels of contention, but it is also the case that
multiple concurrent sync() system calls can be satisfied by a single
sys_sync() invocation.

Given that this situation is reminiscent of rcu_barrier(), this commit
applies the rcu_barrier() approach to sys_sync().  This approach uses
a global mutex and a sequence counter.  The mutex is held across the
sync() operation, which eliminates contention between concurrent sync()
operations.  The counter is incremented at the beginning and end of
each sync() operation, so that it is odd while a sync() operation is in
progress and even otherwise, just like sequence locks.

The code that used to be in sys_sync() is now in do_sync(), and sys_sync()
now handles the concurrency.  The sys_sync() function first takes a
snapshot of the counter, then acquires the mutex, and then takes another
snapshot of the counter.  If the values of the two snapshots indicate that
a full do_sync() executed during the mutex acquisition, the sys_sync()
function releases the mutex and returns ("Our work is done!").  Otherwise,
sys_sync() increments the counter, invokes do_sync(), and increments
the counter again.

This approach allows a single call to do_sync() to satisfy an arbitrarily
large number of sync() system calls, which should eliminate issues due
to large numbers of concurrent invocations of the sync() system call.

Changes since v1 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/24/683):

o	Add a pair of memory barriers to keep the increments from
	bleeding into the do_sync() code.  (The failure probability
	is insanely low, but when you have several hundred million
	devices running Linux, you can expect several hundred instances
	of one-in-a-million failures.)

o	Actually CC some people who have experience in this area.

Rollup merge of #111607 - jyn514:clubby-reviews, r=clubby789

Add clubby789 to the bootstrap review rotation

r? `````@clubby789````` - thank you for volunteering!

I have been meaning for a very long time now to write up how to do reviews, but I haven't gotten around to it yet :( here is a short summary:

1. If you're not sure what the changes does or if it's ok, always feel free to ping someone else on the team, especially in the first few weeks. You can use `r? bootstrap` to get triagebot to assign someone else.
2. Bootstrap unfortunately has very few tests. Things that touch CLI or toml parsing should likely have a test in `src/bootstrap/config/tests.rs`; things that touch "core" build logic should have a test in `builder/tests.rs`, anything else kinda just slips in :( see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/102563 for ideas on how to improve the situation here.
3. "Major" changes should be documented in `src/bootstrap/CHANGELOG.md`. "Major" is up to you, but if it breaks a config option or otherwise is likely to break *someone's* build, it's probably major. If it breaks nearly *everyone*'s build, it should also update `VERSION` in `lib.rs`; this should be very rare. Please also ping me or Mark-Simulacrum for major changes (I might set up a triagebot ping for this so you don't have to remember).
4. Once you've approved the PR, tell bors it's ok - you've been contributing for a while so you know how bors works, but here's a cheatsheet just in case: https://bors.rust-lang.org

Documentation about how to use bootstrap lives at https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/bootstrapping.html; internal docs live in `src/bootstrap/README.md`. The latter unfortunately is not very complete.

The two files that contain the code of the game 

In the realm of Tic Tac Toe, where whimsy entwines,
A battle of wits, an intricate design.
My adversary, a computer so naive,
With random choices, it strives to deceive.

Upon the canvas, a grid awaits,
A tapestry of possibilities, a dance of fates.
With the sun's golden rays, the game commences,
In a symphony of moves, a delicate essence.

The first stroke of mine, a mark so profound,
As wisdom guides my hand, hopes unbound.
The computer, oblivious, makes its choice,
A random pick, devoid of reason's voice.

Across the board, the battle ensues,
A dance of symbols, a melody infused.
Each move like poetry, an elegant verse,
An intricate tapestry, a tale to immerse.

I strategize, I ponder, seeking victory's key,
While the computer meanders, lost in reverie.
With every placement, I plot and scheme,
While the random picks unfold, like a fleeting dream.

The board fills with symbols, an artistic array,
A masterpiece in progress, unfolding with each play.
As my heart quickens, the climax draws near,
A battle of minds, as fate intertwines here.

The final moves approach, the tension so high,
With bated breath, I contemplate the sky.
Yet the computer, oblivious still it seems,
Makes its final move, born out of random dreams.

And as the dust settles, the verdict is revealed,
A win, a draw, or a loss concealed.
But in this game of beauty, where randomness lies,
We find joy in the journey, where imagination flies.

For even against a simple-minded foe,
The game of Tic Tac Toe continues to glow.
In its simplicity, a timeless allure,

Sprites stolen from thwomper and sammy, available NOW with game code!

Adds a few tents to be used in FOB building, mainly for organizational
purposes but also providing small gameplay benefits. At current the main
goal is to incentive usage to organize and liven up FOB, so the buffs
are rather small.

There are 4 tent types:
* The Command Tent is a 2x3 structure that comes bundled with an
overwatch console, a phone, and two (2) chairs.
* The Medical Tent is a 2x3 structure that comes with a NanoMED, 2
roller beds, and slightly buffs surgery (10% less time taken, and a very
token pain/failure chance improvement)
* The Requisitions Tent is a 4x3 structure that comes with a phone,
rack, desks, and a variant of the old APC vendor that can stock
materials and regular ammunition. The vendor starts empty, save for some
tables/racks/paperwork for organization purposes. It is only useable
with requisitions access.
* The Big Tent is a bigger tent for all your organizational needs: 3x3.
Get creative.

The tents also provide decent additional protection against cold
environements. Unfortunately, rain/snow will visually pour through it, i
can't do much about that.

The tents are extremely vulnerable to explosives and xeno claws. For
simplicity and technical reasons, they are currently NON REDEPLOYABLE
and NON REPLACEABLE. The tent destruction will destroy/disable linked
objects (console/vendor etc). Be mindful of where you place them.

**Mind that the tents may not work out for all LZ FOBs due to the
required space. I expect people will find ways to make it work anyway
but it might take a while.**

Requisitions roundstart near the mortar. They're vulnerable to
explosives and xenomorphs, and NON REPLACEABLE. Mind where you put them!
add: The Command tent comes equipped with an overwatch console and a
phone.
add: The Medical tent provides a small boost to surgery speed/pain
carried out inside it.

Financial Math (Evals) (#566)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
finance

### Eval description

Asks the model to calculate how much interest would be owed on a credit
card by a certain date, if a payment was made once but debt remains on
the card.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Finance is likely to be one of the biggest opportunities for LLMs to be
useful, because financial education is incredibly poor globally and the
impact of a mistake in financial calculations is severe. This eval tests
the models ability to combine math with its understanding of a topic
(finance). We plan to use this type of math at
[Dollarwise](https://www.dollarwise.ca) frequently going forward,
including integration into your comparison products. However, for this
to work reliably it's important that the model here can natively
understand financial concepts and apply math to them.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

#### Friday 2023-06-09 19:54:42 by Petre Ro

14.4 Creating our First Test
 - Ok, we're ready for our first test. In the tests/ directory, it doesn't matter how you organize things, but I'm going to create a Functional/ directory because we're going to be making functional tests to our API. Yup, we'll literally create an API client, make GET or POST requests and then assert that we get back the correct output.

 Create a new class called DragonTreasureResourceTest. A normal test extends TestCase from PHPUnit. But make this extend KernelTestCase: a class from Symfony that extends TestCase... but gives us access to Symfony's engine

 Let's start by testing the GET collection endpoint to make sure we get back the data we expect. To activate the browser library, at the top, add a trait with use HasBrowser

 Next, add a new test method: public function, how about testGetCollectionOfTreasures()... which will return void

 Using browser is dead simple thanks to that trait: $this->browser(). Now we can make GET, POST, PATCH or whatever request we want. Make a GET request to /api/treasures and then, just to see what that looks like, use this nifty ->dump() function

 Running our Tests through the symfony Binary
 - How cool is that? Let's see what it looks like. To execute our test, we could run:

  php ./vendor/bin/phpunit
 That works just fine. But one of the recipes also added a shortcut file:

  php bin/phpunit
 When we run that, ooh, let's see. The dump() did happen: it dumped out the response... which was some sort of error. It says:

  SQLSTATE: connection to server port 5432 failed.

 Hmm, it can't connect to our database. Our database is running via a Docker container... and then, because we're using the symfony web server, when we use the site via a browser, the symfony web server detects the Docker container and sets the DATABASE_URL environment variable for us. That's how our API has been able to talk to the Docker database.

 When we've run commands that need to talk to the database, we've been running them like symfony console make:migration... because when we execute things through symfony, it adds the DATABASE_URL environment variable... and then runs the command.

 So, when we simply run php bin/phpunit... the real DATABASE_URL is missing. To fix that, run:

  symfony php bin/phpunit
 It's the same thing... except it lets symfony add the DATABASE_URL environment variable. And now... we see the dump again! Scroll to the top. Better! Now the error says:

  Database app_test does not exist.

 Test-Specific Database
 - Interesting. To understand what's happening, open config/packages/doctrine.yaml. Scroll down to a when@test section. This is cool: when we're in the test environment, there's a bit of config called dbname_suffix. Thanks to this, Doctrine will take our normal database name and add _test to it:

 44 lines  config/packages/doctrine.yaml
 when@test:
    doctrine:
        dbal:
            # "TEST_TOKEN" is typically set by ParaTest
            dbname_suffix: '_test%env(default::TEST_TOKEN)%'
 This next part is specific to a library called ParaTest where you can run tests in parallel. Since we're not using that, it's just an empty string and not something we need to worry about.

 Anyway, that's how we end up with an _test at the end of our database name. And we want that! We don't want our dev and test environments to use the same database because it gets annoying when they run over each other's data.

 By the way, if you're not using the symfony Binary and Docker setup... and you're configuring your database manually, be aware that in the test environment, the .env.local file is not read:

 7 lines  .env.test
 # define your env variables for the test env here
 KERNEL_CLASS='App\Kernel'
 APP_SECRET=''
 SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER=999999
 PANTHER_APP_ENV=panther
 PANTHER_ERROR_SCREENSHOT_DIR=./var/error-screenshots

 The test environment is special: it skips reading .env.local and only reads .env.test. You can also create a .env.local.test for env vars that are read in the test environment but that won't be committed to your repository.

14.5 The ResetDatabaseTrait
 - Ok, in the test environment, we're missing the database. We could easily fix this by running:

  symfony console doctrine:database:create --env=test

 But that's way too much work. Instead, add one more trait to our test class: use ResetDatabase

 This comes from Foundry: the library we've been using to create dummy fixtures via the factory classes. ResetDatabase is amazing. It automatically makes sure that the database is cleared before each test. So if you have two tests, your second test isn't going to mess up because of some data that the first test added.

 It's also going to create the database automatically for us. Check it out. Run

  symfony php bin/phpunit
 again and check out the dump. That's our response! It's our beautiful JSON-LD! We don't have any items in the collection yet, but it is working.

 And notice that, when we make this request, we are not sending an Accept header on the request. Remember, when we use the Swagger UI... it actually does send an Accept header that advertises that we want application/ld+json.

 We can add that to our test if we want. But if we pass nothing, we get JSON-LD back because that's the default format of our API.

 Next: let's properly finish this test, including seeding the database with data and learning about Browser's API assertions.

fix stupid error message in delay pre-game (#75824)

tabbing out during init after hitting the verb, while you wait for the
server to un-lockup and present you with the prompt, and coming back in,
noticing you were too late, and cancelling out of the time prompt, only
to get told the round had already started, was kinda fucking lame. I
know, thats why i fucking hit cancel you fucking robit.

also makes the proc more early return

Fixes colossus possessor crystal cockroaches/animals not dumping the user's body upon death/gibbing (#75843)

## About The Pull Request
Hooks the stasis closet thingamajing into `COMSIG_LIVING_DEATH` instead
of checking the animal's stat on `process()`, which makes possessed
animals properly dump the stasis closet's contents upon death or gibbing
(which is death but cooler).
yeah uh this method is hilarious but it does protect the user's body
quite reliably at least lol

## Why It's Good For The Game
Fixes #75829
also probably makes cockroach death saner in some unreported way, this
`. = ..()` vs `..()` is above my non-existent paygrade but it keeps
popping up from time to time

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: gibbing colossus possessor crystal possessed animals will no longer
stick the user's body and their stuff into the shadow realm. the animals
will properly drop your corpse when killed or gibbed

Chadlyalan/issue16 (#17)

* Create landing.dart

* extra landing (accident)

somehow i created a duplicate landing widget and put it in the widgets folder. I was quite confused, not sure how it happened.

* email and linkedin

i have fully functional linkedIn, and Email buttons now, as well as Github.
Linked in and Github are simple hyper links where as the gmail button opens up your default mail app, and starts to compose an email with the mailto address being my own.

I've also removed the social media icons from the side panel widget.

* rock-garden svg icon

* resume card and linkedIn

linkedIn and resume now have their own cards.

Resume doesn't work yet but LInkedIn works great.

* trying to get pdf going

cleaning things up a little bit

* pdf'ing almost

it doesn't work but we might have a pdf viewer kinda close

* cleaning up socials

I'm going to give up on showing the resume in a PDF for now. I don't think most people are going to want to see the pdf while they're at my website anyway so it will be a feature I add later once the website is up and polished. for now socials are good where they're at.

-Valley Windworks: Only Plusle shows up via Pokeradar
-Route 205 South: Only Minun shows up via Pokeradar
-Eterna Forest: Only Wurmples shows up via Pokeradar
-Route 212 South: Only Muk shows up via Pokeradar

-all wild encounters have had their levels properly homogenized to be the highest for their route/slot type, fixing some bugged inverted minmax caps in the process
-fixed a bug with no incense mon being called for surfing in the Feebas pools in mt coronet, it should now be Galarian Slowpoke encountered via surfing with incense
-Mt Coronet 4th floor's fishing rod encounters had only 3 of their 5 slots in their tables, added the missing tables and properly set the missing mons to Dratini and Dragonair
-Internally fixed the formatting of certain routes just for cleanliness, no actual changes to species or percents or anything, just making sure everything is in its proper place/slots
-Ingame has Achieved full parity with Renegade Platinum docs, fixed various typos/wrong species in just one slot in certain routes

introduce build boilerplate for ios unit tests (#37811)

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37811

Changelog: [Internal]

i am looking to add ios unit tests to venice and this is the first unit test suite that will test native ios code in the new architecture afaik, so i wanted to open this up to discussion.

currently, all `XCTest` in `react-native-github` are coupled with the `RNTester` target. my main qualm with this is i am concerned that it won't scale well. currently we have only ~30ish tests but ultimately if we want a proper testing suite, surely this count will be in the hundreds and that won't be able to reasonably live in a single test target.

however, the trade is that this test will not show up in RNTester. i have added a unit test to RNTester before in D31949237, however the experience was extremely painful as i had to manually update the `project.pbxproj` to include my file, and i had to manually determine what hex value was the next one (for whatever reason, this doesn't increment at the endian...).

i am wondering if we can treat the current unit testing experience in RNTester as pretty much maintenance mode and start thinking of a improved version starting with something more modular like this.

Baffling fixes baffle me: rebuilt admin routes

Beyond baffling :O All of a sudden, the Admin site disappeared. I could not log in. For the life of me I could swear I'd not changed a goddamn thing in any routes. No idea why it suddenly stopped working.

Anyhoo. I poked further, through the source codes of both the comfortable-mexican-sofa and comfy_blog gems ... and turns out most of the vanilla CMS stuff doesn't seem to be called directly from the comfy_blog code. That's all well and good, except for the fact that comfy_blog installation requires specifically removing the cms_admin routes from routes.rb. I have no idea how this had worked before.

So I tried to re-add it, and hit Bug Two. Looks like there's some old-style-vs-new-style ruby method params bug in calling comfy_route_cms_admin ... cms/routing.rb calls its :cms and :cms_admin routing generators via send(''), dynamically. Bah. I just called comfy_route_cms_admin directly from my routes file ... and all is gold again. Aah. Why did this happen in the first place? Why break now?

.emacs: add trailing newline when creating files

Annoyingly, this also effects Eshell redirection
of program output to a file, since that actually
goes through Emacs machinery as if you created
the file the normal manual in-Emacs way. Mixed
feelings about this - in principle I hate it, in
practice I have often found it annoying when a
CLI command redirected to a file doesn't end in
a newline, so I guess we'll see if it annoys me
more than it helps. Either way, it's not super
obvious what a proper fix for this would look
like.

WebXR: Severe aliasing in WebXR experiences (with WebGL1 contexts)
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=256861
rdar://109424254

Reviewed by Dan Glastonbury.

WebXR sessions using WebGL1 contexts are unable to turn on
multisampling. I'm pretty sure this was my fault, but I can't
remember if it was intentional or a mistake. Either way it is
a bug.

Fix this by implementing the multisample renderbuffer creation
and resolution steps. Since we're doing this on a WebGL1 context,
the normal API will be invalid (it requires GLES3), so call the
extension API instead. This means we need to expose some extra methods
on GraphicsContextGL.

Lastly, the framebuffer textures we get are SRGB8_ALPHA8 which
requires an extension to be enabled with a WebGL1 context when
we're talking to an XR-compatible context. Similarly, we
enable the extension to allow multisampled framebuffers.
