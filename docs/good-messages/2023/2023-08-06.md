Added Omen Spontaneous Combustion and light tube and mirror effects (#77175)

## About The Pull Request

Cursed crewmembers can randomly, extremely rarely, spontaneously combust
for no reason.

Cursed crewmembers can get zapped by nearby light tubes.

Cursed crewmembers can freak out when passing by mirrors.

To make up for these, triggering a cursed effect is slightly less than
half as likely now when walking around now.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Cursed is fun as hell, but after a certain point it gets kind of
monotonous - it's airlocks, vending machines, and the rest is too rare
to count. We need more ways to comically get hurt in the game.

You might dislike the 'reduced effects' bit but trust me it is
incredibly frickin' common to have shit happen to you. Add to the
occasional vending machine and airlock crushes the near-constant light
tubes all over the station? Yeah, that needs a toning down else it will
be just a tad too miserable to be funny. Also cause the poor janitor
unneeded stress.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Cursed crewmembers can randomly, extremely rarely, spontaneously
combust for no reason.
add: Cursed crewmembers can get zapped by nearby light tubes.
add: Cursed crewmembers can freak out when passing by mirrors.

Science Resprite! (With Sovl!) (#77314)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
What a crusty department. These outfits are...
Something.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/76465278/63fe13cf-bcbf-42c2-a22c-c868ae49a72c)

How old are these now? I'm pretty sure they're unchanged since when I
started playing years ago on other servers.... besides the RD Turtleneck
and Roboticist suit of course. But they still did have some touch-ups to
be made...

Regardless, I think this department deserves a little love!
I've tried to stay true as I could to their current designs; this isn't
a re-**_design_**, just a re-sprite. I used the base jumpsuit design
from Medbay for most of these since it's the most modern suit that fit
with the colored-spots style.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/76465278/ef7ff5b0-f0e3-481a-9ed4-ba830e3ee0c3)

All of them have been touched up, and the RD's "alt" is now a subtype of
the buttondown so it can easily inherit any sprite updates in the
future.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from

## Why It's Good For The Game
These deserved some touch-ups and modernization, and while I'm not keen
on entirely reworking them I figured I could at the least give them the
update the Science Team deserves.

(The buttondown has an outdated obj sprite in this image! It's since
been made smaller and more folded)
Also labcoats for comparison

Fixes bloody soles making jumpsuits that cover your feet bloody when you're wearing shoes (#77077)

## About The Pull Request
Title says it all.

It basically made it so wearing something like a kilt would result in
the kilt getting all bloody as soon as you walked over blood, even when
you were wearing shoes, unless you wore something else that obscured
shoes.

I debated with myself a lot over the implementation for this, I was
thinking of adding some way to obscure feet in particular, but it's
honestly so niche that it could only have caused more issues elsewhere
if I tried to fix this issue that way.

When Space Dragons devour people they get .extinguish()ed (#77248)

## About The Pull Request

When Space Dragons devour people they get extinguished, removing flames.
## Why It's Good For The Game

> When Space Dragons devour people they get extinguished, removing
flames.

I find it quite annoying that even after you die to a space dragon, the
jackass melts not just your jumpsuit, your suit, your hat, your mask, he
also melts your entire skin off, leaving your body husked with 400
million burn damage when and if the dragon finally dies. I don't think
there's any real reason for this to be necessary, it doesn't help the
dragon in any way - It's just kind of a middle finger to the dead guy,
or more accurately, an oversight.

Worse, because the flame sprite is stupidly noisy, when a dragon DOES
die the corpses are all thrown around randomly and they all look the
exact same, which makes it easier to ignore them.

If there's a concern about tracking sensors, I can make it disable them,
but honestly if you can do that with demons I don't see why this would
be a problem. Not even accounting for the fact that many jumpsuits
ingame are fireproof.
## Changelog

flames.

Add stores::Policy and start stubbing in auth{z,n}

This adds GitHub oauth login, a "Policy" system for constructing aggregate
implementations of various required registry services, and the beginning of
auth.

I've split authentication between "TokenAuthorizer" and "Authenticator"; I
think there still needs to be a "UserStorage" trait as well. The idea is that
Authenticator implements the CLI web auth using an OAuth flow, maintaining an
in-memory map of "login registration sessions". Once the oauth flow is
complete, we register the resulting internal User object with the appropriate
login registration session. The next time the CLI polls for a user, the
endpoint finds the user associated with the login registration session. The
handler then registers the user with the token authorizer.

And this is where UserStorage would come in: between those two steps, we should
store the user _somewhere_ (and validate that we actually want to accept this
user.)

Additionally: add a Configurator type to hold general configuration data. This
is a little bit of a weird one! To explain: I've made some of the
more-sensitive values async in order to provide a Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
Configurator in the future. Yanno: for stuff you don't necessarily want
floating around memory indefinitely.

I've added (and removed) the extism plugin. I think it will make its triumphant
return soon -- I want to run accept/reject/transform plugins on package version
modification (whether or not that's via mirroring) as well as user
registration.

Anyway, my eyes are crossing as I write this.

More portable cades tweaks and buffs (#3967)

# About the pull request

Despite making a lot of tweaks and changes to portable cades I barely
touched them in the game until recently. Now I have more experience and
can tweak it again.

1) You can now stack damaged cades and stack stores health of each cade.
You can repair stacked cades but it will take longer time.

2) Miniengi pamphlet allows faster repairs but only when cade is folded.

3) You can quickly collapse portable cades with crowbar if you have at
least miniengi skills.

4) You no longer need to have folded portable cade in hand in order to
repair it, but if you do, you can move while repairing.

# Explain why it's good for the game

1) It's extremely annoying to repair each individual cade in order to
stack them just because it got hit by a stray bullet once. Now you can
just ignore damage and keep going.

2) Yeah it took 10 second for PFC to repair each single cade. Really
long. Now it's 5 seconds, but only when folded and if you have miniengi
skills. Makes miniengi pamphlet a bit more relevant.

3) It was intended, but turned out it was a bit inconvenient. It was
faster to collapse by hand because you didn't need to deal with tools.
Now it requires just a crowbar and slightly faster. Also requires
miniengi skill to use crowbar.

4) First was just a bit annoying, second allows more mobility which is
the point of portable barricades.

# Changelog
:cl: ihatethisengine
balance: you can stack scratched portable cades if their HP at least
75%. Doing so will reduce the health of all barricades in the stack to
the level of the most damaged.
balance: you can repair stacked portable cades but it will take longer
time depending on how many cades in stack.
balance: miniengi skill makes repairs of folded portable cades faster
(10 seconds to 5 seconds, same as engineer).
balance: with engineering skill at least of miniengi you can collapse
deployed portable barricade with a crowbar (wrench is no longer
required, slightly faster (2 sec to 1.5 sec)).
balance: you no longer need to have folded portable cade in hand in
order to repair it.
balance: if you have folded portable cade in hand, you can move while
repairing it.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

QualityScaler 2.0 

 NEW
 - It is now possible to upscale images and videos in one shot
 - The message box is now more "conversational"
 - Now the app will save the upscaled files by adding the chosen resolution % tag. This allows you to try different % resolutions without the produced file overwriting the previous one. 
 --- For example, an image with BSRGANx4 and Resolution 70%:
 --- QualityScaler 1.14 => image_BSRGANx4.png
 --- QualityScaler 2.0   => image_BSRGANx4_70%.png
 - New GUI based on the splendid work of @customtkinter:
 --- it is now possible to select files via a "Select files" button instead of the Drag&Drop function that presented several problems
 --- this new library allows for much more organized and optimized code
 --- the new interface is fully resizable and so adaptable to any screen 
 --- the new interface also allows more space to add new widgets (in the future) to customize the upscale operations 

 BUGFIX & IMPROVEMENTS
 - A comprehensive restructuring of the code and many micro-optimizations:
 --- more than 50% of the code has been restructured to be faster and more readable
 - Updated all dependencies

 FOR DEVS
 - With the new GUI based on @customtkinter, it is easier to run the app via python script and should give less headaches than the old GUI which needed more 3/4 different libraries
 - Many more logs have been added in console (for those who use the app via Python code) 

 I want to sincerely thank the people who support and will support this work (financially and otherwise). 
 Thank you for allowing me to learn how to develop these projects and at the same time be able to help my parents financially. ❤

Python: Import OpenAPI documents into the semantic kernel (#2297)

### Motivation and Context

<!-- Thank you for your contribution to the semantic-kernel repo!
Please help reviewers and future users, providing the following
information:
  1. Why is this change required?
  2. What problem does it solve?
  3. What scenario does it contribute to?
  4. If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here.
-->

This allows us to import OpenAPI documents, including ChatGPT plugins,
into the Semantic Kernel.

### Description

<!-- Describe your changes, the overall approach, the underlying design.
These notes will help understanding how your code works. Thanks! -->
- The interface reads the operationIds of the openapi spec into a skill:
```python
from semantic_kernel.connectors.openapi import register_openapi_skill
skill = register_openapi_skill(kernel=kernel, skill_name="test", openapi_document="url/or/path/to/openapi.yamlorjson")
skill['operationId'].invoke_async()
```
- Parse an OpenAPI document
- For each operation in the document, create a function that will
execute the operation
- Add all those operations to a skill in the kernel
- Modified `import_skill` to accept a dictionary of functions instead of
just class so that we can import dynamically created functions
- Created unit tests

TESTING:
I've been testing this with the following ChatGPT plugins:
- [Semantic Kernel Starter's Python Flask
plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel-starters/tree/main/sk-python-flask)
- [ChatGPT's example retrieval
plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/blob/main/docs/providers/azuresearch/setup.md)
- This one was annoying to setup. I didn't get the plugin functioning,
but I was able to send the right API requests
- Also, their openapi file was invalid. The "servers" attribute is
misindented
- [Google ChatGPT
plugin](https://github.com/Sogody/google-chatgpt-plugin)
- [Chat TODO plugin](https://github.com/lencx/chat-todo-plugin)
- This openapi file is also invalid. I checked with an online validator.
I had to remove"required" from the referenced request objects'
properties:
https://github.com/lencx/chat-todo-plugin/blob/main/openapi.yaml#L85

Then I used this python file to test the examples:

```python
import asyncio
import logging

import semantic_kernel as sk
from semantic_kernel import ContextVariables, Kernel
from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureTextCompletion
from semantic_kernel.connectors.openapi.sk_openapi import register_openapi_skill

}


plugin = todo_plugin_get # set this to the plugin you want to try

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

kernel = Kernel(log=logger)
deployment, api_key, endpoint = sk.azure_openai_settings_from_dot_env()
kernel.add_text_completion_service(
    "dv", AzureTextCompletion(deployment, endpoint, api_key)
)

skill = register_openapi_skill(

context_variables = ContextVariables(variables=plugin)
result = asyncio.run(

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Science Resprite! (With Sovl!) (#7124)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/77314
-----

## About The Pull Request
What a crusty department. These outfits are...
Something.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/76465278/63fe13cf-bcbf-42c2-a22c-c868ae49a72c)

How old are these now? I'm pretty sure they're unchanged since when I
started playing years ago on other servers.... besides the RD Turtleneck
and Roboticist suit of course. But they still did have some touch-ups to
be made...

Regardless, I think this department deserves a little love!
I've tried to stay true as I could to their current designs; this isn't
a re-**_design_**, just a re-sprite. I used the base jumpsuit design
from Medbay for most of these since it's the most modern suit that fit
with the colored-spots style.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/76465278/ef7ff5b0-f0e3-481a-9ed4-ba830e3ee0c3)

All of them have been touched up, and the RD's "alt" is now a subtype of
the buttondown so it can easily inherit any sprite updates in the
future.
## Why It's Good For The Game
These deserved some touch-ups and modernization, and while I'm not keen
on entirely reworking them I figured I could at the least give them the
update the Science Team deserves.

(The buttondown has an outdated obj sprite in this image! It's since
been made smaller and more folded)
Also labcoats for comparison

## Changelog
:cl:
image: resprited the entirety of RnD! Genetics, Robotics, the RD, and

Auto merge of #114011 - RalfJung:place-projection, r=oli-obk

interpret: Unify projections for MPlaceTy, PlaceTy, OpTy

For ~forever, we didn't really have proper shared code for handling projections into those three types. This is mostly because `PlaceTy` projections require `&mut self`: they might have to `force_allocate` to be able to represent a project part-way into a local.

This PR finally fixes that, by enhancing `Place::Local` with an `offset` so that such an optimized place can point into a part of a place without having requiring an in-memory representation. If we later write to that place, we will still do `force_allocate` -- for now we don't have an optimized path in `write_immediate` that would avoid allocation for partial overwrites of immediately stored locals. But in `write_immediate` we have `&mut self` so at least this no longer pollutes all our type signatures.

(Ironically, I seem to distantly remember that many years ago, `Place::Local` *did* have an `offset`, and I removed it to simplify things. I guess I didn't realize why it was so useful... I am also not sure if this was actually used to achieve place projection on `&self` back then.)

The `offset` had type `Option<Size>`, where `None` represent "no projection was applied". This is needed because locals *can* be unsized (when they are arguments) but `Place::Local` cannot store metadata: if the offset is `None`, this refers to the entire local, so we can use the metadata of the local itself (which must be indirect); if a projection gets applied, since the local is indirect, it will turn into a `Place::Ptr`. (Note that even for indirect locals we can have `Place::Local`: when the local appears in MIR, we always start with `Place::Local`, and only check `frame.locals` later. We could eagerly normalize to `Place::Ptr` but I don't think that would actually simplify things much.)

Having done all that, we can finally properly abstract projections: we have a new `Projectable` trait that has the basic methods required for projecting, and then all projection methods are implemented for anything that implements that trait. We can even implement it for `ImmTy`! (Not that we need that, but it seems neat.) The visitor can be greatly simplified; it doesn't need its own trait any more but it can use the `Projectable` trait. We also don't need the separate `Mut` visitor any more; that was required only to reflect that projections on `PlaceTy` needed `&mut self`.

It is possible that there are some more `&mut self` that can now become `&self`... I guess we'll notice that over time.

proc: fix missing conversion to 'iterate_shared'

I'm looking at the directory handling due to the discussion about f_pos
locking (see commit 797964253d35: "file: reinstate f_pos locking
optimization for regular files"), and wanting to clean that up.

And one source of ugliness is how we were supposed to move filesystems
over to the '->iterate_shared()' function that only takes the inode lock
for reading many many years ago, but several filesystems still use the
bad old '->iterate()' that takes the inode lock for exclusive access.

See commit 6192269444eb ("introduce a parallel variant of ->iterate()")
that also added some documentation stating

      Old method is only used if the new one is absent; eventually it will
      be removed.  Switch while you still can; the old one won't stay.

and that was back in April 2016.  Here we are, many years later, and the
old version is still clearly sadly alive and well.

Now, some of those old style iterators are probably just because the
filesystem may end up having per-inode mutable data that it uses for
iterating a directory, but at least one case is just a mistake.

Al switched over most filesystems to use '->iterate_shared()' back when
it was introduced.  In particular, the /proc filesystem was converted as
one of the first ones in commit f50752eaa0b0 ("switch all procfs
directories ->iterate_shared()").

But then later one new user of '->iterate()' was then re-introduced by
commit 6d9c939dbe4d ("procfs: add smack subdir to attrs").

And that's clearly not what we wanted, since that new case just uses the
same 'proc_pident_readdir()' and 'proc_pident_lookup()' helper functions
that other /proc pident directories use, and they are most definitely
safe to use with the inode lock held shared.

So just fix it.

This still leaves a fair number of oddball filesystems using the
old-style directory iterator (ceph, coda, exfat, jfs, ntfs, ocfs2,
overlayfs, and vboxsf), but at least we don't have any remaining in the
core filesystems.

I'm going to add a wrapper function that just drops the read-lock and
takes it as a write lock, so that we can clean up the core vfs layer and
make all the ugly 'this filesystem needs exclusive inode locking' be
just filesystem-internal warts.

I just didn't want to make that conversion when we still had a core user
left.

Arcane/Blood Barrage fixes, cleans up cult spell code, autofire barrage, more responsive/sane blood collection (#76852)

## About The Pull Request

Refactors arcane barrage (the wizard spell) and blood barrage (the weird
version of the same spell that cultists get) into the magic subtype. No
longer are they rifles...for some reason. Also they have sprites once
again! Yay. Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/76561

So as to not replicate a really crappy system used to get the hand
swapping working, I've just opted to take this opportunity to make
arcane barrage an automatic fire weapon. Yes, this is kind of a feature,
but it's...it's appropriate, don't you think? And I don't think
meaningfully changes its fire rate?

Blood Barrage no longer harms cultists/constructs shot by it and now
properly just heals them/injects them with unholy water. Why all this
was shoved into the Bump() proc is beyond me, but it works now. Fixes
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/76560

I've improved the variables for some of the cult spells, and I've also
fixed what I think is one the most pesky parts of how drawing blood
works. So, rather than using range(), it uses view(), which seems to
cause the spell to be a bit funky with lighting? So if you're in
darkness (gosh cultists in dim light, how unheard of), this spell
struggles to gather up blood. Not anymore it doesn't!

Lastly, it only worked on blood pools or droplets, not blood trails. So,
you could bleed a character out by dragging them around, but not sap up
the blood they're dropping from doing so. Only the intermittent blood
splatters or your own bloody footprints count.

Here is the funny thing with that. It still cleans up the blood trail.
You just couldn't activate the blood draw from the trail or treat it as
blood. Now you can. Blood trails now give you +5 charges, and you can
activate the blood draw using blood trails.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Arcane Barrage/Blood Barrage:

This was some really old code and I'm still not sure why they were made
as a separate spell to the madoka reference, which at this stage is
still better than this spell. But at least it is using a sensible
subtype with a reasonable, more modern component to facilitate the
'rapid firing barrage of magical bullet' image this spell is meant to
invoke. As a result of all this nonsense, this spell had its sprites
broken because it kept being attached to stuff in the rifles folder.
Let's put a stop to that here and now and break it independently
instead.

Oh also cultists getting shot by healing bullets that still killed them
is both funny and dumb and the way it worked was bonkers.

Blood Draw:
A cultist trying to determine, on the fly, what blood is a valid for the
blood draw is nearly impossible from visual alone. You'd be convinced
this part of the spell is broken just because having a splatter and a
trail on the same tile massively obfuscates whether you're looking at
valid sources of blood. I've struggled to understand as a player what
was going on and why it was so selective about what was acceptable. Now
I see that the problem was one of visual accuracy, bad type checking,
and really, really outdated code that should have been improved with
better procs.

Blood trails are also actually made from dragging out a creature's
bloody corpse. For humans, the most common source of blood trails, this
does actually mean they're losing blood to produce these trails. It
stands to reason this should be a valid source (bloody footprints are,
after all). I gave them a...somewhat minor amount of charge contribution
just to keep it moderately sane for how much blood it generates.

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Arcane Barrage and Blood Barrage are magic gun subtypes and
not rifle subtypes. Also they have sprites again.
qol: The barrage spells now use the automatic component to do its thing.
fix: Blood Barrage once again heals cultists and constructs without
hurting them.
code: Cleans up how Blood Rites finds blood to draw in. You can now just
click turfs as well as blood, and it should now be much more accurate
about it.
qol: Blood trails contribute to charges gained using Blood Rites. You
can also activate Blood Rite's blood draw using blood trails.

Fixes some synthetic language oversights (#76846)

## About The Pull Request

#76305 removed the knowledge of every language from silicons, but this
had a couple of oversights.
This language set was not only used by cyborgs but also bots and vending
machines.

A couple of effects relied on them knowing all of those languages,
specifically their emp_act and also the station trait which rerolled
their languages.
Now they actually _learn_ a random language and start speaking it
instead.

Also I fixed a related runtime which I noticed in testing where a bot
would die as a result of being EMPed, delete itself, and then try and do
a bunch more shit after it stopped existing. Annoying.

Why was I looking at bot languages? Haha don't worry about it 😇 

## Why It's Good For The Game

Restores function of a funny feature.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Station traits can once again allow vending machines and bots to
speak a random language
fix: EMPed bots and vending machines once again speak a random language

Remove validation link from website

Having these links and icons was a fashion some years ago, but that
seems to have mostly faded. And the placement on our website looks
quite ugly (in my opinion). Moreover, HTML 4.01 Transitional is not
the latest and greatest anymore, long live HTML 5!

Funnily enough, the added div actually introduces an error since commit
1edb8b3c85 removed the opening paragraph in the hosting_thanks that is
still closed after the validator link. As far as I can tell, it is the
only validation error...

bevy_audio: ECS-based API redesign (#8424)

# Objective

Improve the `bevy_audio` API to make it more user-friendly and
ECS-idiomatic. This PR is a first-pass at addressing some of the most
obvious (to me) problems. In the interest of keeping the scope small,
further improvements can be done in future PRs.

The current `bevy_audio` API is very clunky to work with, due to how it
(ab)uses bevy assets to represent audio sinks.

The user needs to write a lot of boilerplate (accessing
`Res<Assets<AudioSink>>`) and deal with a lot of cognitive overhead
(worry about strong vs. weak handles, etc.) in order to control audio
playback.

Audio playback is initiated via a centralized `Audio` resource, which
makes it difficult to keep track of many different sounds playing in a
typical game.

Further, everything carries a generic type parameter for the sound
source type, making it difficult to mix custom sound sources (such as
procedurally generated audio or unofficial formats) with regular audio
assets.

Let's fix these issues.

## Solution

Refactor `bevy_audio` to a more idiomatic ECS API. Remove the `Audio`
resource. Do everything via entities and components instead.

Audio playback data is now stored in components:
- `PlaybackSettings`, `SpatialSettings`, `Handle<AudioSource>` are now
components. The user inserts them to tell Bevy to play a sound and
configure the initial playback parameters.
- `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of special
magical "asset" types. They are inserted by Bevy when it actually begins
playing the sound, and can be queried for by the user in order to
control the sound during playback.

Bundles: `AudioBundle` and `SpatialAudioBundle` are available to make it
easy for users to play sounds. Spawn an entity with one of these bundles
(or insert them to a complex entity alongside other stuff) to play a
sound.

Each entity represents a sound to be played.

There is also a new "auto-despawn" feature (activated using
`PlaybackSettings`), which, if enabled, tells Bevy to despawn entities
when the sink playback finishes. This allows for "fire-and-forget" sound
playback. Users can simply
spawn entities whenever they want to play sounds and not have to worry
about leaking memory.

## Unsolved Questions

I think the current design is *fine*. I'd be happy for it to be merged.
It has some possibly-surprising usability pitfalls, but I think it is
still much better than the old `bevy_audio`. Here are some discussion
questions for things that we could further improve. I'm undecided on
these questions, which is why I didn't implement them. We should decide
which of these should be addressed in this PR, and what should be left
for future PRs. Or if they should be addressed at all.

### What happens when sounds start playing?

Currently, the audio sink components are inserted and the bundle
components are kept. Should Bevy remove the bundle components? Something
else?

The current design allows an entity to be reused for playing the same
sound with the same parameters repeatedly. This is a niche use case I'd
like to be supported, but if we have to give it up for a simpler design,
I'd be fine with that.

### What happens if users remove any of the components themselves?

As described above, currently, entities can be reused. Removing the
audio sink causes it to be "detached" (I kept the old `Drop` impl), so
the sound keeps playing. However, if the audio bundle components are not
removed, Bevy will detect this entity as a "queued" sound entity again
(has the bundle compoenents, without a sink component), just like before
playing the sound the first time, and start playing the sound again.

This behavior might be surprising? Should we do something different?

### Should mutations to `PlaybackSettings` be applied to the audio sink?

We currently do not do that. `PlaybackSettings` is just for the initial
settings when the sound starts playing. This is clearly documented.

Do we want to keep this behavior, or do we want to allow users to use
`PlaybackSettings` instead of `AudioSink`/`SpatialAudioSink` to control
sounds during playback too?

I think I prefer for them to be kept separate. It is not a bad mental
model once you understand it, and it is documented.

### Should `AudioSink` and `SpatialAudioSink` be unified into a single
component type?

They provide a similar API (via the `AudioSinkPlayback` trait) and it
might be annoying for users to have to deal with both of them. The
unification could be done using an enum that is matched on internally by
the methods. Spatial audio has extra features, so this might make it
harder to access. I think we shouldn't.

### Automatic synchronization of spatial sound properties from
Transforms?

Should Bevy automatically apply changes to Transforms to spatial audio
entities? How do we distinguish between listener and emitter? Which one
does the transform represent? Where should the other one come from?

Alternatively, leave this problem for now, and address it in a future
PR. Or do nothing, and let users deal with it, as shown in the
`spatial_audio_2d` and `spatial_audio_3d` examples.

---

## Changelog

Added:
- `AudioBundle`/`SpatialAudioBundle`, add them to entities to play
sounds.

Removed:
 - The `Audio` resource.
 - `AudioOutput` is no longer `pub`.

Changed:
 - `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of assets.

## Migration Guide

// TODO: write a more detailed migration guide, after the "unsolved
questions" are answered and this PR is finalized.

Before:

```rust

/// Need to store handles somewhere
#[derive(Resource)]
struct MyMusic {
    sink: Handle<AudioSink>,
}

fn play_music(
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    audio: Res<Audio>,
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mut commands: Commands,
) {
    let weak_handle = audio.play_with_settings(
        asset_server.load("music.ogg"),
        PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5),
    );
    // upgrade to strong handle and store it
    commands.insert_resource(MyMusic {
        sink: audio_sinks.get_handle(weak_handle),
    });
}

fn toggle_pause_music(
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mymusic: Option<Res<MyMusic>>,
) {
    if let Some(mymusic) = &mymusic {
        if let Some(sink) = audio_sinks.get(&mymusic.sink) {
            sink.toggle();
        }
    }
}
```

Now:

```rust
/// Marker component for our music entity
#[derive(Component)]
struct MyMusic;

fn play_music(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
) {
    commands.spawn((
        AudioBundle::from_audio_source(asset_server.load("music.ogg"))
            .with_settings(PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5)),
        MyMusic,
    ));
}

fn toggle_pause_music(
    // `AudioSink` will be inserted by Bevy when the audio starts playing
    query_music: Query<&AudioSink, With<MyMusic>>,
) {
    if let Ok(sink) = query.get_single() {
        sink.toggle();
    }
}
```

Science Annex Nightmare Inserts (#3288)

# Science Annex Nightmare Inserts

Apparently I'm the only one in CM who actually likes this fucking map,
and like a year ago I told nanu I'd make NM for science annex and
kutjevo. Also so help me God if this fucking lowers my GBP because i
don't know how the shitty GBP economy works I'm going to have an
aneurism.

**Also I'm not on the discord, if you have comments leave them on the
PR.** Nor will I be rejoining. That place sucks and I don't like
interacting with the retards on it. Sorry sweeties, but daddy has no
desire to rejoin that shitshow. You have no idea how freeing it is to
not hear people crying about everything at all times.

> This PR adds 4 new NM to the map Science Annex.

WRONG WE'RE AT 10 NOW BABY!!!!!!!!!

**Lan Party** 20% Chance


![gamerannex](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/0aa46b6d-ab20-4797-b35d-5ef7c3cb4a46)
This insert features an epic lan party between the prisoners and the
prison staff, who will win in this epic competition? Xenos.

**Pizza Palace** 30% Chance

![pizzaannex](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/eff5767a-8e0c-4c33-8c04-30d297c89ebd)
This insert changes the kitchen to be a pizza palace. Mamma Mia! (The
pizza time is replacing the sentry spawn, its so fricken thematic)

**Pool Party** 20% Chance

![poolannex](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/fd6d127e-7c63-4673-976f-9faa84100b68)
Woah dude, prison's out man heh surf's up dude! Come and hang out with
your best pals while everyone else around the station dies.

**Warden Office - Redecorated** 15% Chance

![wardenannex](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/32e221e2-20b4-4e66-814c-8ea62d7d6056)
The warden has found God, well a god, the god of HEFA and chose to
sacrifice himself to bring the pain! The knights said he had a change of
heart, but too bad!

**POD HOLD BABY** 10% Chance

![podhold2](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/0fbe2729-1473-4b05-8fe4-f34c30b75a09)
Oh yeah baby! I heard you've never even heard of this SOULFUL HOLD!!!!
Don't worry, with the NEW CHANGES coming to it, its now 25% better!
Better hope that medium chance sentry actually does spawn, though.

**Engineering Office** 30% Chance

![engieoffice](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/22a62e2b-dcf9-4a7c-a550-32134d691594)
Thought it would be cool if they didn't demolish the office, so here it
is repaired and with new minor stuff like a cool beret to tempt you to
check it out. Also don't read the paper.

**Research Cells Containment** 25% Chance

![research](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/e3aba4a6-d895-415a-8d9d-ec93bcdbd671)
The prison staff assumed that whoever was the cause of the outbreak was
in these cells. Unfortunately for everyone, they ended up being wrong.
You get to witness what's left over in the research cellblock if they
walls weren't destroyed from the beginning!

**Emergency Medical Practice** 20% Chance

![medicalhold](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/b41eeee2-9602-4cf1-8055-a6cf74dafc41)
Shit really started hitting the fan, so the medical staff set up a
temporary treatment area in the triage zone. Strangely, the sounds of
men screaming in agony attracts xenos, who knew?

**Scav Ship Hold** 10% Chance

![scavship](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/17386a2c-8b5a-4647-a102-38a845155be0)
I heard you liked single man suicide holds? Awesome news then, I've got
another one for you. This one even comes with elite mercenary gear to
help you survive. Only problem is the guy who owned it before you didn't
maintain it, and its not that protective now. One might say the slow
down of the armor will kill you, I say drip or drown loser. Go out in
style!

**Looted Armory** 15% Chance

![empty](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/7221de4f-43bd-4b7a-ae11-125c12e6c434)
You know what they say, the early bird gets the worm. Well in this case,
the early prisoners got all the gear. Help yourself to what's leftover,
it's not much!




**Miscellaneous changes**

The sentry gun in the park is gone. This shit still massacres new surv
players and they don't know what happened. Call it baby sitting, I don't
care. I intended to remove it when I changed LZ1 and forgot, so it goes
bye bye now!



![podhold](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/assets/133173804/2972a11d-ce94-4ce1-bd37-20f5a8a24d4f)
This piece of shit console now no longer blocks movement. The META
DEFINING pod hold is now slightly stronger. Honestly, 70% of the people
reading this probably don't even know where this is located and 100%
don't go into it. Listen, it bugs me that this shit blocks you being
able to move. Imagine having an extra dude to FF you in the now 4x4 box
of hell. The possibilities are endless, not really, but I'd like to
think so.
 
# Explain why it's good for the game
Nanu asked me to make NM for this map and kutjevo. I like this map more
than kutjevo, so I made some for here first. It adds character, who
doesn't want to sacrifice the warden for HEFA?

Sentry change is QOL for new players. It had literally 0 impact outside
of killing new players. Its funny, but we have to protect the children.
Call this the protect the children change and it will pass through the
dev team, I guarantee it.

The console change is a QOL change for me because its so fucking
annoying that this little piece of shit can stop me from moving. LOOK AT
IT, IT'S AGAINST THE FUCKING WALL, HOW DOES IT BLOCK THE ENTIRE TILE?!

qcacld-3.0: Defer HDD initialization.

 * ALso rely on userspace writing to /dev/wlan, Wi-Fi
   HAL writes "ON" or "OFF" to /dev/wlan.

 * Use this method to initialize hdd as it's a safer
   way to ensure both wlan_mac.bin and WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini
   are ready to be read.

 * This also eliminates the needs for horrible hacks
   to read the userspace file.

Rename User Entity 'surname' and 'name' properties.
In my opinion, project suffered from these badly chosen names. My mistake was not thinking through these two attributes' meanings as closely as I should've been. Result was vague 'name' property which could cause havoc as project progressed. Hence, I stepped on its tail ASAP here in this commit and made sure it's properly named: "first_name". Therefore, it clearly states it's purpose in User. Same goes for new "last_name" which replaces suboptimal obsolete "surname". (#6)
