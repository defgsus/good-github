[MIRROR] STAY IN THE LIGHT: Adds terrify Nightmare spell, terrified status effect, and a reason to mind the shadows [MDB IGNORE] (#18775)

* STAY IN THE LIGHT: Adds terrify Nightmare spell, terrified status effect, and a reason to mind the shadows (#72282)

Adds the Terrify spell, and its associated status effect, Terrified.
This new spell is given to antagonist nightmares, as a part of their
brain. The spell only works in those surrounded by darkness, and will
apply the Terrified status effect if successful. Upon being Terrified,
victims will passively gain **Terror Buildup** if they remain in the
dark. As buildup increases, so do the negative effects, including tunnel
vision, panic attacks, dizziness, and more.

There are two primary methods for mitigating terror buildup. The first
is moving into the light, which will reverse the passive terror buildup
and eventually make it go away. The other method is by getting a hug
from a friendly hand, which will reduce buildup significantly.

Getting a hug from an UNfriendly hand (a nightmare, for instance) will
cause the victim to freak out and be briefly knocked down. This can be
spammed on targets who are caught alone in the dark, keeping them in an
unfavorable position (sideways) and adding to the victim's terror
buildup considerably. Escape into the light as soon as possible, or
you'll be pushed to MAXIMUM TERROR BUILDUP.

To what end? Heart failure. Past the soft terror cap (which limits how
much passively generated terror you can make) exists the hard terror
cap. Bypassing that threshold will cause a stress induced heart attack
and knock you unconscious (embarrassing!)

for quest progress/request text entries for the deDE localisation with
proper casus/declension (these are not proper translated names of
locations/NPCs that have been left over by Blizzard since their language
localisations in TBC in 2006 and onward).

[FIX] website: redirect to case insensitive URL if not exact match

Before this commit, if a link to a page was not correct because of a
case mismatch, it would simply land on a 404 page.
While it's correct, as URL are case sensitive, it leads to a few bad UX
flow at the admin/editor level:
- Create a link in your page (on a text or a button eg), type an URL
  which does not exists (to create it after) like /Page
- Click on the link/button you just made, you are redirected to /Page
  which display a 404 with the "Create page" option (correct)
- When you click on that button, it will actually create a page with
  /page URL, leading to a mismatch between the URL you created and the
  page URL.
  Your link/button will still lead to a 404 URL as it points to /Page.

Since it's just a fallback when an exact URL match is not found, it
should not break anything and should not have bad impact at any level
(seo/speed etc).
Indeed:
- It's done through a 302 redirect
- `_serve_page()` is already a fallback case, so it will only make
  the `website.redirect` and 404 cases a bit slower due to the extra
  search query.

The only possible scenario seems to be if the user (mind the uppercase):
- Created a /Page page
- Created a redirect from /page to /another-page

In this case, /page won't land on /another-page but on /Page.
This flow seems unlikely and is not actually wrong either way.
At least, it certainly is less important than ensuring a case
insensitive fallback.

Finally, note that another solution would have been to either:
- Force page URL to lower case.
  -> This is not stable friendly, people might be relying on this to
     create pages with different casing:
     `/Batman-VII-The-Dark-Knight-Whatevers`, while not recommended,
     doesn't sounds idiot.
     On top of not being stable friendly, we probably want to keep
     offering this possibility
- Redirect all URLs to lowercase endpoints.
  -> This is obviously not stable and not Odoo's jobs. It should be
     something decided by the sysadmin and done at nginx (etc) level.

xfs: change the order in which child and parent defer ops are finished

commit 27dada070d59c28a441f1907d2cec891b17dcb26 upstream.

The defer ops code has been finishing items in the wrong order -- if a
top level defer op creates items A and B, and finishing item A creates
more defer ops A1 and A2, we'll put the new items on the end of the
chain and process them in the order A B A1 A2.  This is kind of weird,
since it's convenient for programmers to be able to think of A and B as
an ordered sequence where all the sub-tasks for A must finish before we
move on to B, e.g. A A1 A2 D.

Right now, our log intent items are not so complex that this matters,
but this will become important for the atomic extent swapping patchset.
In order to maintain correct reference counting of extents, we have to
unmap and remap extents in that order, and we want to complete that work
before moving on to the next range that the user wants to swap.  This
patch fixes defer ops to satsify that requirement.

The primary symptom of the incorrect order was noticed in an early
performance analysis of the atomic extent swap code.  An astonishingly
large number of deferred work items accumulated when userspace requested
an atomic update of two very fragmented files.  The cause of this was
traced to the same ordering bug in the inner loop of
xfs_defer_finish_noroll.

If the ->finish_item method of a deferred operation queues new deferred
operations, those new deferred ops are appended to the tail of the
pending work list.  To illustrate, say that a caller creates a
transaction t0 with four deferred operations D0-D3.  The first thing
defer ops does is roll the transaction to t1, leaving us with:

t1: D0(t0), D1(t0), D2(t0), D3(t0)

Let's say that finishing each of D0-D3 will create two new deferred ops.
After finish D0 and roll, we'll have the following chain:

t2: D1(t0), D2(t0), D3(t0), d4(t1), d5(t1)

d4 and d5 were logged to t1.  Notice that while we're about to start
work on D1, we haven't actually completed all the work implied by D0
being finished.  So far we've been careful (or lucky) to structure the
dfops callers such that D1 doesn't depend on d4 or d5 being finished,
but this is a potential logic bomb.

There's a second problem lurking.  Let's see what happens as we finish
D1-D3:

t3: D2(t0), D3(t0), d4(t1), d5(t1), d6(t2), d7(t2)
t4: D3(t0), d4(t1), d5(t1), d6(t2), d7(t2), d8(t3), d9(t3)
t5: d4(t1), d5(t1), d6(t2), d7(t2), d8(t3), d9(t3), d10(t4), d11(t4)

Let's say that d4-d11 are simple work items that don't queue any other
operations, which means that we can complete each d4 and roll to t6:

t6: d5(t1), d6(t2), d7(t2), d8(t3), d9(t3), d10(t4), d11(t4)
t7: d6(t2), d7(t2), d8(t3), d9(t3), d10(t4), d11(t4)
...
t11: d10(t4), d11(t4)
t12: d11(t4)
<done>

When we try to roll to transaction #12, we're holding defer op d11,
which we logged way back in t4.  This means that the tail of the log is
pinned at t4.  If the log is very small or there are a lot of other
threads updating metadata, this means that we might have wrapped the log
and cannot get roll to t11 because there isn't enough space left before
we'd run into t4.

Let's shift back to the original failure.  I mentioned before that I
discovered this flaw while developing the atomic file update code.  In
that scenario, we have a defer op (D0) that finds a range of file blocks
to remap, creates a handful of new defer ops to do that, and then asks
to be continued with however much work remains.

So, D0 is the original swapext deferred op.  The first thing defer ops
does is rolls to t1:

t1: D0(t0)

We try to finish D0, logging d1 and d2 in the process, but can't get all
the work done.  We log a done item and a new intent item for the work
that D0 still has to do, and roll to t2:

t2: D0'(t1), d1(t1), d2(t1)

We roll and try to finish D0', but still can't get all the work done, so
we log a done item and a new intent item for it, requeue D0 a second
time, and roll to t3:

t3: D0''(t2), d1(t1), d2(t1), d3(t2), d4(t2)

If it takes 48 more rolls to complete D0, then we'll finally dispense
with D0 in t50:

t50: D<fifty primes>(t49), d1(t1), ..., d102(t50)

We then try to roll again to get a chain like this:

t51: d1(t1), d2(t1), ..., d101(t50), d102(t50)
...
t152: d102(t50)
<done>

Notice that in rolling to transaction #51, we're holding on to a log
intent item for d1 that was logged in transaction #1.  This means that
the tail of the log is pinned at t1.  If the log is very small or there
are a lot of other threads updating metadata, this means that we might
have wrapped the log and cannot roll to t51 because there isn't enough
space left before we'd run into t1.  This is of course problem #2 again.

But notice the third problem with this scenario: we have 102 defer ops
tied to this transaction!  Each of these items are backed by pinned
kernel memory, which means that we risk OOM if the chains get too long.

Yikes.  Problem #1 is a subtle logic bomb that could hit someone in the
future; problem #2 applies (rarely) to the current upstream, and problem

This is not how incremental deferred operations were supposed to work.
The dfops design of logging in the same transaction an intent-done item
and a new intent item for the work remaining was to make it so that we
only have to juggle enough deferred work items to finish that one small
piece of work.  Deferred log item recovery will find that first
unfinished work item and restart it, no matter how many other intent
items might follow it in the log.  Therefore, it's ok to put the new
intents at the start of the dfops chain.

For the first example, the chains look like this:

t2: d4(t1), d5(t1), D1(t0), D2(t0), D3(t0)
t3: d5(t1), D1(t0), D2(t0), D3(t0)
...
t9: d9(t7), D3(t0)
t10: D3(t0)
t11: d10(t10), d11(t10)
t12: d11(t10)

For the second example, the chains look like this:

t1: D0(t0)
t2: d1(t1), d2(t1), D0'(t1)
t3: d2(t1), D0'(t1)
t4: D0'(t1)
t5: d1(t4), d2(t4), D0''(t4)
...
t148: D0<50 primes>(t147)
t149: d101(t148), d102(t148)
t150: d102(t148)
<done>

This actually sucks more for pinning the log tail (we try to roll to t10
while holding an intent item that was logged in t1) but we've solved
problem #1.  We've also reduced the maximum chain length from:

    sum(all the new items) + nr_original_items

to:

    max(new items that each original item creates) + nr_original_items

This solves problem #3 by sharply reducing the number of defer ops that
can be attached to a transaction at any given time.  The change makes
the problem of log tail pinning worse, but is improvement we need to
solve problem #2.  Actually solving #2, however, is left to the next
patch.

Note that a subsequent analysis of some hard-to-trigger reflink and COW
livelocks on extremely fragmented filesystems (or systems running a lot
of IO threads) showed the same symptoms -- uncomfortably large numbers
of incore deferred work items and occasional stalls in the transaction
grant code while waiting for log reservations.  I think this patch and
the next one will also solve these problems.

As originally written, the code used list_splice_tail_init instead of
list_splice_init, so change that, and leave a short comment explaining
our actions.

hash-object: use fsck for object checks

Since c879daa237 (Make hash-object more robust against malformed
objects, 2011-02-05), we've done some rudimentary checks against objects
we're about to write by running them through our usual parsers for
trees, commits, and tags.

These parsers catch some problems, but they are not nearly as careful as
the fsck functions (which make sense; the parsers are designed to be
fast and forgiving, bailing only when the input is unintelligible). We
are better off doing the more thorough fsck checks when writing objects.
Doing so at write time is much better than writing garbage only to find
out later (after building more history atop it!) that fsck complains
about it, or hosts with transfer.fsckObjects reject it.

This is obviously going to be a user-visible behavior change, and the
test changes earlier in this series show the scope of the impact. But
I'd argue that this is OK:

  - the documentation for hash-object is already vague about which
    checks we might do, saying that --literally will allow "any
    garbage[...] which might not otherwise pass standard object parsing
    or git-fsck checks". So we are already covered under the documented
    behavior.

  - users don't generally run hash-object anyway. There are a lot of
    spots in the tests that needed to be updated because creating
    garbage objects is something that Git's tests disproportionately do.

  - it's hard to imagine anyone thinking the new behavior is worse. Any
    object we reject would be a potential problem down the road for the
    user. And if they really want to create garbage, --literally is
    already the escape hatch they need.

Note that the change here is actually in index_mem(), which handles the
HASH_FORMAT_CHECK flag passed by hash-object. That flag is also used by
"git-replace --edit" to sanity-check the result. Covering that with more
thorough checks likewise seems like a good thing.

Besides being more thorough, there are a few other bonuses:

  - we get rid of some questionable stack allocations of object structs.
    These don't seem to currently cause any problems in practice, but
    they subtly violate some of the assumptions made by the rest of the
    code (e.g., the "struct commit" we put on the stack and
    zero-initialize will not have a proper index from
    alloc_comit_index().

  - likewise, those parsed object structs are the source of some small
    memory leaks

  - the resulting messages are much better. For example:

      [before]
      $ echo 'tree 123' | git hash-object -t commit --stdin
      error: bogus commit object 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
      fatal: corrupt commit

      [after]
      $ echo 'tree 123' | git.compile hash-object -t commit --stdin
      error: object fails fsck: badTreeSha1: invalid 'tree' line format - bad sha1
      fatal: refusing to create malformed object

Fixes critical plane masters improperly not being readded in show_to (#72604)

## About The Pull Request

[Adds support for pulling z offset context from an atom's
plane](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/9f215c5316e5cfdbedf6a23ff97dfee0e523354b)

This is needed to fix paper bins, since the object we plane set there
isn't actually on a z level.
Useful elsewhere too!

[Fixes compiler errors that came from asserting that plane spokesmen had
a plane
var](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/b830002443f2fbe230e9ff00236d7a46a9f2eec7)

[Ensures lighting backdrops ALWAYS exist for each lighting
plane.](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/0e931169f7c5336333bc6f41353c82f603fc1170)

They can't float becuase we can see more then one plane at once yaknow?

[Fixes parallax going to shit if a mob moved zs without having a
client](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/244b2b25baecfc644505a3ea1e348e0cb97a04e0)

Issue lies with how is_outside_bounds just blocked any plane readding
It's possible for a client to not be connected during z moves, so we
need to account for them rejoining in show_to, instead of just blocking
any of our edge cases.

Fixing this involved having parallax override blocks for show_plane and
anything with the right critical flags ensuring mobs have JUST the right
PMs and relays.
It's duped logic but I'm unsure of how else to handle it and frankly
this stuff is just kinda depressing.
Might refactor later

[show_to can be called twice successfully with no hide_from
call.](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/092581a5c06f7f884f48d41c96fa9300327ef214)

Ensures no runtimes off the registers from this

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes #72543
Fixes lighting looking batshit on multiz. None reported this I cry into
the night.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Fixes parallax showing up ABOVE the game if you moved z levels
while disconnected

2 New Positive Quirks! (#72912)

## About The Pull Request

I added a few quirks to a downstream that I feel fit well with tg so
here they are.

First up is Poster Boy, a quirk that gives you three mood altering
posters, similar to the traitor objective to hang up demoralizing
posters. You spawn with a box that has one poster that will uplift the
entire crews spirits and 2 that are unique to your department. Captain
counts for security and assistants get only neutral posters. Finally,
with a crayon or spraycan, if you are any antagonist you can make your
poster into one of the ones from the traitor objective.

![dreamseeker_nRy44SL9Jb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/214109008-6f1b4b7c-e800-4142-be6d-926a8e975973.png)
example of quirk posters
Costs 4.


Finally, the characterful Throwing Arm quirk, which lets you throw
objects further (but not harder) and means you will never miss shots
into the disposals bin.
Costs 7.

previously i had a food subscription quirk here as well but i pulled it
out and plan to re-add it as a separate PR in march, where it will now
give you ingredients to cook a meal with occasionally.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Positive quirk variety is good and fun, I think that these positive
quirks are reasonable ones that offer unique things that the current
positive quirks do not.
Poster boy gives people a reason to run around and claim wall real
estate for their department and hopefully can build more solidarity in
departments, the hidden antag feature probably has uses but is just for
styling on people.
Throwing arm offers a fun character trait that probably can have some
slight uses and encourages the use of throwing weapons and tools more.
Also it is good to have a way to never miss the disposals bin. It's so
embarrassing.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Poster boy and Throwing arm positive quirks.
imageadd: added posters for poster boy quirk

Adds the DNA Infuser, a genetics machine you feed corpses to infuse their DNA with yours! What could go wrong?! (#71351)

## About The Pull Request  
Adds the "DNA Infuser" to genetics. One person enters, a corpse is added
to the machine, and you can activate the machine to "infuse" the subject
with the DNA. This converts one random organ from a set into the
mob-related organ.

### Rat mutation 🐀

Rats can be fed in to turn you into a rat-creature-thing!
```diff
+See better in the dark
+Can pretty much eat anything! Toxic foods, gross foods, whatever works!
+Smaller, and can climb tables
?Randomly squeaks occasionally?
-Take twice as much damage
-Vulnerable to flashes
-Gets hungry MUCH quicker.
-Yes, eat anything, but only ENJOY dairy.
```
Having every rat organ at once allows you to ventcrawl nude!

### Carp mutation 🐟 

Carp work for a mutation as well!
```diff
+Strong jaws, that drop teeth over time!
+Space immunity! Breathe in space, unbothered by pressure or cold!
+Smaller, and can climb tables
-Can't block your jaws with a mask
-Can't take the heat, overheats easily
-Can only breathe in environments that have minimal or no oxygen
-Nomadic. If you don't enter a new zlevel for awhile, you'll start feeling anxious.
```
Having every carp organ at once allows you to swim through space!

### Fly mutation 🪰 

Any corpses without organs to turn into turn into fly organs! Fly organs
now have a bonus for collecting them all, transforming you into a fly,
when you pass the threshold. But even without those, fly organs are
technically... organs. They most of the time work like normal ones.

## Todo 🐦 

- [x] Finish the infuser code
- [x] Create a little booklet that shows what kind of shit you can turn
into, hopefully i can autogenerate this based off of organ set subtypes
list
- [x] sprite/slap a color on rat mutant organs
- [x] Maybe make a *few* more organ sets

## Why It's Good For The Game 🐑 

Oops, I forgor to fill this out! My hackmd is here.

https://hackmd.io/@bazelart/ByFkhuUIi

## Changelog 🧬 

:cl: Tralezab code, Azlan + Azarak (Az gaaang) for the organs
add: Added the DNA infuser to genetics! Person goes in, corpse goes in,
and they combine!
add: Try not to turn yourself into a fly, OK?

wifiap: Temporarily switch HackerFi-Guest to 2g

My ipad pro 10.5" (and some of my friends' apple wireless devices back
when the eap245v3 was used for the network in the house my senior year
of undergrad) has intermittent connection issues (which most often
present themselves as failing to connect to the network) when using a 5g
wifi channel from the eap245v3. I tried disabling
`wpa_disable_eapol_key_retries`, disabling `isolate`, using a non-DFS
channel, using WPA2 authentication instead of WPA3, using a different
channel width, and adjusting the DTIM and beacon interval all to no
avail. The only thing that fixes the issues is to use a 2g channel
instead of a 5g channel.

Nothing stood out to me as being obviously different between successful
and failed connections when investigating with wireshark. I tried to
enable debug output for the ath10k driver/firmware stack as instructed
in these 2 locations:

https://www.candelatech.com/ath10k-bugs.php
https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ath10k/debug

but was unsuccessful.

`logread` on the eap245v3 would report many cases of the following when
the ipad failed to connect:

```
Thu Nov  3 10:29:21 2022 daemon.notice hostapd: wlan0-1: STA 86:71:6e:b7:2c:ff IEEE 802.11: did not acknowledge authentication response
```

Being unable to dig further (without a significant time investment) into
a likely driver or firmware-based issue, I resolved myself to using a 2g
channel to make the ipad happy, where "happy" means "able to connect
to the wifi network the first time" and "able to maintain a connection
for long periods of time". However, I realized the ipad was having
throughput issues on the 2g channel, likely due to congestion since I
live in an apartment complex with many busy 2g networks nearby. Running:

```
iw dev wlan1 station dump
```

on the eap245v3 confirmed approximately 25% retransmission rate and 1%
outright failure!

As such, I have purchased a device with an alternate driver/firmware
stack (mt76) in the hopes that it will work nicer with my ipad on 5g
channels.

Balance/optimization/polishing (part 25 of ???)

Artefacts:
- Chinese Calligraphy now increases vassal opinion by +1 instead of town opinion by +2.

Landed titles:
- Added a bunch more titular Chinese empires.

Laws:
- Minahasan pagans are now eligible for Cognatic succession and Feudal Elective (for the time being). Starting setup TODO.

Objectives:
- Female Enatic rulers will now plot to kill their husbands if they don't have a daughter and their husband is an eunuch.
- Added a new ambition for Taoists to become Immortal. This makes it more likely that the "Matters of Life and Death" event will fire, and will do other things down the line.

Religions:
- Minahasans now reform to the correct religion.

Scripted effects:
- Made it less likely for CI realms to go from e.g. Poor to Unquestioned Mandate on normal succession.
- The TF now helps the EoC with his MoH rating.
- Fixed some issues with Chinese dynasty name flag cleanup.

Succession voting:
- Added "electors" for Fraternal Seniority (to keep the player from using it as a primogeniture substitute).

Traits:
- Added new incapable_according_to_regent trait.

Decisions:
- Shinto Japanese Monastic Feudal characters no longer get to convert between Japanese religions by decision, seeing as that'd result in a government change.
- Set up the remaining intra-Japanese religious conversion.
- The AI now appoints new Saio/Saiin on_five_year_pulse.
- Limited the ability to convert to Jainism somewhat, seeing as the religion effectively didn't leave India historically.
- Chinese artifact searching is now a bit more widely available, but also a bit more expensive.
- Removed the decisions to create specific Chinese artefacts; it potentially resulted in too many artefacts being around.
- Improved Chinese character decision setup, and made them consistent with Grace/Bloodline character creation.
- It is no longer possible to support a Rising Sun Subjugation when none is being prepared.

Events:
- Wako captain gender now takes home province title holder's view on gender into account.
- Made the AI appoint new Saio/Saiin on_five_year_pulse.
- Scandalous Saio/Saiin now hurt Shinto MA.
- Improved on province religion flipping in Japan, including adding Shugendo and Koshin.
- Improved on character religion flipping in Japan, including adding Shugendo and Koshin.
- Japanese provinces no longer flip to random religions.
- Cleaned up leftover old Grace events.
- Fixed some event id issues.
- Hindu and Jain ascetics should no longer appear in weird places.
- Fixed vanilla issue with physician-missionaries potentially coming from non-proselytizing reformed HF pagan realms.
- Fixed Tianxia issue with physician-missionaries potentially coming from Chinese-/Japanese-style realms.
- The dueling master from the Martial Ambition/War Focus event should no longer show up where chopsticks are common, seeing as that's rather unfitting.
- A ruler declared incapable by their regent now gets a fancy new incapacitating trait rather than the Incapable trait, seeing as the latter affects stuff like health and fertility, which a regent can't magically affect. Fixes vanilla stupidity.
- Wako characters can now pick up the Pirate trait and its upgrades from raiding even if non-pagan and lacking a pirate bloodline.
- Reserved ids for Treasure Fleet stuff.

History:
- Reduced potential holdings in Sakhalin, Hokkaido, Taiwan, and assorted other islands somewhat.
- Reduced potential holdings in Africa (south of vanilla) somewhat.
- Added/adjusted some temples to increase pagan MA.
- Korehazi no Azamaro's event troops are no longer inheritable. Die, Mutsu; die!
- Added former_eoc_traits to historical EoCs and pretenders that lost their throne.
- Su Shi is now a Poet.
- Sun Bu'er now becomes Disfigured partway through her life.
- (Xi-)Xia is now e_white_and_lofty.

Localization:
- Assorted smaller improvements.
- Updated customizable_localisation for Chinese Imperial stuff.
- Monastic Feudal's desc now accounts for all Bön rulers being eligible.
- Fixed a few instances of vanilla forgetting that a court chaplain isn't necessarily male.

Syndicate Bomb Core Payloads Can Only Be Triggered via the Bomb (#72986)

## About The Pull Request

Basically, you can't extract the bomb core, slap a 10-second c4 on it/on
the shell/and run off having triggered an incredibly powerful explosion.
This is accomplished by having the syndicate bomb override ex_act (it
will be deleted if the explosion goes off), as well as the payload
itself being subtyped into something resistant to bombs and burning.

In-universe, this is described as the shell being quite resistant to
forms of external explosive force- but if any explosive force comes from
within the bomb's shell: kabloom. The bombcore itself has been
redesigned (in a rare moment of non-ineptude) by Donk Co., who has
redesigned the bomb core payload from the ground up- meaning that it can
only be detonated electronically by an impulse from the bomb machinery.
Cutting the wrong wire and attempting to get rid of the bomb by hitting
it with an axe or something will still cause it to blow up, but you know
how those things can be.
## Why It's Good For The Game

I feel like the point of the syndicate bomb is to be a threat for the
crew to match up against. I want a clown in bomb squad gear to head out
to the site and sweat trying to figure out which wire it is, until....
KA-BLHONK: red mist. Or, I want some "helpful" assistant to interrupt
someone's session by going "I KNOW WHAT WIRE IT IS", and having those
odds of either blowing everyone around them up or actually saving the
day.

Being able to detonate something that was balanced and designed to have
_at least_ one minute and a half in **10 SECONDS** is just so injurious
to the game. You can buy a shitload of these bombs, extract the cores,
slap c4 on it and go around the station doling out some serious
explosions. You can run into medbay, wrench it down, slap a c4 on it AND
NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! They can't cut wires, they can't figure
it out to save the day, all they can do is run. Running from danger is
fine and acceptable, but it's just completely stacked against the crew
in a way that I feel needs to be rectified somehow.

I like the idea of purposefully fucking with the wires on the spot so
you sacrificially kill everyone, that feels quite fair to me. I just
simply don't like the fact that you can waltz around the station
punching huge gaps in the hull (remember, putting c4 on the bomb core
itself would cause it to go kabloom) with nearly nothing as far as risk.
It's way too rewarding for something very easy to accomplish (there's a
reason why it's 90 seconds- it's not meant to be easy to accomplish).

This doesn't affect base bombcore behavior, just the explodey ones that
come standard in syndicate bombs.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: After an unfortunate event occuring when some nuclear
operatives took the ship to a Fireworks Store, the Syndicate have
re-engineered their bomb cores to only explode when electronically
triggered by the bomb shell itself. The payload inside a standard
syndicate bomb can not be exploded with another explosion, you must keep
it in the bomb machinery for it to actually do some explodey stuff.

It Came From Outer Spess: Adds midround changelings, delivered by an absolutely disgusting changeling meteor (#73018)

## About The Pull Request

Adds a new dynamic midround opportunity and random event - Space
Changeling.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28870487/215284465-f5c5c1b1-b83d-471a-89be-1b65a4d2f2d4.mp4

If you are fortunate enough to recieve this role, you will be stuffed
into a changeling meteor and hurled at the side of the station. With no
crew identities, no access, and no equipment, you'll have to rely on
your **free** organic space suit and armblade to infiltrate the station
and get settled.

With no disguises to fall back on, the midround changeling experience
may lead to some very unfavorable situations. It's not unlikely that
you'll be spotted making your way inside, or that someone will see the
impact site and cause a panic. This role is not easy, but keep in mind
that you also have nothing to lose in the event that you use Lesser
Form/Headslug.

Aside from the starting circumstances, you have the same objectives and
capabilities as a roundstart changeling. Getting inside of the station
will be the hard part, but from there you can do what changelings do
best and blend in.

<details>
<summary>A brief note on the free stuff you get:</summary>
<br>
You get the organic space suit and armblade for free. The space suit is
absolutely vital, but I decided that the armblade should be given for
free as well. It's necessary for breaking open windows or airlocks and
getting access to the station, since otherwise your options are limited
to arrivals/departures. Having to pay a 2 point tax to avoid walking
naked into the main hallways of the station and getting gibbed is lame,
and with the added difficulty of the role I think it's fair.
</details>

Also, this is my 100th PR here! :)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Adds midround changelings in a WAY COOLER way than just making a random
crew/new arrival a changeling.

Lets people experience Hardmode Changeling, and test the adaptability
and flexibility of the most versatile antagonist even harder than
before. Losing the option to bypass the whole shape-shifter thing by
disguising as your crew identity presents a welcome change to the
formula.

Adds a teensy bit more midround variety, so we stop getting Nightmare At
The Thirty Minute Mark every round.
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
add: Midround changeling spawn event.
add: Changeling meteor. It has a present for you.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

🚶‍♂️Add 11 New Walking Styles (#99) 🚶‍♂️

HUGE thanks to @MadsLeander 

Notes/descriptions of the walking styles:

Bigfoot (move_characters@orleans@core@) - Head hanging slightly forwards, somewhat hurting in left fot, wide with arms as if he's large, walking slow, runs crazy and fast (Used by this character in storymode: https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Sasquatch_Roleplayer)

Coward (move_m@coward) - Hunched forward when standing still, other wise not diffrent from the default male walk.

Dave (move_characters@dave_n) - Shoulders are higher then normal walk, standing wide when still, left foot hurting when running/jogging (sprint is the default one) (Used by Dave Norton in storymode)

    Femme2 (move_m@femme@) - Shoulders are "swinging", left leg is leaned on when standing still, generally can be best described as a feminine walk for male peds, run and sprint are like the default one (This is one of the avalible walks in GTA Online)

Jimmy (move_characters@jimmy) - Similar to nervous/slow (they are all from the same character afterall), but with out the nervous or slow part (walks normal speed and not tripping with legs when standing still) (Used by Jimmy, the son of Michael in storymode)

Patricia (move_characters@patricia) - Swinging with hips, straight/stiff back, run/sprint is similar to the default female one (Used by Patricia Madrazo in storymode)

Ron (move_characters@ron) - Entire body posture slightly hanging to the left, runs like an idiot, sprint is normal. (Used by Ronald "Ron" Jakowski in storymode)

Swagger2 (move_m@swagger@b) - Confident and somewhat slow walking, moving slightly to the right every so often, run an sprint is normal.

Gangster6 (move_f@gangster@ng) - Slight diffrent in walking speed, posture is noticible diffrent, arms are more straight when standing still.

Veryslow (move_m@leaf_blower) - Head looking down, walking very slowly, running with right arm as if he had a leaf blower, sprint is normal.

Flee5 (move_m@flee@c) - Similar to Flee4, but multiple diffrences like how many times he turns his head to look behind etc.

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].
With this patch a process can be killed via:

 {

         return syscall(__NR_pidfd_send_signal, pidfd, sig, info, flags);
 #else
         return -ENOSYS;

 }

 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 {
         int fd, ret, saved_errno, sig;

                 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

         fd = open(argv[1], O_DIRECTORY | O_CLOEXEC);
         if (fd < 0) {
                 printf("%s - Failed to open \"%s\"\n", strerror(errno), argv[1]);
                 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

         sig = atoi(argv[2]);

         printf("Sending signal %d to process %s\n", sig, argv[1]);
         ret = do_pidfd_send_signal(fd, sig, NULL, 0);

         saved_errno = errno;
         close(fd);
         errno = saved_errno;

         if (ret < 0) {
                 printf("%s - Failed to send signal %d to process %s\n",
                        strerror(errno), sig, argv[1]);
                 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

         exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

 */
Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

#### Saturday 2023-02-04 16:20:25 by Jan-Cord

finished chord refactor + minor fixes
- added (remaining) muted strings
- fixed placement of text behind chord boxes in a lot of songs
- added some \vspace hacks ocasionally, to fix bad pagebreaks
- "Kopfüber in die Hölle": removed the note that said "Capo 3. Bund" because it seems to be wrong. Don't know where I found that originally...
- added sources to some songs
- "Mit dir schlafen": removed redundant C chordscheme that wasn't used
- "Nicht Wecken": added missing Am chordscheme
- "Trinklied": got rid of that annoying linebreak in line 3, by forcing it into a single line (using \adjustbox) (hack)
- "Volle Fahrt": removed redundant Bm chordscheme

Update LICENSE to be GPLv3

As much as I don't think I'll ever enforce it,
it does show good faith to the FOSS community what I
*intend* for others. Again, fuck cops and I don't want
to send cops to peoples doors for breaking the license
nor do I want to threaten to send cops to peoples doors
for saying "fuck you, I do what I want" to me. I like
people who say "fuck you, I do what I want."

This is really a license to appeal to diehard FOSS people
and make them feel comfortable with the software.

[cli][frameworks][fs-detectors][next] detect framework versions (#9009)

This PR:

- updates `packages/frameworks` to have most supported frameworks specify which dependency version should reflect the overall framework version
- updates `packages/fs-detectors` to allow framework detection that returns the full `Framework` record instead of just the slug
- updates `packages/next` to return the detected Next.js version in the build result
- updates `packages/cli` to leverage these changes so that `vc build` can add `framework: { version: string; }` to `config.json` output

The result is that Build Output API and supported frameworks will return their framework version in the build result of `vc build` when possible, which is used by the build container  when creating the deployment. The dashboard later retrieves this value to display in richer deployment outputs.

Supports:

- https://github.com/vercel/api/pull/15601
- https://github.com/vercel/front/pull/18319

---

With the related build container updates, we get to see Next.js version in the build output. You'll see this with BOA+Prebuilt or a normal deploy:

---

### The Path to this PR

I went through all the supported frameworks and figured out how to best determine their versions. For most of them, we can check a known dependency's installed version number. 

We can get most of the way only checking npm. For a handful, we'd have to support Go/Ruby/Rust/Whatever dependencies.

I started with a more complex method signature to allow for later expansion without changing the signature. It looked like this, in practice:

```
async getVersion(dependencies: DependencyMap) => depedencies['next']
```

However, after checking all currently supported frameworks, I don't think this will end up being necessary. It also has the constraint that all dependencies have to be gathered and presented to the function even though it only needs to check for one or two. That's not a huge deal if we have them already where we need them, but we don't. We could use a variant here where this function does its own lookups, but this seemed unnecessary and would beg for duplication and small variances that could cause bugs.

Further, if we only look at `package.json`, we're going to either see a specific version of a version range. To be precise, we have to look at the installed version of the package. That means checking one of the various types of lockfiles that can exist or poking into node_modules.

If we poke into node_modules to detect the installed version, we introduce another point where Yarn 3 (default mode) will not be supported. If we read lockfiles, we have to potentially parse `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn` lockfiles.

If we use `npm ls <package-name>`, that also fails in Yarn 3 (default mode). We could accept that and go forward anyway, which would look like:

```
const args = `ls ${packageName} --depth=0 --json`.split(' ');
const { stdout } = await execa('npm', args, { cwd });
const regex = new RegExp(String.raw`${packageName}@([\.\d]+)`);
const matches = stdout.match(regex);
if (matches) {
  return matches[1];
}
```

But it turns out there's a `--json` option! That's what I ended up using, for now.

We could explore the lockfile route more, but after some initial digging, it' non-trivial. There are 3 main lockfiles we'd want to check for (npm, pnpm, and yarn) and there are different lockfile versions that put necessary data in different places. I looked for existing tools that parse this, but I didn't find any. We could certainly go down this path, but the effort doesn't seem worth it when `npm ls` gets us really close.

---

### Follow-up Versioning

Now that we know how to determine version per framework, we can vary configuration by version. In a future PR, we could allow a given value to vary by version number:

```
name: (version) => {
  if (semver.gt(version, '9.8.7')) {
    return 'some-framework-2''
  }

  return 'some-framework';
}
```

However, it may still be easier to differentiate significant versions by adding multiple entries in the list.

I HATE LIVERMED, I HATE LIVERMED, I HATE LIVERMED!!! (#3714)

* Makes combat medical kits better

- Replaces Dylovene pill bottle on Combat Medical Kit with Carthatoline pill bottle, as every chem inside it already WAS an upgrade over their normal counterparts, making it better at halting toxins damage and preventing liver from killing you. Also adds a Sanguinum syrette to stave off massive bloodloss which would cause the former as well.
- Replaces one of the Quicklot syrettes with a Sanguinum syrette on the Oxygen Deprivation First Aid Kit for better treatment of causes of oxyloss.
- Standardizes pill icons based on chem colors across all pre-built pills for easier reognition.
- Guarantees the "skill issue/salt PR" tag since it doesn't fix underlying issues of current medical system

* Adds carthatoline pills to deferred and corpsman large kit

Keeping in line with the rest of the PR.

* Blood regen pills!

- Adds pre-made Ferritin-Hemosiderin pills composed of iron and protein to help regenerate lost blood
- Replaces Sanguinum syrette on combat kit with ferritin-hemosiderin pill bottle
- Combat surgery kits now really hold advanced tools (except bone gel since the adv version is Soteria made)
- Makes the advanced bone gel item description not a copypaste of its stock counterpart

* Forgot a comma

Damn my haste.

Extract `FrameVisit` to drive `FrameController`

The problem
---

Programmatically driving a `<turbo-frame>` element when its `[src]`
attribute changes is a suitable end-user experience in consumer
applications. It's a fitting black-box interface for the outside world:
change the value of the attribute and let Turbo handle the rest.

However, internally, it's a lossy abstraction.

For example, when the `FrameRedirector` class listens for page-wide
`click` and `submit` events, it determines if their targets are meant to
drive a `<turbo-frame>` element by:

1. finding an element that matches a clicked `<a>` element's `[data-turbo-frame]` attribute
2. finding an element that matches a submitted `<form>` element's `[data-turbo-frame]` attribute
3. finding an element that matches a submitted `<form>` element's
   _submitter's_ `[data-turbo-frame]` attribute
4. finding the closest `<turbo-frame>` ancestor to the `<a>` or `<form>`

Once it finds the matching frame element, it disposes of all that
additional context and navigates the `<turbo-frame>` by updating its
`[src]` attribute. This makes it impossible to control various aspects
of the frame navigation (like its "rendering" explored in
[hotwired/turbo#146][]) outside of its destination URL.

Similarly, since a `<form>` and submitter pairing have an impact on
which `<turbo-frame>` is navigated, the `FrameController` implementation
passes around a `HTMLFormElement` and `HTMLSubmitter?` data clump and
constantly re-fetches a matching `<turbo-frame>` instance.

Outside of frames, page-wide navigation is driven by a `Visit` instance
that manages the HTTP life cycle and delegates along the way to a
`VisitDelegate`. It also pairs calls to visit with a `VisitOption`
object to capture additional context.

The proposal
---

This commit introduces the `FrameVisit` class. It serves as an
encapsulation of the `FetchRequest` and `FormSubmission` lifecycle
events involved in navigating a frame.

It's implementation draws inspiration from the `Visit`, `VisitDelegate`,
and `VisitOptions` pairing. Since the `FrameVisit` knows how to unify
both `FetchRequest` and `FormSubmission` hooks, the resulting callbacks
fired from within the `FrameController` are flat and consistent.

Extra benefits
---

The biggest benefit is the introduction of a DRY abstraction to
manage the behind the scenes HTTP calls necessary to drive a
`<turbo-frame>`.

With the introduction of the `FrameVisit` concept, we can also declare a
`visit()` and `submit()` method for `FrameElementDelegate`
implementations in the place of other implementation-specific methods
like `loadResponse()` and `formSubmissionIntercepted()`.

In addition, these changes have the potential to close
[hotwired/turbo#326][], since we can consistently invoke
`loadResponse()` across `<a>`-click-initiated and
`<form>`-submission-initiated visits. To ensure that's the case, this
commit adds test coverage for navigating a `<turbo-frame>` by making a
`GET` request to an endpoint that responds with a `500` status.

includes my La Luz ruck run.

Very slightly better stats than my previous La Luz ruck run of this
year, but the top of my Amphipod handheld had trouble, which
interfered with me drinking when I wanted.  Additionally there was a
lot of gray, potentially slippery, old ice to deal with.  I wound up
not pushing myself as hard as I'd like, but at least my hot-spot
didn't hold me back (although I took 400mg ibuprofen and 500mg
acetaminophen and four double espressos before I started).

FWIW, I wasn't able to do this training last year due to a foot injury
and I wasn't able to do it two years ago due to a leg injury. So, I'm
definitely in better shape than I have been for the last couple of
years, but that's not saying much.  This is much faster than 2019, when
I was in excellent shape, but that was due to there being so much snow
at the top that I had to walk a lot.

Bottom line is I think I got a good, but not great, much less
excellent training effect from today's run.  I am hoping that my
hot-spot will continue to heal, since that's currently my weak link.

"1:25pm. Done with the chores. Let me read manga for a bit, chill a bit more and then I will clone Ionide and start studying it. Initially, I just want to read the code raw to get a sense for the codebase. Then I'd need to work on getting it to run. Only once I've acccomplished that can I start development on it.

1:35pm. I know I am slacking today, but after such a tense yesterday, I can finally unwind a little. Somehow I am starting to treasure that I won't have any emails to deal with over the weekend.

It is Saturday so I am allowed to slack off a little. That should be my mindset. If anything, it is abnormal how I just kept going over the past 8. And even during my trading days I didn't really make a distinction.

Hrrrrmmmmm...

Yeah, even though I'll contribute to F# open source, but I kind of want to continue Youtubing. I'll have to look into voice synthesis at some point then.

11ai is great, and I am even considering making HK a drama once an OS alternative comes out, but in order for it to be viable for that kind of thing, I'd want the voice synthesizer to be cable of even expressing emotion.

2pm. Ok, let's get started. I'll lightly get into it.

Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer

I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!

Heh, I remember this.

Ionide couldn't be created without the support of Lambda Factory.

I clicked on the link and it is broken.

Let me try cloning this.

2:10pm. I need to install the .NET 6 SDK. I am still on 3.1. I am quite behind the curve I at this point, aren't? I sometimes wonder whether I should upgrade Spiral to the latest thing, but the Hopac library is hardly maintained so I do not want to bother.

I kind of like Hopac, so I'd make it one of my OSS projects if it came to that. I already studied its source.

2:15pm. The first challenge is always to just build the project. It can be harder than it seems.

I opened issue 1820.

`.> "E:\ionide-vscode-fsharp\packages\Yarnpkg.js\tools\yarn.cmd" install (In: false, Out: false, Err: false)`

Hmmm, let me take a look at this.

2:35pm. There is nothing inside the packages folder.

2:40pm. Let me try running `npm install`.

https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#first-time-build

I see there are first time build instructions here.

I somehow missed it. I'll follow the guide from here on out.

Let me fork the project and retarget it on my own.

3:05pm. https://github.com/mrakgr/ionide-vscode-fsharp

I can't figure out how to change the repo. Let me just clone if from my own and build it again.

Hmmm, maybe I should have just changed the remote? Nevermind.

https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#launching-ionide

3:15pm. I managed to launch the extension host, and it works!

Right now, the project's master just renamed to main. That surprised me.

3:30pm. https://github.com/Hopac/Hopac/milestones

I feel bad that Hopac was abandoned like this.

> Would [Hopac](https://github.com/Hopac/Hopac) be a good choice? Spiral uses it for its language services and I even studied its source years back, along with Rx, so maybe bringing it up to .NET 7 compatibility might not be a bad idea for a side project (as the first step.) It is not particularly popular though, and I am doing this in order to get on the track to paid work, so picking it as a project might be contrary to that goal.

I'll ask this of Kristof as well.

This would have the benefit of allowing me to create a concurrency library for novel AI hardware as well. I studied its source, but I certainly do not understand it enough to the point where I could replicate the library.

3:40pm. Now forget this. I got Ionide to run in the extension manager. What I should do now is study its source for a few hours.

> abstract eq: v1: U2<string, SemVer> * v2: U2<string, SemVer> * ?optionsOrLoose: U2<bool, Semver.Options> -> bool

Oh, I keep forgetting F# has U2. I always define my own types instead.

```fs
        type LspRange =
            { start: Fable.Import.VSCode.Vscode.Position
              ``end``: Fable.Import.VSCode.Vscode.Position }
```

I had no idea that you could just put keywords in double graves to get them as record fields.

...I knew about function names, but not about these.

4:10pm. I've been thinking about the stock market lately.

https://www.google.com/finance/quote/QQQ:NASDAQ?hl=en&window=1Y

During the night I was thinking how the situation last week was bullish. I am surprised it just broke out right this week. Now this is super bullish. I thought it might go back and forth for a month before doing this. I'd be all in here, if I had an account and the money.

Back in mid November, I was kind of on the fence, I thought it would be better to wait a month or two, and then it went down, but the show of strength of late January is qualitatively different in comparison. The fear has faded, the volatility has gone down and upwards momentum is coming in.

4:15pm. I'd go long, but the question remains, go long what exactly? At this point I'd be looking over charts of ETFs and mutual funds, seeking to rotate into the best one. Trading fees aren't too much, so if one is not sure, QQQ would not be too bad to start things off.

4:20pm. Forget that.

Focus on the Ionide source.

4:40pm. I am really surprised that most of the plugin is a Fable project. Had I known this was possible, I would have done Spiral's plugin in Fable as well.

This is really excellent. I could study this project and learn some practical webdev as a result.

5:15pm. I've gone through all the files from top to bottom. The project is rather large. Most of the complexity is in the individual components.

Of course I did not understand much from this skim, certainly not the functionality, but I got a grasp on the overall style.

For some reason, most likely because I do not have Fable installed, the project I've been viewing had syntax highlighting, but not anything else like errors and type inference. I'll have to figure out what to do about that.

5:20pm. Right now, what I need to do is study Fable.

Back in 2020 I studied the webdev languages as a preparatory step for Spiral's own editor plugin. I've gone with Typescript in the end, and somehow ReasonML impressed me more than Fable, but 3 years later things might be different. Ionide actually worked when I tried it. And Fable might be better too. I do not remember what beef I had with Fable back in April 2020. I see that the directories inside the `e:\Webdev\Fable` folder are from that time.

Holy shit, just how many of those node packages are in the Typescript folder? I am trying to move them to the `old` folder and it is taking forever.

...120k files.

5:25pm. Anyway, while that is going on why don't I play around?

I didn't think it would be like this, but why don't I take Fable seriously?

6:05pm. Had to leave for lunch.

My god, the Typescript folder is 269k files and takes up 5gb on my hard drive. I am going to wipe that.

Now, as I was saying. I should play with Fable. I also have no idea how to start F# projects with Ionide, so that is something I need to find out as well.

https://fable.io/docs/2-steps/your-first-fable-project.html

Ah, you start a project using the dotnet tool. Let me give it a try.

6:20pm. > Any modification you do to the F# code will be reflected in the web page after saving.

Oh so it has hot reloading? Interesting.

6:40pm. Figured out how to get the Ionide to type its own project. For some reason it can miss the packages the first time around. I realized this on the template project. In that case, just closing the editor and starting it again is enough to get it to work. Great. Now I have the files completely typed.

I wish I had that the first time around. It would have made the skim more effective.

6:45pm. I wonder where webpack is putting `bundle.js`? I think it is supposed to go into `public` folder, and the html file there can't possibly work without it, but that file is not there. Does it run the html and then erase it right away? I have no idea. Maybe it moves them first to some temporary folder before running them.

6:55pm.

```js
// Note this only includes basic configuration for development mode.
// For a more comprehensive configuration check:
// https://github.com/fable-compiler/webpack-config-template
```

I should look at this tomorrow.

In fact, I should start things off by going through the basics. That means the Fable docs, the above and so on. I should definitely figure out how to debug web programs. After that I'll be ready to look into the iodine project for real. The best way to get familiar with is to just trace through.

Remember my experience with Pharo. Yeah, that swell, having the entire system at your fingertips. You can learn a lot just by stepping through the code and looking at it.

.NET has a lot opaque libraries which is a pity.

7pm. I guess I'll be going in this direction for a while. Branimir gave me a push in this direction and I've yielded.

The project he showed me was also a web project involving Blazor. Most likely I will be learning databases before too logn.

But that HN made it clear to me. Imagine I tried getting a job as a C++ programmer: low pay, abuse, complexity. They make web development sound like some kind of utopia.

7:05pm. Tomorrow should be peaceful, but on weekdays I might have interviews. Sigh, I'll try not to think about that. Just considering that is making my stress level rise. Like I have on Youtubing, I'll focus getting a grip on Fable and studying the Ionide plugin. It will take me quite a bit of studying on order to get a grip on a project of this complexity, but after that I should be able to contribute. A lot of time will no doubt be taken up getting up to speed with Fable's ecosystem.

7:10pm. I've been doing good not stressing myself out today. All this is good. Suppose I do not get an offer in the next 3 weeks. That will be a good opportunity to get up to speed with web development.

7:15pm. This kind of experience is the number one thing I can do to improve my earnings potential. I need to just make it a bit motivated.

Let me close here. I am 3 chapters behind on Satanophany raws so let me get to them. From here on out, my job will be to have fun and relax. The interview with Branimir went well. As long as I let go of my obsession, I should not have too much trouble passing them. The initial interviews aren't really what I should be worrying about to this degree. Most people usually worry about the coding parts."

External Organ Rework: new bodypart_overlay system (#72734)

Bodypart overlays are now drawn by the new /datum/bodypart_overlay
datum.

External organs no longer draw anything and instead add a special
/datum/bodypart_overlay/mutant to the bodypart, which draws everything

Makes it way easier to add custom overlays to limbs, since the whole
system is now modularized and external organs are just one
implementation of it

I haven't moved anything but external organs to this new system, I'll
move eyes, bodymarkings, hair, lipstick etc to this later

New pipeline is as follows:
- External organ added to limb
- External organ adds /datum/bodypart_overlay/mutant to limb to
bodypart_overlays
- Limb updates its icon, looks for all /datum/bodypart_overlay in
bodypart_overlays
- Very cool new overlay on your limb!

closes #71820

:cl:
refactor: External organs have been near-completely refactored. 
admin: Admin-spawned external organs will load with a random icon and
color
fix: fixes angel wings not working for non-humans (it was so fucking
broken)
fix: fixes external organs being invisible if they werent initialized
with a human
/:cl:

### Why this is good for the game
External organs are cool but are pretty limited in some ways. Making
stuff like synthetic organs is kinda fucked. I tried and it was dogshit.
Now you can just give an icon state and icon and you're good (using
/datum/bodypart_accessory/simple)

Stuff like eyes, cat ears and hair seem like good choices for extorgans,
but don't quite work for it because their icons work a lot differently.
This solves for it completely since any organ (or object or whatever)
can add it's own icon to a bodypart.

Want to add an iron plate to someones head? Go ahead. Want a heart to
stick out of someones chest? No problem.

post I'm helping organize the Global Mormon Studies 2023 online conference, so I've been trying to figure out what (if anything) I would submit for myself. I've been wanting to do something about the online (and, thereby, intentionally international) Toronto Community of Christ congregation, but I've had trouble figuring out what exactly that would be. Today, an idea clicked. I was going through their YouTube and Facebook videos for some early data collection when I realized just how different the two platform experiences are. So, I figure I'll do something on "physical and digital geographies": How broadcasting church allows Beyond the Walls to transcend physical borders but creates new digital ones.

Admins can now choose where fish go (#73109)

## About The Pull Request

I've pigeonholed myself as the fish guy now. It seems like someone made
events easier to add admin controls for so I thought I'd add some to the
event I most recently touched.

Instead of letting the RNG choose admins can now direct a circle of carp
to converge upon a specific location, or even a trail of specific
locations if they want the carp to just sort of swim in a circle around
the space station (although the ones on the far side of the station from
the starting point will travel all the way through it to get there).
This also works with magicarp.
They don't really move fast enough for you to use this to punish a
specific person but you can use it to annoy a specific location full of
people.

Plausibly there's no reason the code _wouldn't_ work for a specified
atom instead of a turf (as long as it sticks to one z level) but I
couldn't think of an elegant way of selecting that whereas "use my
current ghost location" is very intuitive, so I didn't add one.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Plausibly this permits admins do more fun things.

## Changelog

:cl:
admin: Admins can direct where carp (or magicarp) are interested in
going when manually triggering the event

feat: simulate images

feat: upload PictureCreation folder and rename

defined a bunch of variables and made the script for circles

target generator is done

I pulled an all-nighter for this... just to make fucking pictures

leftover

fixed a couple of things

new master images* (the files are too big)

the thing is that we are dealing with a 1GB photo and most likely will take a while to generate all the background images using flip image augmentation

Im going insane

for some reason whenever I try to use opencv's bounding box it always throws this error: cv2.error: OpenCV(4.6.0) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\convhull.cpp:143: error: (-215:Assertion failed) total >= 0 && (depth == CV_32F || depth == CV_32S) in function 'cv::convexHull'

IDK what this means and its 2 am and I just want this to work

final a some what working script

whats left: figure out how to get a more accurate bounding box, how to crop a rotated rectangle

updated ignores

finally creates the images with all features

but the image of the picture is bad quality due to all the rotating so im going to rewrite it. Also, the coordinates for the bounding box is not right for some reason.

alright the valid camera image generation

basically fixed the transformations

end of me testing stuff

All I have done testenv has like what the script really should be.

changed some coords

ayo no rotation it works so far

It works. It accurately represents the runway

finally finished ( to use import pain and run fnl_valid_gen)

cleaning the branch up and switched to jpgs bc smaller

added a test

initial exploration and math

i am god

check if target in snapshot

data saving done

change imports and use of var

curse you advik the platypus!!!!!!!!!

I rewrote the whole thing again

fix some file logic

ran some tests and entered stats

word and decimal points

remove notebook

VASTLY enhances the Black Market. Black market items are obtainable by

Various valuable, rare, or otherwise interesting items now have a 'black
market value' that allows them to be sent down the ASRS elevator in
exchange for black market points to order various things with. Anything
that's 'rare' is probably worth something. Added a scanner to the black
market to let them detect said points.

Added DIALOGUE to the black market.

FIxed some construction wirecutter steps needing a screwdriver for some
reason.

Changed up Req's mapping to add a hidden storage room.

slightly changed human remains' description

Added the maintenance jack, can be found in the black market for now.

# Explain why it's good for the game

> VASTLY enhances the Black Market. Black market items are obtainable by
deconstructing a supply computer and pulsing the circuit board. If
you're knowledgeable in engineering enough.

Black Market is comically underused, by comically enhancing it like this
it will freshen shipside roleplay and create new and interesting
scenarios for MPs, req, and bystanders to interact with.

> Added a whole new category for black market items and thoroughly
enhanced the possible contraband items to order. Guns, drugs, and worse
are plentiful in stock...

The contraband needs to be actually meaningful to the players for it to
have any impact. The list of loot has been curated so that players will
be intrigued, but will not be able to abuse it for
too-stronger-than-usual gear without blatant drawbacks.

> Various valuable, rare, or otherwise interesting items now have a
'black market value' that allows them to be sent down the ASRS elevator
in exchange for black market points to order various things with. Added
a scanner to the black market to let them detect said points.

This means CTs could go on scavenger hunts through the ship, evading
curious MPs to sift through maintenance and various hidey holes scanning
everything.

> Added DIALOGUE to the black market.

Finally, we have dialogue in CM! The very first human NPC. We're
ignoring WO because nobody likes WO.

> FIxed some construction wirecutter steps needing a screwdriver for
some reason.

Necessary in this PR to avoid stupid confusion when deconstructing the
computers.

> Changed up Req's mapping to add a hidden storage room.

To let CTs hide their goodies so they won't be in open sight. NOT DONE
YET!

does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. Please note that
maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags should they
deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system all you want,
but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off the bat. -->

:cl:
add: VASTLY enhances the Black Market. Black market items are obtainable
by deconstructing a supply computer and pulsing the circuit board. If
you're knowledgeable in engineering enough.
add: Added a whole new category for black market items and thoroughly
enhanced the possible contraband items to order. Guns, drugs, and worse
are plentiful in stock...
add: Various valuable, rare, or otherwise interesting items now have a
'black market value' that allows them to be sent down the ASRS elevator
in exchange for black market points to order various things with.
Anything that's 'rare' is probably worth something. Added a scanner to
the black market to let them detect said points.
add: Added DIALOGUE to the black market.
fix: FIxed some construction wirecutter steps needing a screwdriver for
some reason.
spellcheck: slightly changed human remains' description
add: Added the maintenance jack, can be found in the black market for
now.
code: Improved supply shuttle code somewhat.

(1/391 fail) deleted some shit and shit still works so, yay?

I thought that little doodad did something important. But when I take it
out, my typechecking works and none of my many tests fail.

OK, I should stop being an frazzle dazzled asshat and explain myself.

I removed the cut step from the front and back end bidirectional
typechecking algorithms. They ought to remove unneeded arguments from
context after leaving a lambda. But I was being a tad too aggressive in
cutting. I trimmed and streamlined the lamba code, then for debugging
sake, I removed the cut step so that I could exactly what it was doing.
And, well, everything still worked. The reason the typechecker doesn't
blow sky high is because I generate globally unique names across the
program. So the realy problem in the typechecker is still lurking in my
algorithm ... but hey, green tests are good, right?

So the final test now passes the typechecker (with correct inferrence).
But it hits one my embarrasingly common undefined sections in the
generator. It seems the lamba survies. It should not have survived. Damn
lambdas. Worst letter in the alphabet.
