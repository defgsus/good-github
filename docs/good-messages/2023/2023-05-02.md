[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Mimes can no longer write without breaking their vow. (#5562)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/74674
-----
## About The Pull Request

I feel this is gonna be unpopular with the lazy mime players.

Also, this is an idea I had in my backlog for a while now

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53777086/231355622-2c5d5d5a-813d-420c-ae42-c1bdc657f3ba.png)

This removes the Mime's ability to write on paper while they're on their
vow of silence.
This can be compared to hand language, which doesn't let you speak
despite not being considered "talking", and PDA messaging, which does
the same.

Mimes can still write with their pen, which is a nice invisible white
color. I thought I would keep it in as I find that interaction funny to
have a Mime give someone just a blank paper, unknowing that there's text
on it.
Spraycans/Telekinesis/Circuits are also left unaffected because they
require actual effort to obtain (doing genetics, doing circuits, or
printing spraycans which take a lot of inventory space and is limited),
compared to paper which you can carry hundreds of papers around and is
bountiful across the station.

I thought this was attempted at least once, but I can't find any PR that
mentions it, so I'm shooting my shot to see if this is something we'd
want.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Mimes using paper is a lazy way to bypass their one job gimmick: Emoting
over talking.

If they get a job change, they can simply break their vow to access
paper writing abilities, so this doesn't affect that really. It more-so
hits the Mimes who uses the job for the free spells/healing
abilities/etc, and bypasses the downsides (im aware its harder to get
people to read paper than it is to talk to them, but you can literally
get the mute quirk and itll have the same effect without being the whole
job).

The point is, you don't get invisible walls for free; it comes at a cost
of not being able to talk to people. If you want to talk, then break
your vow, lose access to your Mime abilities, and remake it later when
the cooldown is over. You're not meant to do both.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Mimes can no longer write on paper without breaking their vow.

Refactors and optimizes breath code (Saves 12% of carbon/Life()) (#74230)

## About The Pull Request

### How things work

As things currently stand, when a mob breaths several things happen
(simplified to focus on the stupid)

We assert the existance of all possible breathable gases, and pull
partial pressures for them
Then we walk through all possible interactions lungs could have with
these gases, one by one, and see if they're happening or not
As we go we are forced to cleanup potential alerts caused by the
previous breath, even if those effects never actually happen
At the end we clear out all the unused gas ids, and handle the
temperature of the breath.

### What sucks

There's I'd say 3 different types of gas reactions.

- You can "need" a gas to survive. o2, n2 and plasma all fall into this
category
- A gas can do something to you while it's in your system. This applies
to most gas types
- Variation on the previous, some gases do cleanup when they're not in
your system, or when there isn't much of them in the first place

The main headache here is that second one, constantly cleaning up
potential side effects sucks, and fixing it would require a lot of dummy
variables

There's other suckage too.

Needing to constantly check for a gas type even if it isn't there is
stupid, and leads to wasted time It's also really annoying to do
subtypes in this system.
There is what amounts to a hook proc you can override, but you can't
override the reaction to a gas type.
It also just like, sucks to add new gases. one mega proc smells real
stupid.

### Improvements

In the interest of speed:

- I'd like to build a system that doesn't require manually checking for
gas
- Reacting to gas "disappearing" should be promoted by the system,
instead of being hacky.
- I would like to avoid needing to assert the existence of all possible
gases, as this is slow on both the assert and the garbage collect.

In the interest of dev ergonomics:

- It should be easy to define a new gas reaction 
- It should be easy for subtypes to implement their own gas reactions.
The current method of vars on the lung is all tangled up and not really
undoable as of now, but I'd like to not require it
- It should be possible to fully override how a gas is handled

### What I've Done

Lungs have 3 lists of proc paths stored on them

Each list handles a different way the lung might want to interact with a
gas.
There's a list for always processing on a gas (we use this for stuff
that's breathed), a list for handling a gas in our breath, and a list
for reacting to a gas previously being in our breath, but not any more.

Lungs fill out these lists using a helper proc during Initialize()
Then, when it comes time to breath, we loop over the gas in the breath
and react to it.
We also keep track of the previous list of partial pressures, which we
calculate for free here, and use that to figure out when to call the
loss reactions.

This proc pattern allows for overrides, easy reactions to removals,
lower indentation code and early returns, and better organization of
signal handlers

It's also significantly faster. Ballpark 4x faster

### Misc

Removes support for breathing co2, and dying from n2 poisoning. 
They were both unused, and I think it's cringe to clutter these procs
even further

Added "do we even have oxyloss" checks to most cases of passive
breathing.
This is a significant save, since redundant adjustoxy's are decently
expensive at the volume of calls we have here.

Fixes a bug with breathing out if no gas is passed in, assigning a var
to another var doesn't perform a copy

Rewrote breathe_gas_volume() slightly to insert gas into an immutable
mix stored on the lung, rather then one passed in
This avoids passing of a gas_mixture around just to fill a hole. 

I may change my mind on this, since it would be nice to have support for
temperature changing from a hot/cold breath.
Not gonna be done off bodytemp tho lord no.

Uses merge() instead of a hard coded version to move the gas ids over. 
This is slightly slower with lower gas counts but supports more things
in future and is also just easier to read.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Faster, easier to work with and read (imo)

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Gunpoints now take half a second to activate, make gasp sounds, and briefly immobilize the shooter and target, other small balance changes (#5591)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/74036
-----
## About The Pull Request
This PR messes around with gunpoints a bit, with the purpose of making
them more viable in certain scenarios without making them obnoxious. The
biggest change is that gunpoints now require a 0.5 second do_after()
where neither the shooter nor the target moves, and immobilizes both of
them for 0.75 seconds if point blank, or half that if you're 2 tiles
away. Originally you were supposed to only be able to initiate a
gunpoint from point-blank, but #56601 seems to have removed that
requirement, so we'll run with it and just leave it as advantageous to
gunpoint closer up. The do_after() reinforces that it should be used as
an ambush tactic, and so you can't use it on someone who's actively
fleeing or fighting you.

Getting held up will now make you emit a shocked gasp sound, a la Metal
Gear Solid, which combined with the short immobilize will hopefully make
it more noticeable that someone's pointing a gun at you.

Holdups will now immediately give a 25% bonus to damage and wounds,
instead of having to wait 2.5 seconds to hit the double damage stage.

Finally, right clicking someone that you're holding up will no longer
shoot them. That just feels like good consistency.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Hopefully makes gunpoints a little more viable for when you want to
stick someone who's not expecting it up without them immediately jetting
off. In the future I'd like to ape Baycode and let the gunman have an
action that toggles whether the victim is allowed to move, so you can
order them to move to a second location without instantly shooting them,
but that'll come later.
## Changelog
:cl: Ryll/Shaps
balance: Holding someone at gunpoint now requires both the shooter and
the victim to hold still for half a second before activating, so you
can't hold-up people fleeing or fighting you. After that, it will
briefly immobilize the both of you, 0.75 seconds if adjacent, or half
that if you're two tiles away. Nuke ops are immune to the
immobilization, since they're ready to die anyways.
balance: Holding someone up will immediately apply a 1.25x damage and
wound multiplier, rather than waiting 2.5 seconds to hit 2x.
soundadd: Being held up will now make the victim play a sharp gasp
sound, a la Metal Gear Solid.
qol: Trying to hold someone up that you're already holding up will no
longer shoot them.

[MIRROR] Tcomms Soundloop Comes From One Source And Is Less Awful [MDB IGNORE] (#20713)

* Tcomms Soundloop Comes From One Source And Is Less Awful (#74908)

## About The Pull Request

The ``soundloop/server`` now only comes from the server hub, so it
doesn't have stacking audio sources. The sound has been made more
uniform when up close, but is overall quieter. Additionally, all the
files have been run through a low pass filter to remove the highest of
it's pitches.
## Why It's Good For The Game

I'm sick of not wanting to be around telecomms because of how bad every
single machine sounds. Now, things are significantly easier on the ear,
quieter, more uniform, and better for everyone's sanity. I asked the
maintainers in the coding channel if I could just remove it and they
said no.

I can't get a video recording, I've tried with win+G, OBS, and sharex
and it's just fucked.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: telecomms is quieter and less ear-damaging.
sound: modified tcomms sound to remove high-tones.
fix: the telecomms sound only comes from the server hub machine.

[MIRROR] Turns Deer into Basic Mob - They Freeze At The Sight of Vehicles [MDB IGNORE] (#20711)

* Turns Deer into Basic Mob - They Freeze At The Sight of Vehicles (#74784)

## About The Pull Request

deers only show up in the BEPIS but i decided that they would be easy
enough to turn into a basic mob (they were). it was so easy in fact that
i decided to dip my toes into coding AI behavior, and made them freeze
up whenever they see a vehicle. this required a lot of code in a bunch
of places that i was quite unfamiliar with before starting this project,
so do let me know if i glonked up anywhere and i can work on smoothing
it out.
## Why It's Good For The Game

one less simple animal on the list. deers staring at headlights is
pretty cool i think, neato interaction for when you do get them beyond
the joke the bepis makes

i'm also amenable to dropping the whole "deer in headlights" code if you
don't like that for w/e reason- just wanted to make them basic at the
very least
## Changelog
:cl:
add: If you ever happen upon a wild deer, try not to ride your fancy
vehicles too close to it as it'll freeze up like a... you know where I'm
going with this.

EMPs on robotic limbs will now disable them for 4-8 seconds rather than causing a 10-20 second full stun (#74570)

## About The Pull Request

EMPs on robotic limbs will now disable them for 10-20 seconds rather
than causing a 10-20 second full stun on the user. Additionally, they
will damage the limb for a little brute and some burn.

Arm EMPs don't do anything special as the limb being disabled already
drops items.

Leg EMPs cause a 10-20 second knockdown, only really applicable if
there's only one robotic leg as two disabled legs KD you anyways.

Chest EMPs cause a 3-6 second standing-up paralyze, visible to the
player by a quite noticeable shaking of their body.

Head EMPs break the optical transponder circuits for 7.5-15 seconds,
effectively giving the user nightmare goggles vision with green instead
of red as the only remaining color.

Tacit approval for the PR at least existing.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Robotic limbs are not so strong that a glancing EMP that may not even
have been directed at you should stun you for ten, TEN seconds, or
worse, twenty. This is basically legacy stunning from the days of
super-stuns on soap, stunbatons, etc. The code for it was last touched
six years ago.

**_The stats as shown above are not even close to final. I really don't
know or care what the right stats should be in the end. and I'm fine
with making them a 10-20 second timer again. I just put some
reasonable-seeming numbers in as a placeholder. EMPs could also still
cause a short stun if that is deemed necessary. Hell, that could be the
chest effect!_**
## Changelog

balance: EMPs on robotic limbs will now disable them for 10-20 seconds

Project Structures

Realized a nice way that I liked, to structure the project module-wise.

I'm thinking about if `@thing/thing` paths could be nice for a project like this :)

Going to bring some of these other nice things over to NBTify, I got them working in jsmediatags today :D

Man, Marco Minnemann's solo work gets better every time I listen. Listening through from HWD&2K: Part I, and now I'm listening to Mouth of God. Music days are the best, listened to a bunch of Mike Keneally this morning too. Gonna try 'You Must Be This Tall' again, after this.

Oh yeah! Just discovered 'Thank You Scientist' the other day, WOW. They are super cool too. Going to buy their latest release, at the same time as when Marco releases his new solo album this Friday. Bandcamp Friday for both :)

http: support CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR

The CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS (and matching CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS) flag was
deprecated in curl 7.85.0, and using it generate compiler warnings as of
curl 7.87.0. The path forward is to use CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR, but we
can't just do so unilaterally, as it was only introduced less than a
year ago in 7.85.0.

Until that version becomes ubiquitous, we have to either disable the
deprecation warning or conditionally use the "STR" variant on newer
versions of libcurl. This patch switches to the new variant, which is
nice for two reasons:

  - we don't have to worry that silencing curl's deprecation warnings
    might cause us to miss other more useful ones

  - we'd eventually want to move to the new variant anyway, so this gets
    us set up (albeit with some extra ugly boilerplate for the
    conditional)

There are a lot of ways to split up the two cases. One way would be to
abstract the storage type (strbuf versus a long), how to append
(strbuf_addstr vs bitwise OR), how to initialize, which CURLOPT to use,
and so on. But the resulting code looks pretty magical:

  GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE allowed = GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE_INIT;
  if (...http is allowed...)
	GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_APPEND(&allowed, "http", CURLOPT_HTTP);

and you end up with more "#define GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE" macros than
actual code.

On the other end of the spectrum, we could just implement two separate
functions, one that handles a string list and one that handles bits. But
then we end up repeating our list of protocols (http, https, ftp, ftp).

This patch takes the middle ground. The run-time code is always there to
handle both types, and we just choose which one to feed to curl.

[sled-agent] Refactor service management out of `StorageManager` (#2946)

## History

The Sled Agent has historically had two different "managers" responsible
for Zones:

1. `ServiceManager`, which resided over zones that do not operate on
Datasets
2. `StorageManager`, which manages disks, but also manages zones which
operate on those disks

This separation is even reflected in the sled agent API exposed to Nexus
- the Sled Agent exposes:

- `PUT /services`
- `PUT /filesystem`

For "add a service (within a zone) to this sled" vs "add a dataset (and
corresponding zone) to this sled within a particular zpool".

This has been kinda handy for Nexus, since "provision CRDB on this
dataset" and "start the CRDB service on that dataset" don't need to be
separate operations. Within the Sled Agent, however, it has been a
pain-in-the-butt from a perspective of diverging implementations. The
`StorageManager` and `ServiceManager` have evolved their own mechanisms
for storing configs, identifying filesystems on which to place zpools,
etc, even though their responsibilities (managing running zones) overlap
quite a lot.

## This PR

This PR migrates the responsibility for "service management" entirely
into the `ServiceManager`, leaving the `StorageManager` responsible for
monitoring disks.

In detail, this means:

- The responsibility for launching Clickhouse, CRDB, and Crucible zones
has moved from `storage_manager.rs` into `services.rs`
- Unfortunately, this also means we're taking a somewhat hacky approach
to formatting CRDB. This is fixed in
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/pull/2954.
- The `StorageManager` no longer requires an Etherstub device during
construction
- The `ServiceZoneRequest` can operate on an optional `dataset` argument
- The "config management" for datastore-based zones is now much more
aligned with non-dataset zones. Each sled stores
`/var/oxide/services.toml` and `/var/oxide/storage-services.toml` for
each group.
- These still need to be fixed with
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/issues/2888 , but it should be
simpler now.
- `filesystem_ensure` - which previously asked the `StorageManager` to
format a dataset and also launch a zone - now asks the `StorageManager`
to format a dataset, and separately asks the `ServiceManager` to launch
a zone.
- In the future, this may become vectorized ("ensure the sled has *all*
the datasets we want...") to have parity with the service management,
but this would require a more invasive change in Nexus.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Add snap-layouts support to the Terminal (#11680)

Adds snap layout support to the Terminal's maximize button. This PR is
full of BODGY, so brace yourselves.

Big thanks to Chris Swan in #11134 for building the prototype.
I don't believe this solves #8795, because XAML islands can't get
nchittest messages

- The window procedure for the drag bar forwards clicks on its client
  area to its parent as non-client clicks.
- BODGY: It also _manually_ handles the caption buttons. They exist in
  the titlebar, and work reasonably well with just XAML, if the drag bar
  isn't covering them.
- However, to get snap layout support, we need to actually return
  `HTMAXBUTTON` where the maximize button is. If the drag bar doesn't
  cover the caption buttons, then the core input site (which takes up
  the entirety of the XAML island) will steal the `WM_NCHITTEST` before
  we get a chance to handle it.
- So, the drag bar covers the caption buttons, and manually handles
  hovering and pressing them when needed. This gives the impression that
  they're getting input as they normally would, even if they're not
  _really_ getting input via XAML.
- We also need to manually display the button tooltips now, because XAML
  doesn't know when they've been hovered for long enough. Hence, the
  `_displayToolTip` `ThrottledFuncTrailing`

## Validation
Minimized, maximized, restored down, hovered the buttons slowly, moved
the mouse over them quickly, they feel the same as before. But now with
snap layouts appearing.

## TODO!
* [x] I'm working on getting the ToolTips on the caption buttons back. Alas, I needed a demo of this _today_, so I'll fix that tomorrow morning.
* [x] mild concern: I should probably test Win 10 to make sure there wasn't weird changes to the message loop in win11 that means this is broken on win10.
* [x] I think I used the wrong issue number for tons of my comments throughout this PR. Double check that. Should be #9443, not #9447. 

Closes #9443
I thought this took care of #8587 ~as a bonus, because I was here, and the fix is _now_ trivial~, but looking at the latest commit that regressed.

Fixes the wapproj fast-up-to-date check (#11806)

I'm working on making the FastUpToDate check in Vs work for the Terminal project. This is one of a few PRs in this area.

FastUpToDate lets vs check quickly determine that it doesn't need to do anything for a given project. 

However, a few of our projects don't produce all the right artifacts, or check too many things, and this eventually causes the `wapproj` to rebuild, EVERY TIME YOU F5 in VS. 

This third PR deals with the Actual fast up to date check for the CascadiaPackage.wapproj. When #11804, #11805 and this PR are all merged, you should be able to just F5 the Terminal in VS, and then change NOTHING, and F5 it again, without doing a build at all. 




The wapproj `GetResolvedWinMD` target tries to get a winmd from every cppwinrt
executable we put in the package. But we DON'T produce a winmd. This makes the
FastUpToDate check fail every time, and leads to the whole wapproj build
running even if you're just f5'ing the package. EVEN AFTER A SUCCESSFUL BUILD.

Setting GenerateWindowsMetadata=false is enough to tell the build system that
we don't produce one, and get it off our backs.

### teams chat where we figured this out

[3:38 PM] Dustin Howett
however, that's not the only thing that "GetTargetPath" checks.

[3:38 PM] Dustin Howett
oh yeah more info: wapproj calls GetTargetPath on all projects it references

when it calls GTP on WindowsTerminal.vcxproj it is getting back a winmd (!)

feat: persistent bind-mounts

This is an important change, where we get remove the previous `--mount`
option, and instead opt for persistent bind-mounts.

Persistent bind mounts have several advantages:
- They make it easier to remember which folders need to be bind-mounted.
- Code is *much* less clunky, as we no longer need to generate temporary
  docker-compose files.
- They allow us to bind-mount host directories *at build time* using the
  buildx `--build-context` option.
- The transition from development to production becomes much easier, as
  images will automatically be built using the host repo.

The only drawback is that persistent bind-mounts are slightly less
portable: when a config.yml file is moved to a different folder, many
things will break if the repo is not checked out in the same path.

For instance, this is how to start working on a local fork of
edx-platform:

    tutor config save --append MOUNTS=/path/to/edx-platform

And that's all there is to it. No, this fork will be used whenever we
run:

    tutor images build openedx
    tutor local start
    tutor dev start

This change is made possible by huge improvements in the build time
performance. These improvements make it convenient to re-build Docker
images often.

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */

Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

Severity Prediction of Knee Osteoarthritis

Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition that affects the joints, including the knee joint, due to the significant weight-bearing of the body. The disease results in degeneration and rupture of the cartilage elements in the knee joint, which causes severe pain. Unfortunately, the prevalence of OA has been increasing globally, with a 113.25% increase in cases from 1990 to 2019. Currently, more than 350 million people globally suffer from arthritis, and it is estimated that by 2040, about 78 million US adults will have the condition. The diagnosis of OA is primarily carried out by evaluating symptoms and comparing plain radiographs, which can be subjective. However, deep learning techniques, such as Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), have emerged as a promising solution to medical problems in recent years. Therefore, the goal of this study is to develop and implement a classification system that can aid doctors in reducing their workload and assist radiologists in assessing the severity of the pain accurately. Furthermore, this will enable them to make the  best diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment. One of the methods used in detecting knee OA is transfer learning with fine-tuning, which leverages deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and classification. By using this method, doctors and radiologists can make informed decisions on the severity of the condition, which can lead to better treatment outcomes for patients.

The following are the goals of the study:
1. The primary objective of this research is to analyze the degree of severity of knee x-ray images.
2. To assist Rheumatologists, in identifying the severity of the disease after the medication, thus reducing the time taken and lengthy treatments.
3. For monitoring and implementing early treatments to sustain good health in patients who pose a concern.
4. To check how accurately, the degree of severity of knee x-ray photographs is estimated by the deep learning algorithm.

The following are the social causes of the study:
1. To assist Rheumatologists, in identifying the severity of the disease after the medication, thus reducing the time taken and lengthy treatments.
2. To reduce the medical and travelling expenses.
3. To overcome the manual mistakes made by the doctor sometimes.
4.  If any person got medication before , so he can check his disease in our webpage rather than consulting any doctor.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

gpg-interface: set trust level of missing key to "undefined"

In check_signature(), we initialize the trust_level field to "-1", with
the idea that if gpg does not return a trust level at all (if there is
no signature, or if the signature is made by an unknown key), we'll
use that value. But this has two problems:

  1. Since the field is an enum, it's up to the compiler to decide what
     underlying storage to use, and it only has to fit the values we've
     declared. So we may not be able to store "-1" at all. And indeed,
     on my system (linux with gcc), the resulting enum is an unsigned
     32-bit value, and -1 becomes 4294967295.

     The difference may seem academic (and you even get "-1" if you pass
     it to printf("%d")), but it means that code like this:

       status |= sigc->trust_level < configured_min_trust_level;

     does not necessarily behave as expected. This turns out not to be a
     bug in practice, though, because we keep the "-1" only when gpg did
     not report a signature from a known key, in which case the line
     above:

       status |= sigc->result != 'G';

     would always set status to non-zero anyway. So only a 'G' signature
     with no parsed trust level would cause a problem, which doesn't
     seem likely to trigger (outside of unexpected gpg behavior).

  2. When using the "%GT" format placeholder, we pass the value to
     gpg_trust_level_to_str(), which complains that the value is out of
     range with a BUG(). This behavior was introduced by 803978da49
     (gpg-interface: add function for converting trust level to string,
     2022-07-11). Before that, we just did a switch() on the enum, and
     anything that wasn't matched would end up as the empty string.

     Curiously, solving this by naively doing:

       if (level < 0)
               return "";

     in that function isn't sufficient. Because of (1) above, the
     compiler can (and does in my case) actually remove that conditional
     as dead code!

We can solve both by representing this state as an enum value. We could
do this by adding a new "unknown" value. But this really seems to match
the existing "undefined" level well. GPG describes this as "Not enough
information for calculation".

We have tests in t7510 that trigger this case (verifying a signature
from a key that we don't have, and then checking various %G
placeholders), but they didn't notice the BUG() because we didn't look
at %GT for that case! Let's make sure we check all %G placeholders for
each case in the formatting tests.

The interesting ones here are "show unknown signature with custom
format" and "show lack of signature with custom format", both of which
would BUG() before, and now turn %GT into "undefined". Prior to
803978da49 they would have turned it into the empty string, but I think
saying "undefined" consistently is a reasonable outcome, and probably
makes life easier for anyone parsing the output (and any such parser had
to be ready to see "undefined" already).

The other modified tests produce the same output before and after this
patch, but now we're consistently checking both %G? and %GT in all of
them.

Oh rip it out
Ah
If you think we live too much then
You can sacrifice diagnostics
Don't mix your garbage
Into my syntax
So many weird hacks keep diagnostics alive
Yet I don't even step outside
So many bad diagnostics keep tyasc alive
Yet tyasc doesn't even bother to survive!

[ADD] website_cf_turnstile: add cloudflare turnstile support

This module allows to add secret key to add the turnstile captcha on
each snippet website_form.

Cloudflare Turnstile

A friendly, free CAPTCHA replacement

add alpaca gpt4 dataset (#2610)

The inputs can be quite a lot of different versions of `no input`,
therefore don't use the `input` column for that.
In some cases the text in `input` is already in the instruction, in
these cases, we also don't use the `input` column.

I am not quite sure how to concatenate the `instruction` and the `input`
column. In most cases it seems fine to just replace last appearance of
`.`, `!` or `?` with a colon, e.g.:
Instruction: `Identify the odd one out.`
Input: `Twitter, Instagram, Telegram`
or 
Instruction: `How dense is a given material?`
Input: `Steel`

But we also have some questions like:
Instruction: `Given the following synopsis, what is the moral lesson of
this story?`
Input: `Once upon a time, there was a poor young boy who wanted some
candy. He begged his father for money to buy it, but his father said no
and ordered him to go to bed. As he was going to bed, the boy saw a
five-dollar bill on the counter, which he took and bought the candy.`

Where this might not be the best case. Either way, I think the this one
token will not make significant difference the model and therefore I
just concatenate instruction and input with a space.

Update README.md

I just published a book about using data science in your personal day-to-day life. I think this group might appreciate it. There are fun pictures, code, math, and jokes. I hope self promotion is ok, this seemed really relevant to the community.

Add toolchain tasks for things that we depend on to train language models.

Most of these are straight forward download and compiles, but there's a few callouts:
- The CLI tools (marian, fast-align, etc.) already have build scripts used by the existing pipeline. For the most part, I'm just replacing them with my own version because they're just unpack/make/cmake. The exception is Marian, which has a little bit more going on with cmake definitions. Maybe I should just copy those in here though?
- Some Python modules that don't have binary wheels available, which we ought to build to avoid needing to compile them at the start of training tasks.
- CUDA (a NVIDIA Toolkit) is a huge pain. They don't have any real advertised way to just dump the files you want into a directory (they want you to run an installer). I _think_ I managed to get this work, but it's possible this will need a tweak in the future if a future task has trouble with the current toolchain.

This also necessitated switching Docker images to Ubuntu, because some tools were not reasonably possible to make work on Alpine.

Further Archive (LCE)

Trying to see how I can possibly discern the different world archive types from each other. Then the tool can just figure out whichever format it should use ahead of time :)

```
Zip Archive | "PK.." | 0x50 0x4B 0x03 0x04
```

https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/web-application-penetration-testing/magic-bytes-identifying-common-file-formats-at-a-glance/

Didn't get to it tonight, I do want to try next though, to use my SNBT implementation to be able to generate TypeScript types from existing NBT archives! That's a super awesome workaround to automating things. It will simply extract the type of the NBT tag themselves, and use that for the output instead of their own values. With a little tweaking to the SNBT handling, it could instead output something JSON-esque, but I could instead format to use as a good'ol TS interface declaration, for that same NBT structure. Then I don't have to make the types for anything fully by hand, I will only have to open the file to generate the types for it.

Once the demo is working, I think it'll probably be fully capable for me to make a complete type declaration for the NBT, with formatting and all. It might take a little extra to get the string manipulation working to get there, but having SNBT made that much closer to being able to do. WOW that is a neat idea. I think that realization was partly what helped me start working on this project again, because I kind of started to see how I could hook everything all together.

Speaking of that, while I remember it, I thought of how I could do the versioning for the NBT structures, too. It will be using interfaces instead of classes, and I think I want to make use of interface merging in order to get the type checking working. Each version of a specific platform will have a definite set of type definitions, and they will always be available. It's not like only the new types will be there. I will need to maintain the interfaces for each version alongside each other, and this will help find the differences between each version's format much sooner. You will simply get type checking errors for any differing properties that don't line up with the other version. This will be probably simple for the pre-Flattening versions, and the jump to Flattening will likely have the most to manually map between. I think the older versions will only have incremental additions and removals of any given features, so it will mostly just have to handle those cases where some things may not have equivalent counterparts in those versions.

Thought of this setup again while on a night walkies :)

I was early in thinking it through a while ago, I wasn't sure about how to merge type files or interfaces back then though, and now I have more stronger of feelings that it could be doable! Essentially the type files will work like how the merging does for the different ES versions, and TypeScript's definitions for them. There will probably be a base types file (say, likely an older version), and subsequent versions will only include the changes that they actually made there. Breaking changes between version formats (aka, Flattening) will have to be adjusted somehow in regards to types and merging, as I probably won't want to allow the pre-Flattening types to collide or mingle with the Flattening ones.

Alright! Time for bed now. This morning..

Reagent containers that splash their contents on people also splash the
floor - the amount that gets splashed on the floor is the amount that
missed the target.

Ckey to receive rewards: N/A (it's not a mapping PR)

## Why It's Good For The Game
Splashing people with a molotov filled with Random Shit now also
splashes that Random Shit all around, making them slightly more spicy to
play around with. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to make fuel
puddles ignite off of lit objects resting on top of them (there's no
item-level proc for hotspot exposure or something). If anyone wants to
advise me on how to make that happen, that'd be cool.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Reagent containers that splash on people when thrown (e.g.
molotovs) now spill their contents on both target and turf. (This means
that throwing molotovs with enough fuel spills fuel puddles, throwing
beakers with acid spills acid on the floor, etc. etc.) Unfortunately,
molotovs still lack the ability to ignite their own spilled fuel, but
we'll get there one day.

Allows Export of your Preferences JSON File (#75014)

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

This was spoken about in #70492 (specifically
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/70492#issuecomment-1278069607),
and I have been waiting for this to be implemented for some time. It
never got implemented, so I decided to code it myself.

Basically, **if the server host doesn't disable it**, you are free to
export your JSONs as a player, right from the stat-panel. It's a pretty
JSON on 515 versions, too!

It's right here:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235251447-1c977718-51fd-4025-8d89-c60bffc379ec.png)

Here's what the prettified JSON looks like on 515.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235321061-4a217e26-c082-4bba-b54a-2c780defda0a.png)

There's a cooldown (default to 10 seconds) between exporting your
preferences.

#### Why is this config?

It's because in the past, a server host could always just file-share the
.sav or .json or whatever to the player, but they would have to do the
explicit option of actually bothering to make the files accessible to
the player. In that same line of logic, the server operator will have to
explicitly make the files accessible. This is mostly because I'm not
sure how good `ftp()` is at being a player function and wanted to have
some sort of cap/control somehow in case an exploit vector is detected
or it's just plain spammed by bots, so we'll just leave it up to the
direct providers of this data to elect if they wish to provide the data
or not.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Players don't have to log into Server A to remember what hairstyle they
loved using when they want to swap to Server B! That's amazing actually.
I always forget what ponytail my character has, and it'll be nice to
have the hairstyle in a readily accessible place (after I prettify the
JSON for myself).

It's also more convenient for server hosts to make player data like this
accessible if they really want to, too.

If we ever add an _import_ feature in the future (which would have to be
done with a LOT of care), this will also be useful. I wouldn't advise it
though having taken a precursory look at how much goes into it while
trying to ascertain the scope of this PR.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: The game now supports export of your preferences into a JSON file!
The verb (export-preferences) should now be available in the OOC tab of
your stat-panel if enabled by server operators.
server: Exporting player preferences is controlled by a configuration
option, 'FORBID_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'. If you do not wish to let clients
access the ftp() function to their own preferences file (probably for
bandwidth reasons?) you should uncomment this or add it to your config
somehow.
config: Server operators are also able to set the cooldown between
requests to download the JSON Preferences file via the
'SECONDS_COOLDOWN_FOR_PREFERENCES_EXPORT' config option.

The SQL Murder Mystery Game by Knight Lab

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

Changed deployers to persist data in one spot.

Recall that deployers often have to persist various data to the file
system. The "weaver multi" deployer, for example, persists logs,
registrations, and traces to files.

Before this PR, deployers would store logs in /tmp and everything else
in ~/.local/share/serviceweaver. Different deployers would sometimes
store their data in the same directory. A "multi_perfetto.db" file would
be right next to a "single_perfetto.db" file, for example.

This made purging data files annoying. It was like a scavenger hunt
trying to track down the various places that data was stored. This PR
changes deployers to store all their data in a single directly. For
example, the "weaver multi" deployer now stores everything inside
"~/.local/share/serviceweaver/multi". The single process deployer stores
everything inside "~/.local/share/serviceweaver/single".

This makes purging much simpler. It also makes it clearer which files
are being used by which deployers.

Note that this PR moves logs out of /tmp, which persists them longer.
This means that logs won't be garbage collected automatically, but I
think that's actually a good thing. We should implement a principled way
of garbage collecting logs, rather than leaving it up to /tmp. I think
it would be surprising and frustrating if an important log file was
spuriously deleted by the OS.

Records (#1148)

Add record types to the language: record values are written like `[x = 3, y = "hi"]` and have types like `[x : int, y : text]`.  Empty and singleton records are allowed.  You can project a field out of a record using standard dot notation, like `r.x`.  If things named e.g. `x` and `y` are in scope, you can also write e.g. `[x, y]` as a shorthand for `[x=x, y=y]`.

Closes #1093 .

#153 would make this even nicer to use.

One reason this is significant is that record projection is our first language construct whose type cannot be inferred, because if we see something like `r.x` all we know about the type of `r` is that it is a record type with at least one field `x`, but we don't know how many other fields it might have.  Without some complex stuff like row polymorphism we can't deal with that, so we just punt and throw an error saying that we can't infer the type of a projection.  To make this usable we have to do a better job checking types, a la #99 . For example `def f : [x:int] -> int = \r. r.x end` would not have type checked before, since when checking the lambda we immediately switched into inference mode, and then encountered the record projection and threw up our hands.  Now we work harder to push the given function type down into the lambda so that we are still in checking mode when we get to `r.x` which makes it work.  But it is probably easy to write examples of other things where this doesn't work.  Eventually we will want to fully implement #99 ; in the meantime one can always add a type annotation (#1164) on the record to get around this problem.

Note, I was planning to add a `open e1 in e2` syntax, which would take a record expression `e1` and "open" it locally in `e2`, so all the fields would be in scope within `e2`.  For example, if we had  `r = [x = 3, y = 7]` then instead of writing `r.x + r.y` you could write `open r in x + y`.  This would be especially useful for imports, as in `open import foo.sw in ...`.  However, it turns out to be problematic: the only way to figure out the free variables in `open e1 in e2` is if you know the *type* of `e1`, so you know which names it binds in `e2`.  (In all other cases, bound names can be determined statically from the *syntax*.)  However, in our current codebase there is one place where we get the free variables of an untyped term: we decide at parse time whether definitions are recursive (and fill in a boolean to that effect) by checking whether the name of the thing being defined occurs free in its body.  One idea might be to either fill in this boolean later, after typechecking, or simply compute it on the fly when it is needed; currently this is slightly problematic because we need the info about whether a definition is recursive when doing capability checking, which is currently independent of typechecking.

I was also planning to add `export` keyword which creates a record with all names currently in scope --- this could be useful for creating modules.  However, I realized that very often you don't really want *all* in-scope names, so it's not that useful to have `export`.  Instead I added record punning so if you have several variables `x`, `y`, `z` in scope that you want to package into a record, you can just write `[x, y, z]` instead of `[x=x, y=y, z=z]`.  Though it could still be rather annoying if you wanted to make a module with tons of useful functions and had to list them all in a record at the end...

Originally I started adding records because I thought it would be a helpful way to organize modules and imports.  However, that would require having records that contain fields with polymorphic types.  I am not yet sure how that would play out.  It would essentially allow encoding arbitrary higher-rank types, so it sounds kind of scary.  In any case, I'm still glad I implemented records and I learned a lot, even if they can't be used for my original motivation.

I can't think of a way to make a scenario that requires the use of records.  Eventually once we have proper #94 we could make a scenario where you have to communicate with another robot and send it a value of some required type.  That would be a cool way to test the use of other language features like lambdas, too.

Agriculture ('Technoculture') Farming: Fertilizer Edition :) (#2278)

* Does Stuff

Beginnings of agriculture code, stripped down TG botany a bunch, got rid of scar botany whilst replacing most of it. Also some map edits to change the paths on stuff and add a few spades for farming.

* Some NPK system framework

Removing more TG botany stuff and getting some framework down for NPK. Adds a "nutrient_type" variable to seeds and gives N, P or K as the type to every seed.

* Removes Stuff, More NPK Framework

Still WIP on NPK stuff, removes more basic bitch TG botany stuff, needs a lot more content but in an almost-working state

* Nutrient drain

Nutrients actually get drained properly now. Crop plots output their level of N, P and K when examined. Still need to make something to handle restoring nutrients and figure out a nutrient economy for plant consumption.

* Mostly working, one major bug

This is mostly working now. The NPK now drains according to the seed planted, it replenishes over time, you can now get water from water tiles and the soil will properly adjust the waterlevel variable with the new water types.

HOWEVER, big bug. The way TG handled watering crops is ass. Doesn't delete, stays in the reagent_container of the soil, normally checks for if a reagent_container has water to bypass how full the soil's container is, bad system that sucks. Needs fixing.

* oops

oopsie!!! fucked something!!! forgot to undo a change I made to the code, it's just there to remind me it's not working correctly

* Last minute fixes/bandaids

I HATE TG BOTANY I HATE TG BOTANY I'M LOSING IT

* Fertilizer groundwork

Some stuff for fertilizer, need to add the attackby but cutting out a bunch of code to clean things up. Need to see if it breaks stuff.

* Fertilizer attackby changes

Adds code to the attackby for farm plots that checks if you're attacking it with fertilizer, doesn't work for some reason I can't tell. Also removes some vestigial TG botany stuff.

* fixt

fixes fertilizer, I forgot to specify something in a var, works now!!! YAY!!!

Goliath-Infused Tendril Hammer uses an internal cooldown for the its special attack instead of a universal click cooldown (#74159)

## About The Pull Request

Rather than using a click cooldown, the tendril hammer instead can make
its special heavy attack every 2 seconds.

## Why It's Good For The Game

In my newfound quest to try and eliminate universal click cooldowns or
weird non-interactivity timers as balancing factors, this definitely is
one of the biggest standout offenders. Lemme make an argument for
universal click cooldowns increases being an ineffective limitation.

I'll use the problems presented by the tendril hammer to highlight some
of those problems, as well as unique problems to the tendril hammer
itself.

<details>
  <summary>da big discussion</summary>

A) The functionality of the hammer actively inhibits all in-game handuse
interaction for several seconds, without explaining this to a player. As
a player, you won't know why this is happening, as universal click
cooldown is not present as a UI element.

B) Since universal click cooldowns are not visible to players, it might
feel more like the game is malfunctioning rather than being a deliberate
mechanic. Even if click cooldowns were visible, players probably would
think that the cooldown applies to the hammer, and not handuse
interactivity with the game world as a whole for several seconds.

C) The functionality of the hammer could work fine as an internal
cooldown on the hammer, only relevant to the hammer. This ensures that
its special effects are exclusive, without the need to interrupt player
interaction as a whole.

D) Since we're talking about miners. If someone is concerned about the
hammer being used on the station against carbon players; you need
someone to help mutate you into goliath mutant, which cannot be bypassed
whatsoever. An excellent example of something similar is the chainsaw
arm, created right next door to genetics in robotics, which does even
more force than the arm and is sharp. With the limitations that exist, I
think it probably discourages most powergaming, if that was even a
realistic concern (it really isn't).

E) You lose both a hand AND your gloves slot when you get the hammer. No
modsuits, no glove equipment, no two-handed equipment, and you now have
to juggle everything with one hand assuming you're not on your, once
again, universal click cooldown for several precious seconds. Miners
live or die in their rapid response to problems. This is also the total
sum of what you lose as a miner. That's a steep cost and it just doesn't
justify its own value compared to what you lose.

</details>

TL;DR - There is no offset to the cost of this weapon, it is strictly a
detriment because of poorly conceived implementation.

This is maybe one of the coolest ideas conceptually for the infusions so
far, heavily hampered by what seems to be an intense fear of the
mutation being _too useful_. So it was made _borderline masochistic to
willingly seek out and use_.

I want to see this actually be useful. I can't see this with the
restrictions it has. Hopefully this is enough to make it worthwhile
getting.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Changes the universal click cooldown of the tendril hammer from
the goliath infusion into an internal cooldown just for the special
heavy attack.

Dogs will no longer harrass if they are buckled to a bed (comfy edition) (#74224)

## About The Pull Request

Before, dogs were somehow magically able to drag their bed to you while
barking at/chasing you. that's silly, let's fix it by checking if you're
buckled, and then aborting course if we're comfy on our little bed
## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes #74082

the dog is BUCKLED. it can't move. probably a better fix to this somehow
on a very deep AI level but that wouldn't allow us to have such a
soulful message (as well as potentially rule out a myriad of edge
cases), so i'm proposing this one.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: If you buckle a dog to a bed, it will no longer drag its bed as it
goes to bark at the mailman. It will instead be comfy and chilling, as
expected.

Sniper laser was tame.

## About The Pull Request

This is bullshit. Splurting out 180 damage with high AP with no delay is
not okay. Its as bullshit as most FCU we had. Mainly removed scatter on
high powered lasers and bloody stuns so the scatter lense may stay for
the mining tool (as there is no way to increase firerate on a
projectile.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Ever got hit at close range by the particle defender on main? Yeah that
is not fun.

## About The Pull Request

Buffs Excav laser module. Inconsisten with the one hit of rocks.
Hopefully this ammends it specially since scatterlenses are getting
removed (although nobody used them in combat yet.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Scatter lense gone, legitimate mining tool needs a buff. The other
options (Phoron Bore) are a sick joke with how slow clunky they are to
use.

Add Utilities.slide/3

Because the implementation for `slide/3` in the Enum module behaves the
way it does, we should just let it. In fact, I'm considering if I
shouldn't just use it as a basis for creating an internal module?

That is, I'm not going to re-implement the Enum module and Enumerable
protocol. Instead, I would just have `Bio.Enum` and expose all the same
functions but with the explicit guarantee that they preserve the struct
type that you're using.

This would alleviate any irritation from the perspective of the behavior
of e.g. `Enum.map` returning a struct instead of a list. You would have
to explicitly opt in to one behavior or the other...

Yeah, I kinda really like that.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Nanotrasen Budget Programme - Mothball Edition [BIRDSHOT STATION] (#5555)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/73502
-----
## About The Pull Request
--- 

The Space Tram is currently spaced. This is a known issue with not the
map, but Trams in general. The Space Tram is a Space Tram to encourage a
fix. Until then, the Space Tram is a maint tram that's an actual hazard
but cannot directly kill anyone, including lizards. Enjoy the commodity
as you zip from secmaint to medmaint.
-------------------------------------------------------

I... really don't know if I should be proud of myself here. This whole
process has been akin to a fever dream and it has only been little over
a month since I first created the .dmm for this. What started as a
simple yet humble reimagining of Birdboat has turned into an entirely
new station, and blown past Metastation sized proportions. This has been
my most expansive project yet, and somehow it's also been my quickest.
So without further ado, I unveil Birdshot - Successor to Birdoat.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Due to recent cost expenditures on Icemoon projects, and a growing
need for orbital research stations, Nanotrasen has decided to pull
Birdboat Station out of mothball after nearly 5 years of abandonment.**

Since then, the station has seen a variety of changes at the hands of
the various vagabond lawless scum and villains that have decided to make
the abandoned station their home. Do not fret though, a Nanotrasen
Operation has secured the companies rightful property for corporate use
once again, though you'll need to be the stewards of the remaining
cleanup operation.

------------------------------------------------------

Now, as you might have guessed by now, Birdshot is heavily based on
Birdboat station. Many of the decisions here follow the original layout,
and what had to be modified or moved still tries its best to replicate
and imitate what bird being said. At least, that was the idea initially.
This has very much grown into its own beast and as such, while the main
inspiration has been Birdboat, there are a lot of new ideas thrown into
the mix that really give this station its own unique and deserving
identity. Maybe it's not perfect, but I've been inspired by MMMiracles
own performance with Tramstation to keep working on Birdshot and
updating it with better and improved faculties. For now, though the
station is in a playable state, and that means I'm making a PR. If I had

## Why It's Good For The Game

We've been with the same 5 maps for a while now. san7890 jokingly said
that I could sacrifice Metastation back in November if I remade Birdboat
but modern. Obviously that wasn't going to happen, yet I was spurred on
by the idea. When I began this in earnest early this January, EOBGames
said that a Birdboat sized map would replace Kilostation in the
rotation. Interestingly we're not a small map anymore so I honestly have
no clue where this goes. Maybe that ephemeral 6th map slot that's been
rumored.

What I can say, is that Birdshot is wholly unlike anything else that is
currently in rotation. It's got an engineering section that feels way
too small for a station of that size, almost evocative of Cere. Cargo is
blessed with a Boutique that makes use of Fikou's new mannequin dolls.
Command is outfitted with a Corporate Guest Suite, and Officials sent
from Nanotrasen can embark from their ferry into the safety of their own
Corporate Dock. Elements of Cerestation are present, yet not in a way
that makes traversal annoying. Furthermore we have **2 Trams** (that I
have yet to get functional but we'll get there) on Birdshot, that's
right 2. One Security Prison Tram, and then other, a Space Tram. Both
Novel in their own ways. Departments on Birdshot twist and turn, and
there's an abundance of Maintenance Tunnels to cut through everything,
for the brave and the bold that is. And there's plenty left to discover,
but I'd rather let Birdshot speak for itself. I'm proud of this one.

If you want something new, this is something that is almost the complete
opposite of Chilled Station - Explicitly Designed to send you back to
the metal death trap that is: **Space Station 13.**


## Changelog
:cl:
add: Birdshot station has been pulled out of Mothball.
add: New station areas and places to visit. A Mix of Kilo and Delta
maints with winding shortcutting paths.
add: A host of new shuttles to support this bold endeavor to reclaim
something that really shouldn't be reclaimed.
add: Two Trams, Two Trams.
add: For the last time Bob, the gaping hole is a **feature.** Use the
breach shutters or have the virologist make starlight.
add: A smiling salute to stations past...
add: Secrets.

Nukes size respriting in favor of "Funny Humans", or making your legs offensively long (#5053)

I'm currently working on migrating prefs, so I'll whip up an image
later.
I mean, I could do it without needing to migrate prefs, but I don't want
to keep the old goofy ass sprite scaling, because its offensive, noisy
and annoying.

I prefer humans with offensively long noodle legs anyhow.

Also thanks to Mothblocks for helping me get started.

## Changelog

:cl: Jolly, Melbert
add: Pref heights now make your legs taller or shorter, so, height is
actually tangible.
del: However, the OLD way of "heights", which were sprite scaling, has
been removed.

add analytics events for filters (#752)

This PR adds a collection of analytics events - some are already in wow but needed to be added back after the table was completely rewritten for filters, and others are brand new to cover the filters interactions. All of the events have parity between Google and Amplitude, including the custom properties we send along with each (eg. portfolioSize, portfolioColumn, etc.). [sc-10784]

The way I'm actually logging the events in kind of awkward, because we have some common extra properties to send with them all, I tried to make them not too clunky when actually doing the logging, and we also have some frustrating inconsistencies between amplitude and google. Once we have everything up for filters, and can spend a bit of time getting settled into the new Google ecosystem of analytics tools, we'll have a better idea of what to change (eg. maybe we can drop amplitude all together?). These things should be addressed in a update of all the analytics event setup for WOW - I've started adding some thoughts on that in shortcut [sc-12296]

There is also a small bug that I noticed while testing - when there are 0 records for the table (from filtering) it showed up as 0.

The Ultimate Way of Browsing Channels

The script works extremely fast except the first time to update the whole data. It takes about 2 minutes to update the whole database with 80 different channels. You can set a cronjob for this. It's not a heavy work for the PC. It justs fetch the text data with yt-dlp. Video example below:

This script is a sophisticated and ingenious tool designed to streamline your YouTube experience by organizing and managing your favorite YouTube channels, allowing you to browse and watch videos directly within the script without ever visiting its website. You can assign the channels inside various categories such as "Tech", "Science", "Sports", etc. The videos can be played using the 'mpv' media player. Moreover, the script allows you to sort videos based on view count or duration; download videos; and even maintain a "Watch Later" list. If you combine this script with "SponsorBlock" lua script created for "mpv", then you will have the ultimate experience. SponsorBlock removes all sponsored segments in a video including intros, outros or similar unnecessary parts. It's normally a browser extension but is also available for "mpv".

No browsers, accounts, distractions, crappy algorithm and recommendations, advertisements, sponsors, intros, outros, fillers or empty spaces. We eliminate them all.

Required Programs: dmenu | mpv | jq | yt-dlp

FEATURES
1. Browse all videos from all channels you set at the same time. You can filter titles through dmenu.
2. Browse a channel's videos.
3. Select a channel either from the main menu or inside a Category.
4. Watch, Download or Put videos in a "Watch Later List".
5. Sort videos by view or duration. The default sort is upload date. The only problem is, we can't have the exact upload date, so we can't apply much more advanced filtering. It can be done but it makes fetching the data for the first time too slow.
6. The menus have a complex loop system. It always continues where you left off. The script doesn't close itself when you make a selection. So you don't have to run the script over and over again and get to where you left off. You can also press Escape to return to a prior menu.
7. You won't see the URLs or any unnecessary things inside dmenu. Just the titles.



JUSTIFICATION
This script is incredibly beneficial for those who seek a minimalist and focused approach to consuming content on YouTube. By providing a CLI-based interface (dmenu), the script reduces distractions and clutter that are commonly encountered on the Youtube website. It allows users to personalize their content consumption and manage channels more effectively. The script is also remarkably efficient and easy to navigate, providing a user-friendly experience that saves time and promotes productivity.

The script is organized into functions that each perform a specific task, such as updating channel data, retrieving video titles, playing videos, downloading videos, adding videos to the watch later list, and browsing all channels. These functions are called by the main script to provide the user with various options for navigating and interacting with the videos.

The script makes use of various Bash features such as associative arrays, shell redirection and piping, to simplify and streamline the code. It also uses conditionals and loops to handle different user input and error cases. Overall, this script is a powerful and flexible tool for browsing, watching, organizing YouTube channels, and it provides a great example of Bash usage to automate and streamline complex tasks.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
- The script begins by defining two associative arrays, CHANNELS and CATEGORIES, which store the YouTube channel names along with their respective URLs and categories. It then sets the directories for storing data and videos, and creates them if they do not already exist.
- The 'update_data' function updates the metadata for a given channel, while the 'update_all_channels' function updates metadata for all channels. The metadata includes the video title, URL, view count, and duration, which are extracted using 'yt-dlp' and 'jq' utilities.
- The 'get_videos' function retrieves the video titles from the metadata of a given channel, sorted by the specified criteria (if any). The 'video_url' function returns the URL of a video based on its title and channel name. The 'play_video' and 'download_video' functions use 'mpv' and 'yt-dlp', respectively, to play or download a video given its title and channel name.
- The 'add_to_watch_later' function appends the video title and channel name to a watch later list, while the 'play_watch_later' and 'delete_from_watch_later' functions play a video from the list or remove it, respectively.
- The 'get_all_videos' function retrieves all video titles from the metadata of all channels, sorted by the specified criteria. The 'browse_all_channels' function lets you browse through all channels and select a video to watch, download, or add to the watch later list.
- The main part of the script first prompts the user to update the database of channels. If the user chooses to do so, the 'update_all_channels' function is called. The script then presents the user with options to browse all channels, browse channels by category, or browse the watch later list. The script loops through these options until the user decides to exit.

Nanotrasen Budget Programme - Mothball Edition [BIRDSHOT STATION] (#73502)

## About The Pull Request
--- 

The Space Tram is currently spaced. This is a known issue with not the
map, but Trams in general. The Space Tram is a Space Tram to encourage a
fix. Until then, the Space Tram is a maint tram that's an actual hazard
but cannot directly kill anyone, including lizards. Enjoy the commodity
as you zip from secmaint to medmaint.
-------------------------------------------------------

I... really don't know if I should be proud of myself here. This whole
process has been akin to a fever dream and it has only been little over
a month since I first created the .dmm for this. What started as a
simple yet humble reimagining of Birdboat has turned into an entirely
new station, and blown past Metastation sized proportions. This has been
my most expansive project yet, and somehow it's also been my quickest.
So without further ado, I unveil Birdshot - Successor to Birdoat.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Due to recent cost expenditures on Icemoon projects, and a growing
need for orbital research stations, Nanotrasen has decided to pull
Birdboat Station out of mothball after nearly 5 years of abandonment.**

Since then, the station has seen a variety of changes at the hands of
the various vagabond lawless scum and villains that have decided to make
the abandoned station their home. Do not fret though, a Nanotrasen
Operation has secured the companies rightful property for corporate use
once again, though you'll need to be the stewards of the remaining
cleanup operation.

------------------------------------------------------

Now, as you might have guessed by now, Birdshot is heavily based on
Birdboat station. Many of the decisions here follow the original layout,
and what had to be modified or moved still tries its best to replicate
and imitate what bird being said. At least, that was the idea initially.
This has very much grown into its own beast and as such, while the main
inspiration has been Birdboat, there are a lot of new ideas thrown into
the mix that really give this station its own unique and deserving
identity. Maybe it's not perfect, but I've been inspired by @MMMiracles
own performance with Tramstation to keep working on Birdshot and
updating it with better and improved faculties. For now, though the
station is in a playable state, and that means I'm making a PR. If I had
to borrow the words of the good MMM, I would call this **Birdshot:
Season 0**

[MIRROR] Chasm Hell On Icebox - 300 Active Turfs on Prod Moment [MDB IGNORE] (#20260)

* Chasm Hell On Icebox - 300 Active Turfs on Prod Moment (#74410)

## About The Pull Request

Spontaneous regressions introduced by #74359
(1e58c1875d9e2f48a306fe31a0626dbbb1990ff9).
```txt
 - Z-Level 2 has 150 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level 3 has 150 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level trait Ice Ruins Underground has 300 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level trait Mining has 300 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level trait Station has 300 active turf(s).
 - End of active turf list.
 ```

Basically the lavaland ruin sucks dogshit and I had to do a lot of stuff to account for everything failing. There was even a moment where we were adding something to `flags_1` instead of `turf_flags` and that was also really bad to figure out.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/229213428-63bb1f6e-6f88-4604-a3c6-e08e20cbfa7a.png)

i also had to add orange genturfs because it was really getting bad with all of the assertions we had to keep making, especially since stuff like this could also show up:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/229213562-4a145453-5f90-4d05-b8cc-5c1beec2b0dd.png)

That's the prison in the red box, those are active turfs because a chasm scraped it away.

Sorry if this is hard to follow but I promise you everything in this is essential. I wish we didn't have to rely on turf flags as much as we do but this is a fix PR, not a refactor.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Even one active turf on IceBox ate up _three_ seconds of SSair's initialization every single time it was really fucking bad.

We haven't had to deal with chasms for about two years so there's a lot of mapping assertions we made since they just weren't a thing, but now they're back so lets do it properly.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: The prison on IceBox should no longer leak air as often.
/:cl:

I have compiled this map about 30 times until active turfs stopped fucking happening and now I am content. This likely doesn't fix _everything_ because some stuff can still be hidden to me, and we still have PRs that need to be merged to reduce the amount of noise we're getting on prod.

The following description is provided to 10 participants.
We can approximately define three types of feminism: (1) difference-denying, (2) difference-removing, (3) difference-honoring. Other approximate categorizations are possible. For the purposes of this project, we use this approximate categorization:

 

(1) Difference-denying feminism: In this approach, any difference between men and women is denied, and is said to be purely due to cultural impositions. There is no biological (called "essential") difference (no "on average" difference when doing group-wise comparison) between men and women. Every difference is socially constructed.

 

(2) Difference-removing feminism: There are biological difference between men and women, but these differences are burdens to women, like a curse of nature, and women must rely on technology to completely remove any biological difference between men and women to be "liberated" (for example only if we remove our wombs we can). Removing the difference is the only way of liberation. This type of feminism relies heavily on technology (especially biological technologies) for "liberation".

 

(3) Difference-honoring feminism: This approach does accept that there exist differences that are purely culturally-imposed and not "essential", but holds that in addition to those, there exist genuine essential differences, and denying or removing them harms women. Denying or harming differences harms everybody, not just women. Men and women have differences and they're both ok. What must change is the culture that values only masculine traits, and views feminine traits as unimportant and without value.

 

 

Find 10 respondents and ask them to read the above description (or read it to them yourself, whichever they choose), and then ask them these questions:

1) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 1 (difference-denying feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

2) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 2 (difference-removing feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

3) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 3 (difference-honoring feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree") what number would you pick?

4) Which of these three approaches do you think has had the most cultural and political impact in the past few decades ("most" in terms of magnitude, not quality, that is, we don't mean "best", just magnitude)?

 5) Are you or have been a mother?
And recorded the response in a csv file attached.
