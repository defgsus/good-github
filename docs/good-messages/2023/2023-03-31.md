Botany Balance Pass (#1783)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
First came the content, now comes the hammer.

- Nukes Megaseed servitors from orbit. 
- Plants now age much, much slower and produce half as quickly.
Ruins that had them now have a ruined seed vendor that can be salvaged
for random seeds(and danger).
Ships that had one now have a crate with some thematic starting seeds,
and a Strange Seed.
Ghostrole Ruins that relied on having all seeds locally now have a
special biogenerator variant that can print a random seed for biomass.

- Adds Genesis Serum. This can be splashed on a tile to make natural
grass and some flora. Green your ship!
Genesis Serum was made a while ago, on request for a way to add natural
grass and flora to your ship. Since I had it lying around fully coded, I
thought I might as well pr it with botany changes.

- Gatfruit found in the seed vault have been replaced with Strange
Seeds.

- The chance to get Gatfruit from a demonic portal(plant variety) has
dropped from 15% to 5%.

- Corpse flowers now have liquid gibs and formaldehyde again. 

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Okay, hear me out

With this and Gardens, botany ships go from a "sit in your vessel for 2
hours" experience to an "explore and forage" one that better fits our
feature arc. It goes without saying that this **shouldn't be merged till
Overmap 4.2 is**, since it facilitates getting seeds from planets as
part of exploration.

Gatfruit are funny, but it takes exactly one seed getting into the hands
of a ship with a dna manipulator and the weapon balance is eradicated
from the game completely(for the round, at least.)
This is more problematic here then it was on TG, since our rounds tend
to be 5 hours long rather then 1.
This has been long coming. I'll reverse this if we ever get that
Plantlock variant we wanted a while ago.

Corpse flowers even have formaldehyde and gibs on tg, not sure what
happened there.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl: 
add: Ruined megaseed servitors can now be found on the frontier,
carrying a bounty of seeds for intrepid adventurers.
balance: the time it takes for plants to reach a lethal age has been
increased massively.
balance: Plant production time increased a bit to compensate.
balance: megaseed servitors have been removed from ships and ruins.
Ships that carried one now have a crate with some starting seeds.
balance: removes gatfruit from the seed vault pool.
balance: reduces the chance of getting gatfruit from a plant-themed
demonic portal significantly.
balance: corpse flowers once again have formaldehyde and liquid gibs.
add: Adds Genesis Serum, a reagent that transforms tiles into natural
grass on splash, then causes some natural flora objects to grow. Turn
your ship green!

Adds preference for "Tagger" paint color. (#74281)

## About The Pull Request

Per the title, this PR allows you to pick your starting paint color from
the "Tagger" quirk on the character preferences menu.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105025397/227810007-4706c743-31c2-47d8-80ac-e11687d36c00.png)

This replaces the starting color being random; it does not prevent you
from changing the color later as normal.
## Why It's Good For The Game

It's a minor quality of life change. This will mostly be helpful to
players who have some "signature" color they like to use, to prevent
having to manually select it (and possibly input a color code) every
round. It will be of less relevance to those who tend to select new
colors every round anyway.

Possible downsides are mainly adding another pref to the menu, although
this shouldn't be too much of an annoyance since it only appears if you
already have the relevant quirk. It does also remove the _ability_ to
have a randomly-chosen paint color, though I'm not sure if that matters.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: you can choose your default paint color for the "Tagger" quirk from
prefs.

Sol is now a Subsystem, Coffins lock themselves, Bloodsuckers don't constantly die, probably (#862)

* Turns Sol into a Subsystem & Many more

Turns Sol into a subsystem and hooks Bloodsuckers onto it via signals instead of doing a ton of for() loops anywhere. This made Sol incredibly fucking fast, so I halved the speed so it only ticks every 2 seconds.

I also improved the sunlight hud to update with regular bloodsucker updates to avoid some useless proc overhead and fixed Coffins not locking by themselves.

* Torpor now ends, moves exiting torpor to its proper place

* round it

* fix comment

* fix CI

The Lizardening Part One (And Friends) (#1845)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
This PR changes a lot of sprites. It's honestly too much. Namely:

- Explorer Equipment + Prototype
- Syndicate clothing
- Digitigrade lizard legs
- A new tail from Halcyon.
- Magboots from Zeta. Originally PR'd to tgstation.
- Colored (not greyscale! Ha Ha!) jumpsuits from Imaginos.

Heavy inspiration from the work of Imaginos, Halcyon, Mqiib, and
2cents#8442 for the original leg-work. (Haha, get it?)
The new digitigrade sprites started as a twinkle in the eye of Mqiib,
for yogstation(?) After myself and Halcyon saw those, an epihpany
struck. Perspective makes things cool and digitigrade perspective was
BAD.

I'll include a collage image of the new sprites if it's needed later.
Preview below:

3/3 client consumers streaming errors

Summary:
This diff makes it so hh_client can consume streaming errors. It's gated under the JK that we're using for standalone IDE. That's because (1) I want streaming-errors to be a carrot that entices more people to test out standalone-ide, (2) the standalone-ide will be written solely to consume streaming errors, so the two go hand in hand, (3) I don't want to even have to test the correctness+behavior of produce_streaming_errors when there are lazy checks.

To opt in, people have to explicitly ask for streaming errors via this flag, every time they do a hh check at the CLI. (it's not pretty, but that's not my goal):
```
hh --config ide_standalone=true
```
Also, this only works if the server had earlier been started to produce streaming errors:
```
hh --config produce_streaming_errors=true
```

My further plan, to reduce the number of codepaths, is that eventually *everything* should use "errors.bin", even `--json`, even if it doesn't display the errors in streaming fashion. My motivation for this is just to reduce the number of different codepaths. I guess that `--json` would read from errors.bin all the way to the end before printing its output, and would internally handle "files have changed" by restarting its read on a new errors.bin. But that will be left for the distant future.

## User-facing design of the feature

1. `hh check --json` will use the existing error mechanism (which waits until it has a complete list of errors that encompasses all disk changes), while all other output formats will by default use streaming errors.
   1. There might have to be some kind of override flag, `hh check --error-streaming false`? But I believe there won't have to be: my research T147955071 indicates that *everyone* who doesn't use `--json` is content with streaming errors. Note that our existing json format isn't friendly to streaming, and most scripts/tools don't use incremental json parsers and hence wouldn't even benefit from them.
2. There are two new exit codes from hh_client that can be produced. This could be a breaking change if any tools did `hh check` and don't know how to deal with (say) files changing under their feet during the typecheck. Previously they would get answers only after the disk had stabilized. Now they will get an error message that they must recover from. My mitigation for this risk, as above, is I think almost all tools use `--json` and hence won't be getting streaming errors. I think only console users will get streaming errors.
   1. `Typecheck_restarted` "Files have changed. Please re-run hh" -- this is for when a typecheck got interrupted by something that caused it to be restarted. This is typical from watchman interrupts.
   2. `Typecheck_abandoned` "Hh_server has terminated. {Killed|Stopped}". This is for when the hh_server daemon gets killed mid-typecheck.
3. It's imperative that when you type "hh" then you get errors that at minimum reflect all disk changes that happened prior to your invocation of "hh" (as to whether they reflect changes which happened since, that's impossible to know).
   1. This was true before (because "hh" causes serverMain to do a synchronous check with watchman before reporting answers; it does the synchronous check in serverNotifier.ml by sending "flush-request" over the subscription and waiting to hear "sync" response).
   2. It's still true now. The watchman sync is now performed in hh_client instead of hh_server, and it displays "hh_server is busy [watchman sync]" while doing it.
3. The errors that get streamed are necessarily unsorted by filename. Ain't nothing we can do about that. (prior to streaming, they were sorted by filename).

## Implementation

```
There is a whole load of ceremony to do with what happens when you want to open errors.bin,
e.g. start the server if necessary, check for version mismatch, report failures to the user.
Concrete examples:
1. There is no server running. "hh check" must start up a server, before it can stream errors from it.
2. There is no server running, but our attempt to start the server failed, either
   synchronously (e.g. we had `--autostart-server false`)
   or asynchronously (e.g. saved-state failed to load).
   "hh check" must detect that no streaming errors are forthcoming.
3. There is a server running, and it has already written errors.bin, but it is the wrong binary version.
   "hh check" must cause it to shut down, and a new server start up, before it can stream errors.
4. There is an errors.bin from an existing server, and its typecheck started 20s ago, but moments
   before "hh check" a file was changed on disk. "hh check" must detect this,
   learn that it cannot use the existing errors.bin, and instead use the new errors.bin that will be forthcoming.

How this function fulfills those cases:
* It of course has to check whether files on disk have changed since this errors.bin was started.
  It does this with a synchronous watchman query,
  and displays "hh_server is busy [watchman sync]".
* If there is a fault like "errors.bin was started too long ago and files have changed
  in the meantime" which can be rectified by waiting and trying again on the assumption
  that a server is running and will pick up the changes, then this will wait and try
  again indefinitely. It will display "hh_server is busy [hh_server sync]".
  The parameter "already_checked_clock" indicates that we have already done a
  (costly) watchman query for this clock, and will not do another watchman query until
  we see a new errors.bin with a new clock.
* If there is a fault like "missing errors.bin" or "binary mismatch" which can
  be rectified by connecting to the monitor+server, this will do so at most once
  with the "connect_then_close" callback parameter, then resume for a suitable errors.bin
  again with "hh_server is busy [hh_server sync]".
  If it already tried once with no effect, then it will raise Exit_status.Exit_with.
```

This isn't my preferred implementation strategy!
1. I don't like how the client will just "wait around indefinitely until a suitable errors.bin appears, on the assumption that hh_server will eventually detect disk changes. I don't like this because, if it never happens, we don't have a crisp callstack or failure event to log.
2. I don't like how the client and server must duplicate the exact same logic for deciding whether file-changes are important. I don't like this because imagine if they disagree, and the client believes a new errors.bin+clock is needed and so waits for one, but the server doesn't believe it's needed.

What I'd like instead if there existed something like "hh sync" over ServerRpc or ClientConnect.connect, with the property that once it returns, then (1) the server guarantees to have started an errors.bin, (2) the server guarantees to have picked up all watchman changes that it deems fit. If we had this then the client would never need to wait indefinitely: if it ever needed to start the server then it'd do this sync and know that errors.bin must necessarily exist when the sync returns; if it ever was in doubt about the age of watchclock then it'd do this sync and know when it returns that the new errors.bin is recent enough.

I found it far too troublesome to implement that kind of "hh sync". This diff uses `connect_then_close`, which calls into ClientConnect.connect, but this has a much weaker guarantee. It only guarantees that the server is running. It doesn't guarantee that an errors.bin has been started, and it doesn't guarantee that the server has synced all changes so far. Why was a stronger sync too troublesome? It's because hh_server's logic for syncing is wrapped up in ServerMain.recheck_until_no_changes_left, and it's not easy to separate the "sync watchman " from the "complete the consequent typecheck".

## Watchman

This diff puts some "watchman since" code in clientCheckStatus.ml. That's clearly not where it truly belongs. The plan in T146551552 is to move us away from subscriptions like there are in watchman.ml, and towards synchronous queries.

I'd quite like to rename watchman.ml -> watchmanSubscription.ml, and create another file watchmanSync.ml which can be used by both server and client. But the code I wrote right now in clientCheckStatus.ml uses Lwt which can't be used in server. Therefore, I'll need to functorize over "promise", like is done in `state_loader_futures.ml` vs `state_loader_lwt.ml`. That will take a bit more work, so I've left it for the future. (ha ha). In the meantime, this diff leaves the code in clientCheckStatus.ml for now.

standard library: bring the tests into the main CI (#8525)

Should close one of the tasks in #8450.

# Description
> **Note**
> in order of appearance in the global diff

- 1b7497c41966306aa3103a95a9b5ef5df7111ee4 adds the `std-tests` job to
the CI which
  1. installs `nushell` in the runner
  2. run the `tests.nu` module
> see `open .github/workflows/ci.yml | get jobs.std-tests | to yaml`

-
[`ec85b6fd`..`9c122115`](ec85b6fd3fc004cd94e3fada5c8e5fe2714fd629..9c12211564ca8ee90ed65ae45776dccb8f8e4ef1)
is where all the magic happens => see below
- :test_tube: 799c7eb7fd5f140289b36b9dbc00329c50e2fbda introduces some
bugs and failing test to see how the CI behaves => see how the [tests
failed](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/actions/runs/4460098237/jobs/7833018256)
as expected :x:
- :test_tube: and c3de1fafb5c5313e30c08c9ca57e09df33b61b74 reverts the
failing tests, i.e. the previous commit, leaving a standard library
whose tests all pass :tada: => see the [tests
passing](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/actions/runs/4460153434/jobs/7833110719?pr=8525#step:5:1)

the issue with the previous runner was the following: the clever trick
of using `nu -c "use ...; test"` did print the errors when occuring but
they did not capture the true "failure", i.e. in all cases the
`$env.LAST_EXIT_CODE` was set to `0`, never stopping the CI when a test
failed :thinking:

i first tried to `try` / `catch` the error in
ec85b6fd3fc004cd94e3fada5c8e5fe2714fd629 which kinda worked but only
throw a single error, the first one

i thought it was not the best and started thinking about a solution to
have a complete report of all failing tests, at once, to avoid running
the CI multiple times!

the easiest solution i found was the one i implemented in
9c12211564ca8ee90ed65ae45776dccb8f8e4ef1
> **Warning**
> this changes the structure of the runner quite a bit, but the `for`
loops where annoying to manipulate structured data and allow the runner
to draw a complete report...

now the runner does the following
- compute the list of all available tests in a table with the `file`,
`module` and `name` columns (first part of the pipe until `flatten` and
`rename`)
- run the tests one by one computing the new `pass` column
  - with a `log info`
- captures the failing ones => puts `true` in `pass` if the test passes,
`false` otherwise
- if at least one test has failed, throw a single error with the list of
failing tests

### hope you'll like it :relieved:

Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia at en.wikipedia.org
Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.
Image: Electrostimulation applied on a penis
Contents: Section 1: In Pornography Section 2: Ball stretcher Section 3: Parachute Section 4: Humbler Section 5: Testicle cuff
Section 1: In pornography
In addition to it’s occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (literally Ball kicking) is a separate genre in Japan. One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles.
Section 2: Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. While leather stretchers are most common, other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches, and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds.
Section 3: Parachute
A Parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. Conical in shape, three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached. Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and squeezing effects on the man’s testicles. Moderate weights of 3-5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage. Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move, when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.
Section 4: Humbler
A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene. The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward, as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.
Section 5: Testicle cuff
A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.
Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being "owned", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of "owning" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.
However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:
Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view. Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being "owned", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes. Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse. Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the "point of no return". It is much harder to reach an orgasm.

Post-Revolutionary Fervor station trait, revolutionary bedsheets, and a megaphone (#73799)

## About The Pull Request

Upon revolution success, the chosen headrev will now also receive a
megaphone, and a "revolutionary bedsheet" repurposed from a stolen CC
bedsheet to commemorate their success. The post-revs confusion and lack
of command/security usually leads to an instantaneous, total breakdown
in cohesion. It's every man for himself -- that's no way to run a
commune! Just because the revolution has succeeded and nobody can see
your big blue "R" anymore doesn't mean you can't be a leader!


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28870487/222981576-e62e457b-1b2d-4756-8c87-7a9093c92c2d.png)

This also adds a new revolution-themed negative station trait --
Post-Revolutionary Fervor. When present, this trait trashes the command
areas at the start of the round. This means cracked windows, broken
consoles, vendors getting knocked over, and the occasional dead
greytider.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28870487/222981095-14ce9336-2320-406e-b0a6-dc91cb8f9479.png)

If you start cleaning at the start of the round, you might finish right
as the next batch of revs decides to crop up.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Giving one of the headrevs a bigger voice and a cool cape (or uncool,
depending on how you view the sprite) means that there's a chance for
them to step up and try to keep the wheels on. Just remember -- Nobody
is obligated to actually listen to this person, it's just a bedsheet.

Adds a neato station trait, which probably counts as command gameplay
content.

## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
add: The headrev who receives the revolutionary banner after a win will
also receive a commemorative bedsheet and megaphone.
add: Post-Revolutionary Fervor station trait. I hope you enjoy fixing
broken computer screens.
spriteadd: A revolutionary bedsheet.

Update to chatgpt.js

# Removed unneeded chunk functions
- I had originally configured this bot to not allow it to exceed the 2000 character limit and attempt to break up the response with a bunch of "chunk" functions. However, I realized this wasn't keeping it from exceeding the amount. Removed all of that

## Added some extra fun. The one complaint my friends gave was that the bot can be quite boring if you try to ask it anything that is viewed as subjective. We're Christian's , and since the bot isn't capable of anything subjective, I decided to add it in myself. Also some Ron Swanson quotes. Really quite simple, I just defined my `const customWords`, set them as an array. I then added the `const randomWord = customWords[Math.floor(Math.random() * customWords.length)];` so that it would pick one of the words at random. Finally, I added it to the `const message =`. I added "Also" as my `const customWord` with a line break before it so it wasn't such an abrupt change, and it made you feel like it was still the AI.

Enjoy!

commit: give a hint when a commit message has been abandoned

If we launch an editor for the user to create a commit
message, they may put significant work into doing so.
Typically we try to check common mistakes that could cause
the commit to fail early, so that we die before the user
goes to the trouble.

We may still experience some errors afterwards, though; in
this case, the user is given no hint that their commit
message has been saved. Let's tell them where it is.

Analysis of Attrition Rate at an XYZ company

Attrition rate is a very useful & essential metric which showcase how many employees are leaving the company over a specific period of time. It's a KPI in HR department to monitor and improve their organisation's workforce planning and overall management. Staffturnover can have a negative impact on your comapny's performance. It also create a negative impression to your clients if the company's attrition rate keeps on increasing so controlling attrition is one of the most important stuff to do.

1. This dataset contains a csv table with 1,470 records which is the total strength of the employees.
2. Each record contains information related to the employee working in XYZ company such as Employee ID, Department, Attrition, Education Field, Salary Slab, Age Group, 
    Years spent at XYZ company and so on.

Key Objective for HR Analytics Dashboard :

* Identifying Key Factors affecting people leaving the company to reduce attrition.


Data Processing :

Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation has been done in order to remove the unwanted data.

1.  Analysed the rows and columns. Removed the Years_with_current_manager was removed since no key insights were found using it.
2.  Duplicated were being removed from all the columns.
3.  Corrected the mispelled word "Travell Rarely" in Business Travel column.
4.  A conditional column has been added to convert Attrition column texts from "Yes" or "No" to values 1 or 0 in order to sum up the column while visualizing.
5.  Detected the Data Type for all the columns in order to correct the Data Type.


Key Insights drawn from HR Analytics Dashboard which leads to Attrition :

1.  Total count of employees in the company is 1470 and it was analysed that 237 people left which has caused 16.1% attrition rate in the company.
2.  Average Age of people leaving XYZ company is 37 years with average salary is Rs 16.5k.
3.  The people with lowest salary slab (upto Rs 5k) as well as with 1 YOE  has the highest rate of attrition.
4.  Laboratory Technician, Research Scientist & Sales Executive are the job roles which is facing highest number people leaving because of the job satisfaction.
5.  Attrition rate in R&D department and people coming from Life Science field is high.
6.  Attrition rate is highest among Male.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Fixes Active Turf Scenario on Tramstation (#5146)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/74354
-----
## About The Pull Request

On the tin. Basically whenever `atmoscilower_2.dmm` would invoked
`atmoscilower_attachment_a_2.dmm`, it would trigger an active turf in
this location since it doesn't have a "ceiling". (as well as there being
an "aired" turf mingling with airless turfs)

This caused the following report:
```txt
 - All that follows is a turf with an active air difference at roundstart. To clear this, make sure that all of the turfs listed below are connected to a turf with the same air contents.
 - In an ideal world, this list should have enough information to help you locate the active turf(s) in question. Unfortunately, this might not be an ideal world.
 - If the round is still ongoing, you can use the "Mapping -> Show roundstart AT list" verb to see exactly what active turfs were detected. Otherwise, good luck.
 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (163,80,2) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Lesser Starboard Maintenance (163,81,2) (/area/station/maintenance/starboard/lesser). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (164,80,2) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.

 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (165,83,3) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/openspace/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Z-Level 2 has 8 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level 3 has 1 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level trait Station has 9 active turf(s).
 - End of active turf list.
```

This is what it looked like when it was reproduced on my machine:

Surprisingly not that hard to debug, albeit tedious. At least I know
that this was the issue with 100% confidence.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Ate up 0.1 seconds of init on my machine. That's silly.

git_connect(): fix corner cases in downgrading v2 to v0

There's code in git_connect() that checks whether we are doing a push
with protocol_v2, and if so, drops us to protocol_v0 (since we know
how to do v2 only for fetches). But it misses some corner cases:

  1. it checks the "prog" variable, which is actually the path to
     receive-pack on the remote side. By default this is just
     "git-receive-pack", but it could be an arbitrary string (like
     "/path/to/git receive-pack", etc). We'd accidentally stay in v2
     mode in this case.

  2. besides "receive-pack" and "upload-pack", there's one other value
     we'd expect: "upload-archive" for handling "git archive --remote".
     Like receive-pack, this doesn't understand v2, and should use the
     v0 protocol.

In practice, neither of these causes bugs in the real world so far. We
do send a "we understand v2" probe to the server, but since no server
implements v2 for anything but upload-pack, it's simply ignored. But
this would eventually become a problem if we do implement v2 for those
endpoints, as older clients would falsely claim to understand it,
leading to a server response they can't parse.

We can fix (1) by passing in both the program path and the "name" of the
operation. I treat the name as a string here, because that's the pattern
set in transport_connect(), which is one of our callers (we were simply
throwing away the "name" value there before).

We can fix (2) by allowing only known-v2 protocols ("upload-pack"),
rather than blocking unknown ones ("receive-pack" and "upload-archive").
That will mean whoever eventually implements v2 push will have to adjust
this list, but that's reasonable. We'll do the safe, conservative thing
(sticking to v0) by default, and anybody working on v2 will quickly
realize this spot needs to be updated.

The new tests cover the receive-pack and upload-archive cases above, and
re-confirm that we allow v2 with an arbitrary "--upload-pack" path (that
already worked before this patch, of course, but it would be an easy
thing to break if we flipped the allow/block logic without also handling
"name" separately).

Here are a few miscellaneous implementation notes, since I had to do a
little head-scratching to understand who calls what:

  - transport_connect() is called only for git-upload-archive. For
    non-http git remotes, that resolves to the virtual connect_git()
    function (which then calls git_connect(); confused yet?). So
    plumbing through "name" in connect_git() covers that.

  - for regular fetches and pushes, callers use higher-level functions
    like transport_fetch_refs(). For non-http git remotes, that means
    calling git_connect() under the hood via connect_setup(). And that
    uses the "for_push" flag to decide which name to use.

  - likewise, plumbing like fetch-pack and send-pack may call
    git_connect() directly; they each know which name to use.

  - for remote helpers (including http), we already have separate
    parameters for "name" and "exec" (another name for "prog"). In
    process_connect_service(), we feed the "name" to the helper via
    "connect" or "stateless-connect" directives.

    There's also a "servpath" option, which can be used to tell the
    helper about the "exec" path. But no helpers we implement support
    it! For http it would be useless anyway (no reasonable server
    implementation will allow you to send a shell command to run the
    server). In theory it would be useful for more obscure helpers like
    remote-ext, but even there it is not implemented.

    It's tempting to get rid of it simply to reduce confusion, but we
    have publicly documented it since it was added in fa8c097cc9
    (Support remote helpers implementing smart transports, 2009-12-09),
    so it's possible some helper in the wild is using it.

  - So for v2, helpers (again, including http) are mainly used via
    stateless-connect, driven by the main program. But they do still
    need to decide whether to do a v2 probe. And so there's similar
    logic in remote-curl.c's discover_refs() that looks for
    "git-receive-pack". But it's not buggy in the same way. Since it
    doesn't support servpath, it is always dealing with a "service"
    string like "git-receive-pack". And since it doesn't support
    straight "connect", it can't be used for "upload-archive".

    So we could leave that spot alone. But I've updated it here to match
    the logic we're changing in connect_git(). That seems like the least
    confusing thing for somebody who has to touch both of these spots
    later (say, to add v2 push support). I didn't add a new test to make
    sure this doesn't break anything; we already have several tests (in
    t5551 and elsewhere) that make sure we are using v2 over http.

Organ Unit Tests & Bugfixes (#73026)

## About The Pull Request

This PR adds a new unit test for all organs, a new unit test for lungs,
and includes improvements for the existing breath and organ_set_bonus
tests. Using the tests, I was able to root out bugs in the organs. This
PR includes an advanced refactor of several developer-facing functions.
This PR certainly represents a "quality pass" for organs which will make
them easier to develop from now on.

### Synopsis of changes:
1. Fixed many fundamental bugs in organ code, especially in
`Insert()`/`Remove()` and their overrides.
2. Added two new procs to `/obj/item/organ` named `on_insert` and
`on_remove`, each being called after `Insert()`/`Remove()`.
3. Added `organ_effects` lazylist to `/obj/item/organ`. Converted
`organ_traits` to lazylist. 2x less empty lists per organ.
4. Adding `SHOULD_CALL_PARENT(TRUE)` to `Insert()`/`Remove()` was very
beneficial to stability and overall code health.
5. Created unit test `organ_sanity` for all usable organs in the game.
Tests insertion and removal.
6. Created unit test `lungs_sanity` for
`/obj/item/organ/internal/lungs`.
7. Improved `breath_sanity` unit tests with additional tests and
conditions.
8. Improved `organ_set_bonus_sanity` unit tests with better
documentation and maintainable code.

---

### Granular bug/fix list:

- A lot of organs are overriding `Insert()` to apply unique
side-effects, but aren't checking the return value of the parent proc
which causes the activation of side-effects even if the insertion
technically fails. I noticed the use-case of applying "unique
side-effects" is repeated across a lot of organs in the game, and by
overriding `Insert()` the potential for bugs is very high; I solved this
problem with inversion-of-control by adding two new procs to
`/obj/item/organ` named `on_insert` and `on_remove`, each being called
after `Insert()` and `Remove()` succeed.
- Many organs, such as abductor "glands", cursed heart, demon heart,
alien hive-node, alien plasma-vessel, etc, were not returning their
parent's `Insert()` proc return value at all, and as a result those
organs `Insert()`s were always returning `null`. I have been mopping
those bugs up in my last few PRs, and now the unit test reveals it all.
Functions such as those in surgery expect a truthy value to be returned
from `Insert()` to represent insertion success, and otherwise it
force-moves the organ out of the mob.
- Fixed abductor "glands" which had a hard-del bug due to their
`Remove()` not calling the parent proc.
- Fixed cybernetic arm implants which had a hard-del bug due to
`Remove()` not resetting their `hand` variable to `null`.
- Fixed lungs gas exchange implementation, which was allowing exhaled
gases to feedback into the inhaled gases, which caused Humans to inhale
much more gas than intended and not exhale expected gases.

### Overview of the `organ_sanity` unit test:

- The new `organ_sanity` unit test gathers all "usable" organs in the
game and tests to see if their `Insert()` and `Remove()` functions
behave as we expect them to.
- Some organs, such as the Nightmare Brain, cause the mob's species to
change which subsequently swaps out all of their organs; the unit test
accounts for these organs via the typecache `species_changing_organs`.
- Some organs are not usable in-game and can't be unit tested, so the
unit test accounts for them via the typecache `test_organ_blacklist`.

### Overview of the `lungs_sanity` unit test:

- This unit test focuses on `/obj/item/organ/internal/lungs` including
Plasmaman and Ashwalker lungs. The test focuses on testing the lungs'
`check_breath()` proc.
- The tests are composed of calling `check_breath` with different gas
mixes to test breathing and suffocation.
- Includes gas exchange test for inhaled/exhaled gases, such as O2 to
CO2.

### Improvements to the `breath_sanity` unit tests:

- Added additional tests for suffocation with empty internals, pure
Nitrogen internals, and a gas-less turf.
- Includes slightly more reliable tests for internals tanks.

## Why It's Good For The Game

**Organs and Lungs were mostly untested. Too many refactors have been
submitted without the addition of unit tests to prove the code works at
all.** Time to stop. _Time to get some help_. Due to how bad the code
health is in organs, any time we've tried to work with them some sort of
bug caused them to blow up in our faces. I am trying to fix some of that
by establishing some standard testing for organs. These tests have
revealed and allowed me to fix lot of basic developer errors/oversights,
as well as a few severe bugs.

[MIRROR] Optimizes some gas_mixture procs, Optimizes pipeline processing significantly by 33% [MDB IGNORE] (#20118)

* Optimizes some gas_mixture procs, Optimizes pipeline processing significantly by 33% (#74233)

## About The Pull Request
It is faster to operate on a gas list, especially if cached, then it is
to operate on a datum.
Doing this cause I'm seeing cost in merge() post #74230

Hits on a few other important places too. self_breakdown and such. Worth
it IMO

Could in theory go further by caching the global list. I'm tempted I
admit but it needs profiling first and it's late

EDIT: I have not slept, and have gone tooo far

The ADD_GAS sidestep saves us 0.1 seconds of init (used to at least.
Ensuring we don't break archive is gonna have a cost. I don't want to
profile this so I'll estimate maybe 0.05 seconds). The faster version of
copy_from is just well, better, and helps to avoid stupid

I haven't slept in 36 hours. Have some atmos optimizations

Pipelines now keep track of components that require custom
reconciliation as a seperate list.
This avoids the overhead of filtering all connected atmos machinery.

Rather then relying on |= to avoid duplicate gas_mixtures, we instead
use a cycle var stored on the mix itself, which is compared with a
static unique id from reconcile_air()
This fully prevents double processing of gas, and should (hopefully)
prevent stupid dupe issues in future

Rather then summing volume on the gas mixture itself, we sum it in a
local var.
This avoids datum var accesses, and saves a slight bit of time

Instead of running THERMAL_ENERGY() (and thus heat_capacity(), which
iterates all gases in the mix AGAIN) when processing gas, we instead
just hook into the existing heat capacity calculation done inside the
giver gases loop
This saves a significant amount of time, somewhere around 30% of the
proc, I think?

This doesn't tackle the big headache here, which is the copy_from loop
at the base of the proc.

I think the solution is to convert pipelines to a sort of polling model.
Atmos components don't "own" their mix, they instead have to request a
copy of it from the pipeline datum.
This would work based off a mutually agreed upon volume amount for that
component in that process cycle.

We'd use an archived system to figure out what gases to give to
components, while removing from the real MOLES list.

We could then push gas consumption requests to the pipeline, which would
handle them, alongside volume changes, on the next process.

Not sure how I'd handle connected pipelines... Merging post reconcile
maybe?
This is a problem for tomorrow though, I need to go to bed.

Saves about 30% of pipeline costs.
Profiles taken on kilo, until each reconcile_air hits 5000 calls

operation renaissance

right now that its all done. don't touch without talking to me or bob first. preferably both.

debuffs on nations with no content to remove said debuffs. commented out of effect.
knightmare frames neferd and rebalanced. same as armor.

new balance is from start of game to gen 4 frames. tanks are better. past 2011 knightmare frames become overly inportant. giving the game a good transition. this may have bugs or not play out how i intended.

melee.
high break through high hard attack and pierce. lower defences stats
artillery. generally good soft attack
mass line. production cost has been cut down but their stats have bneen heavily braught down.
all purpose. treated as the elite varients. higher stats more construction cost.

my personal favourite "and honestly id love to make it its own seperate division some how"
fortress frames.
barely any attack and pierce but stupidly high armour defence and anti air capablities. hopefully the rebalance will lead to players needing and wanting to make speciialized divisions.

for example. have melle focused divisions who push through knightmares, fortress knightmares to hold back to reinforce breaking lines. or just provide good aa "these are the most expensive right now.

finally history file work. should be alot more cleaner now and countries should start with all their techs that they are meant to

[evals] ROT13 string evals (#361)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
ROT13

### Eval description

This is a test for GPT4s character-level abilities. It's aware of ROT13
and makes a pretty solid attempt at decoding these ROT13 strings, but it
messes up a lot. The accuracy for GPT 3.5 Turbo is 0.05.

### What makes this a useful eval?

A human with a character lookup table could easily solve these ROT13
decoding. Also, based on my testing with GPT 3.5 Turbo, the model is
happy to make an attempt, even though the results it gives are
incorrect.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage

applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Add regex match eval (#159)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name

Regular Expression Match

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to understand regular expression patterns. 

### What makes this a useful eval?

- Educational purposes: Regular expressions are an important concept in
computer science and programming. By being able to evaluate them,
ChatGPT can serve as a useful learning resource for users who are
studying this topic or want to deepen their understanding.
- the accuracy is 0.79 against gpt-3.5-turbo
- Over 400 regular expression cases have been collected from related
unit tests.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Taxes Eval

### Eval description

Tests the model's ability to evaluate tax liability for generic examples
from common cities including NYC, SF, and Seattle. The eval also tests
ordering of multiple choice options, with the model outputting different
results if the multiple choice labels are switched around.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Taxes are a relatively logically straightforward task, yet there is a
high degree of complexity to the legal and tax system, which makes
calculations difficult to estimate.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,

Initial commit of frontend (blank template)

Added frontend, with React + Vite. Monorepo(-ish) setup is somewhat
unconventional. Most configs are copied from Vite's react-ts template
(and slightly modified). Also, dev server setup is somewhat
unconventional too, but seems to work.

Frontend is currently just a blank "hello world", but build, dev, and
prod work fine (including HMR in dev). Actual UI is next up (along with
test db entries in migrations, probably...).

Notes to self:
- Should probably have one src and one lib folder (with src/bot and
src/ui subfolders, and similar for lib).
- For some reason, typescript complains with "Cannot find module '....png'
or its corresponding type declarations.", but *only* when running as
language server (not standalone; build works just fine..) and, even more
weird, error disappears if I open src-ui/index.d.ts in another editor
tab (but error reappears if I close that tab). Go figure... Since I can
build, I'm ignoring this for now (maybe VSCode does not pick up correct
tsconfig, or..?).
- Although Vite *does* support running dev server in "middleware mode",
decided to stick with proxying ../ui paths from probot server to dev
server. Main reason (perhaps paranoid/misguided?) is that there are
two quite different tsconfigs now, and I don't want to (or have time to)
coverge them right now. Hence decision to use standalone dev server (for
now, at least). As for proxying direction: much easier this way, since
(a) need session auth anyway, and (b) by always proxying GitHub webhooks
etc directly into Probot, I'd guess it's less likely to have issues
because HTTP reqs follow different paths in dev vs prod. Anyway, will
hopefully switch to vite server "middleware mode" in near(?) future...
- Also tried preact + preact-cli, but (a) latter seems to have many
project layout assumptions hardcoded stiff (but: did get it to
work with unconventional monorepo, after ~3hrs and several kludges),
and (b) what I incidentally saw while trying to get that to work *seems*
to suggest there is little reason to use Preact over React (e.g.,
pull req for preact-router baseUrl has been open for ~3yrs with
eventual recommendation to just use react-router, or material UI preact
components were abandoned in favor of MUI, etc etc).
FWIW, setting up vite was very smooth (less than 30min to first
successful "npm run build"?). Hopefully the monorepo-ish layout I'm
using won't come back to bite me, we'll see.

Change references to Galileo to Guru Maps

It's the same app, just they had to change the
name. Here's their explanation for what happened
(from a Facebook post):

We renamed the Galileo and that's why:

The Galileo has acquired a fame of a reliable and
stable powerful map app for the past 9 years and
we love that name.

Two years ago, the European Union registered the
Galileo trademark for its global navigation

ask 1 Software configuration

Task 1 Why I did decide to participate in Dare IT Challenge?

One year ago I decide to change my profession definitely. Then I started learning testing on my own. I passed ISTQB exam and learned some new skills on the Udemy platform.

In autumn my friend told me about Dare IT. I started to observe girls from Dare IT on Linked In and Instagram.
I was on a few webinars. I attended an online job fair organized by Dare IT and I fell in love with that organization.
After the job fair, I was very uplifted and determined to get new skills and start my career in IT as QA Tester.
The automation part of testing is very alluring for me, I loved working with software, testing applications, and developing my digital skills.
I'm pleased that I can do that with Dare It. I believe that I will be a good tester able to automate tests.

Minor Nukie Thing: Bolt-action Sniper Rifle, balance coding, and some ammo changes (#73781)

## About The Pull Request

### The Rifle:
-The Sniper Rifle is now a bolt action. This replaces the 4 second fire
delay on the sniper rifle. This overall will improve the fire rate if
you're good at racking the bolt, but it will also feel less like you're
in a weird limbo of inaction while using the sniper rifle, since the
fire delay can be quite confusing to players not used to it. This can be
tweaked, like reducing the speed of the racking action, if it seems like
it is too much.
-The scope component now goes up to 50 tiles (or so), which allows you
to gain a significant sightline over an area. The reasoning for this is
simple. The component actually nerfed the overall range of the sniper
rifle's scope, so this should hopefully restore that somewhat. And
having such a huge sightline makes it much easier to utilize the
impressive range of the rifle. Currently, it's really only ideal for
extremely close range fighting.
-The normal sniper rifle, the one that syndicate base scientists get,
can be suppressed. I don't know why it was different.

### The Ammo:

Normal .50 BMG: Does much more object damage, and on top of that deals
additional damage to mechs, but not by much more. Now, when it
dismembers a limb, it also deals its damage to the chest. This ensures
that you didn't straight up lose out on dealing a killing blow because
you took their limb off, and makes the dismemberment property of .50 BMG
a significant upside rather than a immense detriment.

Marksman: Gains a lot of the above benefits, but has much lower range.
Why this nerf? It's actually because of some funny nonsense with how
ricochet works. Which can cause....accidents to happen. To you. Consider
that firing down a straight line and missing could be quite embarrassing
when the bullet has 400 tiles of range.

Soporific: Now called Disruptor ammo. Works as it did before, putting
humans to sleep for 40 seconds (seriously, 40 seconds). Also deals some
stamina damage, if...that's relevant. But now also causes an EMP effect
and a boatload of added damage to both mechs and borgs, allowing it to
be an excellent anti-mech and anti-borg ammo type, as well as scrambling
any pesky suit sensors, energy weapons and so on in an area around the
impact. Useful for support fire.

Incendiary (NEW!): Causes a massive firebomb to go off where it impacts
(no explosion, so this isn't a stun). Also sets the target on fire,
which is always fun. Good for shooting into groups of people with
impunity. Also deals burn damage instead, since I think nukies could use
more methods for direct fire damage.

Surplus (NEW!): It's .50 BMG but it lacks most if not all the upsides.
No armour penetration, no dismemberment, no paralysis. It still deals a
lot of damage to objects, so not a bad option for simply removing
structures from afar. So what's the point in this ammo? You can buy 7
magazines for the price of one. I want to introduce 'Surplus' as an idea
for nukies to invest in if they want to be able to keep shooting but
they're really on a budget, like most non-warop nukies tend to be. This
is definitely subject to change (like a damage decrease on top of
everything else).

Pricing and Capacity: Normal ammo and surplus costs 3 TC. Every special
ammo costs 4 TC. Every special ammo also has the same ammo capacity as
the normal magazine. It's kind of weird how most of the subtypes had 5
shots rather than 6, but then soporific had...3? I don't get it. This
would probably cause a good deal of confusion, especially if you are
swapping ammo types and weren't aware of this particular oddity.

Anyway, 6 shots.

### Minor Addition
Gets rid of the cheap suppressor. It lies to players, tricking them into
thinking this is a low quality suppressor. Newsflash, it isn't. There is
no distinct difference between that suppressor and the normal
suppressor.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The sniper rifle, unfortunately, sucks a lot except for very specific
use cases. It got a big nerf with the scope component in terms of range,
even if the functionality is way cooler. And, at a baseline, there was
some counterintuitive functions attached to it. Dismemberment was cool,
but it also caused a loss in overall damage due to how limbs contribute
to core health. On top of this, the cool ammo types were...not much
better? Penetrator was almost always the best option, even if it lost a
lot of damage as a consequence.

So, what was it good for? X-ray + Penetrator. Pretty much, that's it. It
has some other uses but if I had to be entirely honest, there wasn't
much that other weapon couldn't do as well.

Hopefully this helps things going forward, and I want to mess with this
as well down the line in case its a bit too much of a boost in power.

Absolutely please rip this PR apart.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Makes the syndicate sniper rifle a bolt-action rifle.
balance: Sniper rifles have a scope range of roughly 50 tiles.
balance: Sniper rifle ammo, if it dismembers your limbs, does damage to
the chest.
balance: All the various syndicate sniper rifle magazines have
consistent casing quantities (6 shots). They also have more consistent
pricing. 3 for normal and a box of surplus, and 4 for every other type.
balance: Reduces the range of Marksman ammo to 50 tiles. Not because it
is strong, but because you might accidentally shoot yourself if you're
not watching where you're shooting. Ricochets are no joke.
add: Replaces Soporific with Disruptor ammo. Works like soporific, but
also EMPS things it hits.
add: Adds Incendiary .50 BMG. Causes a combustion to erupt from the
struck target, as well as setting targets on fire. Great for parties.
add: Adds Surplus .50 BMG. It sucks, but you get a lot of them! Quantity
over quality, baby.
remove: The suppressors in the bundle are of standard quality. The
apparent 'cheap suppressor' that came bundled with the C-20r and sniper
rifle were found to actually be 'fine'. Trust us.

Log Active Turfs To Mapping Log (#74267)

## About The Pull Request

Was reminded of doing this via
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/74245#issuecomment-1483943979

They're mapping issues, so let's log them to the mapping log. Quite
shrimple honestly.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/227805458-5e6bcf01-629d-4b81-ab6a-b26e63d41ca3.png)
## Why It's Good For The Game

As the comments expound, the reason why we probably haven't done this in
the past is because any number of things can cause active turfs (like
ruin placement (either in icebox or in space)), or other silly stuff
like that. Thus, finding stuff like this would only really be viable
with stuff like the View Active Turfs verb, where you could visually
jump to and see all of the active turfs in that dynamic configuration
(and this still remains the best way to find active turfs).

This PR just makes it easier to do a "post-mortem" analysis on potential
active turfs, so that if it's very blatant, it can be fixed a lot
easier. It's best to try and find them during an ongoing round, but this
is life. (same as the unit tests concession, not too enthused on that
but we would have spontaneous errors out the ass without _something_)
## Changelog
Nothing that concerns players.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Let me put this link here.

> What a time it was to be alive.

3/31/2023

9:20am. It is time to transform a bit. From here on out I'll focus on the easy bits. Today I meant to do the deployment tutorial, but an idea came to me that I should do a video about how to debug SAFE Stack programs.

So that is what I'll do first. Let me go through my reads and then I will start.

Oh right, any mail? Spam and a reject. It has been two weeks, so I'll get nothing more from this application round. Let's give it a while until I try again.

9:55am. Let's get started. The debugger video I'll narrate myself. I'll try it in real time as a challenge.

10am. Oh my god, this is so complicated. VS Code is broken. I'll have to do it once and then do it again.

10:15am. Third time's the charm.

10:25am. Actually it is not a bad exercise to say things out loud during the first run, but fuck editing this. I'll write a script and dub over it.

This is the ideal compromise. I'll be getting talking exercise like this without the pain of having to be a voice actor.

11:45am. Done with part 1 on how to debug a console application. Next is the SAFE Stack application.

Let's give it a shot.

12:10pm. Had to take a short break. Let me just run it in regular mode, and then I'll have breakfast.

12:40pm. Let me stop here for the morning. I'll finish the video after this and move on to deployment.

1:25pm. Let me do the chores.

2:25pm. Let me resume. Stop reading /g/ threads me. The AI fears are really coming to the forefront, but to me, if anything that's a reason to be bearish.

It is not that easy to discover an entirely new class of fundamental models. If it were, the ML community would have done it.

I feel very foolish myself. It is true that I was racing, but deep in my heart, what I really want is that the one with the best programming skill to win. I do not want the Elon Musk types to win everything because they have the deepest pockets.

I want my chance, and I want everyone else to get a chance.

My mistake was not pattern matching enough. I should have recognized that the AI space resembles the 70s mainframe era rather than the 10s gaming era where anyone can come in and create.

Let me resume.

2:45pm. Weird things are happening. I can't even run the UI locally. I wonder if upgrading Fable to 4.0.3 from the prerelease version is what is the culprit. Also the old ports aren't getting released for some reason.

...Why is everything broken today? Let me try it in Rider.

I was hoping that updating Fable wouldn't break things, but it did.

Sigh, the Fable prerelease from the previous commit works. So much for trying to do the right thing. Nevermind, let me just stick with it.

3pm. I had to reset the computer as weird things were happening.

```
    <RootNamespace>Minimal_API_Tutorial_1</RootNamespace>
    <AssemblyName>Some name</AssemblyName>
```

Ah, maybe I can set the assembly name like this. Ok.

5:35pm. Finally exporting this to Youtube. This should have been a brief video, but it took quite a while to make. It is almost 13m long.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fsharp/comments/110la01/how_to_debug_fable_and_safe_stack_applications/
How to debug Fable and SAFE Stack applications?

I'll post a link in this question I asked two months ago when the vid is up. I've come some way.

5:55pm. https://youtu.be/kakBk4RqLxM
How To Use A Debugger In Multi-Process (SAFE Stack) Applications (For Beginners!)

Finally it is out!

https://www.reddit.com/r/fsharp/comments/127pxd5/how_to_use_a_debugger_in_multiprocess_safe_stack/?sort=new

I hope this doesn't get downvoted. In fact, I'd like it if it got upvoted. But who knows how the reception will go. Popular Youtubers get zillions of likes, but I am fighting for one or two likes. I suppose that fits me. That's life for you.

6:10pm. Hmmm, what do I do now? I guess I'll close for the day here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkOSUVzOAA4
T3 Stack Tutorial - FROM 0 TO PROD FOR $0 (Next.js, tRPC, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma & More)

I have no idea what all these things are, but no doubt studying this will make me a better web dev. Consider this penitence for my shitty performance in the first half of 2020 and just get on with it. I guess I'll watch this a little before lunch time.

I just do not feel like jumping into deployment at this time. I'll try that out tomorrow. I am looking forward to it. After I release that video, I ask for jobs on the F# sub again.

6:20pm. https://youtu.be/YkOSUVzOAA4?t=59

The project is a Twitter clone where you can only post emojis. It can be scaled to millions.

Actually that aspect of it would be pretty interesting to me. This is just the kind of project I need to be a real web dev.

https://youtu.be/YkOSUVzOAA4?t=75

He says that the free services covered here are really generous.

https://youtu.be/YkOSUVzOAA4?t=109
> Initialize
> Get it on Github
> Get it deployed

https://youtu.be/YkOSUVzOAA4?t=120
> Make sure to deploy early and often in all your development process.

7pm. Done with lunch. I watched about 15m of this. I'll leave the rest for later. I'll have to ask on the F# sub what technology choices should I make once I start.

I should also check out the techs covered in this video and their docs. A priority for me would be to implement all of this using free services only."

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Adds the Dark Matt-eor when you emag a stupid amount of meteor shields + lots of meteor file sorting + qol + dark matter singularity + dark matt-eor summoning final traitor objective (#5128)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/74330

## About The Pull Request

<details>
  <summary>Dark Matt-eor Image</summary>
  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40974010/228368755-34ae5f89-e1bb-498b-bbf8-a14ff4240dc0.png)

</details>

> A barely visible blur in the cosmic darkness, like a ghostly shadow on
a moonless night. A piercing howl in the vacuum of space, as if it were
tearing the fabric of reality. A twisted halo of light around it,
bending and breaking the rays of distant suns. A shower of quantum
sparks, flickering and fading in its wake. A dark matter meteor (dark
matt-eor) is a wonder to witness, and to dread.

> A sudden impact, like a hammer blow to the heart of the station. A
violent tremor, shaking and shattering the metal walls and windows. A
deafening roar, as the air rushes out of the breached hull. A blinding
flash, as the dark matter meteor unleashes its hidden energy. A tiny
black hole, forming and growing in the center of the station. A
relentless pull, dragging everything towards the abyss. A dark matter
meteor is incredibly deadly.

Emagging too many meteor shields will summon a dark matt-eor. This comes
with several warnings, and after awhile, warns the station that someone
is trying to summon a dark matteor.

The dark matt-eor itself is not that damaging in its impact, but drops a
singularity in its final resting place.

## Why It's Good For The Game

It's a new way to terrorize a round as an antagonist. Before, emagging a
lot of meteor shields would basically make meteor showers the only event
that can run, which is cool, but since constant meteor waves are going
to destroy the station, let's also throw in the mother of all meteors!

This also adds warnings to spamming emagging meteor shields, which imo
needs it. The round ends when someone spams emagged meteor shields, and
since they're meteor shields nobody is going to reasonably check on
them.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: The dark matt-eor
add: Summon a dark matt-eor final traitor objective
add: Dark matter singularity variant, which can't grow as big as a
regular singularity but hungers for blood
code: cleaned up/sorted meteor shield code, satellite control, and more
qol: added a lot of feedback to interacting with meteor shields
balance: emagging a lot of meteor shields warns the station, but
emagging enough of them summons a Dark Matt-eor.

computing standard deviation of the mean, in addition to the average now, weighted and unweighted. should probably be functions. should probably have a class, actually...

compares averages with `timavg.csh` as well. comparison good to ~8 decimal places. not expecting to reproduce bit-wise, but i think we're not at the machine-precision level yet with the numerics anyways, so i think my averaging/stddev routine is missing something. haven't compared to std deviation computation from `timavg.csh` yet, but I should.

Too slow. for loops. need to look at iterators, parallelism, comprehension, and other methods to speed up. i hear generator functions help a lot, but I just don't understand how/why that could possibly make a difference.

function argument I/O needs to catch up a little bit. important but not urgent yet, call it a quality of life effort soon, though.

Mega-trends Driving Chemical Industry.Pt 2

 
Mega-trends Driving Chemical Industry - Success Priorities (Pt.2)
Introduction
The priorities for success in the chemical industry are dynamic and constantly changing. End users' demands and priorities shift with changing technology, usage experience, and processes. So, organizations in the industry must evolve to remain competitive.
In this document, we will examine the priorities that the chemical industry must set to become or remain a leader in their sector.
For leaders of an organization, safe, compliant, sustainable operations and any relevant transformational effort hold top priorities. Despite automation being in existence for over a decade, many chemical companies still suffer from siloed data and a lack of integration in manufacturing and the supply chain. This siloed state further prevents them from automating other processes and capitalizing on internal know-how and relationship-building with customers and vendors. If we trace back to the roots of the chemical company sales, we find that they originally sold crude oil products and inorganic materials to the downstream industry. However today, their consumer base has expanded to include the life sciences and automotive industries and in future, it will continue to evolve.
To garner success and evolve with the market, chemical companies will put these four strategies on their priority list.
THE STRATEGIES
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY INCREMENT
Chemical companies can automate a major part of their back-end systems by utilizing machine learning, artificial intelligence and predictive models, thus enabling scenarios like touchless order fulfilment, and lights-out manufacturing and bringing the vision of autonomous enterprise even closer. Initially, companies can focus on reducing the processing time, increasing first-pass yields through predictive quality and improving overall equipment effectiveness. This can be achieved with continuous improvement of Integrated IoT, Machine learning and Digital Twins in everyday operations. Next, companies can put their efforts into collaborating with customers, suppliers and upstream-downstream service partners.
This can be achieved through the use of an intelligent asset network, predictive models, and experience management. These tools can improve the overall supply chain management of an organization. Additionally, they can anticipate possible disruptions, simulate them, and implement contingency plans to mitigate risk throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, by utilizing machine learning, end-to-end standard operations can be automated.
 
Managing Integrated Operations
The ability to operate safely and effectively is critical for chemical companies. One of their never-ending tasks is reducing cycle time and improving the first yield pass. They focus on individual inefficiencies, such as material movement or equipment efficiency and strive to reduce cycle time by fully integrating end-to-end operations. Manufacturing connectivity and intelligence solutions, such as Brabo, and technologies like digital-twin enable companies to operate more reliably and efficiently, by providing them with an integrated view of day-to-day operations. They also offer valuable insights into operations, improving problem rectification and business outcomes.
Problems in Traditional Scenarios
•	The potential impact of an event on one or multiple downstream processes is not understood appropriately.
•	The best solution to a problem due to missing functionality to completely model multiple solutions is not chosen efficiently.
•	Integration between operation and management systems is minimal or non-existent.
 
Solutions offered by New World Scenarios
▪Interrelated data from facilities, operations, human resources, logistics and the environment dealing with a digital representation of the Operational world is fully integrated by Brabo, an OT-IT connectivity platform. ▪ Events which are having an impact on operational continuity are processed, presented and analyzed for their potential. Remedies are then proposed and a new corrective action plan is executed.
▪ The ability to understand what data needs to be worked upon is vital to modern operations.
 
Top value drivers for Integrated Operation Solution are:-
1.	Reduction in Process Cycle Times
2.	Quicker Response Time
3.	Reduction in Cost and Waste
4.	Support for implementing new business Processes

cql3: remove expr::token

Let's remove expr::token and replace all of its functionality with expr::function_call.

expr::token is a struct whose job is to represent a partition key token.
The idea is that when the user types in `token(p1, p2) < 1234`,
this will be internally represented as an expression which uses
expr::token to represent the `token(p1, p2)` part.

The situation with expr::token is a bit complicated.
On one hand side it's supposed to represent the partition token,
but sometimes it's also assumed that it can represent a generic
call to the token() function, for example `token(1, 2, 3)` could
be a function_call, but it could also be expr::token.

The query planning code assumes that each occurence of expr::token
represents the partition token without checking the arguments.
Because of this allowing `token(1, 2, 3)` to be represented
as expr::token is dangerous - the query planning
might think that it is `token(p1, p2, p3)` and plan the query
based on this, which would be wrong.

Currently expr::token is created only in one specific case.
When the parser detects that the user typed in a restriction
which has a call to `token` on the LHS it generates expr::token.
In all other cases it generates an `expr::function_call`.
Even when the `function_call` represents a valid partition token,
it stays a `function_call`. During preparation there is no check
to see if a `function_call` to `token` could be turned into `expr::token`.
This is a bit inconsistent - sometimes `token(p1, p2, p3)` is represented
as `expr::token` and the query planner handles that, but sometimes it might
be represented as `function_call`, which the query planner doesn't handle.

There is also a problem because there's a lot of duplication
between a `function_call` and `expr::token`. All of the evaluation
and preparation is the same for `expr::token` as it's for a `function_call`
to the token function. Currently it's impossible to evaluate `expr::token`
and preparation has some flaws, but implementing it would basically
consist of copy-pasting the corresponding code from token `function_call`.

One more aspect is multi-table queries. With `expr::token` we turn
a call to the `token()` function into a struct that is schema-specific.
What happens when a single expression is used to make queries to multiple
tables? The schema is different, so something that is representad
as `expr::token` for one schema would be represented as `function_call`
in the context of a different schema.
Translating expressions to different tables would require careful
manipulation to convert `expr::token` to `function_call` and vice versa.
This could cause trouble for index queries.

Overall I think it would be best to remove expr::token.

Although having a clear marker for the partition token
is sometimes nice for query planning, in my opinion
the pros are outweighted by the cons.
I'm a big fan of having a single way to represent things,
having two separate representations of the same thing
without clear boundaries between them causes trouble.

Instead of having expr::token and function_call we can
just have the function_call and check if it represents
a partition token when needed.

[MDB Ignore] Manifest Destiny - The Final Tile Flattening (#74169)

Alt Title: The End Of The 12 Month War
## About The Pull Request

### Hey! Listen! This PR _will_ cause a merge conflict with your PR!
Please ensure that you have the knowledge on how to handle merge
conflicts, found here:
https://hackmd.io/@tgstation/ry4-gbKH5#Assured-Merge-Conflict-Resolution

Supercedes #74023 entirely.

Port of the tooling introduced in
https://github.com/BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet/pull/7970 (we already
had everything else), modified to meet /tg/'s requisites and culling
anything that was not entirely relevant (that I could see). It's not the
end of the world if I missed something tbh. Some aspects were commented
out since they may be relevant to downstreams who port this PR or to
enable (what I see to be) un-necessary warnings.

This is a culmination of a year's efforts, starting with _Red Rover,
Four Corners_ (#65290) and later _Opposing Corners_ (#65455). If you
don't understand why this PR exists or why it's necessary, I recommend
reading both of those.

Since then, several mappers (both in their own mapping as well as
tailored PRs) have worked on "flattening" out these tile turfs, however
I've continually wanted a function that would mass automate it (outlined
here https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=31872 - This
functionality might still be useful if added to UpdatePaths or another
type of script thereof, but I no longer have reason to keep the bounty
up).

It's finally here! Yippie! A new python file, courtesy of itsmeow at
BeeStation. Very awesome. As previously mentioned, a lot of alterations
had to be made for our mapping desires, but the results are quite
agreeable. There's a few assertions that this file makes that I had to
address:

* We have "colorless" tile decals. These are transparent, so they don't
do anything. By default, bee would make these "white tiles", but we have
no such thing. I decided to just add a maplint and an UpdatePaths to
guard against this silliness (only Delta and Tram) had it.
* For some reason, it labels already-converted decals with the default
direction as an error state. I might touch this up in the coming hours,
but for now I surpressed the error due to how many false warnings it was
spitting out.

There's a few ways this tool can be improved, but I lack the knowledge
on how to do so:
* Make it so that we can run the map merger to fix the keys of the map
in the `update_map` function, rather than run the fixer-upper python
file. We can live without this to be honest. It's actually slightly good
because it forces you to look at all of the MapMerge Warnings, and you
can ascertain any potential errors without it silently passing you by
and hitting the repository (or at least those that we haven't linted for
yet).
* Be able to pass in any regex to "flatten" anything. That's way out of
scope for what I want to do here though.

## How do you use this tool?

I made a readme.
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/363852cb17fa46dad8fd20e261f8f665f3e008bb/tools/MapTileAggregator/readme.md
### Mapping March
oh hey it's pretty neat that this PR came out in mapping march, what a
nice qol for mappers as the month enters the home stretch. ckey is
san7890

## Why It's Good For The Game

slimmer DMM files, better mapping practices. cool new tool. so nice.
## Changelog
Nothing that really affects players, but a short summary for all those
reading this PR:

* All "corner" turf decals are flattened, and there's now a tool that we
store that you can re-run to keep stuff flat in case you like mapping
one way and want to fix it at the end.
* We (should) now lint against useless uncolored turf decals since that
was completely garbo as far as our codebase is concerned.
* UpdatePaths for fixing up uncolored turf decals, yippie!


If you want to review this PR, may I suggest the file filter. You don't
need to look at any of the DMM files I already did:

Allow transitions to interrupt Suspensey commits (#26531)

I originally made it so that a Suspensey commit — i.e. a commit that's
waiting for a stylesheet, image, or font to load before proceeding —
could not be interrupted by transitions. My reasoning was that Suspensey
commits always time out after a short interval, anyway, so if the
incoming update isn't urgent, it's better to wait to commit the current
frame instead of throwing it away.

I don't think this rationale was correct, for a few reasons. There are
some cases where we'll suspend for a longer duration, like stylesheets —
it's nearly always a bad idea to show content before its styles have
loaded, so we're going to be extend this timeout to be really long.

But even in the case where the timeout is shorter, like fonts, if you
get a new update, it's possible (even likely) that update will allow us
to avoid showing a fallback, like by navigating to a different page. So
we might as well try.

The behavior now matches our behavior for interrupting a suspended
render phase (i.e. `use`), which makes sense because they're not that
conceptually different.

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

Makes Lesser Form into one ability & unit tests it (#73572)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #73491
Every time I have used this ability lately it's been fucked. 
It would vanish from my actions at arbitrary moments, and also sometimes
transform me into a horrible monkey-man thing instead of a monkey. This
is a shame because being able to become a monkey can be pretty fun, even
if it makes you very vulnerable to being butchered.

Refactoring it into being one action instead of two actions which add
and remove each other fixes the part where the action just disappears.
It reliably sticks between transformations now, regardless of whether or
not they were voluntary.

I also noticed that when I was turning into a monkey it wasn't dropping
the changeling "fake clothes" outfit pieces I had on as a human, leading
to a really fucked up looking monkey. I fixed this by adding `force =
TRUE` in the drop to ground proc in the check for if the equipment you
have is still valid after your species changes. I don't _think_ this has
any side effects but I never do and then someone finds some.
For good measure I also made all of the changeling equipment abilities
which don't work if you are a monkey detect if you become a monkey and
retract themselves.

I also noticed that for a long time Last Resort has been trying and
failing to give you Lesser Form (well, Human Form rather) as a Headcrab,
so I fixed that and now you actually get the ability.

Finally I did a _little_ bit of housekeeping in general on the
changeling actions, mostly balloon alerts. I think these definitely need
more attention than I gave them though. I left a lot of the `to_chat`s
in place because many of them give information you want to be a little
sticky, or refer back to in order to double check what you just did.

I also added a unit test which flips back and forth a few times to
ensure the ability still works.
This required adding an "instant" flag to the monkeyize/humanize procs
to skip the timers, and idenitified a couple of weird issues.
First point: Humanising a monkey would remove the monkey mutation and
then call humanise again, which would not skip itself because it still
regarded you as being a monkey. I changed the order of operations here
slightly so that it will early return.
Second point: Calling `domutcheck` on `human/consistent` would runtime
because we skip the bit which sets up any mutations in their DNA. This
is a part of changeling transformation, so I just made it return
instantly.

## Why It's Good For The Game

You can use this ability again without getting stuck permanently as a
monkey, or it just deleting itself from your list of abilities for no
reason.
Turning into a monkey with fake outfit pieces on won't turn you into an
abomination.

## Changelog

:cl:
refactor: Changeling's Lesser Form is now one ability instead of two
which keep swapping, which should consistently turn you back and forth
without deleting itself from your action bar.
fix: Hatching from an egg left by a Last Resort headcrab should
correctly grant you Lesser Form in addition to your other abilities.
fix: Turning into a monkey while using the Changeling space suit won't
leave you as a monkey with a weird inflated head.
qol: Using lesser form as a monkey with only one stored DNA profile will
skip asking which profile you want and will simply transform you
immediately into the only option.

Polishes some side sources of light and color [MDB IGNORE] (#19860)

* Polishes some side sources of light and color (#73936)

## About The Pull Request

[Circuit Floor
Polish](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/6b0ee9813271f693ceb44ad42277c36ef2e71268)

Circuit floors glow! but it looks like crap cause it's dim and the
colors are washed out.
I'd like to make them look nicer. Let's make them more intense and
longer range, and change the colors over to more vivid replacements.

While I'm here, these should really use power and turn on and off based
off that.
Simple enough to do, just need to hook into a signal (and add a setter
for turf area, which cleans up other code too).

[Desklamp
Upgrade](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/8506b13b9c97bf740c3e97db04450555387dd126)

Desklamps look bad. They're fullwhite, have a way too large
range.Crummy.
Let's lower their lightrange from 5 to 3.5, and make the ornate ones
warmer, and the more utilitarian ones cooler. The clown one can be
yellow because it's funny

I'm renaming a color define here so I'm touching more files then you'd
expect

[Brightens
Niknacks](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/73936/commits/835bae28e9eb9946be53c9f5dac0a0a39f15ef21)

Increases the light range of request consoles, status displays,
newscasters, and air alarms (keycard machines too, when they're awaiting
input at least)
Increases the brightness of air alarms, I think they should be on par
with apcs, should be able to tell when they're good/bad.
Increases the brightness of vending machines (I want them to light up
the tiles around them very lightly, I think it's a vibe)

Fixes a bug with ai status displays where they'd display an emissive
even if they didn't have anything on their screen, looking stupid.
This was decently easy but required a define. Looked really bad tho

The niknack changes are more minor so I'm not gonna grab photos for
them. I can if you'd like but I don't think it's necessary. Mostly a
vibes in dark spaces sorta thing

## Changelog

:cl:
add: I made circuit floors brighter and more vivid.
add: Made air alarms, vending machines, newscasters, request consoles,
status displays and keycard machines slightly "brighter" (larger light
range, tho I did make air alarms a bit brighter too)
add: Tweaked desklamps. Lower range, and each type gets its own coloring
instead of just fullwhite.
fix: AI displays are no longer always emissive, they'll stop doing it if
they aren't displaying anything. Hopefully this'll look nicer
/:cl:

* Polishes some side sources of light and color

* yellow

* Update dance_machine.dm

* Merge branch 'upstream-merge-73936' of https://github.com/Skyrat-SS13/Skyrat-tg into upstream-merge-73936

mame: update to 0.253.

It’s time for MAME 0.253, but before we start talking about all
the exciting updates, there are a couple of things that will affect
people compiling or packaging MAME. Firstly, libc++ 6 is no longer
supported. You can still compile with clang 6, but you’ll need to
use libc++ 7 or later, or GNU libstdc++ 7 or later, for the C++
standard library. Secondly, MAME now requires Lua compiled as C++
to work correctly. This prevents the use of Lua libraries from
Linux distribution package repositories, as they are compiled as
C. (The technical reason for this change is that MAME requires C++
stack frames to be unwound correctly, including destructor calls,
when Lua errors are raised from C++ code. Using Lua compiled as C
will cause resource leaks.)

We’ve updated to Lua 5.4, which comes with an all-new garbage
collector, giving better performance. This should have minimal
impact on people writing scripts and plugins. Two of the biggest
visible changes are that unpack has been replaced with table.unpack
and the deprecated bitlib has been removed. While we’re talking
about Lua, we’d like to draw your attention to the new MAME Goodies
repository, where we’ll be adding additional content for use with
MAME. So far, there are two plugins. One of them is sure to be
useful for fans of Konami’s arcade rhythm games. They also serve
as example code for people looking to learn about some of the things
you can do with MAME’s Lua scripting capabilities.

The long-rumoured microcode-based Motorola 68000 CPU core is finally
here! It’s already delivering results, with a number of previously
out-of-reach Atari ST demos now running. We’ve done some intensive
testing, but there are probably still regressions lurking. Let us
know if one of your favourite 68k-based games flakes out on you.

One of the more interesting systems to be dumped and emulated this
month is Akazukin, a 1983 arcade game where you shoot wolves preying
on a defenceless girl. There’s also a game bearing the rather
generic title Heroes, an early version of Data East’s Mutant Fighter.
We’ve added a few more electronic toys to play with, including Race
Time from Bandai, Punch Your Lights Out from Tiger, and a trio of
backgammon and chess games from Tryom. If you’re in a more serious
mood, the Brother LW-30 and LW-840ic dedicated word processors are
now supported. The Sony NWS-3410 UNIX workstation is now working
(albeit without its frame buffer, so you’ll need to use a serial
terminal), as is the ironically named Vector 4 S-100 bus computer
(Vector Graphic never sold a system with vector graphics capabilities).

Building on the work in last month’s release, Hyper Neo Geo 64
games are looking better than ever. Numerous texturing and tilemap
issues have been resolved. Taito F3 video emulation has had several
effects fixed, with Land Maker in particular looking noticeably
better. Switching from video to sound, the KC 85 computer family
now has working audio output, some issues with looping and retriggered
samples on the Apple IIgs have been fixed, and fixes for PC Engine
CD audio playback issues have made some games go from crashing to
playable. More subtly, correcting audio chip clock frequencies has
fixed the pitch of sounds for several systems, including Snow Bros.
2 and Noboranka.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

chore: update style throughout code (#570)

Even though it's a perfectly compatible change, I thought the new version would be a good
opportunity to update our linting rules which is something I've wanted to do for a while.

This commit bumps our `prettier` version to 2.x, which includes some beneficial defaults;
primarily, enforcing trailing commas. I realize trailing commas may not be viewed as
"beneficial" by all :) but I think they are valuable and the AirBnb JS style guide (which
we try to use as our source of truth, not that we're following it perfectly) requires
them. Happy to debate the change but thought I'd propose it because the lack of trailing
commas has bugged me for a while haha.

dehacked: fix quit messages.

The messages hadn't been checked for length. Fortunately caught relatively early because the only string that shows up in vanilla (and thus would cause a crash) is also one of the longest ones.

I've also amended two things in the text itself:

1. big burly violent guy who's all about freedom and blaming scientists for things is...... not something that's aged well. And when a corporation is involved you know it's the investors pushing for the bad thing and not the actual researchers on the ground.

2. that other quit message literally reads like you're goading someone into suicide IRL, in the current environment where everybody's depressed and a lot of us have lost important people to plague or war or medical neglect or workplace accidents or violent bigotry or any combination thereof. I've taken the liberty to rephrase it so the emphasis is on what I think was intended.

Threw in a replacement for "exit to DOS" as well.
