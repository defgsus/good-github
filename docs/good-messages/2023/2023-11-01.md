Nukie Update Followup: Returns CQC to the previous price range, Core Gear kit for newbies, hat stabilizers for everyone (#79232)

## About The Pull Request

Brings the CQC kit back down to the same price range of 14 TC (it's 1
more than before weapon kits). It feels like currently that CQC is
overpriced, even with the stealth box coming along with it, and by
comparison the energy sword and shield got a huge value increase by
combining the two. They're both melee styles and also equally difficult
play styles. It isn't really necessary to make one more expensive than
the other. Also now comes with syndicate smokes. It's a whatever change,
ops get these for free on the base.

Adds a core gear kit in the weapon category. This kit comes with a
doormag, a freedom implant, stimpack and c-4 charge. All of these are
items almost every nukie buys if they want to succeed, so let's inform
newer players by putting it RIGHT on top of the list. This isn't at any
discount, this is mostly to help inform players what items help make you
successful.

Hat stabilizers are now a part of every syndicate modsuit for FREE. It
comes built in, can't be removed, and has no complexity cost. Now
everyone can wear their wacky hats as they operate.

## Why It's Good For The Game

CQC felt like it got shafted waaay too hard with the weapon case
changes. Definitely don't believe that it is punching at the same weight
as many of the other high cost weapons. So we've dropped it down a
category. 14 TC is still a large upfront cost, even if it comes bundled
with a lot of goods.

Melbert gave me the idea of a core bundle kit to help newer players and
I was really taken with that. So I added it as part of this followup.

I want people to wear their hats goddamnit, and I didn't learn my
mistake with the tool parcels. So now everyone has hat stands on their
suits. WEAR THE SOMBRERO YOU **FUCK**.

### THIS IS NOW A THREAT.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Operatives can once again read about the basics of CQC at a
reasonable price of 14 TC.
qol: All Syndicate MODsuits come with the potent ability to wear hats on
their helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by
their bald helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their
MODsuit, wearing a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted
in more than a few operatives prematurely detonating their implants! BUT
NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of
gear for success as an operative. This is right at the top of the
uplink, you can't miss it! Great for those operatives just starting out,
or operatives who need all their baseline equipment NOW.

Mapping/Balance - Joint-Shop and Tribe Deathclaw

Made the shop near nash a little more interesting! It now has a more "Shoppy"-ish appearance? And has unqiue Strong Radroaches inside that I might use in other areas. They aren't too dangerous. Still die in one shot to [MOST] weapons, some weaker weapons might not be ideal for them. I tested combat against them early on with energy weapons. We'll see.

I changed the health and damage of the Deathclaw under the Sulphur Bottom camp as well; It deals significantly more varied ranges of damage 25-50 and is tankier over all. A big roll on luck when fighting the Deathclaw, which I think is a very interesting feel for actually sending people down there to fight it, and players who are very tanky will struggle killing it as it can occasionally nail some BIG damage on you.

I also increased the size of the Deathclaw arena, so that the deathclaw can actually BREAK shit like its intended to do when it reaches its enraged point! I really look forward to seeing fights in here become a lot more of a FIGHT rather than an endurance test. The rewards remain the same.

Literally changed one spot for the oven in a log cabin a little south east of Nash.

adds this ruin to space ruin pool
this is a shady (as NT always is) bioresearch outpost that got fucked up
by an experiment
this has like some puzzle aspect to it since you gotta find keycards and
shit and press buttons to unlock shield gates
this ends with you fighting a heart which if you defeat, destroys the
blockade that prevents you from entering the outpost vault

also you can no longer literally just cut indestructible grilles or
unanchor indestructible windows

### new puzzle elements or something idk
variant of pressure plate that you cannot remove and it sends a puzzle
signal
cooler red puzzle doors that look very foreboding or something idk
theyre for this ruin
also puzzle blockades, which are indestructible dense objects that are
destroyed if they receive a puzzle signal
and also buttons and keycard pads for puzzles

### enemies
living floor, it can only attack stuff on top of it and it attacks until
the victim is dead
it is invincible to all but a crowbar, and it cannot move, and it
remains hidden until a victim is in range

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/aa1d54f6-b259-4e58-9d44-e393d2131acf

living flesh, it can replace your limbs with itself
the conditions for that are; the limb must have 20 or more brute, victim
must be alive and dismemberable, the limb may not be torso or head, or
the limb may not be living flesh
alternatively it can replace a missing limb
these are all checked with every attack
they have 20 hp
the limbs in question will sometimes act up, while passively draining
nutrition, arms will randomly start pulling nearby stuff, legs may step
randomly
limbs when detached, turn into mobs and reactivate AI 2 seconds later.
if the host is shocked, all living flesh limbs will detach, or if the
host dies they will also do that

## Why It's Good For The Game

ruin variety is cool i think
also the other things i added should be useful for other mappers for
bitrunning or whatever

also bug bad for that one fix

[Testmerge Ready] Adds the RB-MK2 Reactor, Makes Tritium buyable from Cargo (#598)

## About The Pull Request


![image](https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/assets/8602857/5985d911-ece0-42b9-b73a-08976488a2af)

This PR adds tritium based nuclear combustion reactors that converts
tritium into power. The reactor itself is only 1 tile in size and you
are expected to build multiple reactors in order to get a good source of
power going. It is currently obtainable by research, and the rods and
machine itself can be printed at the engineering protolathe, It can be
upgraded via stock parts for crazy power generation.

More tritium in a rod means less time to manage it, but it also means
that the rod's pressure can possibly get too high. There is nothing
stopping you from filling it up with other gases to moderate it, such as
freon if you're brave.

The RB-MK2 engine requires a source of cooling, but not too much
cooling, in order to produce a good amount of power. There is a safety
feature to prevent it from running too hot or too overpressured, but
that can be disabled by cutting the safety wire. There are also several
wires to allow for signal based management if you feel so inclined to
add such a thing to the setup.

### Current wire setup:

| Wire | Pulse | Cut | Mend  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overclock | Enables/Disables overclocking | Nothing | Disables
overclocking |
| Activate | Toggles the reactor on/off | Turns reactor off | Turn
reactor on |
| Disable | Turns reactor off | Nothing | Turns reactor off |
| Throw | Ejects the rod, if off | Nothing | Ejects the rod, if off |
| Lockdown | Toggles vents open/closed | Nothing | Turns vents off |
| Safety | Toggles safety on/off | Turns safety off | Turns safety on |
| Limit | Increases the cooling limit percent by 5% | Nothing | Resets
the cooling limit to 0%

### How to Operate

1. Construct the RB-MK2 on a powergrid inside a room with cooling.
1. Fill an RB-MK2 rod with 50 moles of room temperature tritium.
2. Insert the rod into the RB-MK2
3. Wrench the RB-MK2 to turn it on.
4. Let the RB-MK2 run hot, but not too hot to the point where the RB-MK2
rod bursts.
5. If it jams, use a crowbar on it. Or a plunger.
6. If it is too damaged, use a welder on it.
7. ????
8. Profit.

### Tips
- To turn the machine on, insert a rod filled with tritium in the hole
and then wrench it. If you don't have a wrench, you can pulse the
activate wire while the rod is in.
- Rods should be filled up with at most 50 moles of tritium, but more
can be added if you're feeling dangerous.
- You can put other gasses inside a rod if you want said gasses to leak
out during processing.
- The RB-MK2 can be upgraded. Matter bins increase the internal buffer's
volume, servos increase the pressure at which the fans will release gas,
and capacitors will increase the power output of the reactor (this can
result in higher temperature gains) per mole of tritium.
- Overlocking increases tritium consume and gives off more heat, but
provides more power.
- To activate the machine, use a wrench on it. It is considered active
when the rod is all the way down.
- An exposed rod (inactivated machine) is more affected by external
temperatures than an inactive rod. This can sometimes be worse than it
being unexposed if the exterior turf temperature is too hot.
- The machine will only process tritium (and generate power) wile
active.
- Opening the vents (aka disabling lockdown) allows processed gas to
escape out of the buffer and allow exterior temperature to influence the
internal rod temperature.
- Closing the vents will prevent exterior temperature from affecting the
rod, and prevent waste gas from escaping. This is useful for if you want
to increase the temperature by closing the vent or in cases of a chamber
fire.
- Throwing the rod, or removing it manually, prevents the rod from
taking on any more heat/cooling. This does not stop internal reactions,
if there are any inside the rod.
- Increasing the cooling limit will reduce the cooling effect external
air has on the rod. This is useful to increase if your cooling setup
makes the rod too cold to process power effectively.
- There is a safety feature on the machine where if the rod gets too hot
or too overpressured, it will automatically turn off and expose itself
to external air. Disabling safeties is only useful if you want the
machine to blow up, or if you don't want the rod to automatically expose
itself (in case of a chamber fire).
- Goes good with radiation shielding as tritium is a byproduct of
radiation shielding, and radiation shielding requires a lot of power to
function.



## TODO

- [x] Actually make sure it works (it doesn't).
- [x] ~~Introduce liquid reagent cooling mechanics where water puddles
can help with cooling management.~~ Not possible because liquid reagents
are shit.
- [ ] Balance it so it isn't more of a pain in the ass to manage than a
supermatter.
- [x] Maybe add safety features like temperature monitoring and other
stuff so engineers aren't 100% blind.
- [x] Replace Burgerstation default Supermatter setup with this one.
- [x] Testmerge!
- [x] Get feedback from engineer mains.

## Why It's Good For The Game

More sources of funny power is good.

## Changelog

:cl: BurgerBB
add: Adds the RB-MK2 reactor.
add: Makes Tritium buyable from cargo.

Replaces the Reaper Scythe with the Vorpal Scythe (also the Morbid trait) (#75948)

adds the Vorpal Scythe, a special chaplain null rod variant, replacing
the Reaper Scythe, a not so special null rod variant.

When you choose the vorpal scythe, it comes as a shard that you implant
into your arm, similar to a cursed katana.

Once implanted, you can draw it at any time like an arm implant.
However, sheathing it again presents some problems. (Also, implanting
the organ gives you ``TRAIT_MORBID``, which I'll explain in a bit)

The Vorpal Scythe has 10 force, one of the weakest null rod variants for
force that isn't a joke null rod. However, it has exceptional armor pen
and also has 2 tiles of reach. So quite unique.

It also has a special beheading ability when you right-click someone.
This borrows some code from amputation shears, functioning pretty
similarly, except with a few additional ways to speed up the action and
restrictions. (It takes 15 seconds baseline to behead someone standing
and conscious, and speeds up or slows down based on factors such as
incapacitation and whether or not our scythe is already empowered)

When you successfully behead someone with a mind, the vorpal scythe
gains 20 force and can be safely stowed and drawn for 2 minutes.
Performing more death knells like this will reset the timer.

If it has not performed its 'death knell', or you haven't hit a living
mob, then it will cause severe damage to you if you ever try and stow it
(or its forced back into your arm). Just hitting a mob with the scythe
will sate it for 4 minutes. Unless it is a non-player monkey. Horrible
things. Just hitting mobs does not reset the timer on empowerment.

What this means is that the chaplain may be more hesitant to simply draw
their weapon on people. It also means that potentially, the chaplain
will not always have magic immunity, since they may end up stowing the
weapon away and be reluctant to draw it on a whim without either taking
damage for sheathing it without hitting something, or dealing with
having one less hand up until they can.

While empowerment only happens when you behead mobs with a mind,
beheading monkeyhumans and other mindless humans subtypes causes their
heads to become haunted! It's mostly harmless and largely just SpOoKy.
We don't want heads with actual players in them to go floating off to
space. (Does not work on monkey heads for sanity reasons)

When you have the Morbid trait, you think creepy stuff is cool and hate
saving peoples lives. You get a mood boost from graverobbing, autopsies,
dissections, amputations (including beheadings with the scythe and
amputations with the shears) and revival surgery. However, you get a
mood penalty when you tend wounds on the living, as well as a hefty
penalty when you perform CPR or defibrillate someone. I was thinking
Victor Frankenstein when I was choosing which actions had an associated
moodlet, so anything that I might have missed would be appreciated.

You also count as potentially cool with regards to haunted objects.
Ghosts think you're neat. (Revenants probably will still kill you if
they had the chance)

Gun rework (#1601)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
WIP.

if it wasn't obvious, very based off tgmc 

this reworks how guns work, by making them 4x more lethal without
touching a single damage value

its a bit difficult to put into words what this does, so i think these 3
gunfights i did with a good friend explains it better than i ever could

https://streamable.com/09in19
https://streamable.com/yel56o
https://streamable.com/x2a0he

if you didnt watch these videos:
- New guns sounds, TGMC as usual. but some racking sounds are from CEV
eris
- guns now can be wielded, if unwielded, they may cause recoil which not
only makes your shots less accurate, but 'scrolls' your screen
- new suppression effects
- getting hit hard enough scrolls your screen
- anything getting hit shakes you as feedback, not just bullets
- bullets can ricochet naturally upon hitting a surface at a step angle.
does not auto aim at your target, so be careful. ricochet sfx taken from
CEV eris
- new effects for bullet impacts. sound effects were taken from TGMC and
https://github.com/Skyrat-SS13/Skyrat-tg/pull/11697
- adds the cattleman revolver and Himehabu 22lr pistol. sprites by yours
truely

big problem is, in order for all of this to work, a certain key needs to
be binded to rack the gun. by default this is SPACE, but moost already
have it binded to 'hold throw mode', which is an issue. for one, not
only you need to ask everyone to rebind their controls to a very
important key, but also a key dedicated to just racking the gun can
cause issues. im up for any solutions

- [x] I affirm that I have tested all of my proposed changes and that
any issues found during tested have been addressed.

## Why It's Good For The Game

people dont fear gunfights. they think its just a way to pvp. people
should be afraid of gunfights, feel the pain OOCly when their blorbo
gets hit

## Changelog

:cl:
add: 22lr and cattleman revolver

revise `pattern` shorthand

Now that we allow a block before alts, the `pattern` syntax class
clause is redundant and arguably disfavored.  Not only that, it also
ties the meaning of the corresponding (unquote) binding operator to
it.  I think it'd be better that the syntax class clause simply be
removed, and the (unquote) binding operator be changed into an actual
shorthand for an inline syntax class matching.

My experience is that inline syntax classes are quite useful for the
same reason complex patterns in `syntax/parse` are useful, but using
them unfortunately requires an unnaturally large amount of rightward
shift.  Moreover, supplying `open` with inline syntax classes is
common but, again, looks ugly.  Therefore I believe `pattern` can
serve a better purpose this way.

Interestingly, syntax class clause macros originally can supply
spliced patterns through `pattern`.  This use is kept through changing
the expected expansion to a block optionally followed by alts.

A remaining problem is that the handling of repetitions *above* the
quasiquote doesn't seem to cover attributes.  Although this is not
directly related to `pattern` per se, the issue may be apparent when
the `pattern` binding is used in a composite binding form.  Again, the
fix should be generalizable.

Basic Pirate NPCs (#79284)

## About The Pull Request

Converts hostile pirate NPCs to basic mobs - specifically, a subtype of
trooper. As their behavior is not meaningfully distinct from other
troopers, this conversion mostly just sticks them on the existing AI
behavior while keeping the rest the same.

Pirates do have one new thing going for them, though, to differentiate
them from other troopers. They use the new **plundering attacks**
component, which means that every time they land a melee attack, they
steal money from the bank account of whoever they hit. This requires the
target to be wearing an ID with a linked bank account, so it's not the
hardest thing in the world to hide your money from them - but it's still
something to be wary of! If killed, any mob with this component will
drop everything they've stolen in a convenient holochip.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Takes down 5 more simplemobs, and (I think) converts the last remaining
trooper-type enemy to be a basic trooper. (It's possible there's more
I've forgotten that could use the same AI, though.)

The money-stealing behavior is mostly good because I think it's funny,
but it also makes the pirates something a little distinct from "yet
another mob that runs at you and punches you until you die". They still
do that, but now there's a little twist! This can be placed on other
mobs too, if we want to make any other sorts of thieves or brigands.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Pirate NPCs now use the basic mob framework. They'll be a
little smarter in combat, and if you're wearing your ID they'll siphon
your bank account with every melee attack! Beware! Please report any
bugs.

[CI Fix] The Demonic Frost-Miner will not attack corpses. (#79294)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #79147.

Prevents the Demonic Frost-Miner from shooting at corpses by returning
early from `OpenFire()`. Also adds the "gutted" status effect to the
corpses in its arena so it won't try to gut them.
## Why It's Good For The Game

#78826 introduced an unfortunate bug by placing corpses in the Frost
Miner's arena. There were a combination of three factors at play here:
that the Miner attacks corpses, that it happens to use colossus bolts in
its attacks, which dust corpses, and that some unfortunate quirk of life
code causes runtimes if, as far as I can tell, a life tick goes off when
a mob is at the wrong point in the dusting process. The time this
process takes happened to perfectly coincide with the Monkey Business
unit test (being the first test that takes a significant period of
time), causing it to randomly fail.

So, this fixes a flaky test that has been a pain in the ass for the last
five days, is the big thing.

Also, it can't possibly have been intended for the Miner to run around
obliterating the aesthetic corpses in its arena within the first 15
seconds of any given round. Completely ruining the mood!

I'll point out that this particular boss may have been forgotten in
#77731, which set out to make only the colossus still gib/dust you, but
even were that not the case I think it would be a bit silly for the
Miner to be busy shooting lifeless corpses when a player shows up to
challenge it, rather than standing in its scary ritual circle.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: The Demonic Frost-Miner will no longer run around destroying the
corpses in its arena the moment the round begins.

Animates nav pane in and out.

This was tricky to get right, but I think it's in a good state. A couple key learnings here:
1. `transition` feels easier to use than `@keyframes` because it automatically supports animating in and out of a state without needing a second keyframe or attempting to run an existing one backwards.
2. `transition` doesn't appear to trigger on page load which is very nice.
3. I initially tried animating the nav pane to `width: 0;`, but getting everything else to lay out correctly was difficult. Turns out animating `grid-template-columns` is supported and works very smoothly.
4. You cannot animate `grid-template-columns` into/out of `auto`, which is very frustrating. I decided to hard-code 300px as the nav pane width (previously the `max-width`), which I'm not a fan of. However given that the nav pane will have a static set of items, I think this is a constraint I can live with.
5. `grid-template-columns` is very strict on its units for animations. You cannot animate from `0` to `1fr`, but you can animate from `0fr` to `1fr`. https://theadhocracy.co.uk/wrote/the-trick-to-animating-grid-columns
6. More annoying, the `>` expando would line-wrap as the nav pane shrunk. This was very difficult to prevent because it is a unique element (not text in an existing element I could put `white-space: nowrap;` on). My workaround was to set the hard-coded width `300px` on the text container (the button) and apply `overflow-x: hidden;`. The fixed width means that as the scroll bar shrinks, the button actually does not, so the `>` character never needs to line wrap. It's hacky for sure, but we need the `overflow-x: hidden;` anyways, so it's not that big a deal.

Create Watermelon

QUESTION:
On one hot summer day, Peter and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. In their opinion, they chose the biggest and the ripest one. After that, the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry. However, they faced a hard problem.

Peter and Billy are great fans of even numbers. That's why they wanted to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. But the difference between the 2 parts should be minimal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible. That's why you should help them and find out if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

 

INPUT FORMAT:

The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

If the input value is not within the range, print "Invalid Input".
In the first line of the output, print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.
If the first line of the output is YES, the next line of the output consists of 2 integers separated by a space. In the case of distinct integers, the smallest number should appear first.
[Text in bold represents the output].

Create Insomnia cure

QUESTION:
"One dragon. Two dragon. Three dragon", — the princess was counting. She had trouble in falling asleep, and she got bored of counting lambs when she was nine.

However, just counting dragons was boring as well, so she entertained herself at best she could. Tonight she imagined that all dragons were here to steal her, and she was fighting them off. Every k-th dragon got punched in the face with a frying pan. Every l-th dragon got his tail shut into the balcony door. Every m-th dragon got his paws trampled with sharp heels. Finally, she threatened every n-th dragon to call her mom, and he withdrew in panic.

Write a program to find how many imaginary dragons suffered moral or physical damage tonight, if the princess counted a total of d dragons?



INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Basic blob mobs (#78520)

## About The Pull Request

I remembered today that blob code is ass, especially blob spores.
There's still a lot to improve but I cleaned up _some_ of it by
converting these mobs.
Now they use a newer framework and more signal handling as compared to
circular references.

I _expect_ the behaviour here to largely be the same as it was or
similar. I haven't added anything fancy or new.

This is a reasonably big PR but at least all of the files are small?
Everything here touched every other thing enough that it didnt make
sense to split up sorry.

Other things I did in code:
- Experimented with replacing the `mob/blob` subtype with a component.
Don't know if this is genius or stupid.
- AI subtree which just walks somewhere. We've used this behaviour a lot
but never given it its own subtree.
- Blob Spores and Zombies are two different mobs now instead of being
one mob which just changes every single one of its properties.
- Made a few living defence procs call super, because the only thing
super does was send a signal and we weren't doing that for no reason.
Also added a couple extra signals for intercepts we did not have.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Blob spores will respond to rallies more reliably (it won't runtime
every time they try and pathfind).
fix: Blobbernaut pain animation overlays should align with the direction
the mob is facing instead of always facing South
refactor: Blob spores, zombies, and blobbernauts now all use the basic
mob framework. They should work the same, but please report any issues.

Scatter laser shells now use the scatter laser beam, and makes them significantly easier to make. Projectiles can now have damage falloff. (#78927)

## About The Pull Request

Allows for damage falloff to apply to more than just shotgun pellets.
Now any projectile can have a damage falloff defined.

Scatter Laser shells no longer use the minigun beams to determine their
damage. Instead they use the actually defined scatter laser beams. Those
beams do 7.5 damage per pellet, times by 6 pellets.

Scatter laser beams now have damage falloff, a separately defined
(positive) wounding power from normal beams, and wound falloff.

Scatter laser shells can be printed from security protolathes once you
have weapon tech.

Scatter laser shells _may_ be damaged by EMPs based on severity. The
result is that it fires a practically useless volley of laser fire. They
cause a honk sound when they hit, so you know when you've shot one of
these.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Well, we want shotguns universally to not be defined by their damage
output (especially extreme damage output) but by niche.

What does the scatter laser shell currently occupy as a niche?

The single highest damage output of any projectile weapon in direct
damage. The thing we don't want of shotguns, and it is reigning champion
of all guns.

Okay, that's a bit misleading, because obviously it is competing with
the likes of .50 BMG which does 70 damage outright and dismembers limbs,
potentially doing upwards of 90 damage if it does, and also hard stuns
people. Obviously _that_ is technically a stronger bullet.

But not for raw damage, because the scatter laser does 90 damage out the
gate, barring any potential wounding that might occur which increases
the damage multiplicatively. No gimmicks, no extra procs, nothing. It's
just 15 force lasers (with no damage dropoff) split between 6 beams.

And the reason for this is because this shell has been nerfed once prior
by making it not fire 6 normal laser shots into someone. That was 120
damage at the time, 120 to 90 was...I guess a nerf during the taser era.
Depends on how you viewed it. Buckshot was doing like 80 at the time,
believe me it was a wild period. But anyway, when we did the whole
damage rearrangement over the course of the laser few years, every other
shell got touched except this one for some reason. Even pulse slugs lost
10 damage while this was still sitting on 90 force point blank.

So what is the new niche? Well, it's laser buckshot. That's not a niche
but crew don't get buckshot, so this is their buckshot. It wounds real
good. Real goddamn good. And its is a laser. It fits the aesthetic,
obviously.

Okay, thanks.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Scatter laser shells actually utilize the _real_ scatter laser
beam. This comes with damage changes. And wounding power.
feature: EMPs can potentially damage scatter laser shells.
refactor: All projectiles can now have damage falloff defined. Yay.
balance: Scatter laser shells can be printed when weapons technology is
researched.

Allows for someone to get between 1-infinity omen accidents. Seriously
why wasnt this a thing before

> qol: Reduces omen bad luck if nobody's nearby.

I LOVE this quirk, but trying to do antything at all except 'Suffer
Miserably' is nigh impossible. To alleviate life a little, making it so
that you have a lesser chance of suffering misfortune if nobody's around
will be the perfect compromise. It makes life easier but doesn't
compromise funny moments.

Any client in viewrange will disable the reduction. This includes
ghosts.

Shapechange health transfer tweaks (#79009)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #78721
This PR does a handful of things behind the scenes to increase the
consistency of shapechange health tracking.

First of all we adjust the order of operations taken when you restore
the original body. The implementation as-was would remove the status
effect midway through and null a bunch of variables we tried to continue
using. This would result in several runtimes and code failing to run,
with the upshot that untransforming upon death would leave the caster
completely alive, with the corpse of its transformed shape at its feet.
Oops.

Additionally while testing this I realised that transferring the damagew
as also kind of fucked.
We wouldn't bother to do it at _all_ if you died, which is a shame, so I
made it simply heal you instead of reviving you so we can always do it.
Then as noted in the linked issue, we were applying all transferred
damage to a single limb, which could exceed the health of the limb and
remove damage. Now we spread it around the body.

Finally, applying damage to a human using the "force" flag would often
actually apply less damage to their _health_ than expected. This is
because arms and legs contribute only 75% of their damage taken to a
mob's overall health.
Now instead of reading `health` we read `total damage` which ignores the
limb damage modifier.

The end result of this is that if you transform into a corgi, take 50%
of your health, and transform back then you will have 50% of your health
as a human.
Previously the result would be that you'd have ~63%, then transforming
into a corgi would leave you with ~63% of a corgi's health, then
transforming back into a human would leave you at about 71%... and so on
and so forth. Now it doesn't do that.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Dying when using (most) shapeshift spells will now kill you rather
than having you pop out of the corpse of your previous form.
fix: Damage will now be accurately carried between forms rather than
being slightly reduced upon each transformation.

Create Boy or Girl

QUESTION:
Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that, they talked very often and eventually, they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise, she is a female. You are given a string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.



INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase letters, which corresponds to the user name. This string contains at most 50 letters.
Output is If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).
Refer to the sample input and output for formatting details.
Text in bold represents the output.
SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 1:
xiaodao
IGNORE HIM!
SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 2:
sevenkplus
CHAT WITH HER!

[MIRROR] ArCargo: Adds the Galactic Materials Stock Market V1.2 (Free Market Edition) [MDB IGNORE] (#24038)

* ArCargo: Adds the Galactic Materials Stock Market V1.2 (Free Market Edition) (#78500)

## About The Pull Request

**This PR is a rerelease of #78164, with some bells and whistles.** As
such, most of the core functionality is the same, but with some tweaks
to balance the gameplay and prevent bike levels of profit. I've tried to
bold the new additions to make it easier to read for those coming back
for the second pass.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/41715314/ff9bf038-524d-44fc-81bb-c6ff97fef6dd)
This PR adds a new machine that can be bought called the **Galactic
Mineral Market** (GMM). The Galactic Mineral Market (GMM) allows you to
buy and sell minerals wholesale from the market machine. It goes
something like this:

### 1. Getting the Machine:
The GMM can be bought as an un-assembled machine for 600 credits from
cargo. It's a low cost, but its not mapped in standard, so if you're
confident in your miners, you shouldn't necessarily need one for the
department. Otherwise, it's available for other crewmembers to buy for
cost.

The cargo pack comes will all supplies necessary to finish the machine.
Tools not included.

### 2. Buying Low
Using the machine's UI, you can see all traded minerals and their
associated prices. Buy prices are played straight, and can be bought for
material price, times the quantity. The order is then instantly placed
on the cargo shuttle, and will be deducted from the buyer's account on
shuttle send. **A single order can only have 10 different stacks of
materials in it. So, that can be 100 sheets of iron and 1 of everything
else, or 500 sheets of iron. After that you're blocked from buying more
sheets until you've sent the order.**

Cargo staff with standard cargo access may toggle the machine to order
directly from the cargo budget. Otherwise, materials are only purchased
from private accounts.

All purchases are treated as private and must be opened by the recipient
like private orders.

### 3. Selling High

It's stocks time. To sell minerals on the market, simply insert any
relevant metal stock into the machine. This produces a totally original
and not-a-bounty-cube stock block, which can be sold on the cargo
shuttle for cargo funds. Stock blocks can also be price-tagged as well
following their standard process.

**Stock blocks start out a bright pink and are worth the value of that
material at that time, but over time their color will degrade. After a
full 5 minutes, stock blocks will switch over to a purple hue, and their
value will once again become liquid, subject to the current market
value. This encourages players to be a bit more fast on their feet than
before instead of just waiting forever for all of their investments to
arrive at the perfect value, before the inevitable "rest of the game"
tries to upend your investing.**

Sold cargo stocks are subject at a 20% processing fee as part of the
galactic mineral market.
### 4. Outside Factors

**In-game events like the Crab-17 or the Market crash event will cause
stocks to bottom out completely, and for the market to become
unavailable until the market stabilizes. Thankfully, once the market has
crashed, typically stocks will recovery and gain back some value,
allowing for fast acting market movers to capitalize on rough markets.**

**Additionally, low value materials like iron and glass have an extra
stipulation, as their value goes all the way down to 0 credits. In that
case, you are unable to buy them at that value as a market protection.
Be careful that you don't see a reset or crash when you're planning on
selling your horde of iron and glass stocks!**

Additionally, market events can occur during the round that can more
sharply adjust a single stock's price and completely rebound it's
trajectory. These events are always mentioned in the station
announcement's economics report.

### Other notes:
The market does not cover all minerals, partially for consistency
purposes as well as for balance reasons. Plasma, being a unique material
that only Nanotrasen has their hands on, is the sole exporter of plasma
in the system, so it stands to reason that it's not on the market, and
remains a solo export. Bananium, as it has a rare and expensive
conversion rate, works the opposite way, and as such isn't listed on the
market either, with the sole source being single cargo sales. All others
just don't make much sense to include into the market at this second, so
I left them out for now.

**Alright now below I'm going to cover the math and shit so if that's
not what you care about then please scroll past.**
<details>
  <summary>Warning: Arcane is about to talk about the math</summary>
Alright.
So this adds a new stock_market subsystem, which fires once every 20
seconds. I'm still fairly new to subsystem design so I'm probably going
to need some feedback on cleaning this up to make it look nicer and run
smoother.

So we have 4 associated lists, each attached to the relevant traded
datum; this tracks prices, market trends, how long that trend is going
to last in SS fires, and market quantity.

Prices fluctuate between 0.5x and 3x the material's single sheet value.
This could be tweaked even farther in the future, but for now I'm
keeping it at this nice clean margin. Prices fluctuate based on a
gaussian normal distribution that is centered on different points based
on their **trend**. Upward trending materials are centered in such a way
that they'll almost certainly go upwards, but being that it's based on a
random chance, not always. Vis versa, downward trends should tend to
lose value at about the same rate. We also change our rounding based on
this trend data, in order to prevent low price values like iron and
glass from getting stuck in the same value or freefall drop over time
just because of rounding down. Similarly, neutral trending materials
will not change nearly as much, and will generally stay at around the
same amount.

When buying or selling a material, the quantity of that material will
change on the market. The magnitude of that change depends on how much
of that material currently exists on the market. Buying a low quantity
material like diamond for example will tangibly increase that material's
cost, while buying stacks and stacks of iron and glass won't do much
damage to the price of iron as there's usually around 500 full stacks on
the market to start with. It's applied at a relative percentage of
(qty_changed / new_total_on_market) * price of goods bought/sold at.

In addition to that, there are random "market events" that can occur
randomly, which you might miss if you don't follow the newscaster
economy news. These three events are fairly barebones now, but in
general they have a 1% chance of happening per material, and can more
dramatically increase, decrease, or fully reset the value of a material
on the market back to it's standard value. This opens up for doing more
with it in the future, but that's a later problem.
</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game

This independently resolves some issues related to #78040, that being
that lowpop stations, or shifts with few miners would have a new way to
be able to still get some access to minerals in a given round. This also
provides a unique minigame and alternative way to acquire money in a
given shift, using minerals.

**"But Arcane,** I hear you ask. **"Isn't this just the same thing you
tried doing way back when and then reverted in #50537?**
Well, fuck man, how you doing I haven't see you around in forever also
no you're completely wrong and here's why

**This PR is no longer contingent on the rest of ArcMining in it's
current iteration.** I have introduced some extra factors into the
gameplay as well to try and curb the creation of bikes within gameplay.
This also provides a massive benefit to round progression and gives the
QM and the cargo members the ability to prevent round progress from
stalling by buying round-critical resources.

Not to mention, as the GMM is not cargo required, more cargo integrated,
it also functions as economy content for the rest of the crew.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: A new export has arrived in the imports section, the Galactic
Materials Market! You can use this to buy and sell minerals for profit
or cost, as well as stock your station when you don't have any miners.
add: Insert sheets of minerals into the Galactic Materials Market to
convert them into a stock block, allowing you to lock in your price for
5 minutes. Wait too long and it'll be subject to market value again!
add: Minerals can be bought on the market either using the station's
cargo budget by cargo crew, or privately by everyone else.
del: Any material stacks that can be bought and sold on the market
before have been removed from the cargo catalog.

FROMGIT: bpf: Do not change gso_size during bpf_skb_change_proto()

This is technically a backwards incompatible change in behaviour, but I'm
going to argue that it is very unlikely to break things, and likely to fix
*far* more then it breaks.

In no particular order, various reasons follow:

(a) I've long had a bug assigned to myself to debug a super rare kernel crash
on Android Pixel phones which can (per stacktrace) be traced back to BPF clat
IPv6 to IPv4 protocol conversion causing some sort of ugly failure much later
on during transmit deep in the GSO engine, AFAICT precisely because of this
change to gso_size, though I've never been able to manually reproduce it. I
believe it may be related to the particular network offload support of attached
USB ethernet dongle being used for tethering off of an IPv6-only cellular
connection. The reason might be we end up with more segments than max permitted,
or with a GSO packet with only one segment... (either way we break some
assumption and hit a BUG_ON)

(b) There is no check that the gso_size is > 20 when reducing it by 20, so we
might end up with a negative (or underflowing) gso_size or a gso_size of 0.
This can't possibly be good. Indeed this is probably somehow exploitable (or
at least can result in a kernel crash) by delivering crafted packets and perhaps
triggering an infinite loop or a divide by zero... As a reminder: gso_size (MSS)
is related to MTU, but not directly derived from it: gso_size/MSS may be
significantly smaller then one would get by deriving from local MTU. And on
some NICs (which do loose MTU checking on receive, it may even potentially be
larger, for example my work pc with 1500 MTU can receive 1520 byte frames [and
sometimes does due to bugs in a vendor plat46 implementation]). Indeed even just
going from 21 to 1 is potentially problematic because it increases the number
of segments by a factor of 21 (think DoS, or some other crash due to too many
segments).

(c) It's always safe to not increase the gso_size, because it doesn't result in
the max packet size increasing.  So the skb_increase_gso_size() call was always
unnecessary for correctness (and outright undesirable, see later). As such the
only part which is potentially dangerous (ie. could cause backwards compatibility
issues) is the removal of the skb_decrease_gso_size() call.

(d) If the packets are ultimately destined to the local device, then there is
absolutely no benefit to playing around with gso_size. It only matters if the
packets will egress the device. ie. we're either forwarding, or transmitting
from the device.

(e) This logic only triggers for packets which are GSO. It does not trigger for
skbs which are not GSO. It will not convert a non-GSO MTU sized packet into a
GSO packet (and you don't even know what the MTU is, so you can't even fix it).
As such your transmit path must *already* be able to handle an MTU 20 bytes
larger then your receive path (for IPv4 to IPv6 translation) - and indeed 28
bytes larger due to IPv4 fragments. Thus removing the skb_decrease_gso_size()
call doesn't actually increase the size of the packets your transmit side must
be able to handle. ie. to handle non-GSO max-MTU packets, the IPv4/IPv6 device/
route MTUs must already be set correctly. Since for example with an IPv4 egress
MTU of 1500, IPv4 to IPv6 translation will already build 1520 byte IPv6 frames,
so you need a 1520 byte device MTU. This means if your IPv6 device's egress
MTU is 1280, your IPv4 route must be 1260 (and actually 1252, because of the
need to handle fragments). This is to handle normal non-GSO packets. Thus the
reduction is simply not needed for GSO packets, because when they're correctly
built, they will already be the right size.

(f) TSO/GSO should be able to exactly undo GRO: the number of packets (TCP
segments) should not be modified, so that TCP's MSS counting works correctly
(this matters for congestion control). If protocol conversion changes the
gso_size, then the number of TCP segments may increase or decrease. Packet loss
after protocol conversion can result in partial loss of MSS segments that the
sender sent. How's the sending TCP stack going to react to receiving ACKs/SACKs
in the middle of the segments it sent?

(g) skb_{decrease,increase}_gso_size() are already no-ops for GSO_BY_FRAGS
case (besides triggering WARN_ON_ONCE). This means you already cannot guarantee
that gso_size (and thus resulting packet MTU) is changed. ie. you must assume
it won't be changed.

(h) changing gso_size is outright buggy for UDP GSO packets, where framing
matters (I believe that's also the case for SCTP, but it's already excluded
by [g]).  So the only remaining case is TCP, which also doesn't want it
(see [f]).

(i) see also the reasoning on the previous attempt at fixing this
(commit fa7b83bf3b156c767f3e4a25bbf3817b08f3ff8e) which shows that the current
behaviour causes TCP packet loss:

  In the forwarding path GRO -> BPF 6 to 4 -> GSO for TCP traffic, the
  coalesced packet payload can be > MSS, but < MSS + 20.

  bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4() will upgrade the MSS and it can be > the payload
  length. After then tcp_gso_segment checks for the payload length if it
  is <= MSS. The condition is causing the packet to be dropped.

  tcp_gso_segment():
    [...]
    mss = skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size;
    if (unlikely(skb->len <= mss)) goto out;
    [...]

Thus changing the gso_size is simply a very bad idea. Increasing is unnecessary
and buggy, and decreasing can go negative.

storagetm: add new systemd-storagetm component

This implements a "storage target mode", similar to what MacOS provides
since a long time as "Target Disk Mode":

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Disk_Mode

This implementation is relatively simple:

1. a new generic target "storage-target-mode.target" is added, which
   when booted into defines the target mode.

2. a small tool and service "systemd-storagetm.service" is added which
   exposes a specific device or all devices as NVMe-TCP devices over the
   network.  NVMe-TCP appears to be hot shit right now how to expose
   block devices over the network. And it's really simple to set up via
   configs, hence our code is relatively short and neat.

The idea is that systemd-storagetm.target can be extended sooner or
later, for example to expose block devices also as USB mass storage
devices and similar, in case the system has "dual mode" USB controller
that can also work as device, not just as host. (And people could also
plug in sharing as NBD, iSCSI, whatever they want.)

How to use this? Boot into your system with a kernel cmdline of
"rd.systemd.unit=storage-target-mode.target ip=link-local", and you'll see on
screen the precise "nvme connect" command line to make the relevant
block devices available locally on some other machine. This all requires
that the target mode stuff is included in the initrd of course. And the
system will the stay in the initrd forever.

Why bother? Primarily three use-cases:

1. Debug a broken system: with very few dependencies during boot get
   access to the raw block device of a broken machine.

2. Migrate from system to another system, by dd'ing the old to the new
   directly.

3. Installing an OS remotely on some device (for example via Thunderbolt
   networking)

(And there might be more, for example the ability to boot from a
laptop's disk on another system)

Limitations:

1. There's no authentication/encryption. Hence: use this on local links
   only.

2. NVMe target mode on Linux supports r/w operation only. Ideally, we'd
   have a read-only mode, for security reasons, and default to it.

Future love:

1. We should have another mode, where we simply expose the homed LUKS
   home dirs like that.

2. Some lightweight hookup with plymouth, to display a (shortened)
   version of the info we write to the console.

To test all this, just run:

    mkosi --kernel-command-line-extra="rd.systemd.unit=storage-target-mode.target" qemu

Dynamic Dual-Wielding, New Armor, Balance Changes

	- Added a new armor set: Twisted Fuck Armor, crafted with bones.
	- Added dynamic dual-wielding for all one-handed (non-spear) weapons. You can only combine thrust-only weapons (i.e. rapiers) with weapons that can thrust, the same goes for slash-only weapons (i.e. axes). (NOTE: attachments are likely to still be broken for some weapons)
	- Added logging for opening or lockpicking passworded containers.
	- Admins can now interact with Gore longships even if they aren't Gores.
	- At least one cause of inventory lag has been fixed, though it's likely some other causes remain.
	- Broken items on the ground are no longer saved.
	- Children of Satan locked armors can now be equipped by Faith of the Dark Wanderers.
	- Clan Shagalax can now utilize and craft scrap armor and some scrap weaponry.
	- Fixed /enlist not working for Kinisgers.
	- Fixed at least one potential cause for invisible weapons. It's possible that there are more causes, but that remains to be seen.
	- Fix for broken dynamic lights (and thus broken Gore char creation) due to a gmod update.
	- Fix for occasional wrong holdtypes on shielded weapons.
	- Fixed Grockling Rattleshirt Armor needing to be melted down at a forge, it can now be broken down with a breakdown kit.
	- Fixed lua error when unequipping shields due to the recent use sound change.
	- Fixed potential lua error in the Kinisger ritual menu when trying to select the Wanderer faction as the default appearance change faction.
	- Fixed Primevalist poison's damage being reduced by armor.
	- Fixed scrap shield backpack attachment offset.
	- Fixed the 'Bladermaster' belief buffing two-handed weapons when it's not supposed to.
	- Fixed the inventory menu showing Wanderer clothes for disguised Kinisger Gores with no clothes item equipped.
	- Fixed thrall NPCs ignoring ragdolled players due to a lua error.
	- HasBelief function now accepts tables of beliefs along with an optional HasAny argument to determine if only one is required or all.
	- Hatred now takes 1.5x as much received damage to fill.
	- Improved detection for if a player is on a longship to prevent players not on board being teleported by mistake. This may also fix bugs with players being left behind when the longship teleports.
	- Javelins now play a different sound for impacting players.
	- Kinisgers can no longer disguise as Gatekeepers and must instead be /enlisted.
	- Nerfed the 'Soulscorch' ritual: its damage now scales with sacrament level up to level 40, it now damages FoTL characters at half the damage, and it now requires a direct line of sight to each target to do damage.
	- Other balance changes (see gabs' commits).
	- Players onboard longships now receive godmode during the transition sequence while they are frozen.
	- Removed old dual wield weapons and crafting recipes. If you're playing on a server and had those items, ask an admin for a refund or something.
	- Reduced the damage bonus from the 'Fanaticism' belief from 60% to 40% and the speed bonus from 'Purity Afloat' from 20% to 15%.
	- Senses now fades in from black instead of fading in from white.
	- Sol Orthodoxists can now equip dual weapons with the 'Repentant' belief.
	- The 'Summon Demon' ritual now summons a blade arm thrall instead of a chainsaw thrall.
	- The 'Yellow Banner of Quelling' ritual now uncloaks characters within talking radius.
	- Updated the 'Reaver Despoiler' salesman to sell refurbished blood test kits at a highly marked up price. These (and regular blood test kits) can be used to detect Kinisgers if they turn green.

Refactor & make base64 functions browser-safe

We had two identical sets of base64 functions in the js-sdk, both
using Buffer which isn't really available in the browser unless you're
using an old webpack (ie. what element-web uses). This PR:

 * Takes the crypto base64 file and moves it out of crypto (because
   we use base64 for much more than just crypto)
 * Makes them work in a browser without the Buffer global
 * Removes the other base64 functions
 * Changes everything to use the new common ones
 * Adds a comment explaining why the function is kinda ugly and how
   soul destroyingly awful the JS ecosystem is.
 * Runs the tests with both impls
 * Changes the test to not just test the decoder against the encoder
 * Adds explicit support & tests for (decoding) base64Url (I'll add an

API: Allow comparisons with and between any python integers

This implements comparisons between NumPy integer arrays and arbitrary valued
Python integers when weak promotion is enabled.

To achieve this:
* I allow abstract DTypes (with small bug fixes) to register as loops (`ArrayMethods`).
  This is fine, you just need to take more care.
  It does muddy the waters between promotion and not a bit if the
  result DType would also be abstract.
  (For the specific case it doesn't, but in general it does.)
* A new `resolve_descriptors_raw` function, which does the same job as
  `resolve_descriptors` but I pass it this scalar argument
  (can be expanded, but starting small).
  * This only happens *when available*, so there are some niche paths were this cannot
    be used (`ufunc.at` and the explicit resolution function right now),
    we can deal with those by keeping the previous rules (things will just raise
    trying to convert).
  * The function also gets the actual `arrays.dtype` instances while I normally ensure that
    we pass in dtypes already cast to the correct DType class.
    (The reason is that we don't define how to cast the abstract DTypes as of now,
    and even if we did, it would not be what we need unless the dtype instance actually had
    the value information.)
* There are new loops added (for combinations!), which:
  * Use the new `resolve_descriptors_raw` (a single function dealing with everything)
  * Return the current legacy loop when that makes sense.
  * Return an always true/false loop when that makes sense.
  * To achieve this, they employ a hack/trick: `get_loop()` needs to know the value,
    but only `resolve_descriptors_raw()` does right now, so this is encoded on whether we use
    the `np.dtype("object")` singleton or a fresh instance!
    (Yes, probably ugly, but avoids channeling things to more places.)

Additionally, there is a promoter to say that Python integer comparisons can just use
`object` dtype (in theory weird if the input then wasn't a Python int,
but that is breaking promises).

17.1 Entities, DTO's & The "Central" Object

 This entity class thing seems almost too good to be true. It gives us all the flexibility, in theory, of a custom class, while reusing all the core Doctrine provider and processor logic. But hold your horses because there are two, albeit fixable, snags.

 Most importantly, we're not allowed to have custom property names. This will cause an error when it tries to serialize. Second, I haven't mentioned it yet, but write operations - like POST or PATCH - don't work at all. Well... if we, posted to our endpoint, the data would be deserialized... but it wouldn't be saved to the database.

 The Problem with Write Operations
 - We can try this because we already have a test for it. Open UserResourceTest and, down here, copy testPostToCreateUser(). Spin over and run that with:

  symfony php bin/phpunit --filter=testPostToCreateUser
 And... 400 error! Open that up. Uh oh:

 Unable to generate an IRI for the item of type App\ApiResource\UserApi.

 Here's what happens. The serializer deserializes this JSON into a UserApi object. Yay! That UserApi object is then passed to the core Doctrine persist processor: the thing that normally saves entities to the database. But because UserApi is not an entity, that processor does... nothing. Then, when UserApi is serialized back to JSON, the $id is still null - because nothing was ever saved to the database - and... so the IRI can't be generated for it.

 We could fix this by creating a custom state processor for UserApi that saves this to the database. But even if we did, the write operations, like POST and PATCH, just aren't designed to work out of the box with this entityClass solution. The reason... is a bit technical, but important.

 Understanding the "Central Object" for an Operation
 - Internally, for every API request, API Platform has a central object that it's working on. If we fetch a single item, that central object is that single item. And that's really important. It's used in various places, like the security attribute: when we use is_granted, the object variable will be that "central" object. For example, if we make a Patch() request, that means we're editing a dragon treasure... so the central object will be a DragonTreasure entity. Easy peasy!

 What's the catch? Well, when you use the entityClass solution with a read operation (so, one of these GET requests), the central object will be the entity. So the User entity will be the central object. But with a write operation (most importantly, the POST operation to create a new user), that central object will suddenly be a UserApi object. That causes some serious inconsistency: the central object will sometimes be an entity... and other times the DTO. Good luck making a security system that works with both of those... and isn't completely confusing.

 Also, when the User entity is the central object, that's when we run into the problem that prevents us from having custom fields on our DTO.

 So, if we could make the UserApi be the central object in all cases, then we'd have consistent security... and we could also fix our big custom properties problem.

 How can we pull that off? By writing a custom state provider that returns UserApi objects. Think about it: because the core Doctrine collection provider returns User entity objects, those become the central objects. If we, instead, return UserDto objects, problem solved. If this doesn't all make sense yet, I'm not surprised. Let's walk through this step-by-step.

 Decorating the Core State Provider
 - Start by running:

  php bin/console make:state-provider
 Call it EntityToDtoStateProvider. My goal is to create a generic state provider that will work for all cases where we have an API resource class that pulls data from an entity. So, we'll mostly keep user-specific code out of here.

 Over in UserApi, set provider to EntityToDtoStateProvider.

#### Wednesday 2023-11-01 11:06:17 by Petre Ro

20.4 Our job in the state processor is simple but important: to convert this UserApi back to a User entity so that we can save it. Say assert($data instanceof UserApi) and, inside, $entity = set to a new helper function: $this->mapDtoToEntity($data). Below, dd($entity).

 Then go add that new private function mapDtoToEntity(), which will accept an object $dto argument and return another object.

 Again, we know this will really accept a UserApi object and return a User entity... but we're trying to keep this class generic so we can reuse it later. Though we are going to have some user-specific code down here temporarily. In fact, to help our editor, add another assert($dto instanceof UserApi).

 Querying for the Existing Entity
 - We need to think about two different cases. The first is when we POST to create a brand-new user. In that case, $dto will have a null id. And that means we should create a fresh User object. The other case is if we were making, for example, a PATCH request to edit a user. In that case, the item provider will first load that User entity from the database... our provider will turn that into a UserApi object with id equal to 6... and that will eventually be passed to us here. If the id is 6... we don't want to create a new User object: we want to query the database for tha existing User. Our job is to handle both situations.

 Now, if $dto->id, we need to query for an existing User. To do that, on top, add a constructor with private UserRepository $userRepository.

 Back down here, say $entity = $this->userRepository->find($dto->id).

 If we don't find that User, throw a big giant exception that will trigger a 500 error with Entity %d not found.

 You might be wondering:

  Shouldn't this trigger a 404 error instead?

 The answer, in this case, is no. If we're in this situation, it means the item state provider has already successfully queried for a User with this id. So there should be no way for us to suddenly not find it. There are some exceptions to this, like if you allowed your user to change their id... or if you allowed users to create brand-new objects and set the id manually... but for most situations, including ours, if this happens, something went weird.

 Next up, if we don't have an id, say $entity = new User().

 Done! In both cases, down here, we're going to map the $dto object to the $entity object. This code is boring... so I'll speed through this. For the password, put a TODO temporarily because we still need to hash that. Also add a TODO for handle dragon treasures. Just focus on the easy stuff... and at the bottom, return $entity.

 If we've done things correctly, we'll take the UserApi, transform that into an $entity and dump it. Rerun the test:

  symfony php bin/phpunit --filter=testPostToCreateUser
 And... 404! Let's see what happened here. Oh... of course. I never put my test back together. This should be ->post('/api/users'). Try that again and... got it! There's our User entity object with the email and username transferred correctly!

 Next: Let's save this by leveraging the core Doctrine PersistProcessor and RemoveProcessor. We'll also handle hashing the password. By the end, our user tests will be passing with flying colors.

Rewrite ecosystem checks and add `ruff format` reports (#8223)

Closes #7239 

- Refactors `scripts/check_ecosystem.py` into a new Python project at
`python/ruff-ecosystem`
- Includes
[documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/zanie/ecosystem-format/python/ruff-ecosystem/README.md)
now
    - Provides a `ruff-ecosystem` CLI
- Fixes bug where `ruff check` report included "fixable" summary line
- Adds truncation to `ruff check` reports
    - Otherwise we often won't see the `ruff format` reports
- The truncation uses some very simple heuristics and could be improved
in the future
- Identifies diagnostic changes that occur just because a violation's
fix available changes
- We still show the diff for the line because it's could matter _where_
this changes, but we could improve this
- Similarly, we could improve detection of diagnostic changes where just
the message changes
- Adds support for JSON ecosystem check output
    - I added this primarily for development purposes
- If there are no changes, only errors while processing projects, we
display a different summary message
- When caching repositories, we now checkout the requested ref
- Adds `ruff format` reports, which format with the baseline then the
use `format --diff` to generate a report
- Runs all CI jobs when the CI workflow is changed

## Known problems

- Since we must format the project to get a baseline, the permalink line
numbers do not exactly correspond to the correct range
- This looks... hard. I tried using `git diff` and some wonky hunk
matching to recover the original line numbers but it doesn't seem worth
it. I think we should probably commit the formatted changes to a fork or
something if we want great results here. Consequently, I've just used
the start line instead of a range for now.
- I don't love the comment structure — it'd be nice, perhaps, to have
separate headings for the linter and formatter.
- However, the `pr-comment` workflow is an absolute pain to change
because it runs _separately_ from this pull request so I if I want to
make edits to it I can only test it via manual workflow dispatch.
- Lines are not printed "as we go" which means they're all held in
memory, presumably this would be a problem for large-scale ecosystem
checks
- We are encountering a hard limit with the maximum comment length
supported by GitHub. We will need to move the bulk of the report
elsewhere.

## Future work

- Update `ruff-ecosystem` to support non-default projects and
`check_ecosystem_all.py` behavior
- Remove existing ecosystem check scripts
- Add preview mode toggle (#8076)
- Add a toggle for truncation
- Add hints for quick reproduction of runs locally
- Consider parsing JSON output of Ruff instead of using regex to parse
the text output
- Links to project repositories should use the commit hash we checked
against
- When caching repositories, we should pull the latest changes for the
ref
- Sort check diffs by path and rule code only (changes in messages
should not change order)
- Update check diffs to distinguish between new violations and changes
in messages
- Add "fix" diffs
- Remove existing formatter similarity reports
- On release pull request, compare to the previous tag instead

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

reduces timer on joining ert after death to 30 seconds (#4652)

# About the pull request

reduces timer

# Explain why it's good for the game

Having to wait a full minute to join an ERT is annoying, it was better
b4 when timer from ERT was a minute as well, but 30 second ERT means if
u die just b4 ERT goes you cant join regardless.

if ppl are ghosting bc they want ert then they are stupid.

DFB property changes. (#4590)

# About the pull request
part 2 out of 4 
This does a **big** touch up on defibrillation property in research

Well, to start off, max_level = 1 was removed. It appears warcrimes
forgot to remove it since process proc has benefits explicitly for
higher levels. I would call it a bug(oversight rather).

Second: Ghosts get notified when the chem starts to try and defib you,
so you dont just wonder how did you stand up, and pretty neat too.

Third: The >6 level of defib to apply healing like with actual item
defib is too high, so we move requirement down to >1 but make it heal
much, much worse at levels lower than 5.
eg it took 20 units to heal ~20 brute at level 3(you will literally
perma lmao), at level 5, however, this will go at around 2.5 per life
tick, level 8 will give 4 damage heal.
This is a balance change(buff) But hardly so since its research,
Research is already neglecting most of the time this property.

Fourth: removes one letter var, This whole file is entombed with them
but Im not doing that for now.

# Explain why it's good for the game


Defib property is way too underused and crudely made. This fixes it,
partially.

Attempt to consider user's timezone when generating timeline

Fuck I hate timezones.

This commit reverts the previous change of adding a timezone to the `formatDate` function, which wasn't working anyway because I'd used `timezone` instead of `timeZone`, because that's the kind of genius I am, but I also decided this wasn't the place to mess around with timezones and any date passed-in here shoiuld be formatted in UTC anyway so that it will be rendered the same no matter where the user is (so long as it's passed-in as a UTC date).

Instead, the key change is that we're using the local date for the user in the timeline component (imported into the timeline in the `usersDate` variable) and comparing that date to the arrival/departure in place of the `beginningOfToday` variable, which was the beginning of the current day in UTC time, but was inaccurate if the date for the current user differed for the current UTC date.

This, in theory, will keep the timeline accurate for the local user at all hours of the day so even after midnight, my current stay should say 'now' instead of a date.

That was a lot of work just to say 'now' for a bit longer.

As the `formatDate` function is used in a lot of places, all should be checked (before and after midnight) as displaying dates correctly, particularly the timeline.

[MIRROR] Resprites IDs, Random Sprites in the Cards DMI, and Fixes Prisoner Coloring [MDB IGNORE] (#24120)

* Resprites IDs, Random Sprites in the Cards DMI, and Fixes Prisoner Coloring (#78761)

## About The Pull Request
These sprites have been adapted from a person who wished to remain
anonymous with their blessing for tg

Take the old IDs and make them look a little more fancy and sci-fi, I
think they look really nice! This makes the job marker into a cute
little screen too, but this is totally optional, if maintainers want the
animation gone It wont take long at all.
Also resprites a few random other items in the cards.dmi, such as emags,
doorjacks, hack-o-lanturn, budget cards, and one touch up on the red
team ID for laser tag for consistency.
Also prisoner IDs had black symbols and black department but orange trim
on an orange card, so it was just a huge mess.

![all the small
things](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/81941674/7bfe75a3-bb75-45bc-9947-373f16d4096b)

## Why It's Good For The Game

I'm gonna be real IDs are kinda crusty, and its something EVERYONE has
to look at at least once a shift. Poor HOPs may even look at two. God
forbid three. Now they will look pretty neat.
As for the other changes, the hack-o-lantern looks like it was made in
2001 its OLD. I don't even know if we use it, but now its updated. The
red laser tag team got a nerf so now all team letters are white, instead
of red being orange for no reason.

## Changelog
:cl:
image: We have received a new shipment of IDs, as the old ones were
found out to be haunted.
image: Laser tag red team ID has received a massive nerf
image: Station budget cards have gotten a facelift
image: Emags and Doorjacks
fix: Numbered prisoner IDs will now be legible

Create 20231107-drone parts.txt

1	"Hull
"	"The hull is the external shell or covering that protects the electronic components of the drone from the elements and from damage due to minor collisions.
As a drone pilot your biggest job is to mitigate, or reduce risk. Part of that is providing for as many possible situations as you can. No matter how skilled you are, accidents do happen. If you are flying a small drone in your back yard, you may not need a $1 million insurance policy, but you may want to check your homeowner’s policy to see if you have liability coverage.
Commercial pilots can purchase “Hull Insurance” which covers loss or damage to your drone. Equipment failures do happen. Hull Insurance does not typically cover any payload components such as the camera, sensors or anything else your drone may carry, but it can help cover the total cost to repair or replace the drone itself.
Commercial drone operators should carry drone liability insurance to cover personal injury and property damage. "
2	Propeller Guards	"Propeller Guards serve to protect the propellers and keep them from coming in contact with obstacles like the wall, the fence, or anything that is not air. If your drone has propeller guards, we highly recommend keeping them on your drone for safety. These are consumable, so keep and extra set on hand. Breaking a guard is always better than ruining a motor, or worse.
Part of your pre-flight checklist is to make sure your propeller guards are installed correctly. Flick the propeller with your finger to make sure it spins freely and does not come in contact with the propeller guard. 
If you have a small drone you may want to take it a step further, especially if flying indoors, by installing a protective cage which is like a propeller guard for your whole drone. It acts like a protective bubble that helps the drone bounce off obstacles and keep flying—and if you have two drones with this cage you can play Sumo Drones!"
3	Propeller	"Propellers are where the rubber meets the road, or in this case; where the blade meets the air! They must be installed and removed carefully to avoid damage to the motor. There are two different types of propellers; clockwise and counter clockwise. In a quadcopter they must match each other in an “X” pattern. Check your propellers before each launch and replace them if you have any nicks, chips or cracks. If one propeller fails on a quadcopter, your drone is coming down.
Propellers, like propeller guards are consumable. Make sure you have at least one extra set on hand. "
4	Motor	"Motors are to propellers like a wheel is to a tire. When working together properly they keep your drone in the air. The term Rotor refers to the propeller and the motor, implying that you can’t have one without the other.
Check your drone’s manufacture’s handbook to find out how long a motor is expected to last. Like replacing tires on your car, you don’t want to wait until one fails, which could potentially cause a crash.
Proper care for your motors includes following the manufacturer’s method of removing a propeller. Always use the propeller removal tool if your drone has one. Flying with a chipped or damaged propeller can put extra stress on your motor, because it creates more friction or drag."
5	Sensor	"Sensors are able to detect obstacles. The number of sensors and their position on the drone determine their influence. Some drones have enough sensors to actually detect and fly around an obstacle. On the TELLO sensors are used as a visual positioning system instead of GPS.
When conducting your pre-flight checklist, make sure all sensors are clear of dust, dirt or debris. If your drone begins flying in unintended ways, it could be because there is dirt on a sensor.
No matter how many sensors your drone has, they can’t replace common sense and diligence to avoid obstacles. Remember, drones don’t have breaks, so the faster you fly, the less likely you’ll be able to avoid an obstacle. In fact, certain flight settings, like sport mode, may disable your sensors completely. Know your drone and the risks before planning your mission."
6	Camera/Gimbal	"The camera can easily be the most expensive component on a drone. A 3-axis gimbal is a tool that can keep the camera stable even as the drone moves.
Care for your camera and gimbal by keeping your lens clean and the entire unit stabilized and protected when not in use. Adding a filter to your lens helps prevent scratches.
Read your drone manual to learn everything you can about the camera and how to use it. If you’re not an experienced photographer, consider taking a course in photography. Practice flying while adjusting the camera angle and performing different maneuvers while keeping the subject in view. Learn to use all the photo and video settings and don’t be afraid to experiment. Taking good images can be the most rewarding part of the being a drone pilot.
"
7	Antenna	"The antenna is a vital component for drone flight because drones use radio waves to communicate with the remote controller. Every movement of the stick is transmitted to the drone’s antenna in almost real time. If your drone is behaving erratically, or weird, it could be due to signal interference. Interference can be caused by many factors including weather, terrain, structures, WIFI signal, high voltage power lines, cellular network towers and microwave antennas. 
If you fly too far from the home point your drone can also lose signal, or connection. If your drone loses connection, it will typically continue to fly the rest of a pre-coded mission. If you are not flying a coded mission it will usually come back to the home point. If it loses GPS signal, it may land because it can’t tell where it is.
A WIFI extender is a good investment for a TELLO because it significantly increases its flight range, but be careful! If you go too far or too high, this could result in loss of your drone.

"
8	Lights	"Most drones come equipped with lights on each arm. On a quadcopter they are most often red under the front two arms and green under the back, but some drones do differ. The FAA allows certified commercial pilots to fly at night only if it is equipped with lights that are visible from three statute miles away. Typically the lights that your drone came with do not qualify, and additional lights must be added. Only FAA Part 107 Remote Pilots may fly at night with strong lights.
Some drone manufacturers, like DJI, have different patterns of blinking lights under the arms to signal different status indicators. Read your drone manual to learn more.

"
9	Battery	"The battery on a quadcopter is typically on the back of the drone, but it can be positioned on the side as well. A hexacopter or octocopter will frequently have six or eight batteries located around the entire body.
Most drones use lithium-ion batteries, but new drone technologies are experimenting with alternative fuels.
Unit 4 provides more detail about the care of lithium-ion batteries, but understand that they can be very dangerous if damaged. Never allow batteries to become overheated, and never use a bulging battery.
Always launch with a full battery and set your drone to return home at 25% of capacity. You should know how long your battery should last, but remember that factors like payload, temperature and wind velocity, can cause the life of a battery to be diminished. Consider investing in extra batteries, because it’s no fun to wait for a battery to charge. "
10	Landing Gear	"Landing gear is an important part of the drone because it protects the rotors and camera from resting on the ground during take off and landing. Landing gear provides stability during take off and landing so the propellers don’t come in contact with the ground.
Some drones, like the DJI Matrice 600 have retractable landing gear that folds up after launch and folds back down before landing. This makes the aircraft more aerodynamic and ensures that the landing gear won’t get in the way of the camera when taking photos or video.
Drone Cadets also recommends using a helipad to protect your equipment from dirt, debris and moisture. It also protects the rotors from becoming tangled in weeds or tall grass.
"

Sunbeams Somersaulting Down

I don’t know if we will ever achieve twice the speed of light. But I’m gonna try. GitHub should be light speed. Medium should be light speed too. 

This would be my mom’s Camry, Cameron’s Challenger, and Adalberto Sanchez’s Ford where normally my uncle, Mike Richardson’s white Dodge Ram would be. 

They know I hate Ford. But they couldn’t possibly put the white Ram out here. It scares him. Them baby Richardsons are gonna get them. The old man Richardson already did. 

But Adalberto pisses them off because he made no money, once killed a man, was MS13 and they knew he would come kill me for $1 million. It was the perfect plan, they knew I’d invite him in and think nothing of him being in my house. 

Plan fell apart when Adalberto Sanchez of Georgetown, SC told them “No. That’s my friend.”

I loved Adalberto. The Creator told me about what happened to him afterwards. They sent mercenaries for him, the CIA will not fuck with MS13. 

I’ll write more on Medium. See me at https://medium.com/@micahthemf … I swear github I was only driving traffic. I do it for the culture goddamn.

wasmparser: Perform type canonicalization for Wasm GC

The unit of canonicalization is a recursion group. Having "unnecessary" types in
a recursion group can "break" canonicalization of other types within that same
recursion group, as can reordering types within a recursion group.

It is an invariant that all types defined before the recursion group we are
currently canonicalizing have already been canonicalized themselves.

Canonicalizing a recursion group then proceeds as follows:

* First we walk each of its `SubType` elements and put their type references
  (i.e. their `PackedIndex`es) into canonical form. Canonicalizing a
  `PackedIndex` means switching it from indexing into the Wasm module's types
  space into either

  1. Referencing an already-canonicalized type, for types outside of this
     recursion group. Because inter-group type references can only go towards
     types defined before this recursion group, we know the type is already
     canonicalized and we have a `CoreTypeId` for each of those types. This
     updates the `PackedIndex` into a `CoreTypeId`.

  2. Indexing into the current recursion group, for intra-group type references.

  Note that (2) has the effect of making the "same" structure of mutual type
  recursion look identical across recursion groups:

      ;; Before
      (rec (struct (field (module-type 1))) (struct (field (module-type 0))))
      (rec (struct (field (module-type 3))) (struct (field (module-type 2))))

      ;; After
      (rec (struct (field (rec-group-type 1))) (struct (field (rec-group-type 0))))
      (rec (struct (field (rec-group-type 1))) (struct (field (rec-group-type 0))))

* Now that the recursion group's elements are in canonical form, we can "simply"
  hash cons whole rec groups at a time. The `TypesList` morally maintains a hash
  map from `Vec<SubType>` to `RecGroupId` and we can do get-or-create operations
  on it. I say "morally" because we don't actually duplicate the `Vec<SubType>`
  key in that hash map since those elements are already stored in the
  `TypeList`'s internal `SnapshotList<CoreType>`. This means we need to do some
  low-level hash table fiddling with the `hashbrown` crate.

And that's it! That is the whole canonicalization algorithm.

Some more random things to note:

* Because we essentially already have to do the check to canonicalize, and to
  avoid additional passes over the types, the canonicalization pass also checks
  that type references are in bounds. These are the only errors that can be
  returned from canonicalization.

* Canonicalizing requires the `Module` to translate type indices to actual
  `CoreTypeId`s.

* It is important that *after* we have canonicalized all types, we don't need
  the `Module` anymore. This makes sure that we can, for example, intern all
  types from the same store into the same `TypeList`. Which in turn lets us type
  check function imports of a same-store instance's exported functions and we
  don't need to translate from one module's canonical representation to another
  module's canonical representation or perform additional expensive checks to
  see if the types match or not (since the whole point of canonicalization is to
  avoid that!).

-------------------------------------

I initially tried to have two different Rust types for each Wasm core type
(`SubType`, `FuncType`, etc...): one for the version that contains raw type
space indices that are produced directly from the reader and another that
contains `CoreTypeId`s after canonicalization. This approach is essentially what
we do for component model types. However, this was getting really painful,
because even `ValType` would have to have two different versions. The amount of
places I was touching, including in downstream crates, was getting out of hand.

So instead I opted to make a new index type that is morally the following enum:

```rust
enum Index {
    ModuleTypesSpaceIndex(u32),
    RecGroupLocalIndex(u32),
    CoreTypeId(CoreTypeId),
}
```

Of course, we have to be very frugal with bits to keep `RefType` fitting in 24
bits and `ValType` in 32 bits, so it is actually a bit-packed version of
that. We can still represent the maximum number of Wasm types in a
module. However a `TypeList` can only have `2 * MAX_WASM_TYPES` stored in it now
(or at least that is how many are addressable; you could add more and then never
stuff their `CoreTypeId`s into these bit-packed indices). We could free up some
more bits here if we started bit-packing `ValType`, but the loss in ergonomics
of matching on `ValType` would be pretty bad.

Anyways, I also added an unpacked version of these bit-packed indices for
ergonomics. The bit-packed version can infallibly be converted to the unpacked
version, and the unpacked version can fallibly be converted to the bit-packed
version (it checks that the indices are representable in the number of bits we
actually have available).

Finally, because we are back to only having a single Rust type for each core
Wasm type, I removed the `define_core_wasm_types!` macro and inlined the
definitions. Sorry for the churn! But it is definitely nicer not having them
inside a macro at the end of the day.

-----------------------------------

This also fixes #923, since canonicalization avoids the exponential behavior
observed there.

refactor(proxy-wasm) improve pwexec resurrection and instance lifecycle

The main goal of this overhaul is to simplify `on_context_create`, make
it fully re-entrant *and* properly handle instance recycling at the same
time.

The way to do so, in my opinion, was to move `pwexec` creation where
`rexec` already was. In other words, always lookup the context id in the
instance rbtree, and if not found, create it. This means that
surrounding code also needed big overhauls. It also removes the
reference counting poor man's GC of the older implementation. The code
became really ugly by then so I took the time to also review this
module's code structure instead of making a *very* ugly commit.

This new ngx_proxy_wasm.c file should be much easier to read and follow
now.

One change I do not fully like is moving the `next_id` to a global
counter, but we do not have a "global proxy-wasm conf" object yet. I
also started thinking about pre-allocating a number of `pwexecs` (like
`worker_connections`) and use free/busy queue that all filter chains can
dip into to get a context id + context memory zone. Perhaps for a later
time.

Drop support for Rails 5.2, and attr_json 1.x

Attr-json 2.x, out for over a year, requires rails 6 minimum. We had been keeping support for rails 5.2 with attr_json 1.x, but it was causing me a tooling headache, and just isnt' worth the trouble.

I don't think we need a major version release to drop rails 5.2 and kithe 1.x -- bundler dependecy resolution should keep it from causing a problem, although some could be annoyed that they can't upgrade. Hypothetically if kithe had wide adoption; it does not, so is really not worth the headache.

Rails 5.2 has been EOL for more than a year, since 01 Jun 2022

Adds a Syndicate Monkey Agent beacon uplink item (#79012)

## About The Pull Request

Adds a Syndicate Monkey Agent beacon uplink item. It spawns a dapper
monkey that must follow your orders.

Added a monkey gun case to the uplink, which contains monkey guns!
Though they aren't very powerful.

Added a more modularlike subtype for antagonist spawners to reduce
future hardcoding.

Gave the syndicate turtleneck a monkey sprite, from SS14!

## Why It's Good For The Game

I want to see the clown driving security insane with 2-3 monkeys and an
incredible amount of pranking. Or an assistant killing everyone with his
monkey friends while wearing a monkey suit. Or a geneticist sending out
mutated monkeys to kill people. Or a scientist equipping his monkeys
with bombs or xenobiology equipment and sending them out to wreak havoc.

6 TC is only enough for two monkeys, but you can get a third if you
finish any kind of objective.

> Added a monkey gun case to the uplink, which contains monkey guns!
Though they aren't very powerful.

We can't have the monkey mafia without guns, come on. The guns are weak
and only usable by monkeys. Additionally, they're restricted to
entertainment only.

Credit to SS14 for the monky turtleneck sprite.

## Changelog

Add organization view UI filters (#10847)

* Add organization view UI filters

This filters are used for the new dashboard UI, they are not API filters.

These were a challenge to create, as django-filter is really opinionated
about the way it should work, and doesn't quite agree with use cases
that need to use filtered querysets (such as limiting the field choices
to objects the organization is related to).

I went through many permutations of this code, trying to find a pattern
that was not obtuse or awful. Unfortunately, I don't quite like the
patterns here, but because all of the django-filter magic happens at the
class level instead of at instantiation time, every direction required
hacks to obtain something reasonable.

Given the use we have for filters in our UI, I wouldn't mind making
these into a more generalized filter solution.

I think I'd like to replace some of the existing filters that currently
hit the API with frontend code and replace those with proper filters
too. These are mostly the project/version listing elements.

* Add filter for organization dropdown

This replaces an API driven UI element. It's not important that these UI
filters are frontend, it was just easier than figuring out how to make
django-filter work for this use case at that time.

* Fix the team member filter yet again

* Use a custom filter field to execute filter set queryset method

* Add tests organization filter sets

* Update code comments

* A few more improvements

- Make view code nicer, use django_filters.views.FilterMixin, sort of
- Use FilterSet.is_valid() to give empty list on validation errors
- Clean up tests with standard fixtures instead

* Review updates for tests and arguments

* Rename FilterMixin -> FilterContextMixin

* Fix lint

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Adds support to the wet_floor component to avoid displaying its overlay, makes ice turfs no longer receive said wet overlay (#8365)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/79275
-----
## About The Pull Request
The title says it all, really.

I always thought ice looked a bit silly, and always wondered why. Today,
I found out it was because of the `wet_floor` component adding an
overlay that suddenly made a turf that should look continuous, tiled,
which in turn gave some very ugly visuals. Ice already looks slippery,
you can tell that it's ice, and the overlay that was added to it just
didn't really help telegraph that any better than the sprite itself
already does.

That's why I added support to make it so it would be possible to force
the overlay to just not be applied to the turf that's affected by the
component, to make it all look a bit better overall.

I added it to the ice turfs as a proof of concept, although I guess it
could also be used on other turfs that are always "wet", like the
bananium floors, but I didn't really care enough to touch that yet, and
I guess the bananium floors can use it a bit better than ice did.

I did notice in this PR that the smoothing of ice seemed to potentially
be broken, but that's something to look into at a later time.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Look at this ice and how much smoother it looks like now:

## Changelog

:cl: GoldenAlpharex
code: Added support to the wet_floor component to make it so the wet
overlay could not be applied to certain turfs if desired.
fix: Ice turfs no longer look tiled, and instead look smooth when placed

Bitstream functions; cheat detection initial R&D

Added bitstream functions for u32s, s32s, strings (two variants), and buffers.

Fixed a mistake in the implementation of the s16 bitstream function.

Did some research into cheat detection. Implementing anti-cheat is not a goal of this ROM hack; however, as Action Replay and GameShark codes don't work on ROM hacks, it would be useful to be able to detect their usage and polirwlt warn the player of possible data corruption.

tree-wide: use /proc/thread-self for thread-local state

With the idmap work, we will have a tainted Go thread in our
thread-group that has a different mount namespace to the other threads.
It seems that (due to some bad luck) the Go scheduler tends to make this
thread the thread-group leader in our tests, which results in very
baffling failures where /proc/self/mountinfo produces gibberish results.

In order to avoid this, switch to using /proc/thread-self for everything
that is thread-local. This primarily includes switching all file
descriptor paths (CLONE_FS), all of the places that check the current
cgroup (technically we never will run a single runc thread in a separate
cgroup, but better to be safe than sorry), and the aforementioned
mountinfo code. We don't need to do anything for the following because
the results we need aren't thread-local:

 * Checks that certain namespaces are supported by stat(2)ing
   /proc/self/ns/...

 * /proc/self/exe and /proc/self/cmdline are not thread-local.

 * While threads can be in different cgroups, we do not do this for the
   runc binary (or libcontainer) and thus we do not need to switch to
   the thread-local version of /proc/self/cgroups.

 * All of the CLONE_NEWUSER files are not thread-local because you
   cannot set the usernamespace of a single thread (setns(CLONE_NEWUSER)
   is blocked for multi-threaded programs).

Note that we have to use runtime.LockOSThread when we have an open
handle to a tid-specific procfs file that we are operating on multiple
times. Go can reschedule us such that we are running on a different
thread and then kill the original thread (causing -ENOENT or similarly
confusing errors). This is not strictly necessary for most usages of
/proc/thread-self (such as using /proc/thread-self/fd/$n directly) since
only operating on the actual inodes associated with the tid requires
this locking, but because of the pre-3.17 fallback for CentOS, we have
to do this in most cases.

In addition, CentOS's kernel is too old for /proc/thread-self, which
requires us to emulate it -- however in rootfs_linux.go, we are in the
container pid namespace but /proc is the host's procfs. This leads to
the incredibly frustrating situation where there is no way (on pre-4.1
Linux) to figure out which /proc/self/task/... entry refers to the
current tid. We can just use /proc/self in this case.

Yes this is all pretty ugly. I also wish it wasn't necessary.

fix: use custom implementation for secret scrubbing

This was a fun exercise in processing streams in go, and an absolutely
massive nerd-snipe :(

Essentially, we need a custom transformer to handle *precisely* matching
Reads on the underlying source with the output - we shouldn't hold
output any longer than is absolutely neccessary.

To be able to do this at all in any reasonable way, we need a trie, and
handle *all* the secrets at once, instead of doing multiple passes.
Multiple passes won't work, since it's possible to accidentally trim too
much at each step, which would be very sad.

So, we need a trie, and we need a custom implementation of one. This is
because *no off the shelf implementation* seems to allow traversing the
trie state-by-state. Thankfully, it's a pretty short implementation to
implement one from scratch, and not too much harder to turn it into a
radix tree (which lets us use quite a lot less memory).

With our trie, we can implement our custom transformer, which is *an
utter pain*. Honestly, the comments should explain all the fun edge
cases it's possible to hit. There's a lot of tests added as well, each
of which was a real horrible thing I hit while implementing it.

I played around a bit with benchmarking, but ugh, it's a *tiny* bit
slower than the original implementation (maybe by like ~25%?). It's not
huge, but the latency problem is *actually solved*. Some potential
things I did look into and gave up on:
- Only copy into dstBuf when dst is full (requires tons of extra
conditionals, so slows everything down).
- Avoid copies at all costs by having "virtual buffer pointers" into
src, that indicate future data to copy (not only is this *slower*, the
logic becomes truly incomprehensible).
- Playing with off-the-shelf radix tree implementations, but they're so
inconvenient to use for this specific use case, it'd be way more
trouble than it'd be worth.

Any ideas welcome, but honestly, I've looked at enough flamegraphs
today.

[ysh breaking] s->trim(), s->startsWith()

camelCase: startswith() -> startsWith()

See Zulip for rationale on s->trim() over s->strip().

We're not implementing all of Python's API, and there are a number of
cosmetic reasons for trim().

Settled on this API:

   trim()
   trimLeft()
   trimRight()

   trimPrefix()
   trimSuffix()

Though to be honest I wonder if the "speed bump" with Python will be
annoying.  It's not that hard for us to accept 'startswith' as well.

Although I want one way to do it, when methods in Python/JS differ by
CASE ONLY, it could be an argument for having both names.
