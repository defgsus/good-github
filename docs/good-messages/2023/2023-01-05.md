Orbs now correctly spawn! All it took was 33 separate orb files, and would probably take a single small block of code for someone more knowledgeable with lua! But maybe Noita is just frustrating like that, idk.

Added some more items to the item list, mostly silly stuff. One less silly thing is adding the map perk to the item list, with the intention that it only gets shuffled in if Toveri is one of the checks. Note to self: make sure it doesn't get shuffled and placed on Toveri.

Added a couple of debug wands, as well as the unlimited spells wand to the debug perks.
One of the debug wands is just a digging wand straight out of Noita's files. The other is a wand pulled from the wiki to travel between parallel worlds -- to make testing stuff regarding them easier.

This is going to be a draft pull request since shops are DEFINITELY broken in this one.

Merge tag 'fs.acl.rework.v6.2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/vfs/idmapping

Pull VFS acl updates from Christian Brauner:
 "This contains the work that builds a dedicated vfs posix acl api.

  The origins of this work trace back to v5.19 but it took quite a while
  to understand the various filesystem specific implementations in
  sufficient detail and also come up with an acceptable solution.

  As we discussed and seen multiple times the current state of how posix
  acls are handled isn't nice and comes with a lot of problems: The
  current way of handling posix acls via the generic xattr api is error
  prone, hard to maintain, and type unsafe for the vfs until we call
  into the filesystem's dedicated get and set inode operations.

  It is already the case that posix acls are special-cased to death all
  the way through the vfs. There are an uncounted number of hacks that
  operate on the uapi posix acl struct instead of the dedicated vfs
  struct posix_acl. And the vfs must be involved in order to interpret
  and fixup posix acls before storing them to the backing store, caching
  them, reporting them to userspace, or for permission checking.

  Currently a range of hacks and duct tape exist to make this work. As
  with most things this is really no ones fault it's just something that
  happened over time. But the code is hard to understand and difficult
  to maintain and one is constantly at risk of introducing bugs and
  regressions when having to touch it.

  Instead of continuing to hack posix acls through the xattr handlers
  this series builds a dedicated posix acl api solely around the get and
  set inode operations.

  Going forward, the vfs_get_acl(), vfs_remove_acl(), and vfs_set_acl()
  helpers must be used in order to interact with posix acls. They
  operate directly on the vfs internal struct posix_acl instead of
  abusing the uapi posix acl struct as we currently do. In the end this
  removes all of the hackiness, makes the codepaths easier to maintain,
  and gets us type safety.

  This series passes the LTP and xfstests suites without any
  regressions. For xfstests the following combinations were tested:
   - xfs
   - ext4
   - btrfs
   - overlayfs
   - overlayfs on top of idmapped mounts
   - orangefs
   - (limited) cifs

  There's more simplifications for posix acls that we can make in the
  future if the basic api has made it.

  A few implementation details:

   - The series makes sure to retain exactly the same security and
     integrity module permission checks. Especially for the integrity
     modules this api is a win because right now they convert the uapi
     posix acl struct passed to them via a void pointer into the vfs
     struct posix_acl format to perform permission checking on the mode.

     There's a new dedicated security hook for setting posix acls which
     passes the vfs struct posix_acl not a void pointer. Basing checking
     on the posix acl stored in the uapi format is really unreliable.
     The vfs currently hacks around directly in the uapi struct storing
     values that frankly the security and integrity modules can't
     correctly interpret as evidenced by bugs we reported and fixed in
     this area. It's not necessarily even their fault it's just that the
     format we provide to them is sub optimal.

   - Some filesystems like 9p and cifs need access to the dentry in
     order to get and set posix acls which is why they either only
     partially or not even at all implement get and set inode
     operations. For example, cifs allows setxattr() and getxattr()
     operations but doesn't allow permission checking based on posix
     acls because it can't implement a get acl inode operation.

     Thus, this patch series updates the set acl inode operation to take
     a dentry instead of an inode argument. However, for the get acl
     inode operation we can't do this as the old get acl method is
     called in e.g., generic_permission() and inode_permission(). These
     helpers in turn are called in various filesystem's permission inode
     operation. So passing a dentry argument to the old get acl inode
     operation would amount to passing a dentry to the permission inode
     operation which we shouldn't and probably can't do.

     So instead of extending the existing inode operation Christoph
     suggested to add a new one. He also requested to ensure that the
     get and set acl inode operation taking a dentry are consistently
     named. So for this version the old get acl operation is renamed to
     ->get_inode_acl() and a new ->get_acl() inode operation taking a
     dentry is added. With this we can give both 9p and cifs get and set
     acl inode operations and in turn remove their complex custom posix
     xattr handlers.

     In the future I hope to get rid of the inode method duplication but
     it isn't like we have never had this situation. Readdir is just one
     example. And frankly, the overall gain in type safety and the more
     pleasant api wise are simply too big of a benefit to not accept
     this duplication for a while.

   - We've done a full audit of every codepaths using variant of the
     current generic xattr api to get and set posix acls and
     surprisingly it isn't that many places. There's of course always a
     chance that we might have missed some and if so I'm sure we'll find
     them soon enough.

     The crucial codepaths to be converted are obviously stacking
     filesystems such as ecryptfs and overlayfs.

     For a list of all callers currently using generic xattr api helpers
     see [2] including comments whether they support posix acls or not.

   - The old vfs generic posix acl infrastructure doesn't obey the
     create and replace semantics promised on the setxattr(2) manpage.
     This patch series doesn't address this. It really is something we
     should revisit later though.

  The patches are roughly organized as follows:

   (1) Change existing set acl inode operation to take a dentry
       argument (Intended to be a non-functional change)

   (2) Rename existing get acl method (Intended to be a non-functional
       change)

   (3) Implement get and set acl inode operations for filesystems that
       couldn't implement one before because of the missing dentry.
       That's mostly 9p and cifs (Intended to be a non-functional
       change)

   (4) Build posix acl api, i.e., add vfs_get_acl(), vfs_remove_acl(),
       and vfs_set_acl() including security and integrity hooks
       (Intended to be a non-functional change)

   (5) Implement get and set acl inode operations for stacking
       filesystems (Intended to be a non-functional change)

   (6) Switch posix acl handling in stacking filesystems to new posix
       acl api now that all filesystems it can stack upon support it.

   (7) Switch vfs to new posix acl api (semantical change)

   (8) Remove all now unused helpers

   (9) Additional regression fixes reported after we merged this into
       linux-next

  encouragement and input from Christoph"

crypto: Rederive pubkey for encode/decode (#6989)

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues/6940

## What
This changes the serialization of a `SuiKeyPair` from base64 encoded
`flag || pubkey || privkey` to `flag || privkey`. This is to never trust
the pubkey bytes inputs when but to always derive it from privkey when
bootstrapping from read/write from files.

This impact the `sui keytool generate` and `sui client new-address`. 

## Notes for breaking change

If you see the following error, 
```
target/debug/sui keytool generate ed25519
Invalid Keypair file InvalidInput "/Users/joy/.sui/sui_config/sui.keystore"
```
This is because the old serialization cannot be parsed anymore. Run: `rm
/Users/joy/.sui/sui_config/sui.keystore` If you would like to keep the
existing keys, please reimport from mnemonics using `keytool import`

Important heretic spell rebalancing (#71620)

## About The Pull Request

Nerfs
- Furious steel cooldown: 30s -> 60 seconds (when ascended: 10s -> 30s)
- Furious steel: Now affected by antimagic
- Cleave cooldown: 40s -> 45s
- Cleave range: 9 tiles -> 4 tiles
- Cleave wound: Now has natural clotting, changing the amount of blood
loss from inf -> ~40%
- Blood siphon range: 9 tiles -> 6 tiles
- Void Pull: Now affected by antimagic
- Void Phase: Now affected by antimagic

Buffs
- Void Blast cooldown: 60s -> 30s

Other
- Rust Formation now has a "distinct" icon
- Void Blast now has a "distinct" icon

## Why It's Good For The Game

A lot of these spells were extremely oppressive, and made it pretty much
a joke to get away with anything.
They were no-brainer choices, and as a result no one really pathed into
anything else but these.

- Furious Steel: 
- Now that blade heretics have "realignment" in their repertoire, which
offers them another counter for being hit by disablers or batons, this
spell doesn't need to have such an insanely high uptime. The spell
should be used for initiating and obtaining the lead in a combat,
instead of having nigh-invulnerability for most periods.
- Additionally, antimagic protection was kind of missing, which was
partially an oversight of it not being a `/magic` projectile.
 
- Cleave:
- Cleave was by far the most absurd ability available bar none. This
spell was guaranteed death in 30 seconds if the target had no way to
stop the bloodflow immediately. AND it could be casted from across the
screen. This brings cleave's range into midrange between you and the
target, giving a lot more opportunity to be aware for the victim.
- Critical bleed wounds had a negative clotting rate, meaning that prior
you would bleed to 0% from cleave if you didn't stop it. Not very fun,
so with the default clotting rate it now stops at 60% blood flow -
enough to be lethal if untreated, but doesn't completely tap you out
   - **Alternatives**: 
      - Keep the no clotting, make it a pure melee / touch spell. 
      - Reduce the cooldown, make it a projectile
- Change it to be like a cool scythe attack that comes out of the caster
and does a sweep

- Blood Siphon: 
- This was primarily done to slot in better with Cleave's range
decrease, encouraging more close range combat between the two. Getting
point clicked from across the screen isn't fun.

- Void Pull and Phase:
- Largely done for consistency. These are spells which cause damage, so
anti-magic should stop the damage from the spells.

- Void Blast
- I have no idea why I made the cooldown so high on this, 1 minute made
it almost worthless.

TLDR: Instakill click spells from across the screen bad, invulnerability
bad

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
balance: Heretic: Furious Steel's cooldown has been doubled (30s ->
60s), and abides by antimagic
balance: Heretic: Cleave's cooldown has increased by 5s, range has been
decreased to 4 tiles, and wound applied now has natural clotting
balance: Heretic: Blood Siphon's range has been decreased to 6 tiles
balance: Heretic: Void Pull and Phase abide by antimagic
balance: Heretic: Halved Void Blast's cooldown to 30s
qol: Heretic: Void Blast and Rust Formation now have distinct icons

Corrects error in stamina HUD element display calculation. Increases stamina HUD readability. (#71623)

## About The Pull Request
Stamina was checking health instead of maxHealth. This is probably a
remnant from when the damage stacked.
I stopped the stamina from appearing like you had no stamina whenever
you were stunned or knockdown. This would obscure potentially value
information from the player while being unclear to interpret.
We should probably represent status effects like this to the player, but
through the stamina bar is not a useful method.
The stamina bar is for stamina.
Additionally, the stamina bar will now be greyed out while you are dead,
like your health bar.

I've done alot of work increasing the readability of the stamina bar.
Firstly, I've cut some fat, removing the 100% sign when you are at full
and the blinking exclamation point when you are close to zero. They
aren't nessisary and add clutter.
There's no more "full but because its blinking bright yellow you are
actually at 20% or less" or "empty but because the whole thing isn't
blinking you still have stamina"
Its a now simple meter that decreases in 20% increments which blinks
softly, at darker and more red colors the lower the meter goes, blinking
faster at the higher percentages. When you are at zero, the empty space
slowly glows a dark red.
Its much more reasonable and intuitive than whatever the hell the old
sprites were doing.
## Why It's Good For The Game
For the HUD changes, it improves the game feel, at least from my
experience. We could probably benefit from an entirely new stamina bar
design, but finding the right one is gonna be tricky.
## Changelog
:cl: itseasytosee
fix: Stamina damage display calculation should be much more sane and
reliable now
imageadd: Simplified the stamina hud

백준 6841 : I Speak TXTMSG

Text messaging using a cell phone is popular among teenagers. The messages can appear peculiar because short forms and symbols are used to abbreviate messages and hence reduce typing.

For example, "LOL" means "laughing out loud" and ":-)" is called an emoticon which looks like a happy face (on its side) and it indicates chuckling. This is all quite a mystery to some adults.

Write a program that will continually input a short form and output the translation for an adult using the following translation table:

Short Form	Translation

[MIRROR] Gives bread and cake slice_types and adds screentip verbs to proccessed foods [MDB IGNORE] (#17721)

* Gives bread and cake slice_types and adds screentip verbs to proccessed foods (#71449)

## About The Pull Request

A side effect of my pizza PR #71202 I added contextual screentips as
part of processable.dm. In doing this, I noticed that with a few
exceptions, almost every single bread and cake type copies the proc
exactly the same for every single child of cake or bread, so I put the
proc on the parent of bread and cake and gave them slice_types, making
them more similar to pizza.dm

For everything else I've changed the default that I put in
processable.dm into "slice" or "cut" for things that use the knife and
"flatten" for things that use the rolling pin.

Finally, you can slice bread with saws now, because I think its silly
that only pizza gets this luxury.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Because it wasnt the focus of #71202 I didn't mess with screentips
outside of the pizza file a lot, but now that it's merged I figure I
should go and do that.
As Bread and Cake's processables are almost fully standardized it seems
silly for them to call on the proc 12 times in the same document so I
did this, which also allows for more versatility in editing how they
work as well allow people to, if they want to, add more tool behaviours
in the future without adding in 12 lines of code. Also means that people
who want to add new cake or bread have one less thing to do.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: you can saw bread with a saw into bread slices
qol: added screentip verbs to a bunch of food files
code: bread and cake now have slice types and all only have one call on
the processable.dm proc
/:cl:

* Gives bread and cake slice_types and adds screentip verbs to proccessed foods

* sco'ish

* fuck me ig

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].
With this patch a process can be killed via:

 */
Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

Small fixes, bump to 0.9.3

* CommandProcessor.cs: A friendly reminder

* PERQdisk.ico:
* PERQdisk.csproj: Renamed

* POSFloppy.cs: Prevent the obvious crash (null pointer exception) when
  a sector is missing; a random block of nulls from an unread/unreadable
  floppy will likely cause other issues, but at least this lets "mostly good"
  floppies load...

* Program.cs: Don't change directories on startup, since that makes
  argument parsing awkward (the -s or file option has to be fully qualified
  or relative to the base dir, which is annoying)

* AssemblyInfo.cs: Bump for 2023!

Added SwingTwist !

Which output the same values as Unity.

Took me a lot of time to put the test together between
Unity and Godot, and making sure that both compute data
the same way.
However, the first basic tests seems to output the exact
same result, so we're good for that part.

Fuck you Unity for the extreme rounding in Debug.Log,
when outputing float values ! I was wondering why
Godot result was like (0.25????, 0, 0, 0,96????) and
why Unity was like (0.3, 0, 0, 1).

And fuck you Godot for not specifying in which units
the angles are when using Quaternion(axis, angle) !
Unity DOES specify that the angles are in degrees.
Godot will use radians instead. I guess that Godot
use radians everywhere, but still, specifying the
unit avoids spending time trying to figure out which
unit the system uses.
Don't expect everyone to be a master in your engine
of reading every documentation page you generate,
even though you'd hope to.

Greatly improved the very hacked up implementation of LZSS-SAP
- Removed the gross procedures working around the FILE* specifications, replaced with the much better pointers from function arguments approach
- Deleted the files for libfmemopen since the hack is no longer needed, this originated from my own stupidity, I do not know how to code, but now I actually know what I did wrong and why I should never do this thing ever again
- Rewritten much of the functions making use of LZSS_SAP due to the prior improvements, this actually greatly improved everything using the LZSS compression, and also got rid of the clunky workaround of using temporary files
- Greatly sped up the LZSS exports due to the improvements mentioned above, which makes the output almost instantly finished now, compared to a few months ago
- Experimented further with the ExportCompactLZSS function, now it can also display the compressed chunks size, tweaked the .txt formatting a well
- Getting a bit of headroom with these changes for the upcoming improvements to VUPlayer's data index structure, which will fix bugs related too index looping, and introduce the ability to playback LZSS streams in chunks, among other improvements. Note that the LZSS export overhaul was directly related to the upcoming changes with the process of exporting data, but I won't get ahead of myself too early
- Planning to add subtunes export properly into the LZSS data later, the function running the recording actually could benefit from a bunch of additional arguments when called... something to keep in mind for actually being able to output all module subtunes, and not only play from start, like it currently is set up to do. This is also a side effect of my poor programming skills, but I will amend myself for that soon with more things that have been overdue to be done.

Changes Admin Prison to be Anti-Telekinesis: Walls off equipment rooms, replaces computers, and makes the tables tidy (#71433)

First PR, may require some changes or something because I don't know how
to do anything bleh
## About The Pull Request

We already had issues with crewmembers with telekinesis making changes
to the security records (purging them and what not). And, nothing has
been done about it, not yet, anyway. Not only record computers are a
problem as well.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106710384/203241399-8314bcba-d2d0-44af-9360-30ff58dbc39e.png)
Previously, prisoners can access the sec vendor with telepathy, and,
since the vendor is free, spam the vendor and be an annoyance. Sure, I
believe that it is not as big of a problem as purging the security
records, but I feel like it's against what the prison is supposed to
stand for; It's supposed to stop them and get them to listen to ahelps
thrown at them.

I've decided to make a bit of changes to the prison to make it so that
people with telekinesis won't fuck up things as much. This replaces real
computers with nonfunctional ones, adding walls to equipment areas to
make sure prisoners don't spam the vendor, and deletes guns/weapons from
the tables so they won't grab them.

## Why It's Good For The Game


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106710384/203241465-833f79da-58a3-4feb-87b0-091fbb846e93.png)
This PR is more tailored to admins dealing with no-good-doers, and goes
for the vibe of "HEY, SOMEONE IS PMING YOU, REPLY TO THEM INSTEAD!" Of
course, this leads to prisoners not interacting with the current round,
and, less chance of them going insane and breaking all the windows with
a telekinesis auto-rifle.

Plus, this can always be reverted in-case someone comes up with coding
stuff in instead. I'm all through with that and willing to work with
whoever to solve the issue.

Also, of course, Closes #60967

## Changelog

:cl:
admin: Nanotrashen made some top-of-the-line changes to their
top-of-the-line prison by walling off their equipment area and removing
some spare guns they somehow left on the tables. We also stole the
security computers, so people with telekinesis can't access them.

Update README.md

The Mahr in Islam: What It Is and Why It Matters

Mahr in Islam is a custom and an obligation. It is practiced in marriage ceremonies. It is basically, a portion of the money or can be any other worthy item that the groom is liable to his bride. Though there is not a definite amount or quantity of a product but it can be decided on a customary basis. The amount may differ based on a groom’s financial position and location. But it is a compulsion on the part of the groom to pay a certain amount to his bride.

Marriage is basically a legal contract in Islam and there are certain rules and regulation that is decided by the parties. There are a few obligatory practices and Mahr in Islam is one of them. A groom is obliged to pay Mahr and he cannot be exempted from it. Mahr fatimi is the amount that was provided to Hazrat Fatimah (Radhiyallah anha). Generally, two opinions regarding Mehr Fatimi exist.

The meaning of Mehr is the obligation that a male partner has to fulfill at the time of Islamic marriage to his female partner. When we translate Mehr in English, in simple terms it would be a gift or contribution that a husband offers to his bride. This is usually dubbed as financial independence for the bride or to provide her with a type of financial freedom. The ownership of Mahr goes to a female partner and no one can evade her from this right. 

Allah says in Quran: “And give the women (on marriage) their Mahr as a free gift” (Quran 4:4)

Surah An-Nisa, verse 20:

“But if you want to replace one wife with another and you have given one of them a great amount (in gifts), do not take back from it anything. Would you take it in injustice and manifest sin?” [4:20
 
 
Prophet PBUH said: “You are not entitled to take back any money. If you have told the truth, the Mahr you paid was for having sexual relations with her lawfully”. [Sahih Bukhari].

At another place, Prophet PBUH said: “Go and look for something, even if it is a ring of iron.” (Al-Bukhari)

Importance of Mahr.

Paying mahr is an obligation in Islamic marriage and is considered one of the main aspects. The woman is given Mehr as her exclusive property and to provide her with a sort of financial independence. Mehr in Islam is a liability and mandatory. It is paid because the girl usually holds nothing. So, to hold her rights, she is given Mehr. It is a sign of duty, respect, and responsibility. Further, it helps build a constructive relationship between husband and wife because it helps the husband understand the responsibilities and rights of his wife. 
  
FAQ:

what is the customary mahr in us as of today

Although the amount of Mehr in Islam is not defined and there is not a definite figure or number of properties or items. The amount may differ vary from country to country. Both husband and wife can decide the amount. If we take it in dollars then It could be millions of dollars or merely a few hundred dollars. But in customary terms, it is usually between 4 to 7 thousand US dollars in several Islamic countries.

How Much Mahr in Islam.

It is stated in Hadith that the Mahr amount should be one gold piece but it is not compulsory. Paying Mahr is a liability and obligation but the amount can be decided mutually by the guardians and there is not any restriction on the amount of mahr.

how to calculate mahr in Islam

Normally, guardians of both sides have to decide about the mahr amount. If they cannot then we can follow the normal pattern in that area. 


what is mahr in Islam
Mahr in Islam is the duty of the groom to pay sizeable money or property to his groom to provide her financial stability and independence. It is an obligation and clearly explained in Quran and Hadith and no one is exempted from it.

maybe_send_to_registration: Don't reuse pre-existing PreregistraionUser.

There was the following bug here:
1. Send an email invite to a user.
2. Have the user sign up via social auth without going through that
   invite, meaning either going via a multiuse invite link or just
   straight-up Sign up if the org permissions allow.

That resulted in the PreregistrationUser that got generated in step (1)
having 2 Confirmations tied to it - because maybe_send_to_registration
grabbed the object and created a new confirmation link for it. That is a
corrupted state, Confirmation is supposed to be unique.

One could try to do fancy things with checking whether a
PreregistrationUser already have a Confirmation link, but to avoid races
between ConfirmationEmailWorker and maybe_send_to_registration, this
would require taking locks and so on - which gets needlessly
complicated. It's simpler to not have them compete for the same object.

The point of the PreregistrationUser re-use in
maybe_send_to_registration is that if an admin invites a user, setting
their initial streams and role, it'd be an annoying experience if the
user ends up signing up not via the invite and those initial streams
streams etc. don't get set up. But to handle this, we can just copy the
relevant values from the pre-existing prereg_user, rather than re-using
the object itself.

Create 130 Seats in Theater.js

Task
Your friend advised you to see a new performance in the most popular theater in the city. He knows a lot about art and his advice is usually good, but not this time: the performance turned out to be awfully dull. It's so bad you want to sneak out, which is quite simple, especially since the exit is located right behind your row to the left. All you need to do is climb over your seat and make your way to the exit.

The main problem is your shyness: you're afraid that you'll end up blocking the view (even if only for a couple of seconds) of all the people who sit behind you and in your column or the columns to your left. To gain some courage, you decide to calculate the number of such people and see if you can possibly make it to the exit without disturbing too many people.

Given the total number of rows and columns in the theater (nRows and nCols, respectively), and the row and column you're sitting in, return the number of people who sit strictly behind you and in your column or to the left, assuming all seats are occupied.

Example
For nCols = 16, nRows = 11, col = 5 and row = 3, the output should be

seatsInTheater(nCols, nRows, col, row) === 96
Here is what the theater looks like:



Input/Output
[input] integer nCols

An integer, the number of theater's columns.

Constraints: 1 ≤ nCols ≤ 1000.

[input] integer nRows

An integer, the number of theater's rows.

Constraints: 1 ≤ nRows ≤ 1000.

[input] integer col

An integer, the column number of your own seat (with the rightmost column having index 1).

Constraints: 1 ≤ col ≤ nCols.

[input] integer row

An integer, the row number of your own seat (with the front row having index 1).

Constraints: 1 ≤ row ≤ nRows.

[output] an integer
The number of people who sit strictly behind you and in your column or to the left.

Fix the whole 'auto-wrapping text' mess

I've finally figured it out. Took literally hours of fiddling around
with AutoWrapStaticText to work around a really weird bug, then more
hours to figure out how to get the settings dialog to wrap nicely when
it's opened, but it's done. It's wonderful. I never want to touch it
again.

Utumno:
We must link to the commit here - just a fixup (kept separate in case
there is a shorter url - certainly needs to wrap better :P)

I am really curious to learn what the 'really weird bug" was - I
remember wrapping being a pain so I'd like to know what made the
difference finally - is it just the `dc = wx.ClientDC(self)` (?)

You mean wx.AutoWrapStaticText and it _is_ wonderful

Edit: added a wx (Pep8) suffix to wx functions/overrides - makes it
much easier to figure out on first read (plus if we ever want to swap
gui libs this would be done by a metaclass reading off the correctly
suffixed method)

[RSDK-923] Make GPS-RTK code more robust, remove bad test (#1679)

Changes include:
- Migrate go statements to `utils.PanicCapturingGo()`
- Don't start the background goroutine unless the rest of startup succeeds (to prevent leaking goroutines)
- Lock the mutex whenever you read or write any data that is also read/written from a different goroutine (this was the actual cause of the race conditions!)
- Remove the test that sometimes fails due to a bug in third-party code. It sucks that it sometimes fails, but all the problems are down in the bowels of https://github.com/de-bkg/gognss, and not in code we own.

Things I kinda wanted to change but didn't: 
 - `RTKMovementSensor.GetStream()` is nearly identical to `ntripCorrectionSource.GetStream()`, and the only times you call the RTK version, you always pass in the same state stored in an ntrip object. Unfortunately, it's a _different_ ntrip object defined in the same file as `ntripCorrectionSource`. Should the function be moved to that class instead, or removed entirely? I dunno. Something in here is redundant, but I couldn't remove the duplication without thinking a lot more.

I ran the tests 1,000 times: no failures. It's possible I'm being overly cautious with the mutex, and if you have specific ones you want me to remove, I'm happy to do so. It's possible I'm writing non-idiomatic Go code, and I'm happy to rewrite this whole thing if you have a different style I should match.

add alternate instructions for wsl2 users. (#184)

not sure if this is the path we would like to take, but raising the question in code if helpful.  many 301 students experience a significant time-dump (for students and TAs actually) when trying to install mongoDB locally.  The answer always seem to be the same "oh, that thing we told you to do, you don't actually need to do it".  Instructions  for the "what-if" or "eventuality of" failure would preserve everyone's time and most importantly save student bandwidth for being 301 ready!  Can we just call this what it is and reap the quality of life benefits?

Alternatively, can the MongoDB install just go away?  because we allow WSL usage, using Ajax is just the way we teach them anyway!  why have half the class install mongoDB which is never used locally anyway!

Add `GPS receiver` device to provide `senseloc` capability (#956)

Add a new `GPS receiver` device which enables the `senseloc` capability (and hence the `whereami` command).  Towards #26 .

- My immediate motivation is that I want to be able to define `excursion : cmd unit -> cmd unit` which executes the given command and then returns to the same location and orientation as before.  Being able to use the `whereami` command is one of the last missing pieces of machinery necessary to be able to do this in classic mode (the other is a `heading` command, see #955).
- The proposed recipe for `GPS receiver` is `antenna + circuit + clock + compass`, which is a somewhat difficult recipe (`antenna` requires `silver` which requires a `deep mine`; a `clock` requires `quartz` + a bunch of `iron gears`, etc.).  One might wonder whether we should make the recipe easier since finding out where you are seems like a kind of fundamental operation.  However, consider that in order to even be able to make use of the result of `whereami` you need at least (1) an `ADT calculator` to deal with the pair (which transitively requires `typewriter` -> `circuit` -> `silicon` -> `quartz`) (2) probably things like `comparator` and `calculator` to do anything useful with the coordinates.  By the time you have those things you can definitely already build `circuit` + `clock` + `compass`, and you're probably not that far away from getting some `silver` for an `antenna`.  Also, in practice it's an interesting/fun constraint to build up machinery that has to work entirely based on *relative* position without being able to find out your absolute coordinates.
- For some reason this is causing `Testing/508-capability-subset` to fail.  I think perhaps it is due to #397 ?  I will investigate. *EDIT*: unfortunately, that wasn't it!

Adds the Sandstorm random event, directional meteor functionality, space sand. (#71802)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request


![sandstorm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28870487/206070641-80d37afc-a365-4f5e-ad48-e8cdf0153ac9.png)

Hey guys, it's your boy. Back at it again with another meteor-adjacent
event PR.

Adds the Sandstorm random event, inspired by the long-unused admin only
one. It picks a direction to approach from, alerts the crew of its
imminent arrival, and after a little over a minute of preparatory time,
sends waves of sand and dust to grind down everything in that direction.

To accomplish this, some minor adjustments had to be made to meteor
generation code. They can now be passed an optional arg for a direction
to be thrown from, and will pick a random one if no direction is given.

Also introduces the newest addition to our cast of meteors -- space
sand! It's even weaker than space dust, and shows up exclusively in this
event. Space sand is **ineffective against rwalls**, and will not damage
the arrivals area's high-tech sand-resistant glass. This is to prevent
this event from venting one of the most dust-vulnerable areas on the
station, and to make sure new players aren't shafted into firelock hell
when the right angle is picked.

I did a lot of testing and tweaking of numbers to get the damage to
average at about the level I'm comfortable with. This is meant to be a
high-impact event that isn't as destructive (or unavoidable) as a meteor
wave. Speaking of avoidance, let's talk about mitigation:

You get an early warning and a direction the sand will come from. You
have time to grab repair supplies, move to safety, get a MODsuit. You
can make worthwhile repairs as the sand comes in from inside (or
outside, if you're brave enough) with nothing more than a welder and
iron sheets. If you're feeling particularly spicy, you can leverage your
prep time setting up shield generators, which spawn in engineering and
have been added to the maintenance machines loot pool. Anyone can
contribute, so do your part as a good crewmate and help out!

All that being said, the event can't be prevented entirely. Shit's going
to get shredded, especially on the outside of the station. Damage will
vary heavily based on the station and direction, ranging from
inconsequential to threatening. It should happen late enough into the
round that, at the bare minimum, the crew shouldn't be caught
unprepared.

For those of you who are worried, the ORIGINAL sandstorm admin event is
still with us too. It's been moved from the space dust file into the
Sandstorm event file. This PR also makes a very minor change to the
naming of the space _dust_ events, for better menuing.

So, to sum it all up: Sand hits grinds down one side of the station, you
get a minute of warning, shield generators now spawn in maintenance. Be
a good crewmate and help where you can.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

More event variety is good, and events that give the players agency on
how bad the impact will be is even better.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags

all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
