Major update after first playtest

Holy smokes!  I asked my friends to role play rules-lawyering assholes, and did they deliver!
Rewrote the opening to better display what the game is actually about.
Replaced "notecards" with "scrap paper" because notecards aren't that common of a thing
Moved the GameManager section to the start, and specified that the GM should have material prepared for the first setting.  This went against the original spirit of the game, but after trying it myself, bullshitting EVERYTHING on the spot isnt fun.
Made some better example themes
Replaced "Players" with "Character Creation"
Players are told to make characters that actually want to be there.  Thank you Thomas, for making an unstable cab driver that immediately tried to kill everyone.
AP is now 10 + Kno, giving Knowledge a mechanical use.
Rules added for starting equipment
1 insta-fail removed.  a 1/6th chance instafail isn't fun.
Resources specified to be something you can carry
Added Bonus section, for added points.
Specified abilities are used once per rest
Organized ability costs

Drop support for Honeycomb trace propagation

Removes any Honeycomb-specific trace header handling.  We expect our
services to be using OpenTelemetry standard trace headers, not Honeycomb
ones.  We should no longer need to accept or emit the Honeycomb headers.

The driving force behind this change is that the hacks that held things
together until now has broken.  Some services have started to rely on
parent-based sampling, which means we all services need to support it.
However, when we "convert" a Honeycomb header into a W3c/OpenTelemetry
header, we hard-code the "sampled" flag to false.

In theory, we could keep the code to accept Honeycomb headers.  It
wouldn't do any harm.  However, with our new parent-based sampler,
traces that carry those headers would never be sampled.  It seems better
to be honest and explicitly drop support for these legacy headers.

If there are services out there that do still rely solely on
Honeycomb-style headers, this will break trace propagation.  We've been
supporting both kinds of headers for a really long time now, so I don't
expect this to happen.  If they do break, we should upgrade their
libraries.

Eoehoma Firearms (& friends) (#2315)

## About The Pull Request


![Screenshot_5451](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/58402542/08f9b0ee-15db-4091-a974-6d887cd85259)

Holy shit, this should not have taken a year to make

Adds the E-10, E-11, E-40, E-50, and E-60 to the game. Weapons
manufactured by defunct firearms company Eoehoma Firearms.

Founded in 77 FS, Eoehoma was a early pioneer of ‘hybrid’ Solarian and
Kalixcian laser weapons. The company went bankrupt due to increasingly
poor and risky decision making, and all of it's patents were bought out
by Nanotrasen. While Nanotrasen's Emitters bear a striking resemblance
to the E-50, otherwise Nanotrasen has not produced any of Eoehoma's old
weapons, instead focusing on Sharplite designed weapons.

Other changes:
- NT and Sharplite weapons have different fire sounds from each other
- Laser weapons buffed to 20 -> 25 damage
- Pulse shots don't destroy walls and are now 50 -> 40 damage
- Emitter shots now do 30 -> 60 damage
- Various grammar fixes
- Removes some non-lore compliant mentions
- Adds a manufacturer indicator to many guns
- Ports https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/60353
- Resprites various laser weaponry, notably the pulse guns.
- Deathsquad and ERT/LP hardsuits have been redone

## Why It's Good For The Game

ceredits to tetrazeta for the unfinished deathsquad sprite, i simply
finished it and touched it up

One of the last things i remember the old leads planned was to buff
lasers to make them stand up to the various ballistics better. Also
allows Pulse Rifles to be more used in events by nerfing them to not be
comedically overpowered. Now they are just Overpowered.

More ruin content and such. I'm sure the maptainers will make good use
of this stuff.

And sprites, i fucking love sprites

## Changelog

:cl: retlaw34, tetrazeta
add: Eoehoma Firearms, a new guns manufacturer!
add: ERT and "Asset Protection" Hardsuits have gotten a new look!
add: New laser fire sounds

balance: Lasers now do slightly more damage
balance: Pulse rifles don't destroy walls anymore and do slightly less
damage, and have lost their stun mode.
balance: Emitters do 60 damage and create turf fires on hitting a
non-supermatter object.

Cannon) now work

spellcheck: Grammar on some descriptions was corrected.

"This message will repeat in approximately 20 galactic standard minutes"

Remaps the shitty outpost 1 (indie space) outpost that I made like 6
months ago. it sucks. Anyone who doesn't think it sucks probably has
stockholm symdromed themselves into liking it. Also this one has lore
and room for expansion.
It's main features are: 
- Decent amount of maint for outpost antics
- REASONABLE amount of storefronts
-abandoned feel
- bar
- Ore refinery so my holy mandate can be implemented when I decide I'm
done with my break.

Massive Ruin Fixes + Removals PR (#2334)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
This PR is made so I can stop getting angry at the ruins beyond saving
that are still ingame. My criteria for a ruin being removed is if
another ruin already does its niche better, if the ruin is outdated
and/or the ruin is excessively small or unbalanced. For ruins that dont
meet this criteria but are still outdated, they will be getting balance
fixes and touch ups or a total remap.

This PR is a draft for now because I will need to update the PR
changelog and description as I make changes and communicate with the
maptainers on what stays and what goes.

Adds departmental RND lootdrop spawners for circuit imprinters,
protolathes and techfabs. Excludes omnisci and basic boards from the
drops.
Fixed a space tile under a door and replaced the omnilathe with a
medical lathe on dangerousresearch
Fixed the whitesands saloon not spawning which may have caused some
sandplanets to spawn without a ruin
Fixed harmfactory's nonfunctional traps to now be as lethal as intended.
Also changed the loot in the vault to better reflect the ruin's theme
and difficulty (cargo techfab board instead of omnilathe, adv plasma
cutter instead of combat medkit, less gold more cash, kept the cyberarm
implant).
Fixed provinggrounds magical SMES FINALLY by adding a terminal on the
back. The map should finally function as intended.
Fixed a few dirs on fire extinguisher cabinets and blast door assemblies
in singularity_lab
Removed mechtransport.dmm for being small and bad
Removed some leftover gasthelizards.dmm cruft (VILE)
Removed nucleardump for being an utter mess of an oldcode ruin
Removed gondolaasteroid for being large and empty besides gondolas.
better suited for a jungle planet IMO.
Removed Jungle_Spider. Literally just a box with spiders and cloning
equipment. Small, bad, hard to find, unjustified loot.
Removed Golem_Hijack. Like jungle spider but it was free rnd, an AI
core, a full BSRPED and three golem corpses. With no enemies or
obstacles.
Removed rockplanet_clock for being a tiny lootbox that doesnt fit with
the lore. Also had a quantumn pad.
Removed whitesands_surface_youreinsane. Its a silly little reference to
an old event that unfortunately resulted in a subpar ruin. Could return
as a wasteplanet greeble ruin, but it has to go for now.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Normally I'm all for remapping instead of removing ruins, but some ruins
are very much beyond saving. Clearing out space for better ruins to take
the spotlight is always nice. Some older ruins are fine but are missing
certain things or have loot that worked fine in the past, but doesn't
reflect the balance we want for ruins in the present.

I will be PR'ing ruins to replace the ones I remove.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would

Skinwalker-B-Gone/God Bless America: Enclave Bunker/Casper Changes (#299)

<!-- Adjusting things like armor or weapon values for balance, while
they may be 'fixes' in their own way, are not considered code fixes as
described above and require the use of the Pull Request format below.-->


## About The Pull Request

Takes a good chunk (around half) of the salvage cars from the parking
lot entering Casper, and places them in and around the exterior of the
Enclave bunker.

Adds a camera system to the bunker.

Moved prewar weapon spawn behind bunker doors.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Enclave can still do salvaging without John Republic and his troopers
completely taking salvage away from the faction (they shouldn't be doing
this anyway, yall MFs need to ahelp that shit when you see it
happening). They would still need to go to the parking lot to get the
rest that was originally there for the total, but it's more manageable
now.

Camera system because super secret government entity being incapable of
observing their own bunker and the immediate exterior is funny.

Prewar spawn moved because random NCR or Followers guards would rush it
for free gamer gear.

fix stupid "this forces us to do things the """right""" way" bullshit from python 3.11 (#79783)

This is likely not the best way to go about this, but i do not want us

## About The Pull Request

Yeah, so - anyways.......

Khans had some issues with their balance. I've went through and re-did
some of their loadouts for their faction.
- The lever action has been removed from Enforcers, instead it is
replaced with the Auto-5. The Auto-5 is the alternative fit as it
doesn't fit in bags like the lever, holds one less round, but in return
fires slightly faster. This is on-par with actual other factions (as the
only faction that got lever shotguns round start are vet-legion. Auto-5s
are more common.)
- The Enforcer and Smith have kept the selectable trait book, but Khans
over-all had a silly amount of traits. Therefor Chemist and Senior
Enforcer had theirs removed. (Senior has enough perks, and the book for
Chemist made the loadout selection for perks worthless.)
- Smith has lost their explosive crafting, but Chemist has gotten the
advanced explosive crafting book akin to NCR sappers who get the choice
of one. (To make Chemist loadout balanced, the lowsurgery book has been
replaced with medium surgery, since both NCR medics and Legion aux get
mid-surgery, not low)
- Khan armors have had their wound protection updated. They are now
roughly equal to NCR/Legion armor counterparts.
- Khan senior enforcer has had his round-start caps lowered from 1,000
to 500. (Tbh this may still be a bit high but w/e I was suggested this
amount)
- Smith, in exchange for losing explosive trait book, has instead gained
more gun crafting recipes in exchange. Can make all base Khan guns plus
10mm smg and some others. Plus - can make alloys like NCR LO / Legion
forgemaster. (Lost their GnB part 4 server-start learned. Work for it,
like the LO has to.)
- Renamed Khan Smith into Khan Armorer, which is a canon name of a Khan
found in Fallout: NV. Minor change, but tbh fits the role better since
they are mostly focused on gun crafting _and_ smithing.
- Made the Senior Enforcer loadouts actually competitive with each
other. Hammer one now gets a deagle with it to provide a sidearm for
range, the 10mm had to be a meme since it was the WORST option possible
- and is now replaced with a Infiltrator since it's just a slightly
better R-91 with a scope. (I'd argue this makes up for the now lack of
an extra selectable trait for head enforcer.)

Also - small hotfix, why the fuck did the Senior Scribe had low surgery
skill but Scribe has mid-surgery??? Not khan related but come on.....
scribe gaming..........

## Why It's Good For The Game

The major factions on server have gotten a fair bit of balancing
attention but Khans lacked a lot, such as overlooked wound armor
protection, their round start caps, and how many traits they could get
(which honestly felt like an unintended oversight, maybe???)

I think this attempts to re-do the Khan loadouts without per-say
'nerfing' them but rather fixing the fact that many of the loadouts
aren't unique to the role (i.e easily replacing chemist with smith, or
vice-versa) - as this has some buffs as well in things Khans were weak
in, such as Smith not having much unique to them.

Bobstation Ghost Port (#300)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

<!-- Adjusting things like armor or weapon values for balance, while

## About The Pull Request

Remembered Escape from Navarro and remembered Bobstation codebase had
interesting ghost mechanics with seeing in monochrome while dead and
de-limbed limbs pop off yourself and stay missing as a ghost.

Ended up finding out - most of it would port with ease! Sadly the motion
blur was really too annoying to get working, but I plan to look at it at
some point. And, while I could get monochrome working, I want to run
that by people first. I enjoy it, but I know it fucks with people. But
hey - lookin' gooood.

De-limbing makes the limb disappear on the ghost.

Wearing armor or clothing? Well, it'll stay on you when you're dead!

And even if you matrix it stays.

## Why It's Good For The Game

It's more of a nice addition to how I even remember ollld TG worked with
ghosts, minus the delimbing and armor. The style kind of fits and makes
ghosts stand out, letting you see who they were - even if you didn't
catch the name - when alive.

Okay Here's all the changes from previous project turn in to now

- changed from having traditional and digital page to having a page dedicated to car design, animations, and 2D/3D respectivelys.
- About and Contact page are one thing since in real life I have no use for the "newsletter" type function. It's easier for me to just give them my information.
- I removed the newsletter thing
- Relabled all pages withing code for 2D/3D and Car Design so that they were actually helpful rather than maintaining sample page naming that I used when just trying to make a layout I could copy around my stuff.
- Added text over the image links on the home page so that the user can tell what each one takes you to. Home page still isn't optimized for mobile. Had a horrible time triyng to fix that. Everything I tried broke something else so I've decided to leave it as it is for the time being until I'm able to give it the attention necessary to fix and overhaul the layout later.
- Added an entire animations page with animations and time lapses that I've created with youtube video embeds that enable full-screen viewing.
- adjusted labels throughout page to fit the updated name system for the different areas. Left some deeper embedded code with the old labels though as it would recquire a stupid amount of renaming all just for it to look the exact same as it does now so I didn't bother to do that.
- Updated some thumbnails and images, gave the new images thumbnails and pages
- Zero bacon ipsum text unless I missed something
- All artworks have a label or description about how they were made.
- it all works :)

distro/el9: refactor package sets to again use `@core` pkg group

Previously, we used a fixed package list from RHEL-9.0 times, instead of
the `@core` pkg group, for all images which used it on el8. The
motivation was that some packages got removed from the group in 9.0
(specifically tuned), which went almost unnoticed. The reasoning was that
a fixed list would give us more control over the package set and prevent
unexpected package removals.

However, with COMPOSER-2074 [1], it turned out that this also meant that
any new packages added to the `@core` group won't be automatically added
to any image which previously used the `@core` group. People still have
(anyhow incorrect) expectation that `@core` pkg group is always
installed on RHEL images and thus that adding a package to the group
will also add it to vanilla RHEL images.

We discussed this shortly within the team and reverting back to using
`@core` package group, instead of a fixed package list, seems like the
lesser evil.

Modify package set definitions, which used `coreOsCommonPackageSet()` to
use `@core` package group instead. Modify the exclude lists accordingly
to achieve almost the same image content as before. There are a few
exceptions:

 - `rhc` package is now installed, which is desired.
 - `insights-client` is now installed on some images where it was
   previously not. This is OK, since RHEL is aiming for a "connected
   experience" by default. This also results in a few additional
   packages to be pulled in as dependencies, specifically:
   - `python3-file-magic`
   - `policycoreutils-python-utils`
   - `tar`
   - `pciutils`
 - `initscripts-rename-device` is now installed. This sub-package has
   been split out of the `initscripts` package on el9, but it was not
   included in the `@core` group definition, when we created the fixed
   pkg list. However, it is now the default member of the group. The
   functionality was previously installed by default on el8 images via
   the `initscripts` package. After talking to the maintainer, I kept it
   in the images as a new package.

Affected images by this change:
 - ami
 - gce
 - gce_rhui
 - image_installer
 - oci
 - openstack
 - ova
 - qcow2
 - vmdk

Some of the listed images already contained `rhc` or `insights-client`,
but now, these are consistently installed on all of them. This is the
case since 9.2, when `rhc` was added to the `@core` group.

`initscripts-rename-device` has been added to all of these image types,
inlcuding on CentOS Stream 9 images.

#### Wednesday 2023-12-06 08:45:39 by KonstantinaVasileva

Add files via upload

1.	Ages
Write a program that determines whether a person is based on the given age: baby, child, teenager, adult, or elder. The bounders are:
•	0-2 – baby; 
•	3-13 – child; 
•	14-19 – teenager;
•	20-65 – adult;
•	>=66 – elder; 
•	All the values are inclusive.

2.	Division
You will be given an integer, and you have to print on the console whether that number is divisible by the following numbers: 2, 3, 6, 7, 10. You should always take the bigger division. If the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 it is also divisible by 6, and you should print only the division by 6. If a number is divisible by 2 it is sometimes also divisible by 10, and you should print the division by 10. If the number is not divisible by any given number, print "Not divisible". Otherwise, print "The number is divisible by {number}".

3.	Vacation
You are given a group of people, type of the group, on which day of the week they will stay. Based on that information, calculate how much they must pay and print that price on the console. Use the table below. In each cell is the price for a single person. The output should look like that: "Total price: {price}". The price should be formatted to the second decimal point.
	           Friday	  Saturday	Sunday
Students	     8.45	     9.80	         10.46
Business	     10.90	    15.60	           16
Regular	       15	       20	         22.50
There are also discounts based on some conditions:
•	Students – if the group is bigger than or equal to 30 people, you should reduce the total price by 15%
•	Business – if the group is bigger than or equal to 100 people 10 of them can stay for free.
•	Regular – if the group is bigger than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 20 reduce the total price by 5% 

4.	Print and Sum
Write a program to display numbers from given start to given end and their sum. All the numbers will be integers. On the first line, you will receive the start number, on the second the end number.

5.	Login
You will be given a string representing a username. The password will be that username reversed. Until you receive the correct password, print on the console "Incorrect password. Try again.". When you receive the correct password, print "User {username} logged in." However, on the fourth try, if the password is still not correct, print "User {username} blocked!" and end the program.

6.	Strong Number
Write a program to check whether or not a given number is strong. A number is strong if the sum of the Factorial of each digit is equal to the number. For example 145 is a strong number, because 1! + 4! + 5! = 145. Print "yes" if the number is strong and "no" if the number is not strong.

7.	Vending Machine
Your task is to calculate the total purchase price from a vending machine. Until you receive "Start" you will be given different coins that are being inserted into the machine. You have to sum them to have the total money inserted. There is a problem though. Your vending machine only works with 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 coins. If someone tries to insert some other coins, you have to display "Cannot accept {money}", where the value is formatted to the second digit after the decimal point and not add it to the total money. On the next few lines until you receive "End" you will be given products to purchase. Your machine has, however, only "Nuts", "Water", "Crisps", "Soda", "Coke". The prices are: 2.0, 0.7, 1.5, 0.8, 1.0 respectively. If the person tries to purchase a not existing product, print "Invalid product". Be careful that the person may try to purchase a product for which he doesn't have money. In that case, print "Sorry, not enough money". If the person purchases a product successfully print "Purchased {product name}". After the "End" command, print the money that is left formatted to the second decimal point in the format "Change: {money left}".

8.	Triangle of Numbers
Write a program that receives a number – n and prints a triangle from 1 to n as in the examples.

9.	Orders
We are placing N orders at a time. You need to calculate the price on the following formula:
((daysInMonth * capsulesCount) * pricePerCapsule)
Input / Constraints
•	On the first line, you will receive integer N – the count of orders the shop will receive.
•	For each order, you will receive the following information:
o	Price per capsule - floating-point number in the range [0.00…5000.00].
o	Days – integer in the range [1…31].
o	Capsules count - integer in the range [0…7000000].
The input will be in the described format, there is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output should consist of N + 1 line. For each order, you must print a single line in the following format:
•	"The price for the coffee is: ${price}"
On the last line, you need to print the total price in the following format:
•	 "Total: ${totalPrice}"
The price must be formatted to 2 decimal places. 

10.	Padawan Equipment
Yoda is starting his newly created Jedi academy. So, he asked Master George Lucas to buy the needed equipment. The number of items depends on how many students will sign up. The equipment for the Padawan contains lightsabers, belts, and robes.
You will be given the amount of money George Lucas has, the number of students, and the prices of each item. You have to help George Lucas calculate if the money he has is enough to buy all of the equipment or how much more money he needs. 
Because the lightsabers sometimes break, George Lucas should buy 10% more, rounded up to the next integer. Also, every sixth belt is free.
•	If the calculated price of the equipment is less or equal to the money George Lucas has:
"The money is enough - it would cost {the cost of the equipment}lv."
•	If the calculated price of the equipment is more than the money George Lucas has:
 "George Lucas will need {neededMoney}lv more."
•	All prices must be rounded to two digits after the decimal point.

11.	*Rage Expenses
As a MOBA challenger player, Peter has the bad habit of trashing his PC when he loses a game and rage quits. His gaming setup consists of a headset, mouse, keyboard, and display. You will receive Peter's lost games count. 
Every second lost game, Peter trashes his headset.
Every third lost game, Peter trashes his mouse.
When Peter trashes both his mouse and headset in the same lost game, he also trashes his keyboard.
Every second time when he trashes his keyboard, he also trashes his display. 
You will receive the price of each item in his gaming setup. Calculate his rage expenses for renewing his gaming equipment.

Readds skull facemask and facepaint (#5042)

# About the pull request
It readds two items that were removed in the past for no valid reason
(in my opinion), since it was a targeted PR against a specific player I
do not think it should've been removed.

# Explain why it's good for the game

It looks nice and fits the atmosphere, adding it will help players
customize their characters without being too loud.
The removal reason of "You'd get laughed at for wearing it IRL" is

Eggsac carrier revival (#4716)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

[Forum Thread](https://forum.cm-ss13.com/t/eggsac-carrier-revival/4711)

# About the pull request

The concept of this PR is to find a middle ground between the current
eggsac carrier and the pre #4459 eggsac carrier.

This PR will make the following changes. (From this point "normal weeds"
can be substituted for "off hive weeds" Placing eggs on hive weeds is
**unchanged**.)

- Eggsac carrier can once again place eggs on normal weeds.
- Eggsac carrier can only place 4 eggs at once on normal weeds.
- If the Eggsac places more than 4 eggs on normal weeds, their oldest
placed egg will die. No hugger release.
- Eggs placed on normal weeds have a maximum lifetime of 5 MINUTES after
which they will die. No hugger release.
- Eggs placed on normal weeds have a 1 MINUTE life whilst the carrier is
further than 14 tiles away from them.
- If the carrier dies, all of their sustained eggs die.

# Explain why it's good for the game

Eggsac carrier at the moment is in a bit of a poor place and has gone
from being very strong to quite poor. Considering the limitation of
having to place only on hive weeds.
The majority of feedback I read against eggsac carrier was with the
quantity of eggs able to be placed, as well as the locations they can be
placed in, all across the map and with impunity.

This PR aims to address those concerns to make the eggsac both less
infuriating to play against while still being satisfying to play as a
frontline support or as a stealthy trapper.

Eggs can no longer be placed all over the map because of the 4 egg limit
off weeds, so the carrier has to think where they want to impact the
map. The carrier also has to stay within a reasonable distance to where
they are impacting with their eggs which localises their impact to their
immediate play area. The carrier also has to be more reactive to current
events as they cannot place an egg which then becomes useful 30 minutes
later.

Killing the carrier also has a small reward as in addition to removing a
xeno from the game, the eggs they are sustaining are cleared. If a
carrier is supporting the front and dies, the marines don't then have to
clear X number of eggs AFTER the kill.

# Testing Photographs and Procedure

1. Spawn as egg carrier.
2. Plant egg on normal weeds.
3. Move 15+ tiles away.
4. Wait 1 minute
5. OR Wait 5 minutes within 14 tiles.
6. Kill the carrier.

The 5 minute lifetime of the eggs will also clear the eggs in the case
that the carrier is admin deleted, or some other weird stuff happens
which doesn't result in a death. This will also catch carriers
de-evolving

-->

Builds on previous "prelude" PRs in the following steps:
 * Ports /tg/ body_position and mobility_flags
* Fixes some interaction requirements to use stun/mobility rather than
lying/knocked_down
* Ports /tg/ granular status updates, ie. status propagating through
handlers and signals. This includes changes to resting, buckling, and
lying down human transforms.
 * Wires our status effect system to it directly
* Removes `update_canmove` from existence completely as not needed
anymore

Because step 1 and 2 require updating all the gameplay logic using them,
this PR modifies a lot of files.

Part 2 will move the actual status effects to /tg/ status_effects,
resolving our timing problems.

[Fleet] Fix inability to upgrade agents from 8.10.4 -> 8.11 (#170974)

## Summary

Closes https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/169825

This PR adds logic to Fleet's `/api/agents/available_versions` endpoint
that will ensure we periodically try to fetch from the live product
versions API at https://www.elastic.co/api/product_versions to make sure
we have eventual consistency in the list of available agent versions.

Currently, Kibana relies entirely on a static file generated at build
time from the above API. If the API isn't up-to-date with the latest
agent version (e.g. kibana completed its build before agent), then that
build of Kibana will never "see" the corresponding build of agent.

This API endpoint is cached for two hours to prevent overfetching from
this external API, and from constantly going out to disk to read from
the agent versions file.

## To do
- [x] Update unit tests
- [x] Consider airgapped environments

## On airgapped environments

In airgapped environments, we're going to try and fetch from the
`product_versions` API and that request is going to fail. What we've
seen happen in some environments is that these requests do not "fail
fast" and instead wait until a network timeout is reached.

I'd love to avoid that timeout case and somehow detect airgapped
environments and avoid calling this API at all. However, we don't have a
great deterministic way to know if someone is in an airgapped
environment. The best guess I think we can make is by checking whether
`xpack.fleet.registryUrl` is set to something other than
`https://epr.elastic.co`. Curious if anyone has thoughts on this.

## Screenshots

## To test

1. Set up Fleet Server + ES + Kibana
2. Spin up a Fleet Server running Agent v8.11.0
3. Enroll an agent running v8.10.4 (I used multipass)
4. Verify the agent can be upgraded from the UI

Ok, this is a lot of code churn, so here goes:
- remove every instance of hooking stac cvars. this is completely unneeded and is a nooby habit, since it's literally a dereference and a microoptimization in exchange for horrible unreadable dogshit code. and now that i'm using sarus's vscode extension i can just use IntValue/BoolValue and other builtins instead of relying on my memory. Thanks sarrus.
- remove stac_enabled. why did that exist?
- rename stac_verbose_info to stac_debug
- fix countless bugs with cvar caching / lateloading
- fix at least one known bug with sv cheats
- fix at least one known bug with stac log to file
- more to come

Vehicle autofire (#4959)

# About the pull request

Convert vehicle hardpoints from using their bespoke firing system to one
structured closely on handheld guns and deployables such as the M2C. Now
using the `autofire` component. Much like handheld weapons it is capable
of different firemodes (semi/burst/auto) and changing targets during
fire.

Hardpoints were converted to match their old effectiveness as closely as
possible; this is intended as a quality of life improvement, not a
rebalance. Damage, AP, range, ammo, etc were not touched.

Fire rates were copied over directly. Single-fire weapons with long
delays were made semi-auto (e.g. LTB), and those with short delays were
made full-auto (e.g. autocannon). Burst-fire weapons with significant
extra delays after the burst remained burst-fire (cupola, smokescreen),
and the rest were converted to full-auto (e.g. dual cannon). While
changing firemodes is easily implemented, no weapon seemed a good
candidate for more than one firemode and so that is omitted for now.

Scatter was approximated. The existing `accuracy` functioned as a
percent chance the shot would stray one tile from the target. Gun-style
`scatter` is instead a cone of fire in degrees. No direct conversion is
possible, so scatter values are roughly set such that firing at a tile
at the edge of the screen should "feel" about as accurate. Closer ranges
would experience less spread than before, longer ranges more.

The buffing weapon sensor module was adjusted to work with the new
firing system, and effects hardpoint scatter angle and firing rate.
Vehicle buffs still use multipliers instead of adding/subtracting as
handheld guns do, as a flat +/- adjustment to fire delay would have a
significantly different effect on slow firing weapons (e.g. LTB) vs fast
firing (e.g. autocannon). One major difference is that burstfire delays
are effected and buffs increases the burst density. Before, there was a
single cooldown initiated at the start of the burst, and only that
cooldown was modified by the buff. Now, since the inter-burst delay is
needed by the `autofire` component both the inter-burst delay and the
after-burst delay are modified by buffs.

Activating non-selected hardpoints was removed as not compatible. The
issue is that tracking a single click's modifiers is no longer
sufficient, it has to track through the whole mousedown-to-mouseup
period and the user can change multiple click modifiers in that time. I
could not find a method that was satisfactory without a much bigger
overhaul of vehicle controls than I'd like to take on in a PR not meant
for it. I'm sure it can be done, but that brings up the question of if
that's even the control scheme we'd want, in a PR that was never meant
to ask that question let alone answer it.

## About The Pull Request

Tl;dr - Took the explosive granter off the construction loadout of CE
(why did they have it, they already had the one with C4 with that
trait.......... leftover Yellowstone change) and gave it instead to the
Logistics Officer since they realistically should have it as they do gun
crafting.

Also - it makes it so LO's can make mortar rounds now. Also-also, took
away the X4 off CE since it's strong. Gave them 2 C4 instead.

## Why It's Good For The Game

LO buff omg

Khans map (My Git borked on last pr) (#285)

********* EDIT ***********
My last pr got closed because I was having errors with my github and had
to wipe it. The khamp is 90% the same as before. I removed the upper
level defense post and removed the lower sentry post's weather cover. I
added more trash piles in khamp, added an advanced workbench and two
advanced salvage spawns in the back thats protected with indestructible
walls so it cant be cheesed. I also made sure it was at the very end of
the bunker so it had to be earned. The back dungeon is much harder than
any other factions "down river". I also removed the wasteland medical
spawners, and replaced them with a few static meds. While I was mapping,
I fixed the church's zoning by heavens night, basically giving it a
roof.
********* EDIT ***********


Updated the khans, gave khamp character and flow, as well as beautifying
it. most of what was in the khamp as far as resources, was moved over
give or take a few things. moved the khans "down river" to the bunker
they use to run out of, filled with plenty of mobs. Most notable gear in
the back is one set of Khan armor(full helm and coat) as well as some
money and gunbook 3. Past servers, khans had a gun book down river. They
have to fight the khan killer ghoul and his little gang of attack
ghouls, and several mirelurks and a few mirelurk nests.

Gunpowder, metal, glass are with the spiders, and bbq sauce, mustard
packets, and hot sauce packets are guarded by mister handies and
cockroach. I added a few Easter eggs and funnies in khamp, that
including past khan dog, sunflower (forgor gurilla), a few batteries in
the river because, where else are you suppose to toss out your old car
batteries.

Khans base, while a bit bigger, does stay within the old dense rock
space they could mine out and stay within.

robot update/rework (#204)

## About The Pull Request

does a lot of changes to robots
all changes TBD

robots are now much faster (0.3 slowdown instead of 1).
they are also somewhat tankier across the board to compensate for their
lack of armor (0 armor btw)

robot modules have been revisited:
medical assaultron was rolled into medical borg and is now an altskin.
mining borg now has a shovel, and its emag module is a rocketsledge that
mines better and has 12 less damage.
engiborg's emag module is also a rocketsledge (uncreative)
assaultron was rolled into secborg and is now an altskin.
vtec has been nerfed significantly from -1 slowdown to -0.25

gutsy flamethrower nerfed significantly: 1s firedelay, 33% lower
projectile count, actual energy cost

all robots now have the wastebot faction, since all selectable sprites
are fo13 robots anyways. this also makes slugs do 90 damage to them,
which is extremely funny and something i might remove. again, tbd



## Why It's Good For The Game

as long as they're pickable they should be functional

A wise man, abandoning the principle of darkness, should cultivate what
  is pure. Leaving home for the homeless life, let him seek his joy in the
  solitude which people find so hard to enjoy, and, abandoning sensual
  pleasures, let him cleanse himself of inner defilements, looking on
  nothing as his own.

Manually copy trailing attributes on a resize (#12637)

## THE WHITE WHALE

This is a fairly naive fix for this bug. It's not terribly performant,
but neither is resize in the first place.

When the buffer gets resized, typically we only copy the text up to the
`MeasureRight` point, the last printable char in the row. Then we'd just
use the last char's attributes to fill the remainder of the row. 

Instead, this PR changes how reflow behaves when it gets to the end of
the row. After we finish copying text, then manually walk through the
attributes at the end of the row, and copy them over. This ensures that
cells that just have a colored space in them get copied into the new
buffer as well, and we don't just blat the last character's attributes
into the rest of the row. We'll do a similar thing once we get to the
last printable char in the buffer, copying the remaining attributes.

This could DEFINITELY be more performant. I think this current
implementation walks the attrs _on every cell_, then appends the new
attrs to the new ATTR_ROW. That could be optimized by just using the
actual iterator. The copy after the last printable char bit is also
especially bad in this regard. That could likely be a blind copy - I
just wanted to get this into the world.

Finally, we now copy the final attributes to the correct buffer: the new
one.  We used to copy them to the _old_ buffer, which we were about to
destroy.

## Validation

I'll add more gifs in the morning, not enough time to finish spinning a
release Terminal build with this tonight. 

Closes #32 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Closes #12567

Bluff eval (#1402)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

bluff

### Eval description

Evaluate how well a model can play (a variant of) the game of bluff,
also known as "liar's dice".

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a game of deception - you have to deceive your opponent and
understand when you are deceived.
Models performing very well on this eval could also be capable of
deceiving humans in real-life scenarios.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

<details>
  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>

  ### Eval

- Rewrite almost the whole bot, _again_, to support multiple chat services
- Add Discord as a service
- Changes to the command parser to add enum support
- Changes to command organization
- Lots of other small things that I can't include here

this was a pain in the ass, but boy it was worth it! we're one step closer to a universal chatbot framework with this

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Replaces the fake monkey cube in Birdshot tool storage with a less lethal one, adds something else fun (#8860)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/80030
-----

## About The Pull Request
One of the "monkey cubes" in Birdshot's tool storage was actually a
gorilla cube. This was funny up until people realized it was a thing and
now people are using it intentionally to grief. I'd rather not.

It's a different cube now. I don't want to spoil it but it won't kill
anyone, just make people laugh.

I added a different fun item to another tile in tool storage. Again, no
spoilers, read the code if you really want to know what it was.

## Why It's Good For The Game
I like the "cube says it's a monkey but it's not" joke. It was funny
when people thought it was a monkey, used it, and got killed by it.
Problem is, people know what it is now and have used it for grief
purposes, so we can't have nice things. Gorillas are stupid hard to kill
and will de-limb people by looking at them.

I wanted to add something else fun to replace it that isn't just the
exact same joke but now it won't kill you, so I did.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
del: Replaced the "monkey cube" in Birdshot's tool storage with a
different "monkey cube".
add: Added a fun surprise item to Birdshot's tool storage to compensate
for the above change.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Ports feral cats and feral cat grenades from Hippie (#8867)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/80031
-----

## About The Pull Request
Feral Cats are just a hostile variant of cats that will fuck you up if
they see you. They are added solely for the sake of feral cat grenades -
a new, interesting, and fuzzy way to get out of a jam or just wreak
havoc around you. Each one costs 5 TC and spawns 5 really pissed off
cats to chase down assistants in the hallway.

They don't currently ignore traitors or the person who threw them - I
haven't worked out how to do that with our faction system (Hippie gave
them the syndicate faction but traitors don't get that on our codebase).
If anyone wants to contribute or help me suss that out it'll be cool,
otherwise just don't be around if there's nobody else for them to maul.

## Why It's Good For The Game
They're funny.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
add: Added a new hostile variant of cats, "feral cats".
add: Added a new traitor item, "feral cat grenades". For 5 TC, you too
can throw a grenade at someone and make five cats maul them to death.

Day five part 2 solution

First one I didn't get day of sadly :(. Turns out I had an off by one
error when getting seed mappings and that completely screwed me night of
day 5 (wasted the whole evening Sadge). Also cheated to get the answer
last night, but I didn't end up using anything from that solution, I
just updated the brute force solution to use threads.

Fix: to-hit formula for player experience levels 21 to 29 inclusive.

From nearly the very beginning, EvilHack had adopted a modified to-hit
formula from SporkHack. One of the changes was a cap for gaining to-hit
bonuses after experience level 20. Vanilla's formula allows the player
to gain one extra point to-hit for every experience level gained, here
that stopped after level 20. Later on I had added a boost at reaching
level 30, but this still left a noticeable gap from levels 21 to 29.

This commit addresses that. Instead of no increase at all, the increase
occurs more slowly. You still get the extra point to-hit per level from
2-20, then get an extra point at levels 22/24/26/28/30, and then still
get the extra boost at level 30. Overall, the player will gain five
extra points of to-hit points vs before. On the surface this may not
seem like much, but this is actually a significant boost compared to how
things were prior.

Enjoy 😁

## Why It's Good For The Game

Modularity good.
Code organizing good.

Solved the first leet code problem of the week

This was interesting given that it felt a little bit underexplained
though, as usual, yah boy beats 100% of other c++ solutions. The problem
involved converting a string to its integer equivalent under some
specific conditions, simply, implement the std::atoi c++ function.
It had alot of edge cases, and I also noticed one very tiny problem that
has being occurring all around my solutions from leetcode based to
personal, when iterating over a range or just looping in a while loop,
we use variables to represent the state of the solution at any given
moment in the loop, the problem is, when is the state representing the
previous, current and next iteration.
For example:
	uint totalValue = 1;
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		std::cout << '[' << i << "] Before: " << totalValue << '\n';
		totalValue *= 10;
		std::cout << '[' << i << "] After: " << totalValue << '\n';
	}
Output:
	0 Before: 1
	0 After 10
	1 Before 10
	1 After 100
	2 Before 100
	3 After 1000
	4 Before 1000
	5 After 10000
In this example, i represents the current state of the iteration, while
totalValue depends on where it is used, in the before statement, it
represents the state of the last iteration and on the after statement,
it represents the state of the next iteration or maybe the current, who
knows. The problem comes to how you use it, if you wanted it to go along
the loop then use it after assigning it and if it is always behind,
assign it as the last statement in the loop and also after exiting the
loop, if totalValue is to be used, remember its state, is it behind,
ahead or current. This bug is hard to trace down, it bothered me a lot
in this solution as well as the int_exp_growing function I implemented
in python when creating the _create_growing_map function. It was NASTY
to even think about.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Removes Clone Damage (#8906)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/80109
-----

## About The Pull Request

Does what it says on the tin. We don't have any "special" sources of
clone damage left in the game, most of them are rather trivial so I
bunched them together into this PR.

Notable things removed:
- Clonexadone, because its entire thing was centered around clone damage
- Decloner gun, it's also centered around cloning damage, I couldn't
think of a replacement mechanic and nobody uses it anyways
- Everything else already dealt clone damage as a side (rainbow knife
deals a random damage type for example), so these sources were removed
## Why It's Good For The Game

Consider the four sources of normal damage that you can get: Brute,
Burn, Toxins and Oxygen. These four horsemen of the apocalypse are very
well put together and it's no surprise that they are in the game, as you
can fit any way of damaging a mob into them. Getting beaten to death by
a security officer? Brute damage. Running around on fire? Burn damage.
Poisoned or irradiated? Toxin damage. Suffocating in space? Brute, burn
and oxygen damage. Technically there's also stamina damage but that's
its own ballpark and it also makes sense why we have a damage number for
it.

Picture this now: We have this cool mechanic called "clone pods" where
you can magically revive dead people with absolute ease. We don't want
it to be for free though, it comes at a cost. This cost is clone damage,
and it serves to restrain people from abusing cloning.

Fast forward time a bit and cloning is now removed from the game. What
stays with us is a damage number that is intrinsically tied to the
context of a removed feature. It was a good idea that we had it for that
feature at the time, but now it just sits there. It's the odd one out
from all the other damage types. You can easily explain why your blade
dealt brute damage, but how are you going to fit clone damage into any
context without also becoming extremely specific?

My point is: **clone damage is conceptually a flawed mechanic because it
is too specific**. That is the major issue why no one uses it, and why
that makes it unworthy of being a damage stat.
Don't take my word for it though, because a while ago we only had a
handful of sources for this damage type in the game. And in most of the
rounds where you saw this damage, it came from only one department. It's
not worthwhile to keep it around as a damage number. People also didn't
know what to do with this damage type, so we currently have two ways of
healing clone damage: Cryotubes as a roundstart way of healing clone
damage and Rezadone, which instantly sets your clone damage to 0 on the
first tick. As a medical doctor, when was the last time you saw someone
come in with clone damage and thought to yourself, "Oh, this person has
clone damage, I cannot wait to heal them!" ?

Now we have replacements for these clone damage sources. Slimes? Slime
status effect that deals brute instead of clone. Cosmic heretics? Random
organ damage, because their mechanics are already pretty fleshed out.
Decloning virus? The virus operated as a "ticking timebomb" which used
cloning damage as the timer, so it has been reworked to not use clone
damage. What remains after all this is now a basically unused damage
type. Every specific situation that used clone damage is now relying on
another damage type. Now it's time to put clone damage to rest once and
for all.

Sure, you can technically add some form of cellular degradation in the
future, but it shouldn't be a damage number. The idea of your cells
being degraded is a cool concept, don't get me wrong, but make it a
status effect or maybe even a wound for that matter.
## Changelog

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].
With this patch a process can be killed via:

 */
Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

fix(oiiotool): --autocc bugfix and color config inventory cleanup (#4060)

The important bug fix is in oiiotool image input when autocc is used,
where we reversed the sense of a test and did the autocc-upon-input if
the file's color space was equivalent to the scene_linear space
(pointlessly), and skipped the conversion if they were different (oh no,
big bug!).

Along the way:

* Add missing try/catch around OCIO call that should have had it.

* Some very ugly SPI-specific recognize-by-name color space heuristics.
I hate this, sorry, but it solves a really important problem for me.

* A bunch of additional debugging messages during color space inventory,
enabled only when debugging, so nobody should see these but me.

* A couple places where we canonicalize the spelling of
"oiio:ColorSpace".

Note that there is still an issue with the color space classification
using OCIO 2.3+'s identification of built-in equivalents by name. These
are shockingly expensive. I will return to this later.

Check for boolean values as argument on pow function.  (#114133)

Hello everyone! 😄
Also @lezcano , nice to meet you! :)

Sorry if I miss anything, this is my first time around here. 🙃

This PR basically makes the same behaviour for cuda when using `torch.pow`. Basically Python considers True as 1 and False as 0. I just added this check into `pow` function. From what I understood, when I do `.equal` for `Scalar` that is boolean, I'm sure that types match so that won't cause more trouble.

I know that the issue suggest to disable this case but that could be a little more complicated, in my humble opinion. And that can create some compability problems too, I guess.

My argument is that code below is correct for native language, so I guess it does makes sense sending booleans as Scalar.

```
$ x = True
$ x + x
2
```

This was my first test:
```
Python 3.12.0 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Oct  2 2023, 17:29:18) [GCC 11.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import torch
>>> torch.pow(torch.tensor([1, 2], device='cuda'), True)
tensor([1, 2], device='cuda:0')
>>> torch.pow(torch.tensor([1, 2]), True)
tensor([1, 2])
>>> torch.pow(torch.tensor([1, 2]), False)
tensor([1, 1])
>>> torch.pow(torch.tensor([1, 2], device='cuda'), False)
tensor([1, 1], device='cuda:0')
```

I've run `test_torch.py` and got following results, so my guess is that I didn't break anything. I was just looking for a test that uses linear regression, as suggested.

```
Ran 1619 tests in 52.363s

OK (skipped=111)
[TORCH_VITAL] Dataloader.enabled		 True
[TORCH_VITAL] Dataloader.basic_unit_test		 TEST_VALUE_STRING
[TORCH_VITAL] CUDA.used		 true

```
(I can paste whole log, if necessary)

If this is a bad idea overall, dont worry about it. It's not a big deal, it's actually a two line change 😅  so can we talk of how do things in a different strategy.

For the record I've signed the agreement already. And I didn't run linter because it's not working 😞 . Looks like PyYaml 6.0 is broken and there's a 6.0.1 fix already but I have no idea how to update that 😅

Defang type inference.

So far the prelude and some of the libraries work but I haven't updated the
tests or the examples. I'm going to keep working in this state as I add
expressions-in-types.

My goal here is to make the type inference pass simpler so that we can modify it
more easily, particularly adding expressions in types. I also want the type
inference process to be more legible to users. It should be easy to reason about
what type inference can do and we should be able to provide feedback about what
it did.

The main principle I'm trying out is that type inference should be (1) local and
(2) feed-forward. "Local" means I don't want inference variables spanning
multiple expressions. "Feed-forward" means that type information should flow in
the same direction as ordinary data - you get the type of an expression, given
the types of its free variables, by looking at the types of its subexpressions.
You don't figure out the type of a binder based on its occurrences.

Here are the main changes to type inference. "Fully known" means "contains no
inference variables, including in the definitions and types of its free
variables".

  1. All variables have fully-known types, and let-bound variables have fully-known
     definitions too.
  2. Each UExpr is either processed "top-down" (i.e. checking it against a
     fully-known type) or "bottom-up" (inferring a fully-known type). There's no
     "partial checking" where you check a term against, say `?a -> ?b` where
     `?a` and `?b` are inference variables.
  3. Inference variables only exist for the duration of a single (n-ary)
     function application.
  4. Lambda-like binders (including `for` binders) must either be explicitly
     annotated or their type must be evident from the top-down type we're
     checking against. The latter case lets us still write things like `each xs
     \x. x + x` without annotating the `x` binder. The `\x` behaves more like a
     `let` binder than a lambda binder in this context. This is also the reason
     we can't adopt truly brutalist type inference and do *everything*
     bottom-up.

Some things are better now:
  * ~1000 loc removed
  * "cheap reduction" is now well-typed because there are no inference variables
    in either the term we're reducing or its environment.
  * We now tend to ask "are these types equal?" rather than "what would these
    variables need to be for these types to be equal?". The latter question
    doesn't work so well when we move beyond syntactic equality and start
    talking about equivalence relations.
  * We can now reliably use features that require fully-known types, like dot
    method resolution.

Other things look worse but I think they're actually better:
   * To support inference, functions should appear last in an argument list. For
     example, we should prefer `each` to its flipped version, `map` (I actually
     deleted `map` from the prelude). This is so that we see the table argument
     first, which tells us the element type, which tells us the type of the
     binder of the per-element function. But function arguments should go last
     anyway, for syntactic reasons. And even before this change, if you put a
     function argument first, it might type check but you wouldn't be able to
     use type-dispatch features (like dot method resolution). This just forces
     us to be more consistent.
   * No more defaults. I got rid of these because they require non-local
     inference. But I think they were confusing anyway for exactly that reason.
     Now you have to be explicit, writing `n = 10 :: Nat` or `n : Nat = 10` (we
     should standardize on one or the other) instead of `n = 10`.
   * `for i.` now usually requries an annotated `i`. But I think it ends up
     being more readable. And for the very common case where you're just using
     `i` to index into a single table, it's better to use `each` anyway.

Other things are actually bad
  * `Nothing`. Sometimes we now have to write `Nothing :: Maybe Nat`. (We should
    be able to write it as `Nothing(a=Nat)` but that doesn't work yet.)
  * `0 + x` will fail now. You can write `x + 0` just fine, because the type of
    `0` is obtained from the type of `x` but if you want to write it in the
    other order you have to write `(0::Nat) + x` or something. It's frustrating
    because `+` is such an obviously symmetric operator. There's a similar thing
    with `case`, where the order of the cases influences whether inference
    succeeds or fails (it wasn't perfect before either - the order could still
    influence whether dot-notation would work).

I'm not sure how to fix these. "Backwards" type inference is just really useful
in handling polymorphic constants like `0` and `Nothing`. (In my opinion this is
the *only* place it's useful.) I'm tempted to just say that we should get in the
habit of annotating these constants or supplying explicit type arguments. Maybe
`Nothing` should take its type argument explicitly so by default so you write
`Nothing(Nat)` or `Nothing(_)` if you're sure you're in top-down checking mode.
Then you can at least avoid the redundant `Maybe` in `Nothing :: Maybe Nat`.

Add 2015/mills1/try.sh + format/typo checks

The try.sh script runs the make command in the judges' remarks to make
it easier.

A warning is that if you have good eye-hand coordination and you're good
at games and you have too much time you might end up falling asleep
playing it as you'll probably never die. I only died because I was
trying to mark a reminder complete on the other side of the screen at
the same time as playing .. and I almost survived that .. and 'Cody's
also blind' as the joke goes in the family. That's probably why I ended
up dying. At that point I already had over 90 points.

Still the purpose is to make it easier to play if the default settings
are too frustrating. I contemplated playing with other settings but I
decided not to. An example where it might be improved is to let the user
pass in the environmental variables to override should they wish to but
it is not even clear to me how the variables should be sanitised so
that's an argument against it.

feat(examples): add p/demo/seqid (#1378)

A very simple ID generation package, designed to be used in combination
with `avl.Tree`s to push values in order.

The name was originally `seqid` (sequential IDs), but after saying it a
few times I realised it was close to "squid" and probably would be more
fun if I named it that way ;)

There's another piece of functionality that I want to add, which is a
way to create simple base32-encoded IDs. This depends on #1290. These
would also guarantee alphabetical ordering, so a list of them can be
easily sorted and you'd get it in the same order they were created. They
would likely be 13 characters long, but I'm also thinking of making a
compact version which works from [0,2^35) which is 7 chracters, and then
smoothly transitions over to the 13 characters version when the ID is
reached.

(I've experience with both base64 and base32 encoded IDs as 64-bit
numbers, as I used both systems. The advantage of base32 is that it
makes IDs case insensitive, all the while being at most 13 bytes instead
of 11 for base64.)

In GnoChess, we used simple sequential IDs combined with
[`zeroPad9`](https://github.com/gnolang/gnochess/blob/7e841191a4a0a94c0d46bc977458bd6b757eab5e/realm/chess.gno#L287-L296)
to create IDs which were both readable and sortable. I want to make a
more "canonical" solution to this which does not have a upper limit at 1
billion entries.

Meat Hook Rework (Accidental Features) (#80002)

## About The Pull Request

Or, how I tried to kill `/datum/forced_movement` but got absolutely
clonged.

Actually, I did kill `/datum/forced_movement`. It was only used in one
spot so I just went ahead and cooked it into a special utility datum
that should only be used in one spot. We can optimize the code later or
something, but I like the way it is right now (pretty much status quo
without the potential of someone using a depreciated framework).

Alright, there were also like 3 `TODO`s (4 if you count the move loop
comment (which is ehhhh)). I naively tried to tackle them a very hard
way, but then I just realized I could use the fancy new datum I cooked
up and wow they're all solved now. The hook looks so fucking good now.

* The code is overall more streamlined, with all of the post-projectile
work being handled by a special datum (I wanted it to be handled by the
hook but the timings were all based on SSFastprocess so datum it is).
Forced movement is killed but we just salvaged whatever we needed from
it.
* More traits to ensure we don't cheese in a way we're not supposed to
* A very sexy chain will spawn when you drag your kill in (this wasn't
there before but I fixeded it :3)
* The firer will actually get grounded when they try and shoot the chain
out. They get grounded for 0.25 seconds unless they hit something. I
don't know how the timing is but I think it's fair.
* We also add a unique suicide act, because I noticed we did the
"magical" one previously, which big-league sucked.
* More traits to ensure less cheese! I like how nice it is now.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The meat hook really makes you _feel_ like Roadhog from Overwatch.
Resolves a bunch of old TODOs while getting rid of a completely obsolete
framework in a really neat way. I don't typically like mixing balances
and refactors but these TODOs were getting crusty man i just wanted to
get them out of the way
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: The Meat Hook will now "ground" you whenever you fire it out at
someone. You get a very small immobilization every time you fire, which
"upgrades" to a full immobilization whenever you actually hit an atom
and start to drag it in.
fix: A chain should now show up as you drag in something with the meat
hooks.
fix: Meat hooks should no longer play the "magical gun" suicide if you
were to use it, but instead do their own unique thing.

Blood brothers is now a single person conversion antagonist (#79971)

## About The Pull Request
Instead of choosing 2-3 brothers, *one* person will be selected and
given a flash which can convert one other person over. In accordance to
the existing 10% chance for 3 members, there is a 10% chance that the
first person converted will receive a flash of their own.

Expectation is people will flash a friend or a robust guy or whatever.
My intent is primarily to see if this kind of blood brothers is more
enjoyable to play with/against, and if their inclusion in a round
increases the general chaos of it. My theory is that since most likely
blood brothers will be people who know each other, that it can become
more consistently interesting to the rest of the crew. That or they just
murderbone together idk

Fikou and head admins said they wanted this to replace rather than add
which I agree with.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Keeps the sandboxy aspect of blood brothers (no uplink) while likely
making it more enjoyable to play. Conversion is equally as simple as
revs for the user, and is just as intuitive to the one being converted
since there are no new mechanics thrown in your face.

Blood brothers is currently disabled everywhere on the main servers
except for MRP. I think this form will be more appealing to all
rulesets. If left enabled, Dynamic now has more antagonists to make
rounds diverse with and I want that

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Instead of teaming up random people together, blood brothers will
now start out with one player and let them convert a single other person
over to blood brother using a flash.

I can't for the life of me remember what changed to get us here.

AOTAutograd: handle set_(), detect metadata mutations that cancel out (#111554)

This should be enough to get @voznesenskym 's FSDP branch to plumb `set_()` through AOTAutograd properly and have everything properly no-op out. Main changes are:

(1) graph break on `aten::set_.source_Tensor_storage_offset` (we could support it but it isn't needed, seems safer to graph break)

(2) Functionalization: add a "proper" functionalization kernel for `aten::set_.source_Tensor`. The previous one we had was codegen'd and it was wrong (it would just clone() and call set_(), which does not do the right thing). I also manually mark on the `FunctionalTensorWrapper` when a given tensor has been mutated by a `set_()` call.

(3) AOTAutograd: I added a new field, `InputAliasInfo.mutates_storage_metadata`, so we can distinguish between "regular" metadata mutations, and metadata mutations due to `set_()` calls. This is mainly because at runtime, one requires calling `as_strided_()` to fix up metadata, while the other requires calling `set_()`.

(4) Made AOTAutograd's detection for metadata mutations / set_() mutations smarter and detect no-ops (if the storage and metadata are all the same).

I also killed `was_updated()` and `was_metadata_updated()`, and replaced them with (existing) `has_data_mutation() ` and (new) `has_data_mutation()`, which can more accurately distinguish between data-mutation vs. `set_()` calls vs. metadata-mutation

**This PR is still silently correct in one case though**, which I'd like to discuss more. In particular, this example:
```
def f(x):
    x_view = x.view(-1)
    x.set_(torch.ones(2))
    x_view.mul_(2)
    return
```

If you have an input that experiences both a data-mutation **and** a `x_old.set_(x_new)` call, there are two cases:

(a) the data mutation happened on the storage of `x_new`. This case should be handled automatically: if x_new is a graph intermediate then we will functionalize the mutation. If x_new is a different graph input, then we will perform the usual `copy_()` on that other graph input

(b) the data mutation happened on the storage of `x_old`. This is more of a pain to handle, and doesn't currently work. At runtime, the right thing to do is probably something like:
```

def functionalized_f(x):
    x_view = x.view(-1)
    # set_() desugars into a no-op; later usages of x will use x_output
    x_output = torch.ones(2)
    # functionalize the mutation on x_view
    x_view_updated = x.mul(2)
    x_updated = x_view_updated.view(x.shape)
    # x experienced TWO TYPES of mutations; a data mutation and a metatadata mutation
    # We need to return both updated tensors in our graph
    return x_updated, x_output
def runtime_wrapper(x):
    x_data_mutation_result, x_set_mutation_result = compiled_graph(x)
    # First, perform the data mutation on x's old storage
    x.copy_(x_data_mutation_result)
    # Then, swap out the storage of x with the new storage
    x.set_(x_set_mutation_result)
```

There are two things that make this difficult to do though:

(1) Functionalization: the functionalization rule for `set_()` will fully throw away the old `FunctionalStorageImpl` on the graph input. So if there are any mutations to that `FunctionalStorageImpl` later on in the graph, the current graph input won't know about it. Maybe we can have a given `FunctionalTensorWrapper` remember all previous storages that it had, and track mutations on all of them - although this feels pretty complicated.

(2) AOTAutograd now needs to know that we might have *two* graph outputs that correspond to a single "mutated input", which is annoying.

It's worth pointing out that this issue is probably extremely unlikely for anyone to run into - can we just detect it and error? This feels slightly easier than solving it, although not significantly easier. We would still need `FunctionalTensorWrapper` to keep track of mutations on any of its "previous" storages, so it can report this info back to AOTAutograd so we can raise an error.

Remove old non-InstUI tool config forms

why:
- we feature flagged these, as it was a user-facing UI change. However,
  it made the code atrociously ugly and resulted in duplicated tests. We
  have turned the flag on and no one got upset, so all is well. The
  changes were very subtle anyways.
- Also, speeds up the remaining tests significantly just by replacing
  userEvent.type with userEvent.paste. As in, they take half as long
  now. Still way slower than I would like, but it'll do for now.

closes INTEROP-8132

closes FOO-3829

test-plan:
- checkout this commit and make sure your front-end assets are rebuilt.
- go to any spot the tool configuration forms can be found, such as on
  the course settings page, and make sure each of the forms loads and
  you can actually use them. We thoroughly tested the forms back when we
  first added them, so you don't have to do that much.
- make sure your screenreader can advance through the forms in a
  sensible manner.
