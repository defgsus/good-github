[MIRROR] Deviant Crew antag panel category, Obsessed crew now shown in orbit menu, Paradox Clone orbit tab is now white [MDB IGNORE] (#25803)

* Deviant Crew antag panel category, Obsessed crew now shown in orbit menu, Paradox Clone orbit tab is now white (#80450)

## About The Pull Request

This rounds up the "Other" (Brainwashed, Hypnotised, Wizard Revenge, and
Obsession) antagonist category into the new "Deviant Crew" category.
This tab is white!

Obsessed crew are now displayed in the orbit panel (no other antagonists
in this group are though).

The Spacetime Aberrations (Paradox Clone) group has also been changed to
be white.

Here's how that looks:

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/415b8cbb-7ac3-4e24-9f74-466480c2aab0)
## Why It's Good For The Game

As was the case with paradox clones, observers can already discern when
a player is obsessed. It shouldn't be a pain to observe these guys,
especially when they're a more RP oriented antag that are (usually)
deserving of the audience.

I made paradox clones and obsessed the same color because they're both
in the broader spectrum of "fucked up crew".

Also converts common text entries to a single define. That is good
coding practice I think.
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
qol: Obsessed crewmembers are now displayed in the orbit panel.
qol: The Paradox Clone orbit menu tab is now white. Neat!
/:cl:

* Deviant Crew antag panel category, Obsessed crew now shown in orbit menu, Paradox Clone orbit tab is now white

fixes for teshvali cybernetics (#900)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

# OOPS
So in the previous and now closed PR
(https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/pull/871#issue-2049760879)
I forgot to commit changes to tgstation.dme. So while the files are now
in the code... they're not enabled. Oops.

## About The Pull Request

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

I didn't notice some more minor changes in the testmerge. This rectifies
some of that - new vars, and such. After I fix the new bugs inherent to
this... Which have now been fixed. ~~Although the current version should
still be functional, teshari cybernetic limbs take approximately 10%
more damage than they should due to the missing var. I think. The var is
weird, and honestly seems to be a redundancy? better safe than sorry.~~
This PR actually enables the previous PR and fixes some things which
would have caused minor statistical inconsistencies on the scale of
+-1-5 damage taken.
### Advanced Raptor limbs
Oh, also advanced cybernetic limbs were implemented since the downstream
made them obtainable. They're a bit brighter than the regular limbs.

Fixes & Balance; the Big One (Ready) (#426)

## About The Pull Request
Meganerfs plascutter damage so they're not comically OP. Rebel deleted
all their PRs, so I'm redoing them all in this one too. Currently
includes;
Removes Dumb Chems (https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/pull/424)
Rear Ech becomes Off-Duty + Vet Ranger Tweaks
(https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/pull/371)
Crafting Recipe Adjustments, Explosive Skill Given to More Roles, &
Fixes for Scribes (https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/pull/374)
Gun-Bloat-B-Gone, Fixes to Bolt Actions, Colt 10mm Revolver, AK-112, &
Loadout Changes (https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/pull/418)
Direct excerpt from Gun-Bloat-B-Gone;
This is a massive compiled PR since I had to keep doing the following
while making it:

Issue of the NCR Captain getting a revolver that could deflect 50% of
incoming rounds, this stacked with katanas and worked with shields.
Issue of Vex getting a P-90. I wanted to reduce their slots as well in
this PR but instead I simply added the AK-112 and gave them that. This
is a nerf, sorry dudes but your P-90 was way too fucking cracked.
Bolt actions had WAY too much slowdown to ever be viable. This has been
greatly reduced.
M1 Carbine, Commando Carbine, and Delise Carbine have been removed from
rotation (but will be left in code for now). Reason why is all 3 are
useless due to Smg+pistol buffs and use pistol calibers, which has
damage drop off now. While I personally liked the M1 it didn't have a
niche, wasn't.. great to begin with, and has been thrown to the wayside.
In these guns place other more useful guns have been added to their loot
tier.
Various fire-delay fixes I got complaints about being too high/low.
Adds knockback to the powerfist. I don't actually know WHY people wanted
that back, since imo it made it worse, but whatever. Also buffed its
damage/AP to compete with most other melee weapons.
Removed Paladin Polearm from rotation. Weapon was really - weird? And
was meant for Brotherhood. Since the Ballistic Fist has gotten a good
buff due to fire delay fix, I added it instead to the Enclave Gunny in
its place. This will be way better for them, has a very good niche, and
also gave them a plasma glock with it.
Also, adds two new guns in the place of those removed:

10mm revolver - Reason is this gun existed prior and adds a
lower-caliber revolver using pistol rounds. Gun auto-ejects casings, is
able to compete with the N-99. Basically a harder-hitting, slower
firing, N-99 that cant take attachments.
AK112 - This gun is practically needed and is a 'lore accurate' version
that I could reason. The P-90 and assault carbine are way too good for
round start guns for most roles. As such, I've replaced them with this
gun near entirely. The AK-112 hits as hard as the P90, so 5 less damage,
but also has 2 extra spread over the assault carbine AND, unlike either,
fires at the same RPM as the R-91. So it actually is a real CHOICE if
you're going to use this, or an R-91.
Armor fixes:

Functioning PA now has the same stats as salvaged PA (baring the
slowdown). There was no reason salvaged PA was better than functioning
PA with just 0.1 more slowdown. (Bumped T-51 bullet protection up by 5,
and laser up by 10. Reason was to make this in-line as what it was
prior.)
Enclave PR that has been up has been incorporated baring the plasma
changes. This makes Enclave armor have SLIGHTLY better rad protection
than normal combat armor, and makes their armor craftable.
NCR wound protection has been touched up a tad, it was really bad and I
genuinely feel bad NCR players had to deal with that.
Enclave Changes
Roles were really heavy for their gear. In exchange for letting them
keep their faction gear being high-end, their slots have been reduced to
9 combat slots.

Marines 5 -> 3
Specialist 2 -> 0
Sergeants 2 -> 2
Armored Infantry 0 -> 1
Gunnery Sergeant 1 -> 1
LT 1 -> 1
Synthetic 1 -> 1
Scientists have gone unchanged and have kept both slots.

Also, Sergeants have lost their APA. In exchange, they have been given
Marine armor. The heavy gunner, however, has been given the choice
between a plasma caster and the Minigun and has kept their APA.
Gunnery has gotten XO-1 variant of APA, which is green and SLIGHTLY
better so he sticks out.

Loadout changes are various, took away MP5s, gave them newly converted
R-93's that are single shot 5mm guns. Gave them a trench gun, upon
request, for their alternative loadout. Gave the Gunnery a G-11 and
moved his caster over to the Armored Infantry. Sergeants lost their
carbines, got AK-112s which are more fair for their automatic gear.

## Why It's Good For The Game
No ez mass printable hyperop infinite ammo plasmacutter dual wield
memery. Fixes from Rebels PRs which are all good for the server and
balance as a whole (see links above). Better enclave base. It's still
bad, but it's better. For enclave base, see here;

Allow spreading arguments to commands (#11289)

-->

Finishes implementing https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/10598,
which asks for a spread operator in lists, in records, and when calling
commands.

# Description
<!--
Thank you for improving Nushell. Please, check our [contributing
guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and talk to the core team before making major
changes.

Description of your pull request goes here. **Provide examples and/or
screenshots** if your changes affect the user experience.
-->

This PR will allow spreading arguments to commands (both internal and
external). It will also deprecate spreading arguments automatically when
passing to external commands.

# User-Facing Changes
<!-- List of all changes that impact the user experience here. This
helps us keep track of breaking changes. -->

- Users will be able to use `...` to spread arguments to custom/builtin
commands that have rest parameters or allow unknown arguments, or to any
external command
- If a custom command doesn't have a rest parameter and it doesn't allow
unknown arguments either, the spread operator will not be allowed
- Passing lists to external commands without `...` will work for now but
will cause a deprecation warning saying that it'll stop working in 0.91
(is 2 versions enough time?)

Here's a function to help with demonstrating some behavior:
```nushell
> def foo [ a, b, c?, d?, ...rest ] { [$a $b $c $d $rest] | to nuon }
```

You can pass a list of arguments to fill in the `rest` parameter using
`...`:
```nushell
> foo 1 2 3 4 ...[5 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]
```

If you don't use `...`, the list `[5 6]` will be treated as a single
argument:

```nushell
> foo 1 2 3 4 [5 6] # Note the double [[]]
[1, 2, 3, 4, [[5, 6]]]
```

You can omit optional parameters before the spread arguments:
```nushell
> foo 1 2 3 ...[4 5] # d is omitted here
[1, 2, 3, null, [4, 5]]
```

If you have multiple lists, you can spread them all:
```nushell
> foo 1 2 3 ...[4 5] 6 7 ...[8] ...[]
[1, 2, 3, null, [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]]
```

Here's the kind of error you get when you try to spread arguments to a
command with no rest parameter:

![image](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/assets/45539777/93faceae-00eb-4e59-ac3f-17f98436e6e4)

And this is the warning you get when you pass a list to an external now
(without `...`):


![image](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/assets/45539777/d368f590-201e-49fb-8b20-68476ced415e)


# Tests + Formatting
<!--
Don't forget to add tests that cover your changes.

Make sure you've run and fixed any issues with these commands:

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to check standard code formatting (`cargo
fmt --all` applies these changes)
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used` to
check that you're using the standard code style
- `cargo test --workspace` to check that all tests pass (on Windows make
sure to [enable developer
mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/developer-mode-features-and-debugging))
- `cargo run -- -c "use std testing; testing run-tests --path
crates/nu-std"` to run the tests for the standard library

> **Note**
> from `nushell` you can also use the `toolkit` as follows
> ```bash
> use toolkit.nu # or use an `env_change` hook to activate it
automatically
> toolkit check pr
> ```
-->

Added tests to cover the following cases:
- Spreading arguments to a command that doesn't have a rest parameter
(unexpected spread argument error)
- Spreading arguments to a command that doesn't have a rest parameter
*but* there's also a missing positional argument (missing positional
error)
- Spreading arguments to a command that doesn't have a rest parameter
but does allow unknown arguments, such as `exec` (allowed)
- Spreading a list literal containing arguments of the wrong type (parse
error)
- Spreading a non-list value, both to internal and external commands
- Having named arguments in the middle of rest arguments
- `explain`ing a command call that spreads its arguments

# After Submitting
<!-- If your PR had any user-facing changes, update [the
documentation](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io) after the
PR is merged, if necessary. This will help us keep the docs up to date.
-->

# Examples

Suppose you have multiple tables:
```nushell
let people = [[id name age]; [0 alice 100] [1 bob 200] [2 eve 300]]
let evil_twins = [[id name age]; [0 ecila 100] [-1 bob 200] [-2 eve 300]]
```

Maybe you often find yourself needing to merge multiple tables and want
a utility to do that. You could write a function like this:
```nushell
def merge_all [ ...tables ] { $tables | reduce { |it, acc| $acc | merge $it } }
```

Then you can use it like this:
```nushell
> merge_all ...([$people $evil_twins] | each { |$it| $it | select name age })
╭───┬───────┬─────╮
│ # │ name  │ age │
├───┼───────┼─────┤
│ 0 │ ecila │ 100 │
│ 1 │ bob   │ 200 │
│ 2 │ eve   │ 300 │
╰───┴───────┴─────╯
```

Except they had duplicate columns, so now you first want to suffix every
column with a number to tell you which table the column came from. You
can make a command for that:
```nushell
def select_and_merge [ --cols: list<string>, ...tables ] {
  let renamed_tables = $tables
    | enumerate
    | each { |it|
      $it.item | select $cols | rename ...($cols | each { |col| $col + ($it.index | into string) })
    };
  merge_all ...$renamed_tables
}
```
And call it like this:
```nushell
> select_and_merge --cols [name age] $people $evil_twins
╭───┬───────┬──────┬───────┬──────╮
│ # │ name0 │ age0 │ name1 │ age1 │
├───┼───────┼──────┼───────┼──────┤
│ 0 │ alice │  100 │ ecila │  100 │
│ 1 │ bob   │  200 │ bob   │  200 │
│ 2 │ eve   │  300 │ eve   │  300 │
╰───┴───────┴──────┴───────┴──────╯
```

---

Suppose someone's made a command to search for APT packages:

```nushell
# The main command
def search-pkgs [
    --install                   # Whether to install any packages it finds
    log_level: int              # Pretend it's a good idea to make this a required positional parameter
    exclude?: list<string>      # Packages to exclude
    repositories?: list<string> # Which repositories to look in (searches in all if not given)
    ...pkgs                     # Package names to search for
] {
  { install: $install, log_level: $log_level, exclude: ($exclude | to nuon), repositories: ($repositories | to nuon), pkgs: ($pkgs | to nuon) }
}
```

It has a lot of parameters to configure it, so you might make your own
helper commands to wrap around it for specific cases. Here's one
example:
```nushell
# Only look for packages locally
def search-pkgs-local [
    --install              # Whether to install any packages it finds
    log_level: int
    exclude?: list<string> # Packages to exclude
    ...pkgs                # Package names to search for
] {
  # All required and optional positional parameters are given
  search-pkgs --install=$install $log_level [] ["<local URI or something>"] ...$pkgs
}
```
And you can run it like this:
```nushell
> search-pkgs-local --install=false 5 ...["python2.7" "vim"]
╭──────────────┬──────────────────────────────╮
│ install      │ false                        │
│ log_level    │ 5                            │
│ exclude      │ []                           │
│ repositories │ ["<local URI or something>"] │
│ pkgs         │ ["python2.7", vim]           │
╰──────────────┴──────────────────────────────╯
```

One thing I realized when writing this was that if we decide to not
allow passing optional arguments using the spread operator, then you can
(mis?)use the spread operator to skip optional parameters. Here, I
didn't want to give `exclude` explicitly, so I used a spread operator to
pass the packages to install. Without it, I would've needed to do
`search-pkgs-local --install=false 5 [] "python2.7" "vim"` (explicitly
pass `[]` (or `null`, in the general case) to `exclude`). There are
probably more idiomatic ways to do this, but I just thought it was
something interesting.

If you're a virologist of the [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/350/) kind,
another helper command you might make is this:
```nushell
# Install any packages it finds
def live-dangerously [ ...pkgs ] {
  # One optional argument was given (exclude), while another was not (repositories)
  search-pkgs 0 [] ...$pkgs --install # Flags can go after spread arguments
}
```

Running it:
```nushell
> live-dangerously "git" "*vi*" # *vi* because I don't feel like typing out vim and neovim
╭──────────────┬─────────────╮
│ install      │ true        │
│ log_level    │ 0           │
│ exclude      │ []          │
│ repositories │ null        │
│ pkgs         │ [git, *vi*] │
╰──────────────┴─────────────╯
```

Here's an example that uses the spread operator more than once within
the same command call:
```nushell
let extras = [ chrome firefox python java git ]

def search-pkgs-curated [ ...pkgs ] {
  (search-pkgs
      1
      [emacs]
      ["example.com", "foo.com"]
      vim # A must for everyone!
      ...($pkgs | filter { |p| not ($p | str contains "*") }) # Remove packages with globs
      python # Good tool to have
      ...$extras
      --install=false
      python3) # I forget, did I already put Python in extras?
}
```

Running it:
```nushell
> search-pkgs-curated "git" "*vi*"
╭──────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ install      │ false                                                             │

## Description
Changes the behavior of `add_user_message` and `add_ai_message` to allow
for messages of those types to be passed in. Currently, if you want to
use the `add_user_message` or `add_ai_message` methods, you have to pass
in a string. For `add_message` on `ChatMessageHistory`, however, you
have to pass a `BaseMessage`. This behavior seems a bit inconsistent.
Personally, I'd love to be able to be explicit that I want to
`add_user_message` and pass in a `HumanMessage` without having to grab
the `content` attribute. This PR allows `add_user_message` to accept
`HumanMessage`s or `str`s and `add_ai_message` to accept `AIMessage`s or
`str`s to add that functionality and ensure backwards compatibility.

Shield Change (As Requested) (#381)

## About The Pull Request

Was requested to do this upon issues with shields. 

So, before some shields literally had the health of Bubblegum + armor on
them as well. The health has been greatly reduced on some, some others
have been buffed at lower end.

Telescopic shield has also been removed since it's busted as hell, had
2250 health, tons of armor, and such.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Some shields that were even labeled as removed were still in the game,
like the Telescopic. Others got buffed by someone last week for some
reason despite stam damage being fucked, etc.

Spruce up each rune-guarding Pan lords' realm

The bulk of particular enemy decisions for most of the four fixed Pan lords
enemies were made ages ago, before we had nearly so many varied monsters
for almost any branch in general. Since there's been such a massive influx
of new monsters to work with compared to so far back in the past, it'd be
reasonable to further add to the gimmickry the lords themselves already
brandish, rather than focus on plain + common + weak flavour choices for
Pan vaults like occultists, large abominations, or weaker skeletons.

 * Mnoleg's level uses very few very ugly things, abominations, or
   tentacled monstrosities for a lot more protean progenitors and shadow
   demons- the former for more interesting shapechanging, the latter to
   fit the summoning (and since Tartarus lost them). There's far too many
   of the former melee-only types before extended, and Mnoleg lacks much
   for noticeable spawns beyond eyes and cacodemons- these two will both
   help. (Note: Don't use proteans beyond Zot, Zigs, and Mnoleg's floor.
   Zot non-draconians get very limited to no non-Zig drift or bleed to
   keep them distinct and dramatic.)

 * Gloorx Vloq's level loses lorocyproca and demonic crawlers for reapers
   and entropy weavers, while upgrading the skeletons hard. While this
   loses a bit of spectral flavour and demon presence, demonic crawlers
   have no real threat in Pan and there's some interest in removing
   lorocyprocas for more interesting tier-2 designs in the future.
   Meanwhile, entropy weavers still can corrode even extended characters,
   and reapers have a new effect plus aren't much prominent in Tartarus
   anymore. (This is a bit of placeholder future-proofing: if a new
   summoning tier-2 does end up existing, then shadow demons could fit
   here better over some other spawns, like shadow wraith and soul eater
   explicit placements, and those demons can replace Mnoleg's shadow
   demons.)

 * Lom Lobon's level loses arcanists and occultists, as they're pretty
   mundane mortal scholars of magic for extended. Instead, to represent
   more interesting mystics across the Dungeon, there's now small amounts
   of one conjurer from each of the Lair roulette branches- nagaraja,
   merfolk aquamancers, fenstrider witches, and jorogumo. They readily
   match up with the green deaths or blizzard demons already present, and
   while mostly not too extra dangerous at Pan depth they're more
   interesting to see than the prior options.

 * Cerebov, the most infamous and intimidating lord of Pandemonium, loses
   orange demons and crimson imps for pretty rainbow fluttering insects.
   They're definitely not the newly revised, rarely used elsewhere,
   very fire-focused sun moths.

 * Each of the unrand lords vaults places an increasing clump of demonspawn
   related to the lord in question for each rune you have on you when
   entering. Mnoleg gets corrupters (summoning), Gloorx Vloq gets black
   suns (necromancy), Lom Lobon gets blood saints (conjurations), and
   Cerebov gets warmongers (big equipment). There's not any extra in the
   given levels beyond those initial counts, though, so they shouldn't
   make the levels blend together too hard with the rest of Pan.

 * Also, the non-holy guaranteed demonic rune vaults and Mnoleg's realm
   both contain some potions of mutation now, to compensate for when the
   old potion of cure / beneficial mutation shuffling removed the (very
   delayed, unreliable, heavily guarded) potions of cure mutation in the
   holy pan level. Those holies should be revised to be less boring, at
   some point, but for now, it should make those vaults feel more
   worthwhile.

This also updates arenasprint and the chasing-across-Pan / orb run spawns
of the lords for those four new sets, a few new tile choices to reduce the
use of generic D floor and wall tiles, deals with teleport islands in Lom's
realm, and tweaks a varied number of vaults to even out some higher and
lower vault lethality ends. Maybe eventually Pan will be varied enough to
be made yet shorter and extended could be made shorter in general?...

Organ movement refactor *Un-nullspaces your organs* (#79687)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

closes #53931, #70916, #53931

Organs were previously stored in nullspace. Now they are stored in their
prospective bodyparts. Bodyparts are now stored in the mob.

I've also had to refactor a lot of code concerning organ movement.
Previously, organs were only moved into bodyparts once the bodyparts
were removed. To accomodate this change, two major distinctions have
been made:

**Bodypart removal/insertion**
Called only when an organ is taken out of a bodypart. Bodypart overlays,
damage modifiers or other changes that should affect a bodypart itself
goes here.

**Mob insertion/removal**
Called when an organ is removed from a mob. This can either be directly,
by taking the organ out of a mob, or by removing the bodypart that
contains the organ. This lets you add and remove organ effects safely
without having to worry about the bodypart.

Now that we controle the movement of bodyparts and organs, we can fuck
around with them more. Summoning someones head or chest or heart will
actually kill them now (and quite violently I must say (chest summoning
gibs lol)).

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7501474/5efc9dd3-cfd5-4ce4-b70f-d0d74894626e

I´ve also added a unit test that violently tears apart and reconstructs
a person in different ways to see if they get put toghether the right
way

This will definitely need a testmerge. I've done a lot of testing to
make sure interactions work, but more niche stuff or my own incompetence
can always slip through.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't

probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

A lot of organ work is quite restricted. You can't C4 someones heart,
you cant summon their organs and a lot of exceptions have to be made to
keep organs in nullspace. This lets organs (and bodyparts) play more
nicely with the rest of the game. This also makes it a lot easier to
move away from extorgans since a lot of their unique movement code has
been removed and or generalized.

I don't like making PRs of this size (I'm so sorry reviewers), but I was
in a unique position to replace the entire system in a way I couldn't
have done conveniently in multiple PRs

## About The Pull Request
What it says on the top: This just disables the fear of santa within the claustrophobia quirk.

## How This Contributes To The Skyrat Roleplay Experience
It's funny the first time you get the pun, but then afterwards all it does it interrupt RP and force people with the quirk to either leave or ask people to stop wearing hats, which isn't fun for anyone.

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would benefit the game and the roleplay atmosphere of the server. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be worth adding. -->

Stops rebar crossbow crashing dreamseeker when fired at point blank. (NO GBP) (#79803)

## About The Pull Request

Simply put, due to how "caseless" is an element added to the ammo when
it hits something, but ammo is qdeleted upon hitting someone. If shot
point blank without combat mode (for some reason) it tries to add
caseless to an ammo that no longer exists. For some reason, the result
of this is to just fucking crash DS instead of aborting the adding of
the element. The ammo isnt reusable anymore, but I'll take that over
crashing.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Removes a game-breaking bug. I hate gun ammo code so much. 

## Changelog



:cl:
fix: Stopped a DS crash when shooting a rebar crossbow in specific
circumstances.

PEP 695 `type` aliases x 7.

This commit is the next in a commit chain adding support for PEP
695-compliant type aliases (i.e., type hints instantiated by statements
of the form ``type {alias_name} = {alias_value}``, available under
Python ≥ 3.12), en-route to resolving feature request #297 kindly
submitted by the magical rainbow GitHub unicorn @EtaoinWu (Yue Wu).
Specifically, this commit begins brutally applying a hardcore AST
transformation just to force PEP 695 to comply with our will. Will you
just stop sucking it already, PEP 695? PEP 695 as if written by Terry
Pratchett:

experimental_use(promise) (#25084)

* Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises

This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when 
something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
can run, then continue in a new task.

I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
separate commit.

* Move throwException to after work loop resumes

throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right 
before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
render the fiber again.

This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
(RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the 
RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
from appearing.

* Use expando to check whether promise has resolved

Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
resolved.

In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
the resolved value.

This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
by `Promise.allSettled`.

The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
without waiting a microtask.

* Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook

Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
implement it yet.

* use(promise)

Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components, 
but that is planned.

If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
"immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in 
previous commits.

Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing 
whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.

When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
principles largely apply.

The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
be deprecated.

lowers DS sentrygun to 200 from 500 (#5225)

# About the pull request
lowers price of DS installed sentrygun to 200 from 500.

# Explain why it's good for the game

Based on git lense, the cost of 500 points has been fixed for at least 6
years ( from what I understand form the moment the fabricator was
added?). The sentryguns are not worth 500 points at the slightest, from
dozens of rounds of experience I can say that the fire off 20 shots max
before they die ( unless you do some DS hold after hijack, but that
hardly counts). The main issue anyone has with it is when you install 3
of them in south part of DS and I am willing t take suggestions how to
adress this issue, but it is minor one, as xenos never realy have to
fight them as they basicly get to shoot only while marines are pushed
into DS and are about to evac and queen can hijack without getting
anywhere near them ( or can just let marines evac and then take out the
sentryguns with ease after she calls the ship back down). More marines
evacing thanks to sentrguns might make the hijack more enjoyable for
both sides. Also lowering the price will only mean you see sentryguns
installed on ds more often, buying 20 of them will have no bigger effect
then 7.

[MIRROR] Refactor icemoon wolves into basic mobs and add taming + pack behavior [MDB IGNORE] (#25126)

* Refactor icemoon wolves into basic mobs and add taming + pack behavior (#79736)

## About The Pull Request

Ports icemoon wolves over to the basic mob framework with a bit of extra
stuff:

- Wolves call for help when attacked within a decently large radius.
Because you know, pack animals.
- Wolves can now be tamed with a slab of meat
- When tamed, wolves can be ridden like goliath mounts. Ride wolf, life
good. Pretend you're playing ARK and start shivering to death in thatch
huts for that High Roleplay experience.
- Tamed wolves have access to a bunch of pet commands (following, point
fetching, point attacking, play dead, etc) and will also defend their
owners vehemently if they're attacked.

You can probably tame multiple if you wanted to.

## Why It's Good For The Game

What part about riding wolves isn't entertaining? I don't really play
/tg/ that much so I can't argue too much about the balance implications
this might pose, but it's undoubtedly a stupid little gimmick and is
likely to be used by bored assistants and miners with too much time on
their hands.

Especially robust individuals will probably find a million things to do
with a basic mob capable of fetching, attacking on command and generally
being able to defend themselves decently well.

## Changelog

:cl: yooriss
refactor: Icemoon wolves now use the basic mob framework and should act
more intelligently, defending their pack.
add: Icemoon wolves can be tamed with slabs of meat and can be ridden as
mounts once friendly. Being rather large dogs, they also have access to
most of the pet commands you'd expect, such as fetching things, and
violently mauling people their owners point at.

It's not because I'm working alone on this that I should work as a
savage. I thought it will be fun to integrate the linting steps as
reviews from the github action bot (Yeah, I know it might not sound
fun but it is !).

Got a MetaQuest 3 for Christmas from my insanely crazy wife. Guess
that this project will take another slow down because I'll try to
create a commercial game with it.

Removes an exploit that can farm Russian revolver moodlets, adds Russian revolvers to the contraband section of games vendors (#80159)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/80158 by making
curses block you from playing Russian roulette regardless of whether or
not there's a live bullet in your Russian revolver's chamber.

A Russian revolver has been added to the contraband section of each Good
Clean Fun vendor.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The bug is incredibly funny, but ~~I want GBP~~ probably should be
fixed.

There's no actual way to get (more) Russian revolvers outside of the
mapstart ones, and that can be a bit stifling to gimmicks that involve
them. And Russian roulette IS a game.

Like the roundstart ones, you could unload these vendor revolvers for
.357 bullets, but you can already just print .357 bullets from a hacked
autolathe directly, so I don't think that's an issue.

## Changelog

:cl: ATHATH
fix: Spacemen can no longer use curses to cheat at Russian roulette by
selectively blocking attempts to shoot themselves.
add: A Russian revolver has been added to the contraband section of each
Good Clean Fun vendor.

Added a .env file, which contains the firebase's secret stuff and which is also in the .gitignore. Also instead of document.title = 'smth' I used svelte:head, because idk. Well the auth doesn't work now: in the /signup when I try to create an account, it says 'auth is not defined', but when I define auth by basicly rewriting the whole Firebase.js (which is now btw isn't in the .gitignore), it says some stupid shit like 'two fuckers have the same outpot at node_modules/some-shit'. idk

, and then, friday? cant believe it! anyway, today is today. and i want to move forward. not just gathering lego that ive already heard from somewhere, but using new type of lego, or get new use of it, or... idk. i was just not feeling that today is finished. was not happy today. the place i work, was full of sad people that work because they work. like pushing button in order to extend life. being middle of them, got negative effect from them. not eating properly also, might made me not happy mood. managed to eat on my way home finally. and now its kind of full of energy. not freezing with window open. but this school made me to have routine, and taught me that something very bad might happen if i lose that. so i need to admit that i am a human. but yea, dandelion thing. we wait for light, we wait for spring, we wait for warm. user might experience same for me. old gubbe might came for the user and say, my daughter might need bundle of dandelion for this and that, or might she saw place with full of dandelion at this humid dark cold freezing night. might be dying of severe cold, expecting that god might forgive her... to help being forgived by god, for user itself, also, play a role as being forgived. why the user wandering in the dark? did the user expelled from somewhere? is this experience of almost-dying-moment-of-cold plays as punishment for user itself? from somewhere? why? what happened? and how? how can we go back? how can we go back to where we were? with new dandelion that we gathered from ths journey???

Defib revert (#4891)

* Update defib.dm

This is very likely going to flourish into a whole ream of medical tweaks but for now starting with this because it's been bugging me.

Reverts the defib brainloss revive cap, defibs no longer check your braindamage value as a part of the process of determining if you can be defibb'd.  They only check if you have a brain, a ckey and if you need to be nanopaste'd.

This does mean the bug where you can be revived with a "dead" brain(and thus brought back in an "incomplete" form) is probably back and I'll tackle that shit later since it requires more in depth messing with. I'd like to ask that you fuckers *not* bypass this penalty by running to cryo and then coming right back up.

* Medical map changes

New storage closet for medical in the lower area, includes a lathe with some basic materials,(plus a lethals disk so SLT stop dying when they wrongly choose the bullpip primary.) basic medical disks, recharger, smartfridge(in case you want to put hyperzine away from the main floor.), and wall storage locker.

Relocates many of the most commonly pilfered medical stuff to this single closet. The medkits, defib(which now has a spare cell that actually matches it.)

Also gives medical a couple jars of bare-minimum meds in said closet.

Medical blood-freezer is still in the main area for obvious reasons however it now has access requirements.

Adds a few missing total lockdown shutters for medical.

Moves the medbay-lower break room(the lil tiiny one), adds a new hallway between lower med and lower research - puts the tiny breakroom there.

Medical rejoice, replaces the flimsy thin railings in the substation with reinforced orange railings. Roaches/spiders can no longer just fall down into that little glass area(Though people can still vault it fairly easily.)

Shrinks the medical shower from 4 stalls to 2.

* Revert "Medical map changes"

This reverts commit d62882ece7e0bd141c3347ff0cdbff21b67b052c.

* SLT buffs

SLTs can now select a Humility as their starting main-arm. It comes with the weapon preloaded and one spare cell.

Humility additionally no longer uses large cells, who tfs idea was this? switches it back to medium and lowers the charge cost to 100. No more 40 magazine shotgun jfc.

Gas mask added to SLT locker.

SLTs now begin with a pair of sterile shock gloves, complete with a kinda okay coder sprite. For removing particularly rude people from medical.

Removes the erroneous insulation on the regal gloves.

* HG

* Update stungloves.dm

fixes an incomplete desc.

Relocates Ians dinner so it's not hiding away inside a closet where he can't enjoy it assumed unintended. Also returns Runtimes food to her from the old map.

Corrects the micromeds in dorms to using offsets rather then being lodged insdie a wall.

Relocates the Turbine cooling chamber blast door button to the GMs storage room and gives it a atmos ID lock for good mesure. Should keep those trainees away from the funny room.

Adds a sec cam I forgot to the new atmos hard storage room.

Moves poly into the GMs breakroom and gives him a few crackers to eat/grab. The stamp is finally free!

Support and default to generating Atom feeds

This includes several breaking changes, but they’re easy to adjust for.

Atom 1.0 is superior to RSS 2.0 in a number of ways, both technical and
legal, though information from the last decade is hard to find.
http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Rss20AndAtom10Compared
has some info which is probably still mostly correct.

How do RSS and Atom compare in terms of implementation support? The
impression I get is that proper Atom support in normal content websites
has been universal for over twelve years, but that support in podcasts
was not quite so good, but getting there, over twelve years ago. I have
no more recent facts or figures; no one talks about this stuff these
days. I remember investigating this stuff back in 2011–2013 and coming
to the same conclusion. At that time, I went with Atom on websites and
RSS in podcasts. Now I’d just go full Atom and hang any podcast tools
that don’t support Atom, because Atom’s semantics truly are much better.

In light of all this, I make the bold recommendation to default to Atom.

Nonetheless, for compatibility for existing users, and for those that
have Opinions, I’ve retained the RSS template, so that you can escape
the breaking change easily.

I personally prefer to give feeds a basename that doesn’t mention “Atom”
or “RSS”, e.g. “feed.xml”. I’ll be doing that myself, as I’ll be using
my own template with more Atom features anyway, like author information,
taxonomies and making the title field HTML.

Some notes about the Atom feed template:

- I went with atom.xml rather than something like feed.atom (the .atom
  file format being registered for this purpose by RFC4287) due to lack
  of confidence that it’ll be served with the right MIME type. .xml is a
  safer default.

- It might be nice to get Zola’s version number into the <generator>
  tag. Not for any particularly good reason, y’know. Just picture it:

    <generator uri="https://www.getzola.org/" version="0.10.0">
	Zola
    </generator>

- I’d like to get taxonomies into the feed, but this requires exposing a
  little more info than is currently exposed. I think it’d require
  `TaxonomyConfig` to preferably have a new member `permalink` added
  (which should be equivalent to something like `config.base_url ~ "/" ~
  taxonomy.slug ~ "/"`), and for the feed to get all the taxonomies
  passed into it (`taxonomies: HashMap<String, TaxonomyTerm>`).
  Then, the template could be like this, inside the entry:

    {% for taxonomy, terms in page.taxonomies %}
        {% for term in terms %}
            <category scheme="{{ taxonomies[taxonomy].permalink }}"
		term="{{ term.slug }}" label="{{ term.name }}" />
	{% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}

Other remarks:

- I have added a date field `extra.updated` to my posts and include that
  in the feed; I’ve observed others with a similar field. I believe this
  should be included as an official field. I’m inclined to add author to
  at least config.toml, too, for feeds.
- We need to have a link from the docs to the source of the built-in
  templates, to help people that wish to alter it.

Delamination variants are now locked in after the countdown is reached (#80324)

## About The Pull Request

Does what it says on the tin.
## Why It's Good For The Game

This effectively changes one and only one thing: 

The "All Within Theoretical Limits" achievement is easier/fairer to get
with this. Previously, if you edged a crystal with the gas composition
method to get a resonance cascade, you had to make sure that your gas
composition stayed until it left the explosion point, which made the
achievement extremely finnicky and unfun to get this way. Regular
delaminations won't really be affected, because yeah. It's at the
explosion point. What are you going to do about it?

This makes the achievement easier to cheese, but honestly, in my opinion
as person who added the achievement, meh. If people feel like this isn't
good for the achievement, say something in the comments.

Closes #79528

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Delamination variants no longer change once the explosion point
has been reached.

The Plantening 2 (RT-Plant growth), Oceanning, Gardening, and normal coordinating and dictionaring

LOTS OF SHIT HAS CHANGED !

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Modifications of the "engine" idk :
- the y coordinates have been FLIPPED ! Now, instead of having increasing y from top to bottom, y increase from BOTTOM to TOP like in any normal game like minecrap or turdaria (love these game btw). This should make things easier. For the rendering part, I just flip the bitmap lol, but gravity changed direction for creatures, water, and plants were made to grow the other way too.
- there is no LoadedChunks array anymore, it has been replaced by a DICTIONARY ! This makes stuff WAY more easy to manage like actually. This also made the teleporting water bug DISAPPEAR ! I am so happy with this information.

--------------------------------------------------

Biomes :
-OCEAN BIOME has been added ! This biome (biome index 8) is well, an ocean biome, very blue, that is very particular compared to other biomes : it is SEALED OFF from other biomes by a sort of cell wall at its edge (when ocean biome = around 50%) that is kinda thick and prevents water from leaking out unless players decide to I guess. Terrain generation is very different : instead of the noise value having to be between let's say 120 and 160 for there to be air and if not it's water, now it has to be over like 180. This makes it so there are very big caves spaces, sometimes spanning around the entier biome, which look rad tbh. Because of this, every plant in this biome (unless inside an air-filled structure) is kelp, both ground kelp and ceiling kelp. And almost all entites are fish. However, since its generation works on a threshold basis of the humidity value, obsidian biomes are cut by it and it can look weird. Same for forests and fairy biomes that are often on the edge and thus are cut. Will have to assign a unique noise value to it prolly, should be ok to do.
-Deep cold biome renamed frost biome but who cares honestly

--------------------------------------------

PLANTS ! The big of the update
- Vine plants have been added ! These work like ceiling kelp, except they spawn outside of water, can be LONG (like up to 40 in length), and alternate x/x+1 every 2 tiles instead of 1 tiles like a ceiling kelp. So :
_ _- -_ _- -_ _ - - instead of _-_-_-_-_- but vertical lmfao.
They are made out of plant matter but also possess FLOWERS, that are the shape of a "+", with every tile being a petal except from the center one being pollen tile :
_o_
oxo       - _ = air, o = petal, x = pollen.
_o_
A special black variant spawns in the obsidian biome.
- Some mushrooms dance. This is a bug due to ceiling making them alternate growthlevels but it's funny lmfao.
-PLANTS NOW GROW IN REAL TIME IN A LOGICAL FASHION ! They now have growth levels that increase over time, making the plants taller and taller until it reaches its maximum. it has been made so flowers and branches sprout at the same location at every growth rate so it makes sense. Works nice ! They legit look like they're growing which is super cool. Still gonna improve it to be more efficient and not have to recreate the whole plant at every growth rate test. Plants also will not overlap with terrain and will stop growing if they bump into it (both stems and branches for trees, branches stopping changes nothing but the stem stopping stops everything).
- it is now possible for the player to place EVERY plant that in the game (from their inventory) in a similar fashion to entities. Both plants and entities have subtypes also. Plants are placed at growth rate 0 and grow over time (very fast).
- Plants don't have an ARRAY for their fillstates anymore but a DICTIONARY. The bitmap is made from it and it's (probably) much more efficient this way.
- The saving system is still in .txts and not .json I will work on that now nyehehehehe so plants don't have their growthLevels saved for now (sad) and spawn/respawn ALWAYS at growth level 0 or 1.
- Growth level 0 is plant being invisible now instead of 1 in size. Basically not started growing.

--------------------------------------------------------

LIQUIDS :
- Since oceon biomes were making the whole fucking game lag like crazy due to attemping to move every water tiles at every frame, I added a temporary isStable thing that makes water movement not being tested if no water was moved in or out or inside at that frame. modifications to the chunk will retrigger the chunk, but it doesn't work well and water often floats for a while for no reason. Thus, additionnally the game checks random chunks for water movement but uhhhhh that's not very normal lmfao. Will have to change that.

------------------------------------------

Milcellaneous :
- why the fuck is Knight of Despair in my files what she doing there what
- I added a font for letters, both upper and lowercase, and many symbols like maths, punctuation, brackets/parentheses and shit. Still need to cut that one into a dict for a rendering system. Will prolly make that dict contain numbers as well and write number after string parsing it'll be easier and more efficient prolly that /10 like a dumbass in a for loop lol.

Update wording in A leap of faith versus the willingness to Know

I doubt anyone will ever read this; maybe this is just for myself.
I do want the changes to be addressed somewhere, somehow.

I cut out my reading list. Partly, this was because it felt
tangential to the main point I wanted to develop in this section,
which is that you should seek out the voices you were never allowed
to hear. Secondly, when I went back to double check that both of
the authors were "actually white" I rapidly ran into the wall of
"what the fuck does 'actually white' even mean??", as one does.

Judith Butler is Jewish, importantly, something I didn't even realize,
and while I embarrasingly don't know that much about Judaism, I do
have at least one Jewish friend who's complained before about how
being lumped into "whiteness" can erase your Jewish identity. I
didn't want to do this.

Secondly, I didn't like the last few paragraphs. I didn't like how they
were worded. Listing an effectively "extinct" gender identity like that
of the Gala next to two-spirit people felt wrong; I worried that I
might be conveying the idea that the only transness that exists today
is the one produced by the modern, western, LGBT community. So,
I made some edits that I hope clarify that this is not the case.

Rebalanced boss levels, '9 lives' levels.

This '9 lives' thing was mostly meant as a silly joke about cats having
nine lives. Now that we're making lives actually matter in career mode,
these levels should just have a normal amount.

Rebalanced, renamed boss levels. Before, boss levels 4 and 6 were things
like "Score $500 in 3 minutes" which were a huge step down from levels
like "Score $500 in 100 lines." I much prefer boss levels being big/epic
things which are longer, harder or with faster-moving pieces.

The boss level 'boss-poki' seems brutal with a score requirement of
$2000. However, ordinary levels like 'Mozzarella Sticks' have a score
requirement of $1100 so it shouldn't be too unusual. It's possible we'll
tweak these all to be easier based on player feedback.

Purged old levels. This includes old boss levels like 'boss-3k' and old
regular levels like 'five_course_meal' which were removed.

Reworks The Visuals Of Independent And Nanotrasen Captains (#2453)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Does what it says in the title. This is a demented PR that touches a lot
of things, but its main benefit is that now regular independent
captains, cowboy independent captains, and nanotrasen captains have a
unique identity.

Of those changed, it includes:

- The Nanotrasen Captain (parade)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/48a31cb1-b266-43cb-9b6e-525028893011)

- The Nanotrasen Captain (regular)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/799c88f0-b7ce-4736-956d-2e9c0a096433)

- The Independent Captain (regular/parade)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/17ecb3d3-5f2f-4ce0-a518-81366945ebdf)

- The Independent Captain (western)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/a56a798c-5adf-41d7-917a-730661f306ed)

The PR also axes a bunch of unused, or frankly quite basic lieutenant
outfits that were nothing more than set dressing with not much substance
behind them. The roles were not removed for now, and they have
appropriate outfits as a placeholder pending a full removal.

This also means that the Head of Personnel was slightly touched up,
mostly by having a coat and hat similar to the western captain's when
appropriate. The role itself is pending a full visual rework for later
that is beyond the scope of this PR.

Speaking of removals, this also means that captain outfits/roles that
were there as a legacy of removed ships, were finally axed for good.
Goodbye deserter captain for Riggs variant number 4, you will not be
missed.

This PR also touches several (a lot) of maps, mostly adding/removing
outfits that were either missing, or didn't fit with the dress code of
the vessel.

Also the PR fixes an oversight by @MarkSuckerberg by making the BYOND
version warning an actual warning, instead of an error when compiling.
Etto bleh.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Visual cohesion is important, and dear fucking god if I see one more
independent western captain not wearing the duster because it wasn't in
the ship, I will weep, and my weeping will cause a biblical deluge.

4.64.0

This update adds a check that forces users to agree to YouTube's Terms of Service before they are able to view rich embeds for YouTube links. I personally do not agree with this, but we were required to implement this in order to maintain access to YouTube's API. Actually, they said "API Clients must state in their own terms of use that, by using those API Clients, users are agreeing to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service." but that's obviously ridiculous for this use case. This is my compromise. Sorry for the inconvenience, everyone. This also comes with aesthetic tweaks to make YouTube's compliance team happy. Woo...

* Added: Setting to display labels on highlighted chat messages giving the reason why the message was highlighted.
* Added: System to force users to agree to a service's Terms of Service before displaying rich content from specific providers. So far this is only used by YouTube.
* Changed: Made the background of highlighted words in chat messages slightly smaller.
* Fixed: A few page elements in mod view not being themed correctly.
* Fixed: Timestamps displaying with an hour when they obviously do not need to.
* API Added: `main_menu:open` event for a general way to open the main menu.
* API Added: Settings UI elements using components using the `provider-mixin` can now override the provider key they use by setting an `override_setting` value on their definition.
* API Changed: The `chat.addHighlightReason(key, data, label)` method now takes an optional `label` parameter to set the text that appears on chat messages when the setting to display labels is enabled.

Nerfs legion core implanting to not be an aheal (#2590)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
The legion core implant now gives you a potent heal of all four damage
types (-100 brute -100 burn -50 tox -50 oxy) instead of a literal aheal.
It now also deals 10 clone damage as a drawback to organics/FBPS (IPCS
excluded because they cant use clone damage medicine).
Due to how adjustBruteLoss and adjustBurnLoss work, the implanted core
no longer heals mechanical bodyparts, making it mostly useless for IPCs
and FBPs only healing oxygen and toxin damage.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
1. Player accessible aheals are not good and encourage exploiting to
cure ailments or gain an advantage.
2. Synthetics could use self-surgery to implant legion cores on the go
for a safety net heal. While not necessarily bad, it was insanely
powerful as an aheal and negated the requirement of stabilizing the core
and getting another person to put it in you.
3. It had literally no drawbacks. A strong consumable healing ability is
cool, but it should come with a cost.

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: legion core implanting no longer aheals you on use
add: legion core implant now just does a potent organic heal with minor
clone damage when used

Reduce memory consumption of `RecentBlockCache` (#2102)

# Description
Our `RecentBlockCache` works like this:
1. somebody requests liquidity
2. cache checks if it's already known
3. if it's not in the cache query the blockchain
4. store in cache
5. remember requested liquidity source for updating it in the background

Whenever we see a new block we fetch the current liquidity for all the
liquidity sources and write them to the cache together with their block.
We have a max cache duration. Whenever the cached state exceeds that
duration we remove the oldest entries.

This implementation uses unnecessarily much memory in 2 ways:
1. We can fetch liquidity for quotes. For those requests it's okay to
return liquidity that is not 100% up-to-date. However, we still remember
the requested liquidity source for future updates. This is not great
because we can receive quote requests for all sorts of random tokens
we'll never see again.
2. We cache state for the same liquidity source for multiple blocks. But
the cache only has 2 access patterns:
    * "Give me the most recent available on the blockchain"
    * "Give me the most recent available in the cache"
There is no access pattern "Give me cached liquidity specifically from
an older block with number X"
That means it's enough to keep the most recent data for any liquidity
pool cached at any point.
    
We can see these 2 things at play with this
[log](https://production-6de61f.kb.eu-central-1.aws.cloud.es.io/app/discover#/?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:'2023-11-28T16:18:27.243Z',to:'2023-11-28T17:55:08.577Z'))&_a=(columns:!(log),filters:!(),grid:(columns:('@timestamp':(width:164))),index:c0e240e0-d9b3-11ed-b0e6-e361adffce0b,interval:auto,query:(language:kuery,query:'mainnet%20and%20driver%20and%20(log:%20%22the%20cache%20now%20contains%20entries%22%20or%20log:%20%22fetched%20liquidity%20sources%22)'),sort:!(!('@timestamp',desc)))).
After ~1h of operation it shows a single `RecentBlockCache` holding ~20K
items. On an average auction we can fetch ~800 uni v2 sources. We
currently have a configuration where we cache up to 10 blocks worth of
data. Meaning we have roughly 8K cache entries for liquidity that is
needed in auction and 12K entries that's only needed for quotes.
Also this is only for a single univ2 like liquidity source. In total we
have 4 different ones configured in our backend.

# Changes
We address `1` by not remembering liquidity sources for background
updates for quote requests.
We address `2` by throwing away all the duplicated data.

## How to test
I did a manual set up where I run an autopilot locally in shadow mode
(fetch auction from prod mainnet) and a driver with all liquidity
sources enabled.
I collected 3 graphs in total to measure the impact of this change on
the memory.
1. This graph is the status quo (very noisy and not really reproducable
across runs)
<img width="1617" alt="0_current_no_optimizations"
src="https://github.com/cowprotocol/services/assets/19190235/0997b34f-8f30-43c4-a797-5e3cf7bccbbf">

2. This graph applies one optimization that is not part of this PR to
make the memory consumption more predictable across runs. I want to
merge that optimization as well but right now it's very hacky. However,
I will include this optimization in all my graphs because it makes the
impact of each optimization easier to spot.
<img width="1420" alt="1_with_univ2_call_optimization"
src="https://github.com/cowprotocol/services/assets/19190235/6f259fa4-4fcd-45dd-ba37-160962065ab3">

3. The effects of this PR's optimization. The memory usage is more
stable over all and grows less over time.

Subtypes Corporate Crates, Fixes Mapped Biohazard Crate, Renames Advanced Voidsuit (#6126)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

1. *Fixes Bug With Corporate Crates, Subtypes Them.*
2. *Removes Varedited Biohazard Bin and Places Normal Biohazard Bin.*
3. *Changes Advanced Voidsuit Name to Advanced Hardsuit.*

## Why It's Good For The Game

1. _I received reports of one specific corporate crate not rendering
properly when opened. As I inspected it, I realized it would be more
efficient to subtype all corporate crates, so I did that. HOWEVER, this
did not repair the initial bug. For some reason the crate was not
rendering its 'aethersecureopen' state, even though all variables and
code seemed to be working properly. No other crate exhibited this issue.
I discovered that by changing the name of the icon state from
'aethersecureopen' to 'aethersecopen', the state began to enforce and
render properly. I suspected it might be a name length issue, but tests
with other equally long icon states in the crate section disproved this
theory. This may warrant further investigation._
2. _This one avoided detection during my initial sweep through. Can't
remember who just went in and tried to varedit bins to fix biohazards,
but hopefully this is the last one they touched._
3. _This has been driving me crazy for a few days, and yesterday
especially. The Advanced Voidsuit is clearly misnamed, as it is in fact
a Hardsuit. When I tried to order these yesterday I overlooked this
cargo entry twice because I was looking for a hardsuit, not a voidsuit.
This just fixes the name._

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
add: Adds Corporate Crate Subtype, Reassigns Corporate Crates to It.
fix: Fixes incorrectly mapped biohazard bin.
tweak: Changes Name: Advanced Voidsuit to Advanced Hardsuit.
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

    Test: Google Photos editor with PIXEL_2021_EXPERIENCE feature in product

      to Pixel XL when spoof is toggled.

    * We will try to bypass 2021 features and Raven
      props for non-Pixel 2021 devices as apps usage
      requires TPU.

69 new vox phrases (#80577)

# attempt 2 of #80569 (no rizz, gyatt, or mothblocks this time)
# created via https://github.com/AlexMorgan3817/ss13-vox

## About The Pull Request

69 or so roughly new phrases
words of note: felinid, jolly, christmas, lightbulb, present, presents,
lizard, lizardperson, never, thanks, while, was, okay, had, her, some
numbers, ever
wordlist used (duplicates inside:)

## Why It's Good For The Game

vox shenanigans

## technobabble
anyway so getting the shitty project running took me 80 hours or so over
many attempts but
the linked fork has less of that poetry python bullshit
just dont install python3.6 its pointless, install python3
anyway so run sudo python3 setup.py
follow instructions till it actually works
generate.sh will not work well so just run "sudo python3 create.py"
directly
also you could just skip the sudo part by just running sudo -i before
all that
create.py will create both voices for vox_masc and vox_fem for some
reason but you could avoid that by removing masc or whatever the fuck
the sex is called from create.py to save some time by doing fem solely
also you should set codebase to tg in codebase.yaml and replace
tglist.jinja2 in templates with this
```
GLOBAL_LIST_INIT(vox_sounds, list(
  {%- for sex, phrases in SEXES.items() %}
    {%- for phrase in phrases %}
"{{- phrase.id -}}" = 'sound/vox_fem/{{- phrase.id -}}.ogg',
    {%- endfor %}
  {%- endfor %}
))
```
which should create roughly correct code for tg but you still need to do
some text work
like removing duplicates n stuff and moving sounds from dist/sounds to
the actual proper sound folder

anyway thank you for coming to my rant

## Changelog
:cl:
add: 69(roughly?) new vox phrases
/:cl:
