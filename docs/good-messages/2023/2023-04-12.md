Mashes several of the Whitesands Survivor Camp ruins into one extra large ruin (#1640)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may

<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Combines the whitesands surface camp adobe, farm, gunslingers,
survivors, hunters and saloon into one massive, 59x59 ruin. Some various
extra loot and changes have been made throughout, generally to improve
the experience of digging through the trash for goodies. Changes the
riot shotgun in the saloon to a double barrel shotgun. Also cleans up
the various issues with the ruins, like walls under doors, or area
passthroughs being used excessively over the outside of the ruins,
resulting in them generating in the middle of mountains buried in the
rock.

"Well, why didn't you add the drugstore?" The loot in it was too good.
The stuff in there can really help a ship get on its feet, and I am not
gonna deprive them of that just to shove it in an already packed massive
ruin area. I'm not saying it doesn't need its own remap, just that it
doesn't fit well with the other camps put into this ruin.

## Why It's Good For The Game
"a ruin that is tiny and sucks on purpose is still bad" and holy shit
did most of the camps fit this criteria. Survivor, Gunslinger, and
Hunter camp variants were the smallest ruins in the game next to the one
that was just a single tumor, and constantly took up entire map
generations just to be a massive dissapointment to any player that came
across them. Or they would spawn in the middle of an acid lake. Either
way this ruin is massive and should provide a breath of fresh air for
scavengers and combat hungry miners alike.

Botany Balance Pass (#1783)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
First came the content, now comes the hammer.

- Nukes Megaseed servitors from orbit. 
- Plants now age much, much slower and produce half as quickly.
Ruins that had them now have a ruined seed vendor that can be salvaged
for random seeds(and danger).
Ships that had one now have a crate with some thematic starting seeds,
and a Strange Seed.
Ghostrole Ruins that relied on having all seeds locally now have a
special biogenerator variant that can print a random seed for biomass.

- Adds Genesis Serum. This can be splashed on a tile to make natural
grass and some flora. Green your ship!
Genesis Serum was made a while ago, on request for a way to add natural
grass and flora to your ship. Since I had it lying around fully coded, I
thought I might as well pr it with botany changes.

- Gatfruit found in the seed vault have been replaced with Strange
Seeds.

- The chance to get Gatfruit from a demonic portal(plant variety) has
dropped from 15% to 5%.

- Corpse flowers now have liquid gibs and formaldehyde again. 

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Okay, hear me out

With this and Gardens, botany ships go from a "sit in your vessel for 2
hours" experience to an "explore and forage" one that better fits our
feature arc. It goes without saying that this **shouldn't be merged till
Overmap 4.2 is**, since it facilitates getting seeds from planets as
part of exploration.

Gatfruit are funny, but it takes exactly one seed getting into the hands
of a ship with a dna manipulator and the weapon balance is eradicated
from the game completely(for the round, at least.)
This is more problematic here then it was on TG, since our rounds tend
to be 5 hours long rather then 1.
This has been long coming. I'll reverse this if we ever get that
Plantlock variant we wanted a while ago.

Corpse flowers even have formaldehyde and gibs on tg, not sure what
happened there.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl: 
add: Ruined megaseed servitors can now be found on the frontier,
carrying a bounty of seeds for intrepid adventurers.
balance: the time it takes for plants to reach a lethal age has been
increased massively.
balance: Plant production time increased a bit to compensate.
balance: megaseed servitors have been removed from ships and ruins.
Ships that carried one now have a crate with some starting seeds.
balance: removes gatfruit from the seed vault pool.
balance: reduces the chance of getting gatfruit from a plant-themed
demonic portal significantly.
balance: corpse flowers once again have formaldehyde and liquid gibs.
add: Adds Genesis Serum, a reagent that transforms tiles into natural
grass on splash, then causes some natural flora objects to grow. Turn
your ship green!

Add color support to Windows console output, properly

This adds color support to the output of the console on Windows. Now if
you're using Windows 10 build 1511 or later (I think it's build 1511
anyway; they added more VT sequence support in later versions), you will
see colors by default. This isn't due to Windows helping in any way;
this commit has to specifically enable it with SetConsoleMode() because
by default, Windows won't enable color support unless we enable it. (Or
if it's enabled in the registry, but having to go through the registry
to enable basic shit like that is completely fucking stupid.)

I tested this in my Windows 10 virtual machine and it's completely
working.

Clarify submodules in desktop_version/README.md

VVVVVV uses submodules now, so you need to know how to initialize them.

I'm explicitly not including `git clone --recurse-submodules`. Usage of
submodules in git projects is kinda rare in my experience, so people
are used to doing simple clones, and that instruction would just result
in people being annoyed thinking they have to delete the repo they
already cloned, and clone it again except slightly differently.

It also doesn't help you if you need submodules that aren't in the
master branch (for example, if you clone my fork recursively and then
checkout the localization branch, you won't have C-HashMap and you'll
need the update command anyway). And you also need it whenever VVVVVV
updates its submodules. So teaching people just the update command is
better.

Replaceable Traitor Uplinks (#74315)

## About The Pull Request

Following [from the suggestion in this hackmd
](https://hackmd.io/IkDWWkpfQa2lkdevsnLqhA?view#Replacement-Uplinks)with
a few twists of my own, I have made a method for traitors to acquire a
replacement traitor uplink that has its own set of flaws and limiters in
order to prevent abuse.


![ZC0WYDFRzc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/228101432-9352390b-9538-4c62-8dc4-55e2e798c466.png)

The basic pitch is as follows, all traitors now start with a new,
crafting recipe exclusive to them, it costs a teleport beacon, a
bluespace crystal, and some iron and cable coil, and then allows them to
build a static, dense machine that they can synchronize with, which
allows the machine to know what signal it should be looking out for from
the traitor.

![dreamseeker_iErI3vju0C](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/228094286-c2bca198-82cd-4ce0-a4a7-c26c24a9327c.gif)

The traitor then uses any radio, sets it to the frequency that has been
added to their static antagonist ui, and then speaks their codeword,
also in the ui, and then a few things happen.

![dreamseeker_gbzSFeHuS5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/228094354-a649c713-f013-4ac2-b8d7-0754a852f987.gif)

Most obviously, they get a replacement uplink that is in the conspicuous
shape of the nukie or lone op uplink. This uplink can be unlocked by
speaking your replacement codeword to it again, it remembers your
previous TC amount and locks all other uplinks associated with your
uplink handler(they can then be unlocked as normal). It also destroys
any other replacement uplinks associated with your uplink handler, which
means you can never have more than one replacement uplink.

This means that if your uplink has been confiscated and you left it
unlocked, if it hasn't been emptied out you can continue from where you
were, and if you want to get back on the TC grind you won't lose the new
TC to whoever stole your uplink. Of course, the new uplink can not be
locked, so you have to be more careful with it or buy an uplink implant
and destroy it. You can destroy your replacement uplink with a
screwdriver right click, same for the machine.

Additionally, the Syndicate Uplink Beacon has another quirk to it, which
is that the teleporter beacon used to create it is intact, which means
people eagle eyed on the teleporter console could go find you, not to
mention that if you use an existing teleporter beacon, someone might
notice its gone missing...

oh also while making the replacement uplink i found a bug caused by a
recent pr that broke debug uplinks due to them not having a purchase
log. thats fixed too

## Why It's Good For The Game

It can be easy to lose your uplink, and as a traitor having your uplink
confiscated, even if it is locked, feels really bad. While the old
traitor objectives were added back to prog traitor to prevent situations
where a confiscated uplink meant that you were completely aimless, I
think that having a backup solution would be good for more inexperienced
traitors or for ones who get unlucky.

Hopefully this is generally balanced well enough but there are a few
levers that can be pulled, but overall I do think that making it so that
traitors can always get a chance to get an uplink and do some objectives
is good for the game. I like the idea of someone getting perma'd,
someone breaks them out, they both craft a new uplink beacon, and then
they go back and get the traitors old gear with stuff they got from the
new uplink, I think that's a cool possibility to throw into the sandbox.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Added new syndicate uplink beacon and associated systems that allow
you to get a replacement traitor uplink
fix: Debug & nukie uplinks no longer runtime and work properly again
/:cl:

Moves revolution code of out of flash code, fixes April Fool conversion forcesay never working in any cirumstances (#74411)

## About The Pull Request

- Signallizes head revolutionary flash conversion code, moving it out of
core flash code.
- Removes "tacticool" flashing from head revs, but they can still
convert from any direction
 
- Fixes April Fools "You son of a bitch! I'm in" force say never
working.
   - Revs are muted on conversion so they couldn't talk.
       - Fixed by only muting revs on non-holidays
   - Cultists are unconscious on conversion so they couldn't talk
       - Fixed by only unconscious-ing cultists on non-holidays
- Brainwash victims are more often than not unconscious / asleep so they
couldn't talk
       - Just left this one. 

- Reduced the chance of them occurring and limits it to April Fools only
- A 1% chance of the force says ocurring means they will happen pretty
much once a week, given multiple rev / cult rounds happen every week and
on average like, 20 people are converted. A little absurd, it's good
that it never worked?

## Why It's Good For The Game

Antag code in core item code is bad

It's funny this meme has existed for like 2, 3 years now? No one's
tested it, it's never worked

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
refactor: Removes Rev code from core flash code
fix: Getting converted on April Fools now triggers the meme force say as
always intended
del: The meme force say can no longer trigger on any day (it didn't work
before anyways)

Stops station blueprints from expanding areas of non atmos adjacent turfs. (#74620)

## About The Pull Request
Fixes #74605

the problem starts with `detect_room()` proc. This proc returns turfs
even those with `atmos_adjacent_turfs` = null. This means it returns
turfs that has a wall, airlock, window etc i.e. whatever that stops air
from flowing through it. This coupled together with `create_area()`
causes some wierdness.

Let's take an example
![Screenshot
(154)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110812394/230769831-e84819f2-31b2-4a67-a8bb-5e07e1c5a1cc.png)

Area A is well defined i.e. it has been created via the station
blueprints and is highlighted in green, Area B however is only
theoretical i.e. we haven't created it yet or we are about to create it.
Now you might be thinking Area A is completely walled & sealed off, it
should be physically impossible to expand it unless we broke down one of
it's walls and so since we are standing in Area B it shoudn't even give
me the option to expand area A Right? right? r.i.g.h.t?
![Screenshot
(155)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110812394/230770056-169cbab3-4516-4da7-ae2c-4f40b50be9ba.png)
Well PHFUUK. The area editor completely ignores the laws of physics and
allows me expand Area A anyway. This could cause some real power gaming
shit because if you create an area next to an area having an APC you
could use that area power without even making your own apc by simply
expanding that area(like using someone else's wifi from outside their
house without them even knowing)

#73850 accidently built on top of this as it relied on this to detect
duplicate APC's but the checks became way too strict as it would check
areas of surrounding walls for apc's and throw the conflicting apc
error. You can now build room's next to each other even if they have
fuctioning apc's however you still can't build rooms in space on top of
shuttle walls because that's been the default behaviour for years and
hasn't been touched one bit.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: station blueprints no longer expands & detects areas of non atmos
adjacent turfs.
/:cl:

Add emotional intelligence evaluation (#589)

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Emotional Intelligence

### Eval description
Evaluates GPT's ability to understand and manage emotional situations
using modified versions of the well-validated, public (i.e.
license-unrestricted) tests first developed by MacCann & Roberts (2008).
Items have actually here been aggregated across three different scales--
the STEU and STEM adult measures, along with a dozen questions from the
youth measure.

Keep in mind that there is not expectation that AI models like GPT-4
should be able to process emotions, so applying any emotional
intelligence test to them should be taken with a grain of salt. These
tests can only measure the AI's ability to understand and analyze
emotional information, not the AI's emotional intelligence in the human
sense.

### What makes this a useful eval?
This eval is useful because it assesses the AI model's ability to
navigate complex or ambiguous emotional situations, which is an
important aspect of human-like communication and problem-solving. By
evaluating the model's performance in this unique domain, we can
identify areas for improvement and better understand its limitations
when it comes to handling emotional contexts. This is particularly
important when considering AI applications that involve interactions
with humans, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and customer support
systems. A better understanding of emotional intelligence can
potentially lead to more natural and effective interactions between AI
models and their users.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This Emotional Intelligence eval provides a unique value because by
testing GPT's capacity to understand and manage emotions, we can gain
insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in a more
human-centric context. Relatedly, this eval also emphasizes the
importance of empathy and emotional understanding in AI systems that are
designed to interact with humans. By evaluating GPT's performance in
this way, we can contribute to the ongoing development of AI models that
are more attuned to human emotions and can provide better support in
emotionally charged situations, such as mental health counseling, crisis
management, and conflict resolution. Moreover, this Emotional
Intelligence eval can serve as a foundation for further research and
development in the field of AI and emotional understanding, paving the
way for more sophisticated AI models capable of handling complex human
emotions and fostering more effective communication.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval
(data is publicly available on OSF, and does not have usage
restrictions)

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

**_I already have access to the 8k GPT-4 API, but I am kindly requesting
access to the 32k as soon as it becomes available._**

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

Heart Disease Prediction (#538)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Heart Disease Prediction

### Eval description

This eval tests the models ability to correctly predict the probability
of a patient to have heart disease. The dataset is constructed from the
[Heart Failure Prediction
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
on Kaggle. The data includes the patient's age, sex, and a number of
medical signals relevant to the diagnosis of heart disease.

The data is provided under the Open Database License (ODbL). 

```
fedesoriano. (September 2021). Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. Retrieved [Mar 31, 2023] from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction.
```

### What makes this a useful eval?

This assesses the model's ability to correctly predict adverse medical
events. Correctly predicting heart disease shows the model's capability
for a strong understanding of medicine. The GPT-3.5-turbo models
currently receives an accuracy of 0.778.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

As far as I can tell, this is the only eval so far related to making
medical diagnoses. To make sure it was a high quality eval, I tried to
find a dataset with a lot of observations and created by doctors with
the relevant expertise.

Add response generation for examples from blog post (#27)

This adds response generation code and runs it over the examples from the [blog post](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/03/24/hello-dolly-democratizing-magic-chatgpt-open-models.html).

A few of the sample outputs:

**Instruction:** Write a love letter to Edgar Allan Poe.

> My love for you is as eternal and enduring as the starlit nights, as deep as the ocean depths, as strong as the wind, and as sweet as the summer breeze. My heart has been yours since the first day I saw you, and it will remain yours forever. I can see you now and my heart fills with longing for our embrace, as I long to be with you forever.

**Instruction:** Explain to me the difference between nuclear fission and fusion.

> Nuclear fission is the splitting of a nucleus, which is a heavy atom, such as uranium, into two separate nuclei, while nuclear fusion is the joining of two nuclei to form a single nucleus, such as hydrogen and helium. Fission occurs when the nucleus absorbs a neutron, leaving a remnant of the nucleus. Fusion occurs when the two nuclei come together and form a single nucleus. Fission is a nuclear reaction and fusion is a nuclear reaction.

**Instruction:** Write a tweet announcing Dolly, a large language model from Databricks.

> Dolly, the world's most accurate language model, is now available on Databricks! 🎉 🎉 🎉

**Instruction:** I'm selling my Nikon D-750, write a short blurb for my ad.

> I'm selling my Nikon D-750, an amazing camera. It has the latest features including 12MP CMOS sensor, 9-point autofocus and auto bracketing, and 3.0x optical zoom. It also has a cool Image Stabilizer system and a dual SD card slot. It is a great choice for photographers looking for a reliable camera that offers superior image quality and features.

**Instruction:** Give me a list of 5 science fiction books I should read next.

> 1. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams 
> 2. Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card 
> 3. 1984 by George Orwell 
> 4. Star Wars by George Lucas 
> 5. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams

added ixwebsocket dependencies

I swear to god I hate cmake and vcpkg sometimes. I spent the past 7 hours trying to get the stupid package to install and then show up when building the project. All I had to do to fix the thing was delete vcpkg and reinstall it again :|
I hope I never have to deal with this ever again

cql3: remove expr::token

Let's remove expr::token and replace all of its functionality with expr::function_call.

expr::token is a struct whose job is to represent a partition key token.
The idea is that when the user types in `token(p1, p2) < 1234`,
this will be internally represented as an expression which uses
expr::token to represent the `token(p1, p2)` part.

The situation with expr::token is a bit complicated.
On one hand side it's supposed to represent the partition token,
but sometimes it's also assumed that it can represent a generic
call to the token() function, for example `token(1, 2, 3)` could
be a function_call, but it could also be expr::token.

The query planning code assumes that each occurence of expr::token
represents the partition token without checking the arguments.
Because of this allowing `token(1, 2, 3)` to be represented
as expr::token is dangerous - the query planning
might think that it is `token(p1, p2, p3)` and plan the query
based on this, which would be wrong.

Currently expr::token is created only in one specific case.
When the parser detects that the user typed in a restriction
which has a call to `token` on the LHS it generates expr::token.
In all other cases it generates an `expr::function_call`.
Even when the `function_call` represents a valid partition token,
it stays a `function_call`. During preparation there is no check
to see if a `function_call` to `token` could be turned into `expr::token`.
This is a bit inconsistent - sometimes `token(p1, p2, p3)` is represented
as `expr::token` and the query planner handles that, but sometimes it might
be represented as `function_call`, which the query planner doesn't handle.

There is also a problem because there's a lot of duplication
between a `function_call` and `expr::token`. All of the evaluation
and preparation is the same for `expr::token` as it's for a `function_call`
to the token function. Currently it's impossible to evaluate `expr::token`
and preparation has some flaws, but implementing it would basically
consist of copy-pasting the corresponding code from token `function_call`.

One more aspect is multi-table queries. With `expr::token` we turn
a call to the `token()` function into a struct that is schema-specific.
What happens when a single expression is used to make queries to multiple
tables? The schema is different, so something that is representad
as `expr::token` for one schema would be represented as `function_call`
in the context of a different schema.
Translating expressions to different tables would require careful
manipulation to convert `expr::token` to `function_call` and vice versa.
This could cause trouble for index queries.

Overall I think it would be best to remove expr::token.

Although having a clear marker for the partition token
is sometimes nice for query planning, in my opinion
the pros are outweighted by the cons.
I'm a big fan of having a single way to represent things,
having two separate representations of the same thing
without clear boundaries between them causes trouble.

Instead of having expr::token and function_call we can
just have the function_call and check if it represents
a partition token when needed.

gpiolib: acpi: use correct format characters

[ Upstream commit 213d266ebfb1621aab79cfe63388facc520a1381 ]

When compiling with -Wformat, clang emits the following warning:

  gpiolib-acpi.c:393:4: warning: format specifies type 'unsigned char' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]
                        pin);
                        ^~~

So warning that '%hhX' is paired with an 'int' is all just completely
mindless and wrong. Sadly, I can see a different bogus warning reason
why people would want to use '%02hhX'.

Again, the *sane* thing from a human perspective is to use '%02X. But
if the compiler doesn't do any range analysis at all, it could decide
that "Oh, that print format could need up to 8 bytes of space in the
result". Using '%02hhX' would cut that down to two.

And since we use

        char ev_name[5];

and currently use "_%c%02hhX" as the format string, even a compiler
that doesn't notice that "pin <= 255" test that guards this all will
go "OK, that's at most 4 bytes and the final NUL termination, so it's
fine".

While a compiler - like gcc - that only sees that the original source
of the 'pin' value is a 'unsigned short' array, and then doesn't take
the "pin <= 255" into account, will warn like this:

  gpiolib-acpi.c: In function 'acpi_gpiochip_request_interrupt':
  gpiolib-acpi.c:206:24: warning: '%02X' directive writing between 2 and 4 bytes into a region of size 3 [-Wformat-overflow=]
       sprintf(ev_name, "_%c%02X",
                            ^~~~
  gpiolib-acpi.c:206:20: note: directive argument in the range [0, 65535]

because gcc isn't being very good at that argument range analysis either.

In other words, the original use of 'hhx' was bogus to begin with, and
due to *another* compiler warning being bad, and we had that bad code
being written back in 2016 to work around _that_ compiler warning
(commit e40a3ae1f794: "gpio: acpi: work around false-positive
-Wstring-overflow warning").

Sadly, two different bad compiler warnings together does not make for
one good one.

It just makes for even more pain.

End result: I think the simplest and cleanest option is simply the
proposed change which undoes that '%hhX' change for gcc, and replaces
it with just using a slightly bigger stack allocation. It's not like
a 5-byte allocation is in any way likely to have saved any actual stack,
since all the other variables in that function are 'int' or bigger.

False-positive compiler warnings really do make people write worse
code, and that's a problem. But on a scale of bad code, I feel that
extending the buffer trivially is better than adding a pointless cast
that literally makes no sense.

At least in this case the end result isn't unreadable or buggy. We've
had several cases of bad compiler warnings that caused changes that
were actually horrendously wrong.

commit: give a hint when a commit message has been abandoned

If we launch an editor for the user to create a commit
message, they may put significant work into doing so.
Typically we try to check common mistakes that could cause
the commit to fail early, so that we die before the user
goes to the trouble.

We may still experience some errors afterwards, though; in
this case, the user is given no hint that their commit
message has been saved. Let's tell them where it is.

Connection terminated.

I'm sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although you have indeed been called.

You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.

But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.

And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, I am nearby.

This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you.

For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.

My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you.

I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.

It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms.

This ends for all of us.

End communication.

Icemoon Hermit Ruin Active Turf Fix - For Real This Time [MDB IGNORE] (#20325)

* Icemoon Hermit Ruin Active Turf Fix - For Real This Time (#74476)

In #74306, I _thought_ I knew what the cause was, and I both attempted a
potential fix _and_ made tracking it easier. The fruits of my labor paid
off, I know exactly what caused it now.

Basically, the demonic portal will scrape away all turfs in a 5-tile
radius on its `Initialize()`, and if a spawner spawned right next to the
hermit ruin... it would count it as a mineral turf and scrape it away as
well. That's so fucking silly. At least we know now.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The fix is to just make those tiles unscrapeable, which is accomplished
via another turf_flag and filtering those out in the `Initialize()` of
the demonic portals.

I also cleaned up the calls to scrapeaway being `null`, which is really
weird because it just defaulted to the normal proc behavior. Naming the
arguments instead does the same thing (I checked)

Move a few functions out of OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED

Geoff Thorpe added OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED nearly two decades ago. The hope
was that at some point some functions can be dropped. Most of the functions
marked deprecated are actually unused nowadays but unfortunately some of
them are still used in the ecosystem. Move them out of OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED
so we can define it without breaking the consumers in the next bump.

ERR_remove_state() is still used by a dozen or so ports. This isn't a big
deal since it is just a stupid wrapper for the not quite as deprecated
ERR_remove_thread_state(). It's not worth patching these ports.

Annoyingly, {DH,DSA}_generate_parameters() and RSA_generate_key() are still
used. They "make use" of the old-style BN_GENCB callback, which is therefore
more difficult to remove - in case you don't know know: that's the thing
responsible for printing pretty '.', '+' and '*' when you generate keys.

Most annoyingly, DH_generate_parameters() was added to rust-openssl in 2020
for "advanced DH support". This is very unfortunate since cargo bundles a
rust-openssl and updates it only every few years or so. As a consequence
we're going to be stuck with this nonsense for a good while.

 Since we are not able to restore the scroll correctly,
 and force the scroll to top every time we change the
 current folder. This is to avoid this kind of weird
 behavior:
 - If I go to a sub-folder, if this subfolder has a lot
 of data and I scrolled down until the bottom. If I go
 back, then my folder will also be scrolled down.

#### Wednesday 2023-04-12 12:41:39 by Tomasz Sobczyk

Update architecture to "SFNNv4". Update network to nn-6877cd24400e.nnue.

Architecture:

The diagram of the "SFNNv4" architecture:
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8037982/153455685-cbe3a038-e158-4481-844d-9d5fccf5c33a.png

The most important architectural changes are the following:

* 1024x2 [activated] neurons are pairwise, elementwise multiplied (not quite pairwise due to implementation details, see diagram), which introduces a non-linearity that exhibits similar benefits to previously tested sigmoid activation (quantmoid4), while being slightly faster.
* The following layer has therefore 2x less inputs, which we compensate by having 2 more outputs. It is possible that reducing the number of outputs might be beneficial (as we had it as low as 8 before). The layer is now 1024->16.
* The 16 outputs are split into 15 and 1. The 1-wide output is added to the network output (after some necessary scaling due to quantization differences). The 15-wide is activated and follows the usual path through a set of linear layers. The additional 1-wide output is at least neutral, but has shown a slightly positive trend in training compared to networks without it (all 16 outputs through the usual path), and allows possibly an additional stage of lazy evaluation to be introduced in the future.

Additionally, the inference code was rewritten and no longer uses a recursive implementation. This was necessitated by the splitting of the 16-wide intermediate result into two, which was impossible to do with the old implementation with ugly hacks. This is hopefully overall for the better.

First session:

The first session was training a network from scratch (random initialization). The exact trainer used was slightly different (older) from the one used in the second session, but it should not have a measurable effect. The purpose of this session is to establish a strong network base for the second session. Small deviations in strength do not harm the learnability in the second session.

The training was done using the following command:

python3 train.py \
    /home/sopel/nnue/nnue-pytorch-training/data/nodes5000pv2_UHO.binpack \
    /home/sopel/nnue/nnue-pytorch-training/data/nodes5000pv2_UHO.binpack \
    --gpus "$3," \
    --threads 4 \
    --num-workers 4 \
    --batch-size 16384 \
    --progress_bar_refresh_rate 20 \
    --random-fen-skipping 3 \
    --features=HalfKAv2_hm^ \
    --lambda=1.0 \
    --gamma=0.992 \
    --lr=8.75e-4 \
    --max_epochs=400 \
    --default_root_dir ../nnue-pytorch-training/experiment_$1/run_$2

Every 20th net was saved and its playing strength measured against some baseline at 25k nodes per move with pure NNUE evaluation (modified binary). The exact setup is not important as long as it's consistent. The purpose is to sift good candidates from bad ones.

The dataset can be found https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UQdZN_LWQ265spwTBwDKo0t1WjSJKvWY/view

Second session:

The second training session was done starting from the best network (as determined by strength testing) from the first session. It is important that it's resumed from a .pt model and NOT a .ckpt model. The conversion can be performed directly using serialize.py

The LR schedule was modified to use gamma=0.995 instead of gamma=0.992 and LR=4.375e-4 instead of LR=8.75e-4 to flatten the LR curve and allow for longer training. The training was then running for 800 epochs instead of 400 (though it's possibly mostly noise after around epoch 600).

The training was done using the following command:

The training was done using the following command:

python3 train.py \
        /data/sopel/nnue/nnue-pytorch-training/data/T60T70wIsRightFarseerT60T74T75T76.binpack \
        /data/sopel/nnue/nnue-pytorch-training/data/T60T70wIsRightFarseerT60T74T75T76.binpack \
        --gpus "$3," \
        --threads 4 \
        --num-workers 4 \
        --batch-size 16384 \
        --progress_bar_refresh_rate 20 \
        --random-fen-skipping 3 \
        --features=HalfKAv2_hm^ \
        --lambda=1.0 \
        --gamma=0.995 \
        --lr=4.375e-4 \
        --max_epochs=800 \
        --resume-from-model /data/sopel/nnue/nnue-pytorch-training/data/exp295/nn-epoch399.pt \
        --default_root_dir ../nnue-pytorch-training/experiment_$1/run_$run_id

In particular note that we now use lambda=1.0 instead of lambda=0.8 (previous nets), because tests show that WDL-skipping introduced by vondele performs better with lambda=1.0. Nets were being saved every 20th epoch. In total 16 runs were made with these settings and the best nets chosen according to playing strength at 25k nodes per move with pure NNUE evaluation - these are the 4 nets that have been put on fishtest.

The two areas of note are the singularity reactor, which is assembled,
and would just need a hand if someone were to want to start it, and the
research lab. The Research lab contains the fruits of the now deceased
science staff's labors, assorted energy weapons. Unfortunately, it also
contains the deceased science staff.

Other areas of the base were not so lucky, and are thoroughly infested

The engineering team attempted to hold back the vines, and quickly
discovered that fire was not sufficient.

And what used to be the recreation area is completely gone

Notably, the hangar is empty. I plan on making a patch to put a
subshuttle inside it once that rolls around.

Notable loot includes:
3 energy SMGs
3 Flamethrowers
The Ion Projector, a self charging Ion weapon.
An Antique Laser
2 Energy PDWs
2 Accelerator Laser Cannons
4 engineering hardsuits
An engineering lathe and circuit imprinter
A particle accelerator
A singularity generator
6 emitters
1 energy shotgun
Kudzu Seeds
Basically Everything You'd Need For an R&D Set Up
A sense of pride and accomplishment



I feel like this has some rough spots but I've got no idea where to
start, so into the review -> testing -> feedback process it goes

- [x] The ruin spawns when the spawn ruin verb doesn't runtime.
## Why It's Good For The Game
More ruin variety. This one spawns in space and does a few things that I
haven't seen yet. Mainly a singularity, cool semi-hidden asteroid base
that could in theory, be turned into a player lair.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would

"Why bother with multiple commits when you can push the entire project with just one? Laziness is a virtue, my friends, and I'm taking it to the next level with this commit. No need to worry about detailed commit messages or carefully selected changes - I'm throwing caution to the wind and pushing everything at once. Who needs Git history anyway? It's overrated.

Refactor op pool for speed and correctness (#3312)

## Proposed Changes

This PR has two aims: to speed up attestation packing in the op pool, and to fix bugs in the verification of attester slashings, proposer slashings and voluntary exits. The changes are bundled into a single database schema upgrade (v12).

Attestation packing is sped up by removing several inefficiencies: 

- No more recalculation of `attesting_indices` during packing.
- No (unnecessary) examination of the `ParticipationFlags`: a bitfield suffices. See `RewardCache`.
- No re-checking of attestation validity during packing: the `AttestationMap` provides attestations which are "correct by construction" (I have checked this using Hydra).
- No SSZ re-serialization for the clunky `AttestationId` type (it can be removed in a future release).

So far the speed-up seems to be roughly 2-10x, from 500ms down to 50-100ms.

Verification of attester slashings, proposer slashings and voluntary exits is fixed by:

- Tracking the `ForkVersion`s that were used to verify each message inside the `SigVerifiedOp`. This allows us to quickly re-verify that they match the head state's opinion of what the `ForkVersion` should be at the epoch(s) relevant to the message.
- Storing the `SigVerifiedOp` on disk rather than the raw operation. This allows us to continue track the fork versions after a reboot.

This is mostly contained in this commit 52bb1840ae5c4356a8fc3a51e5df23ed65ed2c7f.

## Additional Info

The schema upgrade uses the justified state to re-verify attestations and compute `attesting_indices` for them. It will drop any attestations that fail to verify, by the logic that attestations are most valuable in the few slots after they're observed, and are probably stale and useless by the time a node restarts. Exits and proposer slashings and similarly re-verified to obtain `SigVerifiedOp`s.

This PR contains a runtime killswitch `--paranoid-block-proposal` which opts out of all the optimisations in favour of closely verifying every included message. Although I'm quite sure that the optimisations are correct this flag could be useful in the event of an unforeseen emergency.

Finally, you might notice that the `RewardCache` appears quite useless in its current form because it is only updated on the hot-path immediately before proposal. My hope is that in future we can shift calls to `RewardCache::update` into the background, e.g. while performing the state advance. It is also forward-looking to `tree-states` compatibility, where iterating and indexing `state.{previous,current}_epoch_participation` is expensive and needs to be minimised.

## About The Pull Request
Expands whitesands_surface_camp_saloon to cover a 30x30 footprint and
not be nearly as bad. The previous version had some really glaring
design flaws, like holes in the wall for a bar. On a planet with a
deadly atmosphere. Yeah. Also all the chairs faced the same direction.

Ignore the patches of error, it's purple grass and doesn't display the
icon in sdmm for some reason.

The major changes are:
Expanding the building's footprint out to 30x30
Moving the loot behind the building, but locking it behind a shovel of
some sort (of which you can go through the ruin to get).
Improving the loot a LITTLE

- [x] The map loads although I still haven't managed to get it to load
on the proper planet with the spawning verb

## Why It's Good For The Game
The old version was kinda bad. Between the clown and mime masks out
front. The small footprint, and the free guns (also out front). This
solves those issues kinda while making it bigger.

The town is an mostly empty place formerly devoted to tourism and the
beloved art of "chilling out". Facets of the life of its inhabitants
before their disappearance included drinking, grilling, and swimming off
the coast of their fairly large beach. Many interesting things happened
on the boardwalk, and a landing pad was present to allow for small ships
to dock inside the town.

The loot list is sparse here. I intend for this to mostly be a setpiece
for roleplay instead of a loot pinata. There's a good selection of
hydroponics seeds and gear, 2 full bar kits, basic kitchen equipment, an
autolathe, a few PDAs, a lotta wood, and a jukebox. Also donuts.

SubShips attempt 2 (#1627)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Accidentally destroyed my old PR for this, #1573, by completely botching
a merge from master to the point that it was easier to make a whole new
fork than try to save it, so here we are again. Here's the original
description:

Ports the parts of beestation/beestation-hornet#7152 that adds the
framework for ships to land on top of each other and not break
everything. A ship can only land on another ship if there's an open
docking port on the mothership that's large enough for the subship.
Here's a video of it in action on a modified dwayne-class:


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51838176/195471361-f9f0d145-d7c9-480e-ad4a-d18705f2590f.mp4

This system should be able to handle just about any orientation of ships
on top of each other, such as ships landed across areas, multiple ships
landed on a single ship, a single ship landed on multiple ships, a ship
that is only partially landed on another ship, a ship that is partially
landed on a ship that's partially landed on another ship, and so on.
Just make sure that you never try to land a ship on itself.

Something to note for this is that ships remember what's underneath them
via baseturfs, and there's a hardcoded check that will cause errors if a
baseturf list grows over 10 entries long. Because ship turfs have
typically 1-3 baseturfs, after about 3 ships stacked on top of each
other things will start to break.

You can also make maps with subships on them, to do this, follow these
steps:
1. make the subship as if it were a regular ship in its own map file
2. create a new /datum/map_template/shuttle subtype that points to your
subship map, these datums can be found in code/datums/shuttle.dm
3. On your main ship, place "subship dock" landmark in turf where you
want the bottomleft corner of the subship's bounding box to be, you can
also use the offset_x and offset_y vars on the landmark to offset this
corner if you need to place the landmark somewhere else.
4. Set the "subship_template" var on the landmark to the path of your
subship's map_template subtype
5. Optionally change the dir on the landmark to rotate the subship. for
reference, NORTH is no rotation, EAST is a 90 degree clockwise rotation,
etc.

You can put the stationary docking port anywhere on your map, as long as
it's on the ship. You can have its bounding box hang off the side of
your ship, but please try to keep the entirety of its bounding box
within the bounding box of map file, otherwise subships landing on your
main ship might accidentally clip through structures nearby your
mainship, including virtual z level borders.

- [x] I affirm that I have tested all of my proposed changes and that
any issues found during tested have been addressed.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Subships allow for many more creative designs and interesting dynamics
between and within ships, especially when a crew may need or want to
split its attention between multiple locations at the same time, or to
make interactions between ships easier when you just need to land a
smaller vessel inside of the other, cutting out the need to travel
through space turfs to get between two ships.

[ci] Mirror third-party images and hailgenetics images on deploy (#12818)

- On *deploys*, makes sure that whatever is in our third-party images is
in our private registry before starting builds like hail-ubuntu that
might depend on those images. This means that we can update our ubuntu
base image without the australians needing to deploy any images by hand.
However, this does not run in PRs because I 1) didn't want to add that
kind of latency for PRs and 2) we don't do any kind of namespacing for
our images so if we did include this for a PR that ultimately wasn't
merged we would have to manually remove the image anyway so why not
manually add it if you're going to PR it… I think point 2 is a little
weak but I recall this being what we agreed on a couple months back when
we discussed this. I'm wondering if we should just eat the minute or so
latency at the beginning of PRs to be safe but it also feels like a
shame for something that changes so infrequently.

- Again on deploys, upload the hailgenetics/* images to the private
registry if they don't already exist there. This way any deployments
that aren't hail team's GCP deployment can get these images
automatically when they deploy a new SHA instead of uploading them
manually. It won't backfill skipped versions, but we decided that was
ok. This seems less relevant for testing on PRs as it will get triggered
on releases and we can easily dev deploy to rectify the image if this
breaks.

DD updates (#2786)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

DD hasn't been touched in a while, and is kind of bad against preds,
tries to fix this to the best my my ability with the below changes.

1. Makes the M1911 more accurate
2. Makes DD armor cover arms and legs, improves its bullet and explosive
resistance
3. ERT Medical Pouch now contains the basic 3 injectors(bic, kelo,
tram), an emergency injector, a splint, and a bandage
4. DD now all have max endurance skill
5. M60 is now full auto, does more damage, and is more accurate
6. DD Minigun(ol painless) now has an integrated magharn
7. M60 now has the same box changing mechanic that smartgun has.
8. Adds 2 new guns(technically 1, or maybe 1.5), the XM177 and M16
Grenadier(an M16A1/2 with an M203 attached)
9. Adds an M203 grenade launcher, single grenade, no IFF, high range
with scope, only fits on M16 grenadier
10. Adds 3 new impact grenade types, only DD have them currently.
11. Adds HE impact grenade, impacts in a cone radius with an HE
explosion.
12. Adds an incendiary impact grenade, impacts in the same pattern as
HIDP, napalm.
13. Adds an impact buckshot grenade, pure vietnam vibes, shoots 10 bits
of additional buckshot that also slow.
14. DD now have MDs tuned to their own IFF.
15. DD are now equipped with XM177s for the medic, Dutch, and
flamethrower operator
16. DD riflemen have a 60% chance for an M16A1, 30% chance for an M16
Grenadier, and 10% chance for an M60.
17. Removes the M60 from black market
18. Moves DD presets to their own standalone folder, and removes the
/fun/ from their typepaths.
19. Changes CLF crashed ship M60 to a MAR50
20. Adds sprites for M203, XM177, M16 Grenadier
21. DD spawn with a lucky pack and a zippo in their helmet.


# Explain why it's good for the game

Dutch's Dozen is a bit outdated, and light on content, gives them some
love.
Removes gear that doesn't fit in BM from BM, also I buffed the gear too
so balance concerns.

1. An unwielded rifle(M41A), had more accuracy than a wielded M1911,
would do this for other pistols too but out of scope as DD only use
M1911
2. They were incredibly easy to kill via leg/arm aiming, as no armor,
HPCs instakilled them(DD are default dishonorable), and FF did insane
damage as they all had high AP 40 damage rifles.
3. ERT medical pouch was worse than normal med-pouch, DD use this too.
4. Was intended, survivor endurance skill nerf effected this too as the
same define was used for both as a shortcut
5. M60 underpreformed, makes it better.
6. Dropping Ol' Painless over and over sucks.
7. Unique realistic mechanic for the M60, makes it more interactive
8. Unique guns, only DD get them, also the XM177 is my favorite gun of
all time I love it 😊
9. Unique UGL for M16 Grenadier, designed to work directly with the
sprite, as its integrated and only fits on it.
10. Grenades for DD to have a better chance against preds, riflemen have
a 30% chance of spawning with M16 GL.
11. Made for a stun, team gameplay for DD.
12. Area denial.
13. Vietnam Vibes, support tool cause it does jack shit damage.
14. DD couldn't tell friend from foe
15. (AWESOME) Carbine for Dutch, makes sense for the support and members
of the team to have carbines instead of rifles
16. Variance within DD team, all 3 of the guns are good, GL is a support
tool, M60 as an ambush(also its The Pig), A1 is normal
17. M60 doesn't fit thematically, and is too powerful.
18. Easier access, they don't fit in the fun file
19. Buffed M60, MAR50 fits more there anyway.
20. Sprites for things I added.
21. Its cool.

New Agda syntax highlighting extension for VSCode (#562)

I've written an improved Agda syntax-highlighting extension for VSCode
called _agda-syntax_
([GitHub](https://github.com/fredrik-bakke/agda-syntax-vscode), [VSCode
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FredrikBakke.agda-syntax)).
Although it is still in preview, my opinion is that it is already a
significant improvement over the previously used extension. Therefore, I
propose that we migrate our development environment (for VSCode users)
to use this new extension.

### Some highlights of the extension
Compared to the previously used extension, this new extension
- injects into markdown syntax, so that the markdown code can be
highlighted as markdown code as well
- highlights all variable declarations (with some bugs still), module
names, wildcard symbols, all reserved keywords (and only recognizes
reserved keywords as reserved keywords)
- Recognizes the appropriate token-boundaries
- Highlights line comments properly

Please understand that the grammar framework that has to be used to
write the extension is highly limited, so not all highlighting
functionality can be implemented. For instance, the parsing must be done
in a single pass, and the functionality to match over multiple lines is
very limited. Hence, for example, matching the left-hand side of an
equals sign is very gnarly (although I have one idea left to try with
regard to this).

Still, I would greatly appreciate any feedback, either if it is a bug or
a feature request, which is another reason why I want to introduce it
into our defined development environment at this point.

If you want to try out the extension right now, follow the VSCode
Marketplace link:

Removing Module Editing as it is out of Scope
- Ah, well isn't that just typical? The life of a coder is a never-ending series of deadlines and incomplete projects. In this case, it seems Rhese has made the executive decision to remove Module Editing capabilities from the project. While this may come as a disappointment to some, it's important to remember that in the grand scheme of things, Module Editing is just a small cog in the machine of software development. Plus, let's be honest, who really wants to spend their time tinkering around with modules when there are more exciting things to be done, like debugging and error handling? In any case, it's probably for the best that Rhese focuses on getting the core functionality working properly before worrying about any additional bells and whistles. After all, as the Guide always says, "Don't Panic" - there's always time to add more features later.

UE5.1.1 - Calibration Mode Overlay

Added a nice new UI overlay to let you know that you are in Calibration Mode after hearing some people get confused about what happens when you first start the system.  If you don't like it, disconnect it in the function for VRPlayerMode_CalibrationMode.

Did a lot of work on the UE5 Manny control rig.  It could be better.  It could be worse.  I find it really hard to tell sometimes, so I did leave the old one in MegaMocapVR\ControlRigs\WIP_ControlRigs\OLD_MMVR_UE5Manny_ControlRig

The UE5 Manny control rig now has a way to lock the arm goals to the chest control, so you can use it for animation/cleanup a bit easier.  This variable is exposed to cinematics, which is a sick feature I want to make more use out of.

I reduced the tick on the editor utility widget.

Revamped the teleprompter, creating a new Teleprompter Screen actor that gets spawned in if you use the new event on the player pawn 'Event_TeleprompterUpdate.

Did some small changes to the metahuman control rig, but... I don't remember what they were.  Again, who knows if its better.  I think I made an 'is valid' check on the iphone name so it wouldn't throw you errors if no iphone was added to the player pawn.

emerge-webrsync: support PGP verification via gemato

Introduce PGP verification of the webrsync snapshot tarballs
using app-portage/gemato - which is already a dependency of Portage
for verifying normal rsync.

This is the same method Portage uses (see below).

Technical changes before we dive into the rationale:
- Use gemato for PGP verification just like Portage does for
  sync-type=webrsync, sync-type=rsync (although that uses a metamanifest),
  and sync-type=git (although that uses gemato for gpg-wrap, so works differently).

- Use gentoo-functions automagically if available for better output
  functions.

- Be more verbose about verification and various other operations,
  while also respecting --quiet if passed for misc. existing & new
  messages.

- Make --verbose a no-op. There weren't enough output messages
  to justify three states (--quiet, normal, --verbose).

- Bail out more aggressively in the event of errors or "warnings".

- Use modern terminology for repository, etc (avoid overloading the
  "portage" term.)

- Allow disabling PGP verification with --no-pgp-verify.

Technically, the fix is very straightforward, but getting to
the fix was the slightly painful bit. What I've concluded
happened is:
- Portage starts getting reworked to gain proper sync module support;

- Someone gets the idea of implementing emerge-webrsync fully in Python
  as a Portage sync module (which is a not-unreasonable idea);

  [This ultimately hasn't gone anywhere, and in fact, while working on this
  bug, I ended up finding a bunch of typos that meant you couldn't even test it.
  But it's a stub anyway.]

- The idea of deprecating emerge-webrsync is floated around. The idea
  being Portage should call it via its new sync module with sync-type=webrsync.

  This is presumably with the ultimate goal of it transparently one day
  using the aforementioned (yet-non-existent) Python implementation as its
  backend, and not the shell script.

  [To this day, Portage's webrsync implementation shells out to the emerge-webrsync
  shell script, but it has the abstraction to switch that out, in theory.]

- At the time, PGP verification in general of the Gentoo
  repository is an active topic, especially now we'd migrated to git which makes
  it way easier, unlike CVS.

- A bug is filed for PGP verification in emerge-webrsync.

  People decide it doesn't matter too much, because Portage is going to
  Real Soon Now (TM) have its own backend (replacing the shell script) and/or
  Portage's sync module support obsoletes emerge-webrsync entirely.

  The idea here, I think, being that nobody should call emerge-webrsync and
  everyone should just call emerge (or emaint) to sync as appropriate.

  [This isn't a terrible idea in a sense, but it needs a better basis:
  we should probably make emerge-webrsync a wrapper which creates a temporary
  repo config to forcefully webrsync a repository if the user asks us to. This
  is what people expect from emerge-webrsync with the default sync-type=rsync
  in repos.conf for ::gentoo.

  I actually started implementing this before I realised that emerge was
  shelling out to emerge-webrsync, so have postponed it.]

- Then nothing happens with the "replacement" ideas and the good
  ol' trusty emerge-webrsync ends up with the same problems sitting
  there because nobody saw the point in working on it if it was to
  be replaced soon. But that didn't happen.

The fix overall for this is pretty small, but the commit is larger
than I'd like because I had to rework a few things to sensibly allow
disabling PGP verification as well as follow the flow.

(I did start splitting up this commit but ultimately it needs -w
for best review even without the output tweaks in this commit and
deconstructing this for atomic commits would end up being more brittle
as I couldn't be as confident in the result.)

Fix MGOAL_FIND_ITEM_GROUP, fix up some code (#2546)

* Reorganize

Code still sucks. In particular recruit_class doesn't compare properly with npc->my_class so MGOAL_RECRUIT_NPC_CLASS fails horribly even if you fix up that area of code to it actually points to type->recruit_class instead of recruit_class

For that matter mission has a select copy of several mission type defs and I can only assume this is due to legacy fuckery.

* Fix mission.cpp

Now will only allow you to select items if you have enough of them, and will only consume the necessary amount.

Added documentation for MGOAL_FIND_ITEM_GROUP

Thank god this wasn't too much work.
