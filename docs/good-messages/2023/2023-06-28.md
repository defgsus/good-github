windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

Implement SSL service

This implements some missing network APIs including a large chunk of the SSL
service, enough for Mario Maker (with an appropriate mod applied) to connect to
the fan server [Open Course World](https://opencourse.world/).

Connecting to first-party servers is out of scope of this PR and is a
minefield I'd rather not step into.

 ## TLS

TLS is implemented with multiple backends depending on the system's 'native'
TLS library.  Currently there are two backends: Schannel for Windows, and
OpenSSL for Linux.  (In reality Linux is a bit of a free-for-all where there's
no one 'native' library, but OpenSSL is the closest it gets.)  On macOS the
'native' library is SecureTransport but that isn't implemented in this PR.
(Instead, all non-Windows OSes will use OpenSSL unless disabled with
`-DENABLE_OPENSSL=OFF`.)

Why have multiple backends instead of just using a single library, especially
given that Yuzu already embeds mbedtls for cryptographic algorithms?  Well, I
tried implementing this on mbedtls first, but the problem is TLS policies -
mainly trusted certificate policies, and to a lesser extent trusted algorithms,
SSL versions, etc.

...In practice, the chance that someone is going to conduct a man-in-the-middle
attack on a third-party game server is pretty low, but I'm a security nerd so I
like to do the right security things.

My base assumption is that we want to use the host system's TLS policies.  An
alternative would be to more closely emulate the Switch's TLS implementation
(which is based on NSS).  But for one thing, I don't feel like reverse
engineering it.  And I'd argue that for third-party servers such as Open Course
World, it's theoretically preferable to use the system's policies rather than
the Switch's, for two reasons

1. Someday the Switch will stop being updated, and the trusted cert list,
   algorithms, etc. will start to go stale, but users will still want to
   connect to third-party servers, and there's no reason they shouldn't have
   up-to-date security when doing so.  At that point, homebrew users on actual
   hardware may patch the TLS implementation, but for emulators it's simpler to
   just use the host's stack.

2. Also, it's good to respect any custom certificate policies the user may have
   added systemwide.  For example, they may have added custom trusted CAs in
   order to use TLS debugging tools or pass through corporate MitM middleboxes.
   Or they may have removed some CAs that are normally trusted out of paranoia.

Note that this policy wouldn't work as-is for connecting to first-party
servers, because some of them serve certificates based on Nintendo's own CA
rather than a publicly trusted one.  However, this could probably be solved
easily by using appropriate APIs to adding Nintendo's CA as an alternate
trusted cert for Yuzu's connections.  That is not implemented in this PR
because, again, first-party servers are out of scope.

(If anything I'd rather have an option to _block_ connections to Nintendo
servers, but that's not implemented here.)

To use the host's TLS policies, there are three theoretical options:

a) Import the host's trusted certificate list into a cross-platform TLS
   library (presumably mbedtls).

b) Use the native TLS library to verify certificates but use a cross-platform
   TLS library for everything else.

c) Use the native TLS library for everything.

Two problems with option a).  First, importing the trusted certificate list at
minimum requires a bunch of platform-specific code, which mbedtls does not have
built in.  Interestingly, OpenSSL recently gained the ability to import the
Windows certificate trust store... but that leads to the second problem, which
is that a list of trusted certificates is [not expressive
enough](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/41909) to express a modern certificate
trust policy.  For example, Windows has the concept of [explicitly distrusted
certificates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn265983(v=ws.11)),
and macOS requires Certificate Transparency validation for some certificates
with complex rules for when it's required.

Option b) (using native library just to verify certs) is probably feasible, but
it would miss aspects of TLS policy other than trusted certs (like allowed
algorithms), and in any case it might well require writing more code, not less,
compared to using the native library for everything.

So I ended up at option c), using the native library for everything.

What I'd *really* prefer would be to use a third-party library that does option
c) for me.  Rust has a good library for this,
[native-tls](https://docs.rs/native-tls/latest/native_tls/).  I did search, but
I couldn't find a good option in the C or C++ ecosystem, at least not any that
wasn't part of some much larger framework.  I was surprised - isn't this a
pretty common use case?  Well, many applications only need TLS for HTTPS, and they can
use libcurl, which has a TLS abstraction layer internally but doesn't expose
it.  Other applications only support a single TLS library, or use one of the
aforementioned larger frameworks, or are platform-specific to begin with, or of
course are written in a non-C/C++ language, most of which have some canonical
choice for TLS.  But there are also many applications that have a set of TLS
backends just like this; it's just that nobody has gone ahead and abstracted
the pattern into a library, at least not a widespread one.

Amusingly, there is one TLS abstraction layer that Yuzu already bundles: the
one in ffmpeg.  But it is missing some features that would be needed to use it
here (like reusing an existing socket rather than managing the socket itself).
Though, that does mean that the wiki's build instructions for Linux (and macOS
for some reason?) already recommend installing OpenSSL, so no need to update
those.

 ## Other APIs implemented

- Sockets:
    - GetSockOpt(`SO_ERROR`)
    - SetSockOpt(`SO_NOSIGPIPE`) (stub, I have no idea what this does on Switch)
    - `DuplicateSocket` (because the SSL sysmodule calls it internally)
    - More `PollEvents` values

- NSD:
    - `Resolve` and `ResolveEx` (stub, good enough for Open Course World and
      probably most third-party servers, but not first-party)

- SFDNSRES:
    - `GetHostByNameRequest` and `GetHostByNameRequestWithOptions`
    - `ResolverSetOptionRequest` (stub)

 ## Fixes

- Parts of the socket code were previously allocating a `sockaddr` object on
  the stack when calling functions that take a `sockaddr*` (e.g. `accept`).
  This might seem like the right thing to do to avoid illegal aliasing, but in
  fact `sockaddr` is not guaranteed to be large enough to hold any particular
  type of address, only the header.  This worked in practice because in
  practice `sockaddr` is the same size as `sockaddr_in`, but it's not how the
  API is meant to be used.  I changed this to allocate an `sockaddr_in` on the
  stack and `reinterpret_cast` it.  I could try to do something cleverer with
  `aligned_storage`, but casting is the idiomatic way to use these particular
  APIs, so it's really the system's responsibility to avoid any aliasing
  issues.

- I rewrote most of the `GetAddrInfoRequest[WithOptions]` implementation.  The
  old implementation invoked the host's getaddrinfo directly from sfdnsres.cpp,
  and directly passed through the host's socket type, protocol, etc. values
  rather than looking up the corresponding constants on the Switch.  To be
  fair, these constants don't tend to actually vary across systems, but
  still... I added a wrapper for `getaddrinfo` in
  `internal_network/network.cpp` similar to the ones for other socket APIs, and
  changed the `GetAddrInfoRequest` implementation to use it.  While I was at
  it, I rewrote the serialization to use the same approach I used to implement
  `GetHostByNameRequest`, because it reduces the number of size calculations.
  While doing so I removed `AF_INET6` support because the Switch doesn't
  support IPv6; it might be nice to support IPv6 anyway, but that would have to
  apply to all of the socket APIs.

  I also corrected the IPC wrappers for `GetAddrInfoRequest` and
  `GetAddrInfoRequestWithOptions` based on reverse engineering and hardware
  testing.  Every call to `GetAddrInfoRequestWithOptions` returns *four*
  different error codes (IPC status, getaddrinfo error code, netdb error code,
  and errno), and `GetAddrInfoRequest` returns three of those but in a
  different order, and it doesn't really matter but the existing implementation
  was a bit off, as I discovered while testing `GetHostByNameRequest`.

  - The new serialization code is based on two simple helper functions:

    ```cpp
    template <typename T> static void Append(std::vector<u8>& vec, T t);
    void AppendNulTerminated(std::vector<u8>& vec, std::string_view str);
    ```

    I was thinking there must be existing functions somewhere that assist with
    serialization/deserialization of binary data, but all I could find was the
    helper methods in `IOFile` and `HLERequestContext`, not anything that could
    be used with a generic byte buffer.  If I'm not missing something, then
    maybe I should move the above functions to a new header in `common`...
    right now they're just sitting in `sfdnsres.cpp` where they're used.

- Not a fix, but `SocketBase::Recv`/`Send` is changed to use `std::span<u8>`
  rather than `std::vector<u8>&` to avoid needing to copy the data to/from a
  vector when those methods are called from the TLS implementation.

Larva surge is limited by marines/xenos ratio (#3592)

# About the pull request

Xenos after hijack now get larva based on marines/xenos ratio. Instead
of infinite larva, larva surge will try to increase the initial amount
of xenos on hijack to 50% of marines forces over time (with a minimum of
5 larvas, if xenos already have good numbers).

# Explain why it's good for the game

Initially, if I remember correctly, larva surge was brought into the
game to discourage marines from early meta-evacuations, which is fair.
But consequently, it really hurt the hijack sequence. Even if marines
evac fair and square, larva surge still comes in action and makes
situation for marines even worse, utterly discouraging everything but
either boomrushing the Alamo or holding lifeboats to evac.

This resulted in hijacks being very repetitive and boring. More than
that, larva surge is extremely busted on lowpop due to the fact you can
get around 20 xenos from nothing, making lowpop hijack even less
interesting. So with this change marines will still get punished for
evaccing with good numbers, but won't be penalized as much for honest
evacuations.

So hopefully, we will see more variety of hijacks and more interesting
stories!

P.S. if you have a better formula, let me know.

Field Transfusions & Fixes Sprites/Runtime (#2152)

* Working field transfusions

As far as I can tell, no runtimes or bugs. Should be good to go. Could maybe do with some polish? But otherwise it works great.

* Fixes energy weapon bugs

Fixes a runtime related to emptying cells from energy weapons, and fixes an overlay bug and inventory icon bug on the cells themselves.

* Bug fixes

read above, fixes a few bugs/errors

* Broken as hell

Supposed to add new IV bag sprites and overlays that would change as the bag gets emptier. Multiple bugs both with transfusion and the icon/overlay. Right now, the icon currently disappears once the object is on the ground and I can't tell why. Secondly, the overlay has the visual bugs and could probably do with a more thorough system to apply it? The bugs on transfusion are mostly due to a lack of sanity checks, where it will continue to be attached to someone from many tiles away when thrown/dropped, etc.

* Shit

HATE HATE HATE this sucks and it is buggy as hell

* Fix icon/overlay updates

* Mostly working

Still some broken stuff, you can attach IV bags if you're not next to someone and do it from inside containers, also fixes the world states for the police and military 10mm pistol

* Finishing touches

Couple of bug fixes, fixes 10mm police/military world sprite, etc etc. Should be good to go.

Replaces the Reaper Scythe with the Vorpal Scythe (also the Morbid trait) (#75948)

adds the Vorpal Scythe, a special chaplain null rod variant, replacing
the Reaper Scythe, a not so special null rod variant.

When you choose the vorpal scythe, it comes as a shard that you implant
into your arm, similar to a cursed katana.

Once implanted, you can draw it at any time like an arm implant.
However, sheathing it again presents some problems. (Also, implanting
the organ gives you ``TRAIT_MORBID``, which I'll explain in a bit)

The Vorpal Scythe has 10 force, one of the weakest null rod variants for
force that isn't a joke null rod. However, it has exceptional armor pen
and also has 2 tiles of reach. So quite unique.

It also has a special beheading ability when you right-click someone.
This borrows some code from amputation shears, functioning pretty
similarly, except with a few additional ways to speed up the action and
restrictions. (It takes 15 seconds baseline to behead someone standing
and conscious, and speeds up or slows down based on factors such as
incapacitation and whether or not our scythe is already empowered)

When you successfully behead someone with a mind, the vorpal scythe
gains 20 force and can be safely stowed and drawn for 2 minutes.
Performing more death knells like this will reset the timer.

If it has not performed its 'death knell', or you haven't hit a living
mob, then it will cause severe damage to you if you ever try and stow it
(or its forced back into your arm). Just hitting a mob with the scythe
will sate it for 4 minutes. Unless it is a non-player monkey. Horrible
things. Just hitting mobs does not reset the timer on empowerment.

What this means is that the chaplain may be more hesitant to simply draw
their weapon on people. It also means that potentially, the chaplain
will not always have magic immunity, since they may end up stowing the
weapon away and be reluctant to draw it on a whim without either taking
damage for sheathing it without hitting something, or dealing with
having one less hand up until they can.

While empowerment only happens when you behead mobs with a mind,
beheading monkeyhumans and other mindless humans subtypes causes their
heads to become haunted! It's mostly harmless and largely just SpOoKy.
We don't want heads with actual players in them to go floating off to
space. (Does not work on monkey heads for sanity reasons)

When you have the Morbid trait, you think creepy stuff is cool and hate
saving peoples lives. You get a mood boost from graverobbing, autopsies,
dissections, amputations (including beheadings with the scythe and
amputations with the shears) and revival surgery. However, you get a
mood penalty when you tend wounds on the living, as well as a hefty
penalty when you perform CPR or defibrillate someone. I was thinking
Victor Frankenstein when I was choosing which actions had an associated
moodlet, so anything that I might have missed would be appreciated.

You also count as potentially cool with regards to haunted objects.
Ghosts think you're neat. (Revenants probably will still kill you if
they had the chance)

[FEATURE] Feature/prepare for training feedbacktask (#3151)

# Description

I added a very rough outline of my ideation behind
`prepare_for_training` with the new `FeedbackDataset`. As discussed
there are 3 complexities:

- How to resolve annotator alignment?
- How to resolve optional fields, which have not been filled out? e.g.,
"Please provide a correction for prompt 1?".
- How handle potential concatenation of fields? 

To make it modular I created a step-wise approach.

1. `Pydantic` Models that map and verify data fields, like so. By doing
this we keep the flexibility to allow for other tasks like
TextClassification and this ensures we can directly use `datasets.field`
and `dataset.questions` for defining training. We could also use the
`name` values from the fields/questions, but this might be more error
prone.
2. `get_relevant_data_for_training()` in `List[dict]` format with all
relevant fields from the Pydantic model. **annotator alignment issue**.
For now I opted for choosing the first non-zero value.
3. Forward the `List[dict]` to a similar flow we previously had.
4. Also add `dataset.unify_responses(question, Enum(strategy))`-method
5. Added `*QuestionUnifcation` to schemas to hold logic surrounding
unifying multiplier responses
6. Added `client.feedback.training`
7. Added`TrainingDataFor*` to hold logic surrounding
`prepare_for_training`-methods per task
8. Added inheritance for ArgillaTrainer

```python 
import argilla as rg
from argilla import (
    FeedbackRecord,
    LabelQuestion,
    LabelQuestionUnification,
    MultiLabelQuestion,
    TrainingDataForTextClassification,

## [silicons/Citadel-Station-13-RP](https://github.com/silicons/Citadel-Station-13-RP)@[1468797059...](https://github.com/silicons/Citadel-Station-13-RP/commit/146879705978b0416739823fa54467e865c3ffb2)
#### Wednesday 2023-06-28 02:48:21 by TheObserver-sys

Take 2: Some fixes and QoL (#5601)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Would you believe me if I hadn't updated my git in about 400 years, and
had to blow the old version of my repo up?
Yes? No? It doesn't matter.

Anyways! Meat and potatoes of this:
Allows players to make gene and plant discs freely in the protolathe.
Since we do not have a dedicated genetics, this will help the pains of
actually doing genetics by giving us storage solutions for genes.

Fixes a problem with brass also creating slag when compressing, by
setting the copper alloy flag to 1.

And finally: Allows you to upgrade the braces! If your brace has T3 or
better, a single brace can hold an entire drill. All credit goes to
Hatterhat for this one, as I pretty much wholesale ripped it from his
buff of the big drill™ on Virgo.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Not making slag is ALWAYS good. It saves on material, too.
Having more discs for a cheap cost is also good, it means you can reduce
headaches while scoping out for genes, because there are many, and the
ability to track them are currently few.
And honestly, the less lugging a person has to do with the mining drill,
the more likely people might stop blowing up an already unstable planet
with miniature hydrogen bombs.
<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl: The0bserver
add: Discs are able to be produced in the protolathe now. Go nuts, or
don't. I'm not your guardian.
balance: Mining Drills can finally be operated with just one brace with
the requisite parts. Thank you, Hatterhat!
fix: Copper no longer smelts slag when set to "Alloying."
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

## [tgstation/tgstation](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation)@[8af20d1577...](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/8af20d157738044cef2fc00846caa1869d56a087)

Fixes some inconsistencies with the chaplain revolver and gets rid of a weird ammo define (#76237)

## About The Pull Request

Firstly, I gave the revolver a new sprite. I mean, this isn't so much of
an improvement as it is a reference I wanted to go with, so if people go
'no not a new sprite' I don't mind reverting.

What's the reference? Check the new name I added as a potential name
roll.

![lucky
38](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/40847847/e11874be-1416-4e21-bda9-4881d49cad1b)

Secondly; I applied to the gun itself revenant bane, the ability to
clear runes, and proper magic immunity as a full null rod would enable.
This last bit was a deliberate design choice, but the divine bow has
full magic protection, so I think this is now more of a consistency
consideration compared to the divine bow.

Thirdly, the revolver is a .38 revolver, HOWEVER, it uses a damage
multiplier to bring it back to the damage it did originally. It also
cannot be reloaded without the prayer action. No cheating. Effectively,
this is the same mechanically as it was before.

It rarely does a funny crit fanfare. This does nothing mechanically, I
just thought it was a funny nod to the sprite's reference (and I guess
another game that the crit fanfare is based on). Borrowed parts of the
code and sprite from this April Fool's pr by Wallemations >
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/74425

## Why It's Good For The Game

I think this might have been a little forgotten since implementation now
that we have another projectile weapon for the chaplain. So I'm brushing
it up a bit.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Makes the chaplain's revolver consistent with its immediate
sibling, the Divine Bow, by giving it similar statistics.
code: Makes the chaplain revolver a .38 but prevents it from being
loaded without using the special prayer action. Also applies a damage
multiplier to keep it at the original 18 force. Mechanically, no
different.
sprite: Gives the chaplain revolver a new sprite.
code: Removes an unnecessary admin log when removing runes.

I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you.

[Eval] Add Chinese Homophonic  (#1169)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Understand Chinese Homophonic 

### Eval description

We have found some popular homophonic sentences on the Internet,
including the Chinese pronunciation of English words and homophones, and
provide several options for the model to determine which option matches
the homophonic sentence the best.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Chinese homophonic puns are a widely popular internet cultural
phenomenon that generates humor by utilizing the homophonic
relationships between Chinese characters. These puns are typically
spread in text form on social media, forums, and messaging applications,
and they are extremely common in China's online culture.

Homophonic puns have a wide range of applications, encompassing ordinary
daily life scenarios as well as hot news events, entertainment gossip,
and political current affairs. These puns frequently appear in internet
memes, jokes, advertising slogans, and short videos, garnering
significant popularity among young people and internet users.

For those unfamiliar with them, homophonic puns may seem like encrypted
text, making it difficult to grasp the true intention behind them.
However, understanding them allows for the establishment of strong
connections between individuals and facilitates smooth communication.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

Add Korean honorific sentence classification eval (#1181)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

korean-honorific

### Eval description

Evaluates LLMs on the task of classifying Korean honorific/non-honorific
sentences.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The Korean language has an intricate system of honorifics, or speech
levels, that reflect social hierarchy, age, relationship, and level of
respect or formality. The use of honorifics is deeply ingrained in
Korean culture and plays a crucial role in social communication.
Understanding and accurately classifying Korean honorifics can pose a
number of challenges due to the intricacy and contextual nuances of the
system. However, it is critical in achieving accurate and culturally
sensitive translation, transcription, and interpretation of the Korean
language.

Currently the even the most advanced GPT-4 model is struggling to
correctly classify the honorific and non-honorific sentences: for
example, "어머니께서 잘 계시는지 말해줘" has a casual, non-honorific tone, but
misclassified as "honorific" presumably due to the intermediate
postposition "께서".

Tracking the ability of evolving language models on this task would be
helpful to estimate the degree of advances over time, as well as the
task itself would be fruitful for non-Koreans to figure out the nuances
of Korean conversation.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

chinese-lantern-riddles

### Eval description

This evaluation tests the model's performance in solving Chinese lantern
riddles, which are based on the shape, pronunciation, and meaning of
Chinese characters.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Lantern riddles are a traditional Chinese festive activity that involves
multiple participants guessing riddles together. Apart from being a part
of festival celebrations, lantern riddles can also serve as an
educational tool to help Chinese language learners enhance their
vocabulary and language reasoning. Through the process of unraveling the
riddles, students can also develop their logical thinking and reasoning
skills, as well as nurture their imagination and creativity. Lantern
riddles can also spark students' interest in language learning and make
the learning experience more enjoyable.

Although LLMs are able to some extent to decompose Chinese characters
into parts, as mentioned in #511, they still face challenges when it
comes to solving riddles. In most cases, GPT 3.5 cannot reason correctly
about the structure of Chinese characters. For instance, the riddle
"上下一体（打一字）" can be interpreted as a combination ("一体") of "上" and "下",
resulting in the answer "卡". However, GPT 3.5 gives the wrong answer,
"升", with a reason that makes no sense. A similar situation occurs when
GPT 3.5 reasons about the pronunciation of Chinese characters, with one
of its explanations stating that the pronunciation of "盼（pàn）" is
similar to the pronunciation of "俄（é）", which is entirely incorrect.
However, on the positive side, GPT 3.5 shows good performance when a
riddle only encodes meaning and does not require reasoning about the
structure and pronunciation.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [ x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [ x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x ] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

Add Belarusian orthography eval (#1188)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

belarusian-orthography

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to switch between classical and modern
orthographies of Belarusian.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Belarusian is famous for having two Wikipedias:
[one](https://be.wikipedia.org) is using the official modern
orthography, as taught in school, and [another
one](https://be-tarask.wikipedia.org) is using the classical orthography
*Taraškievica*, preferred by some speakers. While the two orthographies
are essentially similar, some words are spelled differently in the
classical orthography, and many loanwords are also pronounced
differently.

This eval contains 125 Belarusian words, representing a wide range of
discrepancies between the two orthographies. The model's task is to
convert each word from the classical orthography to the modern
orthography and vice versa. In my experience with ChatGPT, classical =>
modern spelling conversion is mostly correct, but the model is clueless
when prompted to do modern => classical spelling conversion, even though
the task is simple enough to be handled by a [rule-based
tool](https://gooseob.github.io/taraskevizatar).

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Ordering Randomised VersionList

### Eval description

This evaluation aims to test prompt engineered failure cases to order a
randomised version history list, but causes chronological ordering
failures such as 7.5.2 -> 7.4.2 -> 7.5.1 -> 7.4.1 (**incorrectly
inserted 7.4.2 in between 7.5.2 and 7.5.1** and **incorrectly skipping
over the major release version 7.5.0** in the Explainable AI chain of
thoughts) and 7.5.2 -> 7.5.1 -> 7.5.0 -> 7.4.1 (incorrectly **skipped
over 7.4.2** in the Explainable AI chain of thoughts).

### What makes this a useful eval?
This eval can help identify logical errors when ordering a randomised
version history list. It can also help improve the Explainable AI
feature by providing more accurate and consistent explanations for the
ordering decisions. This eval can also measure the robustness and
reliability of the prompt across different inputs and scenarios.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval is high quality because it causes the succeed rate for a 5
options (ABCDE) multiple choice quiz drop from 20% correct at randomly
selected answers to only 0-6% correct for GPT-3.5-Turbo. These are
prompt engineered failures, causing [bigger failure rates than prior
work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04388.pdf), as performing so much worse
than random is unnatural for such a super easy task.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

</details>

- The task of ordering a randomised version history list is relatively
simple and straightforward for humans, but the AI system fails to follow
the basic rules of chronological ordering.
- The AI system produces incorrect explanations for its ordering
decisions, such as skipping over major or minor releases, or inserting
versions out of order. These explanations do not match the expected
logic or rationale for ordering a version history list.
- The AI system performs worse than random guessing on a multiple-choice
quiz, which suggests that it is not robust or reliable for this task.

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Reasoning with Contradictory Constraints

### Eval description

Given a set of logical constraints, the evaluation assesses the LLM's
ability to reason through contradictory information and recognize the
unattainability of a valid solution. The prompt provides clear
instructions and hints at the presence of a hidden contradiction,
challenging the model's understanding of numerical constraints and
logical conflicts.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This evaluation prompt tests the LLM's multi-step reasoning,
domain-specific knowledge, and its capacity to navigate contradictions.
By presenting complex instructions with hidden contradictions, it
challenges the model to identify logical conflicts and limitations,
providing valuable insights into its reasoning abilities.

(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

[Eval] Determine a gear rotation given a layout (#1136)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

gears_rotation

### Eval description

Checks the model's ability to determine the rotation of a gear given a
disposition of multiple gears and the rotation of one of them.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Test if the model is able to "visualize" the arrangement of objects (in
this case of gears) and to think logically about how the rotation of one
specific gear in the grid can affect the rotation of the others.
Gpt3.5 had an accuracy of 0.16 (4/25 right). Gpt4 (chatgpt plus
subscription) seems to fail in the same places as 3.5. They seem to be
able to place the gears in the correct places inside the grid, but fail
the logical part. Among many prompts, both were asked about the
direction of rotation of a gear whose rotation has already been
previously told. However, they still got it wrong.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Simple 2-Block Arrangement Puzzles

### Eval description

Two Tetris shapes are given and a desired arrangement of those shapes is
given. The model must arrange the blocks to match the desired shape
outline.

Here's an example of what a prompt/answer would look like:

### What makes this a useful eval?

This kind of spatial reasoning is trivial for a human to do. It should
also be a piece of cake for a generally-intelligent AI model.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good

where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4

- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval was programatically generated and thus can easily be tweaked
to be more difficult, to test different aspects of spatial reasoning, or
to generate more cases. I [wrote a
script](https://github.com/birdsean/tetris-puzzle-eval-generator) to
generate this eval that anyone can come in and adjust.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

commit: give a hint when a commit message has been abandoned

If we launch an editor for the user to create a commit
message, they may put significant work into doing so.
Typically we try to check common mistakes that could cause
the commit to fail early, so that we die before the user
goes to the trouble.

We may still experience some errors afterwards, though; in
this case, the user is given no hint that their commit
message has been saved. Let's tell them where it is.

Refactor test suite to make real requests to a real server (#131)

In the course of validating #125, we discovered that using the stdlib's
[`httptest.ResponseRecorder`][0] mechanism to drive the vast majority of
our unit tests led to some slight brokenness due to subtle differences
in the way those "simulated" requests are handled vs "real" requests to
a live HTTP server, as [explained in this comment][1].

That prompted me to do a big ass refactor of the entire test suite,
swapping httptest.ResponseRecorder for interacting with a live server
instance via [`httptest.Server`][2].

This should make the test suite more accurate and reliable in the long
run by ensuring that the vast majority of tests are making actual HTTP
requests and reading responses from the wire.

Note that updating these tests also uncovered a few minor bugs in
existing handler code, fixed in a separate commit for visibility.

P.S. I'm awfully sorry to anyone who tries to merge or rebase local test
changes after this refactor lands, that is goign to be a nightmare. If
you run into issues resolving conflicts, feel free to ping me and I can
try to help!

Add snap-layouts support to the Terminal (#11680)

Adds snap layout support to the Terminal's maximize button. This PR is
full of BODGY, so brace yourselves.

Big thanks to Chris Swan in #11134 for building the prototype.
I don't believe this solves #8795, because XAML islands can't get
nchittest messages

- The window procedure for the drag bar forwards clicks on its client
  area to its parent as non-client clicks.
- BODGY: It also _manually_ handles the caption buttons. They exist in
  the titlebar, and work reasonably well with just XAML, if the drag bar
  isn't covering them.
- However, to get snap layout support, we need to actually return
  `HTMAXBUTTON` where the maximize button is. If the drag bar doesn't
  cover the caption buttons, then the core input site (which takes up
  the entirety of the XAML island) will steal the `WM_NCHITTEST` before
  we get a chance to handle it.
- So, the drag bar covers the caption buttons, and manually handles
  hovering and pressing them when needed. This gives the impression that
  they're getting input as they normally would, even if they're not
  _really_ getting input via XAML.
- We also need to manually display the button tooltips now, because XAML
  doesn't know when they've been hovered for long enough. Hence, the
  `_displayToolTip` `ThrottledFuncTrailing`

## Validation
Minimized, maximized, restored down, hovered the buttons slowly, moved
the mouse over them quickly, they feel the same as before. But now with
snap layouts appearing.

## TODO!
* [x] I'm working on getting the ToolTips on the caption buttons back. Alas, I needed a demo of this _today_, so I'll fix that tomorrow morning.
* [x] mild concern: I should probably test Win 10 to make sure there wasn't weird changes to the message loop in win11 that means this is broken on win10.
* [x] I think I used the wrong issue number for tons of my comments throughout this PR. Double check that. Should be #9443, not #9447. 

Closes #9443
I thought this took care of #8587 ~as a bonus, because I was here, and the fix is _now_ trivial~, but looking at the latest commit that regressed.

Add ability to checkpoint a pipeline.

This change allows to query the running configuration of
a pipeline. And we also allow to update the running
configuration of a pipeline explicitly. So all the normal
interactions with connectors, pipelines, and program
objects act as a staging area which can be committed
using the API to the running version of the pipeline.

This change has several components:

This is pretty straight forward: We add history tables for
pipeline, program, attached_connectors, and connectors.
The history table contains the same fields as the
non-history counter-parts but we add a revision field
and change the primary keys to be uuid+revision in those
tables.

The history tables are immutable snapshots of the pipeline
config. You see where this is going, whenever we need
to commit a config. We go off and copy the pipeline row,
the program row, all attached_connector and connector
rows associated with the pipeline we want to version
into the history table. We assign them a new
revision for every version. And we're almost done with
versioning stuff. Kind of...

Now we have all these versions, and each version has a
different binary, so we need to keep the binaries around.
That's a bit unfortunate, but this will go away again
once we have JIT. It also is kinda dumb because we don't
want to keep binaries for all versions we ever created.
So here is what we do:
Whenever we create a new program binary we version it
in a (new) binaries folder (in the dbsp workspace) using a
naming schema that is `project_$uuid_$version`. The reason
we version immediately and not say at commit time of a pipeline
is because the binary we used so far was just the binary directly
from the target dir of that project. But we don't really
know what state this binary is in, especially if we can have
commit and compile requests happening at the same
time. So in the same 'transaction' that builds the binary
we version it and copy it away. And the pipeline manager
only runs versioned binaries. We also need a way to clean
up binaries. That's also a bit silly because when is it safe to delete
a version of a binary? Well, it's only safe if no pipeline
has that program version as it's current, last revision.
And no pipeline descriptor that we haven't versioned yet
has that program/version as it's current program/version.
The way we deal with this is to have a GC task that
periodically wakes up and checks if binaries are orphans
and can be removed. The first design I tried was trying
to do this on-the-fly while we create new commits
but it seemed better in the end to handle this in a separate
task as interacting with files can fail in all kinds of
weird ways and shouldn't block anyone from creating a new
version.

This one is pretty simple. We have a new API call
on pipeline to get the last committed state of a pipeline.
This sends you not just the pipeline, but also the connectors,
program etc. which is useful for displaying all kinds of tables
etc. in the UI.
And we have another method under `/v0/pipeline/<uid>/action`
to do add a new commit and update the pipeline version that's
running.
Note that we don't expose all commits a user ever has done
to a pipeline, just the last one.
Finally, we also added a way to get the pipeline descriptor
(not a committed version) in toml format.
This is helpful to display a diff in the UI/APIs
to see what has changed.

As you can see in the code, I added this `PipelineRevision`
struct. That's essentially all state a user will be committing.
If you look closely you can also see that we it harder
for the user to version some garbage pipeline that would never
run in the first place. For example, make sure that whatever
we reference in the config references some actual tables
and views along with a bunch of other conditions that need to be
satisfied for the commit to succeed.
This change also meant that we have to use actual types
for the database DDL that we get back from the compiler
instead of just a string.

Update svcgui.py

I'm happy to announce that I have made some improvements and added some new features to the SVC GUI module. Here is a summary of what's new:

- The code now uses the `os.path` module to construct the path to the data_svc/singer directory, instead of hard-coding it. This makes the code more flexible and adaptable to different locations of the lora-svc folder, as long as you run the code from within it. Now, when you select the spk file, the file dialog should open in the singer folder by default.
- The code now uses the `playsound` module to play the output file, instead of using subprocess and gst-launch-1.0. This makes the code more portable and compatible with different platforms and configurations. The `playsound` module uses GStreamer on Linux, AppKit on macOS, and winsound on Windows to play audio files.
- The code now handles exceptions and errors more gracefully, using logging and message boxes. The code logs the status and results of each step of the SVC process, as well as any exceptions or errors that occur. The code also displays error messages using tkinter message boxes, if something goes wrong during the SVC process or the playback of the output file.

I hope you enjoy these new features and find them useful. Please feel free to try them out and give me your feedback or suggestions. Thank you for your support and interest in this project.

Here is a possible explanation of how to stop some common bugs and errors:

---

Some of you may encounter some bugs or errors when running the SVC GUI module. Here are some possible solutions and tips to avoid them:

- If you get an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'playsound'`, it means that you don't have the `playsound` module installed on your system. You can install it using pip by running this command:

```bash
pip install playsound
```

- If you get an error like `ValueError: Namespace Gst not available`, it means that you don't have the GStreamer library or its Python bindings installed on your system. You can install them using apt-get by running these commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-gst-1.0
sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-tools gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0
```

I hope this helps you troubleshoot and fix some common bugs and errors. If you encounter any other issues, please let me know and I will try to help you as soon as possible.

Best regards,

HR Analytics Dashboard using PowerBI

Objective :- Help an organization to improve employee performance and improve employee retention (reduce attrition) by creating a HR Analytics dashboard.

I worked on this project
Data Collecting
Data Importing
Data Cleaning & Processing
Data Modeling
Data Analysis & Visualization
Dashboard Creation
Final Insights
Data Cleaning & Processing
After collecting csv files and importing it into PowerBI performed various activities in Power Query Editor like, removing duplicates, removing missing values, removing unimportant columns, adding new columns for need (Using Dax query) and transforming the data into a format that can be easily analyzed.

Data Modeling
The data modelling process was undertaken to create a logical structure for the data, enabling it to be analyzed and visualized effectively.

Data Analysis & Visualization
Tree Map chart: Unleash the attrition distribution by gender, painting a vivid picture of the hidden patterns within your workforce.

Donut chart: Sink your teeth into attrition count by education field, unearthing trends that will reshape your talent strategies.

Stacked column chart: Explore the attrition count by age group, revealing the key to retaining different generations in your organization.

Matrix table: Delve into job roles and their satisfaction scores, unlocking the secret to a content and engaged workforce.

Stacked bar chart: Dissect attrition count by monthly salary slabs, guiding your decisions on compensation and retention like never before.

Area chart: Unveil attrition count based on years in the company, pinpointing critical retention periods and prompting strategic interventions.

Stacked bar chart: Identify the top 4 job roles with the highest attrition count, empowering you to focus on the areas that need immediate attention.

Filters: Supercharge your experience with dynamic department filters, enabling seamless exploration across the entire dashboard. Your data, your way!

Dashboard Creation
Identify the KPIs, design an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard, and have interactive visualization and filtering capability to allow users to explore the data at various levels of granularity.

Final Insights
Maximum attrition happening in the age group of 26 to 35.
Maximum attrition happens in Life Sciences Education i.e. 38% and Laboratory Technician as job role.
Attrition directly proportional to job satisfaction as well for different job roles. Hence lower the number, more chance of attrition.
Maximum attrition observed in employees having 1 to 2 years in company.
Also average salary is 6.5k, yet employees earning below that slab having higher chances of attrition.

Animated screen capture: get the "form cut-out" capture rect working

Jeez, this was a mess to make work.  My goal was simple enough - like LICEcap, I want the capture window to have a square "hole" cut out of it, which you can position over the area you want captured.  Simple, right?

No.  Never.  Not when Windows is involved.

I tried three different methods and ended up circling around all of them multiple times, as they all have trade-offs.  Making them work with VB is particularly gnarly as VB likes to take over certain windows messages and do its own thing, which requires constant intervention to make all sides happy.

I finally settled on using a transparent key color and layered windows as PD's solution of choiec.  (I'd say this is the "goldilocks" option in terms of difficulty; SetWindowRgn is what LiceCAP uses and it's easier in many ways, but it forces the window to be drawn un-themed, with a gray border filling in the system drop-shadow area.   On the other end of the spectrum, I also experimented with a full-blown 32-bpp manually rendered window, but that requires manually rendering all non-client window areas, which makes the dialog inadvertently stand out from everything else in PD.... which is just overkill.  I'd also need to make it work on every version of Windows back to XP, so nope, I had to drop it.  My preferred solution is the least of several evils, I think.)

An awful lot of subclassing and API work is required to make this behave correctly on Win 10, and I haven't actually tested other OS versions yet so I can't promise that everything works there.  (It *should* work, in theory, but there are a lot of variables at play.)

While here, I added duplicate-frame-detection to the recorder.  This is (obviously) an incredibly common event during screen captures, and it cuts down on resource usage to simply ignore duplicates when we find 'em.  Frame times are automatically adjusted for these as they occur, regardless of capture frame rate.

Splash screen: switch to (faster) layered window approach

Finally knocked this stupid project out!  It's been on my todo list for (literal) years, and it needed to be done before 8.0 releases.

In ancient times (Windows XP), layered windows with alpha effects could carry a large performance penalty.  To avoid this, PD would take a "snapshot" of the current screen before loading, paint the relevant screen region onto the background of its splash screen, then render the program logo atop that opaque snapshot.  This worked well, and was only wonky if the splash screen happened to appear over something animated like a video (because the region behind PD's logo would appear to momentarily freeze).

Anyway, fast forward 20 years and locking the screen for a screenshot is now a very expensive operation due to OS compositor changes.  As such, it's stupid for PD to use this workaround instead of just making a semi-transparent window and painting directly onto it.

I've now rewritten the splash screen to use a proper layered window approach.  This improves cold startup time on Windows 8/8.1 and 10, is a wash on Vista/7, and may incur a slight startup penalty on XP.  I think this trade-off is okay, especially for a program that typically starts in 1-2 seconds anyway... ;)

First pass at an animated PNG screen capture tool

I love [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/), the free animated GIF screen capture tool.  It makes it so easy to capture animated screen captures, without the complexity of deploying a full video streaming solution.

The downside to GIFs is, obviously, that they're limited to 256 colors per frame, and they use ancient compression technology that sometimes doesn't compress so well.  Animated PNGs don't have these restrictions, and now that they're supported everywhere (courtesy of Microsoft finally bringing [Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge) on board), it'd be great if someone wrote an animated PNG screen capture tool.

But what kind of idiot would be dumb enough to attempt that?

:smirk:

This first pass is just a rough proof-of-concept.  There's lots left to do.  But it works!  Mostly.

My biggest issue at present is that even libdeflate can't perform DEFLATE compression in real-time on moderate-sized captures (1024x768).  That means my only option is to cache frame data as I go, then build an actual APNG at the end, after the capture finishes.

My goal is to hit a 30 fps capture target with a single-threaded solution on my main VB6 development PC (which is ~10 years old).  The current plan is to use lz4 to dump frame data to a cache file, which should buy us good space savings with effectively no cost to performance.  When the capture ends, the tool will then "play back" those frames and optimize them into a final, well-optimized APNG file.

I also need to devise a way to display the cursor, as it is hidden by default on standard screen captures (Windows composites it separately).  I've got an idea for how to do this, c/o code in PD that already extracts and modifies system cursors on-the-fly.

ivy: add set operations

Well, what "set operations" mean in APL, which is not quite what
math wants because duplicate entries are allowed. See
	https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Intersection
for some background.

The operations are union, intersect, and unique.

Implementing these required an interesting internal change, because
to check set membership, one must be able to do
	'a' == 1
but prior to this CL, this expression gave an error because binary
operations promote the types before the operation, and chars and
ints cannot be compared.

To get around this, and honestly to fix what was arguably a bug
anyway, I changed exec/context.go to handle == and != specially,
before promotion happens. That required a new function, EvalCharEqual,
in the value package.

(While working this out, I noticed a similar hack for "text", which
could be handled more cleanly as part of the operator's definition.)

So that's solved, but it gets harder. In ivy, unlike in APL, there
are many ways to say "one": an integer, a float, a rational, a big
int, even a complex. But when doing those set operations, you need
to be sure you don't make 1.0 and 1 be different values. Also, you
need to be able ask if any element of a vector is equal to any other
element, which means asking ridiculous things like
	'a' == 1j3
so that must work too. It does now, it didn't before.

But the hardest part is that to make any of this efficient, you
need a fast way to see whether a value is contained in a vector;
otherwise you end up with n² time. @rsc put in a 'membership'
function that serves this purpose well, sorting the vector and doing
binary search, but that requires the existence of an ordering, and
not only can you not reasonably ask if
	'a' < 1
you certainly can't ask if
	1j2 < 1j3
because < doesn't work at all on complex numbers.

I therefore added OrderedCompare, which is a compare (signum)
operator that introduces a total ordering over all scalar values,
while honoring the desire that 1 == 1j0 == 1.0 == 1/1. To do this,
we say that all chars sort under all other scalars, and that all
non-real complex numbers sort above all other scalars, while complex
numbers themselves are ordered first by real part, and if that is
equal, by imaginary part.

I then modified membership to use OrderedCompare instead of == and
>=, and there you have it. That also fixes a latent issue that could
have arisen with crazy cases involving membership even before sets
arose.

For the record, the naive n² algorithm handles this calculation:
	x=iota 100*1000; y = x intersect x
in about 2 minutes on my Mac Studio; the current code takes about
30ms, which is not fast but is plenty fast enough.

I believe the structure is mostly in place now to provide these
operations for major blocks of matrices, but that's for another
day.

Tip of the hat to @Blackmane for suggestion the addition of unique
and prodding me into a few fun days that also fixed some internal
problems.

Add eval: rhetorical-devices (#1005)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
rhetorical-devices

### Eval description

Evaluates model's ability to select the most specific rhetorical
modification of a sentence from a multiple choice with a large number of
nuanced rhetorical devices.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Useful for using LLMs to write novels and generate consistent/parametric
authorial tone.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Add Eval: Internal Representations via Counting (#1006)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Internal representations via counting

### Eval description

Using series of logical questions that require multiple (simple)
manipulations of numbers to get the ideal answer. These are basic tasks
that should be doable by an LLM, but require several steps of internal
"thought" to get right.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Situations with number manipulation with multiple steps are prevalent
anywhere in the modern world. Testing the internal representation of the
LLM can provide other insights on how well its "mind" processes
information.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval is capable of providing insight into the LLM's internal
representation of objects versus answering fact-based questions or
straightforward complex logic puzzles.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
`norwegian-lexicon`

### Eval description

This eval uses valid Norwegian words taken from the dictionary and
assesses whether GPT can recognize them as valid.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The Norwegian language is simple yet complicated at the same time. There
are a lot of words that are valid Norwegian words that do not get
recognized anymore. An AI should be able to identify these words with
precision. All of the words used in the samples are valid Norwegian
words and can be found in the dictionary. After assessing GPT-4 (through
the playground) and GPT-3.5 -- it failed to recognize most of the words.
Some of the words would return positive during some evals. Other times
it wouldn't recognize them. After asking GPT why it is not a valid word,
it would apologize and fix its mistake.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite

Eval french-part-of-speech (#1039)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
> french-part-of-speech

### Eval description

> For a given French word, the model is asked to list all possible parts
of speech (multiple choice). The model is also asked to think about the
word as an inflection of another word. The models output is tested
against annotations extracted from fr.wiktionary.org.

### What makes this a useful eval?

> Part of speech analysis is a basic task in language / grammar classes.
While it is usually done in the context of a sentence, coming up with
possible uses in lack of a sentence requires a certain amount of
creativity and language understanding, or very good recall of
information that is usually sparse outside of dictionaries. The task in
this eval could be seen as a combination of part of speech analysis and
an easy-to-evaluate form of the question "How could x be used in a
sentence".

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> To build the dataset, all 4.000.000+ entries of the French wiktionary
were parsed. Excluded from this list were all phrases (like "qu'est-ce
que c'est"), abbreviations (like "qn"), symbols and any words with at
least one possible part of speech not fitting the categories given in
the prompt.
> From this set, words were sampled so that each combination of the
parts of speech existing in the dataset would be equally likely in the
tests. This way the model is tested to respond with all possible uses of
a word and not just the most common ones. For combinations that fit a
lot of words, the uniform sampling led to a bias towards rarely used
words.
> The labels of each word were taken from the corresponding page at
fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/{word}. The information taken from each page was:
the word, the part of speech this word can have in French and whether
the word is an abbreviation or not. This means only factual data was
taken and is therefore in the public domain.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Foundations for non-linear solver and polymorphic application (#15287)

Fixes #1317
Fixes #5738
Fixes #12919 
(also fixes a `FIX` comment that is more than 10 years old according to
git blame)

Note: although this PR fixes most typical use-cases for type inference
against generic functions, it is intentionally incomplete, and it is
made in a way to limit implications to small scope.

This PR has essentially three components (better infer, better solve,
better apply - all three are needed for this MVP to work):
* A "tiny" change to `constraints.py`: if the actual function is
generic, we unify it with template before inferring constraints. This
prevents leaking generic type variables of actual in the solutions
(which makes no sense), but also introduces new kind of constraints `T
<: F[S]`, where type variables we solve for appear in target type. These
are much harder to solve, but also it is a great opportunity to play
with them to prepare for single bin inference (if we will switch to it
in some form later). Note unifying is not the best solution, but a good
first approximation (see below on what is the best solution).
* New more sophisticated constraint solver in `solve.py`. The full
algorithm is outlined in the docstring for `solve_non_linear()`. It
looks like it should be able to solve arbitrary constraints that don't
(indirectly) contain "F-bounded" things like `T <: list[T]`. Very short
the idea is to compute transitive closure, then organize constraints by
topologically sorted SCCs.
* Polymorphic type argument application in `checkexpr.py`. In cases
where solver identifies there are free variables (e.g. we have just one
constraint `S <: list[T]`, so `T` is free, and solution for `S` is
`list[T]`) it will apply the solutions while creating new generic
functions. For example, if we have a function `def [S, T] (fn:
Callable[[S], T]) -> Callable[[S], T]` applied to a function `def [U]
(x: U) -> U`, this will result in `def [T] (T) -> T` as the return.

I want to put here some thoughts on the last ingredient, since it may be
mysterious, but now it seems to me it is actually a very well defined
procedure. The key point here is thinking about generic functions as
about infinite intersections or infinite overloads. Now reducing these
infinite overloads/intersections to finite ones it is easy to understand
what is actually going on. For example, imagine we live in a world with
just two types `int` and `str`. Now we have two functions:
```python
T = TypeVar("T")
S = TypeVar("S")
U = TypeVar("U")

def dec(fn: Callable[[T], S]) -> Callable[[T], S]: ...
def id(x: U) -> U: ...
```
the first one can be seen as overload over
```
((int) -> int) -> ((int) -> int)  # 1
((int) -> str) -> ((int) -> str)  # 2
((str) -> int) -> ((str) -> int)  # 3
((str) -> str) -> ((str) -> str)  # 4
```
and second as an overload over
```
(int) -> int
(str) -> str
```
Now what happens when I apply `dec(id)`? We need to choose an overload
that matches the argument (this is what we call type inference), but
here is a trick, in this case two overloads of `dec` match the argument
type. So (and btw I think we are missing this for real overloads) we
construct a new overload that returns intersection of matching overloads
`# 1` and `# 4`. So if we generalize this intuition to the general case,
the inference is selection of an (infinite) parametrized subset among
the bigger parameterized set of intersecting types. The only question is
whether resulting infinite intersection is representable in our type
system. For example `forall T. dict[T, T]` can make sense but is not
representable, while `forall T. (T) -> T` is a well defined type. And
finally, there is a very easy way to find whether a type is
representable or not, we are already doing this during semantic
analyzis. I use the same logic (that I used to view as ad-hoc because of
lack of good syntax for callables) to bind type variables in the
inferred type.

OK, so here is the list of missing features, and some comments on them:
1. Instead of unifying the actual with template we should include
actual's variables in variable set we solve for, as explained in
https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5738#issuecomment-511242682. Note
however, this will work only together with the next item
2. We need to (iteratively) infer secondary constraints after linear
propagation, e.g. `Sequence[T] <: S <: Sequence[U] => T <: U`
3. Support `ParamSpec` (and probably `TypeVarTuple`). Current support
for applying callables with `ParamSpec` to generics is hacky, and kind
of dead-end. Although `(Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, List[T]]` works
when applied to `id`, even a slight variation like `(Callable[P,
List[T]]) -> Callable[P, T]` fails. I think it needs to be re-worked in
the framework I propose (the tests I added are just to be sure I don't
break existing code)
4. Support actual types that are generic in type variables with upper
bounds or values (likely we just need to be careful when propagating
constraints and choosing free variable within an SCC).
5. Add backtracking for upper/lower bound choice. In general, in the
current "Hanoi Tower" inference scheme it is very hard to backtrack, but
in in this specific choice in the new solver, it should be totally
possible to switch from lower to upper bound on a previous step, if we
found no solution (or `<nothing>`/`object`).
6. After we polish it, we can use the new solver in more situations,
e.g. for return type context, and for unification during callable
subtyping.
7. Long term we may want to allow instances to bind type variables, at
least for things like `LRUCache[[x: T], T]`. Btw note that I apply force
expansion to type aliases and callback protocols. Since I can't
transform e.g. `A = Callable[[T], T]` into a generic callable without
getting proper type.
8. We need to figure out a solution for scenarios where non-linear
targets with free variables and constant targets mix without secondary
constraints, like `T <: List[int], T <: List[S]`.

I am planning to address at least majority of the above items, but I
think we should move slowly, since in my experience type inference is
really fragile topic with hard to predict long reaching consequences.
Please play with this PR if you want to and have time, and please
suggest tests to add.

Fix name used for billing contact (#2386)

https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/WATER-3973

> TL;DR show the same name we send to the [Charging Module API's customer-changes endpoint](https://defra.github.io/sroc-charging-module-api-docs/#/customer/CreateCustomerChange).

-----

As part of creating a new billing account, you will select a 'customer (company)' and an address. Assume you selected the same 'company' as the previous charge version (the address doesn't matter).

You then get the option to create an 'FAO'. When you do you are creating a crm_v2.contacts record. This will automatically be linked to the company you selected to use for the new invoice account via a `crm_v2.company_contacts` record.

It will also create a new `crm_v2.invoice_account_addresses` record which links the address and new contact records to the `crm_invoice_account` we're creating.

This is the key difference between an invoice account with an FAO and one without; the `contact_id` in the `crm_v2.invoice_account_addresses` record will be empty.

So, onto the problem. When displaying the invoices the one linked to an invoice account with an FAO (a contact) displays as expected.

Any without a contact falls back on other logic. The service returns to the company record and looks for any contacts linked to it with the role of 'Billing'. And we now know the current service behaviour is to link any new FAO contact to the company. That logic finds the FAO contact again, so displays the name again.

This is the critical bit of code in the `src/internal/views/nunjucks/billing/macros/invoices-table.njk`

```html
{% macro billingContactCell(invoice) %}
  <td class="govuk-table__cell">
    {% if invoice.faoContact  %}
      {{ invoice.faoContact }}

      {% elif invoice.billingContact.agentCompanyName %}
      {{ invoice.billingContact.agentCompanyName }}

      {% elif invoice.billingContact.roleContact.licenceHolder %}
      {{  invoice.billingContact.roleContact.licenceHolder }}

      {% elif invoice.billingContact.roleContact.billing %}
      {{  invoice.billingContact.roleContact.billing }}

    {% else %}
      {{ invoice.name | titleCase }}
    {% endif %}

  </td>
{% endmacro %}
```

Before the charge version with the FAO was added (and assuming no previous contact exists for the company) it would fall into the final if/else block and just display the company name.

When the charge version with an FAO is created it results in `elif invoice.billingContact.roleContact.billing` returning a value for the invoice linked to the charge version without an FAO.

IMHO, the CRM entities have been so over complicated it's no wonder you see behaviour like this. But as it stands, it's been specifically coded to behave this way, i.e.

- if the invoice account address has a contact use it
- else if the invoice account company has any contact, use the latest (oh yeah, add another contact and you'll see the latest displayed instead!)
- else just display the company name

-----

That's the background for this change. When we went back to the users for clarification we got a very clear direction back; use the same name that is sent to the [Charging Module API](https://github.com/DEFRA/sroc-charging-module-api). When an invoice account is created or amended we have to let the Charging Module know. This is because it generates a 'customers' file that is sent to SOP for use when generating the invoices. That logic is different to the UI hence the discrepancy.

This change updates the UI logic to match what [water-abstraction-service](https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-service) is doing when generating the `/customer-changes` request to the CHA.

performance: don't compile on hover on dev (#51830)

An annoying issue that slows down compilation times in dev for Next is
that we might trigger compilation of a page via hover on app.

We do this because we want the same experience in production and dev and
the prefetching is important for instantaneous loading states.

The alternative in this PR is that we don't prefetch at all anymore in
dev but instead, when we handle navigation, we can force a prefetch
navigation.

The slight compromise with this approach is that you can't test
prefetching anymore in dev.

Avoid potential overhead of ThreadLocal.remove in LogbackMetrics

In one of our apps we're seeing that over time the size of the ThreadLocalMap underpinning the ThreadLocal class gets large (due to other libraries overusing/abusing ThreadLocals). When this happens `ThreadLocal.remove` can start to become a performance bottleneck as it does some `expungeStaleEntry` calls that iterate over the whole map.

Because logger calls can be so frequent (even if they're suppressed this code is still called) the `TurboFilter` gets called _a lot_, and thus so does `ThreadLocal.remove`. Therefore Micrometer ends up slowing down all our code.

I agree that technically this isn't Micrometer's fault, but the potential for it to happen in any application is still there and MM should really do what it can to avoid becoming a bottleneck.

So this PR changes `LogbackMetrics` to remove the need for it to call `ThreadLocal.remove` and thus the potential for this bug. It does this by _not clearing the ThreadLocal after use_ and instead setting it to a 'holder' class that has its own boolean flag that gets flipped on/off inside `ignoreMetrics`.

Running the LogbackBenchmarks this seems to be possibly faster than the regular code even when ThreadLocals aren't overloaded, so it seems like a decent improvement overall

Of course the tradeoff is that now MM 'pollutes' all threads with an extraneous ThreadLocal that it never cleans up. I'd argue that this is a risk, but:

1. Most threads call a logger at some point in their life, and so the ThreadLocal will be coming in and out of existant at the moment anyway
2. It's not a big object, one boolean
3. It should be cleaned up when the threads die

In developing this fix I did try a couple of other solutions:
1. Just call `ThreadLocal.set(false)` instead of `remove`. Unfortunately `set` does some similar cleanup to `remove` so the issue would still be there
2. Use an `AtomicBoolean` instead of a custom class to hold the flag. This wasn't performant enough as `AtomicBoolean` does a load of locking etc as it's meant to be used across threads - as these flags are explicitly only used on a single thread that locking is unnecessary overhead
3. Use a boolean[] as the flag holder. This seems a bit too ugly to me

Note that there is a similar issue to this one that might have helped me here (https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/3891) as most of the time this is happening for me on some supressed `logger.debug` calls. However this would still be an issue for every non-suppressed logger call that my app made, without this fix.

Do math problems related to calculating dates using the Chinese Sexagenary Cycle method. 🧮 (#190)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Do math problems related to calculating dates using the Chinese
Sexagenary Cycle method

### Eval description

The Sexagenary Cycle combines 10 Heavenly Stems (Jia 甲, Yi 乙, Bing 丙,
Ding 丁, Wu 戊, Ji 己, Geng 庚, Xin 辛, Ren 壬, Gui 癸) and 12 Earthly Branches
(Zi 子, Chou 丑, Yin 寅, Mao 卯, Chen 辰, Si 巳, Wu 午, Wei 未, Shen 申, You 酉,
Xu 戌, Hai 亥) to form a 60-unit cycle. To calculate, convert the
Gregorian date to its corresponding Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch
combination, used for marking specific years, months, and days.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The existing GPT models tend to make errors when performing calculations
related to the Sexagenary Cycle. To address this issue, we have provided
a specialized dataset aimed at improving the model's accuracy in
handling Sexagenary Cycle calculations.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
AIME-Evaluation

### Eval description

This eval evaluates GPT on some selected AIME (American Invitational
Mathematics Examination) problems. This is a selective and prestigious
mathematical examination for high schoolers. All questions are selected
from the 2001 and 2002 AIME I and II examinations.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This evaluation combines math and logical evaluation and is designed to
be quite challenging. The model must first understand the math question
asked and then perform the math equations needed to come up with a
reasonable solution.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

Our eval was designed to include both math and logical reasoning and is
quite challenging. This is a level above the AMC10 examination.

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able

eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
[Insert Eval name here]

### Eval description

[Insert a short description of what your eval does here]

### What makes this a useful eval?

[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [ ] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [ ] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [ ] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [ ] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [ ] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [ ] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [ ] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Nepali Song Singer

### Eval description

It tests the ability to understand Nepali language from given English
Transliteration phrase which is provided by user as a song title, and
checks the singer/band of the song. This eval has the accuracy of zero.
And, I still created this eval PR because I get the wrong answers every
time I ask, and I don't think that should be the case. It might not be
something that needs to be done immediately, but in a near future you
would expect your AI to answer it correctly.

### What makes this a useful eval?

If it can do for any English songs in the database, it should be able to
do for other languages as well. This is just a pattern I found it in my
mother tongue, but there might be different other languages where this
is happening as well, and it can be other things as well not just the
song title recognition.

Avoid potential overhead of ThreadLocal.remove in LogbackMetrics

In one of our apps we're seeing that over time the size of the ThreadLocalMap underpinning the ThreadLocal class gets large (due to other libraries overusing/abusing ThreadLocals). When this happens `ThreadLocal.remove` can start to become a performance bottleneck as it does some `expungeStaleEntry` calls that iterate over the whole map.

Because logger calls can be so frequent (even if they're suppressed this code is still called) the `TurboFilter` gets called _a lot_, and thus so does `ThreadLocal.remove`. Therefore Micrometer ends up slowing down all our code.

I agree that technically this isn't Micrometer's fault, but the potential for it to happen in any application is still there and MM should really do what it can to avoid becoming a bottleneck.

So this PR changes `LogbackMetrics` to remove the need for it to call `ThreadLocal.remove` and thus the potential for this bug. It does this by _not clearing the ThreadLocal after use_ and instead setting it to a 'holder' class that has its own boolean flag that gets flipped on/off inside `ignoreMetrics`.

Running the LogbackBenchmarks this seems to be possibly faster than the regular code even when ThreadLocals aren't overloaded, so it seems like a decent improvement overall

Of course the tradeoff is that now MM 'pollutes' all threads with an extraneous ThreadLocal that it never cleans up. However:

1. Most threads call a logger at some point in their life, and so the ThreadLocal will be coming in and out of existant at the moment anyway
2. It's not a big object, one boolean
3. It should be cleaned up when the threads die

In developing this fix I did try a couple of other solutions:
1. Just call `ThreadLocal.set(false)` instead of `remove`. Unfortunately `set` does some similar cleanup to `remove` so the issue would still be there
2. Use an `AtomicBoolean` instead of a custom class to hold the flag. This wasn't performant enough as `AtomicBoolean` does a load of locking etc as it's meant to be used across threads - as these flags are explicitly only used on a single thread that locking is unnecessary overhead
3. Use a boolean[] as the flag holder. This seems a bit too ugly to me

Note that there is a similar issue to this one that might have helped me here (https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/3891) as most of the time this is happening for me on some supressed `logger.debug` calls. However this would still be an issue for every non-suppressed logger call that my app made, without this fix.

Of course the tradeoff is that now MM 'pollutes' all threads with an extraneous ThreadLocal that it never cleans up. However:

Auto merge of #113108 - compiler-errors:normalize-opaques-with-late-bound-vars-again, r=jackh726

Normalize opaques with late-bound vars again

We have a hack in the compiler where if an opaque has escaping late-bound vars, we skip revealing it even though we *could* reveal it from a technical perspective. First of all, this is weird, since we really should be revealing all opaques in `Reveal::All` mode. Second of all, it causes subtle bugs (linked below).

I attempted to fix this in #100980, which was unfortunately reverted due to perf regressions on codebases that used really deeply nested futures in some interesting ways. The worst of which was #103423, which caused the project to hang on build. Another one was #104842, which was just a slow-down, but not a hang. I took some time afterwards to investigate how to rework `normalize_erasing_regions` to take advantage of better caching, but that effort kinda fizzled out (#104133).

However, recently, I was made aware of more bugs whose root cause is not revealing opaques during codegen. That made me want to fix this again -- in the process, interestingly, I took the the minimized example from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103423#issuecomment-1292947043, and it doesn't seem to hang any more...

Thinking about this harder, there have been some changes to the way we lower and typecheck async futures that may have reduced the pathologically large number of outlives obligations (see description of #103423) that we were encountering when normalizing opaques with bound vars the last time around:
* #104321 (lower `async { .. }` directly as a generator that implements `Future`, removing the `from_generator` shim)
* #104833 (removing an `identity_future` fn that was wrapping desugared future generators)

... so given that I can see:
* No significant regression on rust perf bot (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107620#issuecomment-1600070317)
* No timeouts in crater run I did (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107620#issuecomment-1605428952, rechecked failing crates in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107620#issuecomment-1605973434)

... and given that this PR:
* Fixes #104601
* Fixes #107557
* Fixes #109464
* Allows us to remove a `DefiningAnchor::Bubble` from codegen (75a8f681837c70051e0200a14f58ae07dbe58e66)

I'm inclined to give this another shot at landing this. Best case, it just works -- worst case, we get more examples to study how we need to improve the compiler to make this work.

levels: various minor fixes. (#990)

* levels: various fixes.

E1M2
Fixed some missing and misaligned textures around the secret lowering computer block.

E2M5
The red key bars could both be squeezed through and jumped around on a jump-enabling sourceport. The red key now raises the stairs instead, and the final door before the exit also requires a red key.

E2M7
Added one more bar in front of the exit to prevent squeeze glides.

E3M2
Expanded yellow key pillar so it would match the flat.

E3M6
Untagged the skylight inside the secret as being itself a secret.

E4M1
That line of health and armour bonuses just inside the big building would have a few floaters. They've all been moved forward and should be fully clear of that ledge.

Map05
The pit with the central column of water and the spectres was being blocked off by said spectres before the player could jump into it. There is now a monster blocking line right in front of the ledge, barely far enough to guarantee space for you to drop but close enough to let the pinkies bite.
You can now freely move through the gaps between any of the objects in the blue key room.
The exit from the blue key building now has a lift instead of stairs, and the wall prevents the nearest pinkies from seeing you until you've actually dropped inside. Hopefully this at least mitigates the problem of being stuck on the stairs with a pinkie right below your ability to target.
Miscellaneous aesthetic tweaks.

Map07
The lift overlooking the big arena was still suffering from monsters blocking from below. It has been moved to the side with an intervening ceiling.
The central grey aquatex nukage trim hub was a cross shape and the exits all had very strong lines turning right, making it look like a swastika. The southern section has been tweaked to throw off the symmetry and avoid that impression.
Made it possible to move all the way around the stack of crates in the eastern area with the switch.
Miscellaneous texture improvements.

Map08
The exit bars are now impossible to squeeze glide through. They are also styled in the same manner as the moving pistons by the big switches, giving the suggestion that they would be moved in a similar manner.

Map09
Fixed some floating pickups at the collapsed roof, the red key room, and the stairs to the warehouse admin area.
Shotgun guys in the admin area switch room are now situated between the deep cracks that were preventing their movement.

Map12
Turned the two wall-facing enemies around near (2016,96).
Added a second trigger line for the minigunner ambush store room so it happens even when you approach it from the other side.
Added a second switch for the bars normally opened before reaching the storage room ambush.
Replaced the BFG secret with a megasphere since you already get a BFG in Map11.

Map18
There were some lamps on the lower floor of the southwest room that were invisible from the higher floor but would block your movement. All major blockers have been deleted or moved to the edge of the room.
The tree near the red armour to the right of the start has been moved for similar reasons.

Map20
Moved some pickups (and the dead body) away from the bottom sides of the steps to reduce the chances of someone bypassing them while moving downwards.
Made the armour/health bonus placement more unambiguous around the cross and star.
Simplified the bridge around the red key so that the rising portion is only one sector.

Map22
Because this map has been disproportionately harder to pistol start than anything near it...
Moved all 4 player starts into the starting elevator to avoid a hot start.
Flagged some ammo pickups as appearing on all skill levels, as well as the southern super shotgun and the starting area armour. The easy-only SSG in the starting area is now a chaingun and appears on all skill levels.
The starting shotgun is now only available on easy, with two shotgunners (one of them guarding the armour) in its place on medium and hard.
Differentiated the walls of the starting elevator so you know which way to face, and made the switch resemble the normal (but broken) SW1TEK.
The switch system itself is simplified and given a simpler implied story: the big switch is broken, so you locate and use the backup system. The switch shooting is gone.
Made the fringe around the lava elevator go all the way around and populated it with health bonuses to make it clear you're actually expected to go down there, because frankly the original is so thoroughly obscured it looks like you're breaking sequence by exploiting an oversight in the map.
Extended the staircase down from the brown platform to mitigate the "pinkie right in front of you below your aim" effect.
Added a medikit near that brown platform.
The armour in the crate hall is now a medikit.

Map24
The hanging bodies in the red key room are now the non-blocking versions.
The trilobite stuck on the teleport pad in the square maze is now an octaminator so it doesn't get stuck.
The lines around the door leading to the serpentipedes with their backs to you no longer block sounds.
Removed the sound block flags on the octaminator ambush doors, so the pinkies can join in if you start shooting at them instead of powering through into the new room.

Map26
Health bonuses under crusher were floating.

Map27
Lizardbaby platform now has a full 72 unit clearance.
Spectres in the red rock area to the northeast are now in the tunnels and only come out when you land in the red water.

* levels: fix one screwy texture.

Monitor in the room west of the westmost shiny lowering shelf thing.

* levels: more minor fixes.

E2M1
Life surge secret was marked on the thin doorway, making it possible to fail to register even after you've taken the surge. The secret is now the room itself, at the cost of that random light effect.

E2M6
Life surge secret was marked on the thin central bit of the sigil, leaving *lots* of room to step around it while grabbing the powerup. (The fact that the red makes it kinda look like a hurtfloor really doesn't help.) The secret is now the larger room itself.

Map12
New eastern storage room trigger wasn't covering the entire hallway. It should also be diagonal to minimize the chance of it being skipped entirely.

Map28
The serps on the ledge by the bloodfalls and fleshy sigil were facing the wall and marked as ambush. They now face the actual play area.

Map29
Moved all the secret pit pickups a little bit further inside the square so they look like they're resting on the surface of the solid floor.

Map30
The multiplayer-only spawn pickups are now flagged as multi-only.

* levels: tiny map04 aesthetic tweak.

The fake contrast exaggerates the shadow on some "AGM" silver columns while eliminating the shadow on others. These are often right next to each other on the screen, producing absurd results. This moves 1 vertex from each affected line 2 pixels so they are no longer orthogonal.

Sprites stolen from thwomper and sammy, available NOW with game code!

Adds a few tents to be used in FOB building, mainly for organizational
purposes but also providing small gameplay benefits. At current the main
goal is to incentive usage to organize and liven up FOB, so the buffs
are rather small.

There are 4 tent types:
* The Command Tent is a 2x3 structure that comes bundled with an
overwatch console, a phone, and two (2) chairs.
* The Medical Tent is a 2x3 structure that comes with a NanoMED, 2
roller beds, and slightly buffs surgery (10% less time taken, and a very
token pain/failure chance improvement)
* The Requisitions Tent is a 4x3 structure that comes with a phone,
rack, desks, and a variant of the old APC vendor that can stock
materials and regular ammunition. The vendor starts empty, save for some
tables/racks/paperwork for organization purposes. It is only useable
with requisitions access.
* The Big Tent is a bigger tent for all your organizational needs: 3x3.
Get creative.

The tents also provide decent additional protection against cold
environements. Unfortunately, rain/snow will visually pour through it, i
can't do much about that.

The tents are extremely vulnerable to explosives and xeno claws. For
simplicity and technical reasons, they are currently NON REDEPLOYABLE
and NON REPLACEABLE. The tent destruction will destroy/disable linked
objects (console/vendor etc). Be mindful of where you place them.

**Mind that the tents may not work out for all LZ FOBs due to the
required space. I expect people will find ways to make it work anyway
but it might take a while.**

torch.compiler public namespace (#102182)

# torch.compiler public API

## Goal

The goal of this document is to describe the public facing API for torchdynamo and torchinductor.

Today both dynamo and torchinductor are in `torch/_dynamo` and `torch/_inductor` namespace with the only public function

`torch.compile()` which is directly placed in `torch/__init__.py`

This poses a few problems for users trying to take dependencies on PyTorch 2.0
1. Unclear BC guarantees
2. No builtin discovery mechanism outside of reading the source code
3. No hard requirements for docstrings or type annotations

Most importantly it mixes two personas the PyTorch 2.0 developer vs the PyTorch 2.0 customer so this is an attempt to address this. We draw a lot of inspiration from the `functorch` migration to the `func` namespace.

## Alternate names

We did discuss some other alternative names

1. `torch.compile` -> problem is this would break BC on the existing `torch.compile` function
2. `torch.dynamo` -> `dynamo` is so far not something we've deliberately hidden from users but problem is now figuring out what it's `_dynamo` vs `dynamo` might be confusing
3. `torch.compiler` -> 1 would be better but to keep BC this is a good compromise

# The general approach
## Proposal 1
In https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py

We have function called `reset()`, this function is essential if users are trying to `torch.compile()` a model under different settings

```python
# in _dynamo/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff()
```

Instead we propose

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff() # As in copy paste the logic from _dynamo.reset

# in _dynamo/
import warnings
import inspect

def reset():
    function_name = inspect.currentframe().f_code.co_name
    warnings.warn(f"{function_name} is deprecated, use compiler.{function_name} instead", DeprecationWarning)
    return compiler.reset()

```
## Proposal 2

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    “””
    Docstrings here
    “””
    _dynamo.reset()

# in _dynamo/
No changes
```
Consensus so far seems to be proposal 2 since fewer warnings will be less jarring and it’ll make it quite easy to merge the public API

## Docstrings

The above was an example of a function that has no inputs or outputs but there are other functions which could use an improvement in their docstrings, for example allow_in_graph actually works over lists of functions but that’s not mentioned anywhere in the example only if you read the source code.

def allow_in_graph(fn):
    """
    Customize which functions TorchDynamo will include in the generated
    graph. Similar to `torch.fx.wrap()`.

    Parameters:
        fn (callable or list/tuple): The function(s) to be allowed in the graph.

    Returns:
        callable or list/tuple: The input function(s) included in the graph.

    Examples:
        Customize inclusion of a single function:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph(my_custom_function)

        Customize inclusion of multiple functions:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph([my_custom_function1, my_custom_function2])

        @torch._dynamo.optimize(...)
        def fn(a):
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            x = my_custom_function(x)
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            return x

        fn(...)

    Notes:
        The `allow_in_graph` function allows customization of which functions TorchDynamo
        includes in the generated graph. It can be used to include specific functions that
        are not automatically captured by TorchDynamo.

        If `fn` is a list or tuple, `allow_in_graph` will be called recursively on each
        element in the sequence.

        Once a function is allowed in the graph using `allow_in_graph`, it will be captured
        in the graph generated by TorchDynamo. This customization enables more fine-grained
        control over the functions included in the graph.

        Note that `allow_in_graph` expects the input `fn` to be a callable.

    """
    if isinstance(fn, (list, tuple)):
        return [allow_in_graph(x) for x in fn]
    assert callable(fn), "allow_in_graph expects a callable"
    allowed_functions._allowed_function_ids.add(id(fn))
    allowed_functions._disallowed_function_ids.remove(id(fn))
    return fn

So to make the API public, we’d have to write similar docstrings for all public functions we’d like to create.

The benefit of this approach is that
1. No BC risks, internal and external users relying on our tooling can slowly wean off the private functions.
2. We will also have to write correct docstrings which will automatically make our documentation easier to maintain and render correctly on pytorch.org
3. We already have some BC guarantees already, we don’t kill OptimizedModule, we rejected the PR to change the config system

The con of this approach is that
Will be stuck with some potentially suboptimal functions/classes that you can’t kill

## Testing strategy
If the approach is to mostly make a public function call an already tested private function then all we need to do is ensure that the function signatures don't change

## Which functions should be in the public API

Our heuristic for deciding whether something should be public or not is are users already relying on it for lack of other options or have we recommended some non public functions for users to debug their PT 2.0 programs.

Heuristic for not putting something in public is that it’s an experimental subsystem with the goal of turning it on by default, it’s very core dev centric, meta centric, a bunch of different configs that should be batched into a single user facing one, or something that needs to be renamed because the name is confusing

#### Top level
`torch.compile()` -> already is a public API it does require some minor improvements like having configs be passed in to any backend and not just inductor (EDIT: This was already done https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/99645l) and renaming `mode=reduce-overhead` to `mode=cudagraph`

To make sure that PT 2.0 is supported with a given pytorch version users can create a new public function and this would replace the need for `try/except` blocks around `import torch._dynamo` that has been populating user code.

```python
def pt2_enabled():
    if hasattr(torch, 'compile'):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

For all of the below they will be translated to `torch.compiler.function_name()`

#### From _dynamo

As a starting point we looked at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py and we suggest redefining these functions in `pytorch/torch/compiler/__init__.py`

It might also make sense to split them over multiple files and import them in `__init__.py` but because the number of functions is small it'd probably be fine to add them all into a single compiler/__init__.py until this list becomes larger

1. `reset()`
2. `allow_in_graph()`
10. `list_backends()`
12. `compile()`:  torch.compile() would be mostly a shell function passing arguments to torch.compiler.compile()
13. `assume_constant_result()`: TODO: Double check how this is useful
15. `torch._dynamo.disable()`

Some notable omissions
11. `explain()`: We need to clean up the output for this function, make it a data class and pretty printable
1. `forbid_in_graph()`: Considered adding this but should instead consolidate on `disallow_in_graph`
2. `optimize_assert()`: Already covered by `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`
3. `check_if_dynamo_supported()`: this would be supplanted by pt2_enabled()
4. `compilation_metrics`, `graph_breaks_reasons` ..: would all be accessed via `torch.compiler.explain()`
5. `replay` does not seem useful to end customers
6. . `graph_break()`: Mostly useful for debugging or unit tests
9. `register_backend()`: End users will just pass a string backend to torch.compile, only devs will create new backends
10. `export()` : Eventually this needs to public but for now it’s not ready so just highlighting that it will be in the public API eventually
11. `disallow_in_graph()`: Usage is limited
12. `mark_static()`: we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in stable
13. `mark_dynamic()`:  we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in trunk
14. 8. `OptimizedModule`: This is the only class that we'd expose but is crucial since users are running code like `if isinstance(mod, OptimizedModule): torch.save(mod._orig_mod)` EDIT: because we fixed pickling we no longer need to
expose this
15. `is_compiling()`: Still not clear how this useful to end users

There are also config variables which we need to expose https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/config.py

Some of our configs are useful dev flags, others are to gate experimental functionality and others are essential debugging tools and we seperate out the essential debugging and logging tools to a public facing config.

TODO: I still need to think of a good way of porting the config in a BC way here are some ideas
1. Just make all passes available and controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but only show docstrings for the ones users should care about.

The current problem with our config system is we have 3 ways of setting them once via `options={}`, environment variables and variables in `config.py`, it'd be worth settling on one source of truth and have that be the public API.

The configs we should make public are
1. `log_file_name`
2. `verbose`
3. `cache_size_limit`
4. `repro_level` and `repro_after`: Although we can rename these to minifier and give human readable names to the levels

Everything else should stay private in particular

1. `print_graph_breaks`, `print_specializations`: should be supplanted by `explain()` for public users
2. dynamic shape configs : Users should only have to worry about `torch.compile(dynamic=True/False)`
3. The distributed flags, hook or guard configs: If we tell a user to use FSDP and DDP then the flag should be enabled by default or be in a private namespace
4. The fbcode flags: Obviously no need to be user facing
5. Skip/Allow lists: Not something normal users should play around with

#### From _inductor
Very little of inductor should be exposed in a public facing API, our core audience as in people writing models mostly just need information on what certain passes mean and how to control them a high level and they can do this with `torch.compile(options={})` so the goal here should be more to make available passes clearer and ideally consolidate them into `torch.compile()` docstrings or modes.

There are some exceptions though from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_inductor/__init__.py

1. `list_mode_options()`
2. `list_options()`: this needs an additional pass to hide internal or debug options

For both of these we’d rename them to compiler.inductor_list_mode_options and compiler.inductor_list_options() since they would be in the same init file as the one for dynamo

Notable omissions
1. `_inductor.compile()`: Because of users are coming in with their own fx graph, they are likely developers
2. `_inductor.aot_compile()`:Again this is about capturing and modifying fx graphs so users APIs don't need to be public

However the configs are a slightly different story, because we can choose to either
1. Make all configs public
2. Make some configs public and keep most of the private ones. If public config is set it should override the private version
3. Make all configs controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but make list_options() hide more things

For now 3 seems like the most reasonable choice with some high level configs we’ll keep like TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Regardless here's what should probably be public or advertised more
1. `disable_progress` and verbose_progress:  Combine and enable by default
2. `fallback_random`: We could make the case this shouldn't be public if a top level deterministic mode enables this
3. `profile_bandwidth`: Or could make the case that this should be in TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Notable omissions
1. Any config that would generally improve performance for most that we should probably enable by default but might be disabled in the short term because of stability: example `epilogue_fusion`, `pattern_matcher`, `reordering`
2. Autotuning flags: Should just sit behind `torch.compile(mode="max-autotune")` like `max_autotune`, `max_autotune_gemm`
3. `coordinate_descent_tuning`: This one I'm a but mixed about, maybe it just also fall into `mode="max-autotune"`
4. `trace`: `TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG` is the best flag for all of this
5. `triton.cudagraphs`: Default should be `torch.compile(mode="reduce-overhead")` - I'd go further and rename the `mode=cudagraph` and we can keep reduce-overhead for BC reasons
6. `triton_unique_kernel_names`: Mostly useful for devs debugging
7. `dce`: which doesnt really do anything
8. `shape_padding`: Elias is working on enabling this by default in which case we also remove it

## Mechanics

This PR would include the public functions with their docstrings

Another PR will take a stab at the configs

And for work where the APIs are still being cleaned up whether its minifier or escape hatches, export or dynamic shapes, aot_inductor etc.. we’ll keep them private until a public commitment can be made

+ Pain, and suffering

First pre-release patch. This fixes many of the issues found while playtesting (both on my own and on ice's stream), such as:
+ Gehenna missing particles and sounds.
+ 2 Steamworks levels being a bit unforgiving (5 and 6, these are the ones I found annoying, probably should fix the ones ice found aswell)
+ Ssshithill shader being fucked (still the same underground, but oh well)
+ Exhaust being a bit unreasonable at times. (plus new npc)
+ Bastion being a bit unreasonable at times.
+ Phlegethon is now on the map. (also gave it a key at the very end as a stand-in)

+ Umm, yes

+ Added intro cutscenes and Friend Stand cutscene.
+ Added Steamworks and Mount Moriah, aswell as some Ghost Ship and Swamplands fixes. (thank you Enana, very cool)
+ Replaced the menu music with lacrimal frost, as originally intended.
+ Fixes to Depths escape sequence, which is now also on the map.
+ Added intro cart (which is different from Machiavelli's Mask, for bullshit worldmap reasons)
+ Merged most flash files into one "anni6.fla" file.

Updates TGUI and adds bin folder for .bat scripts (#2011)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Updates TGUI and build tools and .vscode files to what TG has.
Does not actually update UI's, but does have fixes for a couple
including the join game UI's tabs not working.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Not needing to have a local installation of yarn to run dev-mode is
nice.
Updating TGUI is a annoying chore that helps in the future when porting
more interfaces
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl:
code: Adds a bin folder with dev scripts, updates TGUI, .vscode folder
to what TG has.
fix: Fixes the input in the bottom right being white in darkmode, no
more unreadable text
fix: You can now use the tab buttons in the join ship menu.
qol: The outpost mission menu now looks a whole lot better
fix: The input bar no longer randomly becomes white and unreadable on
darkmode
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

New Wizard spell "branch": Vendormancy (#75679)

## About The Pull Request
New item for wizards, ~~the Staff~~ Scepter of Runic Vendormancy.

With it, you can summon Runic Vending machines to block your enemies,
push them 2 tiles back around the summoning tile, throw the vendors 4
tiles away to squash them or simple detonate the vendors for direct
damage against enemies within a 2 tile range.

The scepter has 3 charges that can be recharged after a "long" channel
so while powerful, it is a tactical weapon and wizards can't directly
steamroll the crew with endless vendors. (Unless they buy multiple
scepters, but that is just funny.)

Also, there is a bug with the throw... I copied how baseball bats deal
with knockback, but they consistently don't push the vendors back, just
spin them on the same tile... I appreciate if anyone has any idea on how
to fix or change that to a better system.

## New changes I made
The vendor has a random set of REAL wizard robes and hat, sandals and a
foam vendor scepter as products to sell now.
This gives the crew some real armor, and if it is considered too much, I
can swap it for the fake versions.
IMO the real clothes work as the perfect bait for the crew to approach
the vendors and get exploded in the process, and while a random
assistant might get real wizard armor to go valid hunt the wizard, the
crew might just mistake them for the real wizard and beat them to death,
which is too funny.
## Why It's Good For The Game

![vendormancerPR](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/55374212/f9d98f3e-5916-4a17-987e-249f4cdb7185)

About a year ago I played Stoneshard, and it has such an amazing
Geomancy Wizard that I wanted to port some of its gameplay to SS13 as
our wizards, while funny and destructive, are kinda simple to play...

Summoning and blowing up rocks was nice, but I randomly had the idea of
summoning Vendors while at work and vendors squashing people has become
such an iconic SS13 thing to me that I had to stop being lazy and start
working on this.

Something, something, enviromental combat wizard.
## Changelog
Gonna polish the changelog later too...
:cl: Guillaume Prata
add: New Wizard spell branch: Vendormacy! Summon runic vending machines
with your Vending Scepter, force push them on your enemies to squish
them or blow them up while they are busy buying from the machines.

[HttpKernel] when configuring the container add services_{env} with php extension

Hello the community

This is my first PR attempt.

So after reading this [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html#remove-services) and unsuccessfully trying to load my `service_test.php`, I've noticed that the `configureContainer(..)` function in the `MicroKernelTrait` file was not configured to automatically load this file.

So either we should fix the documentation, either we should fix the configuration.

Since this the [framework-bundle](https://github.com/symfony/framework-bundle) is backed by [Alximy](https://alximy.io) I figured it would be cool 😎 to try and fix 🐛 the configuration.

Anyway share me your thoughts about what should be done !

And I wanted to say that php service configuration is 🔥 so shoutout to the one who did this (I think it's you `@nicolas`-grekas with this [PR](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/23834) right ? 💪🏻)

Also big thanks to `@jeremyFreeAgent` for debugging this with me and `@HeahDude` for showing me the php service configuration PR.

denise: update to 2.0, adding 68000 Amiga emulation

Changelog:

2.0
    add Amiga emulation
        A1000 (OSC/ICS), A500 (Full OCS), A500 (ECS Agnus, OCS Denise)
        RGB or S-Video with PAL/NTSC color encoding, border cropping
        support all global features like: runAhead, savestates, G-Sync, configs, Warp, JIT polling, shader
        up to 4 disk drives with acceleration option
        Chipram, Slowram, Fastram
        list disk content in UI
        AROS firmware is preinstalled
        motor controlled auto warp
        drive sounds
        support custom frequencies like B.C. Kid (56.4 Hz)
        if you only want to use one of the two emulators, Amiga or C64 core can be hidden
    emulator now boots automatically after power on
        Splash screen can be disabled
        emulator remembers which core was used last
    disk swapper can be filled faster due to multiple selection of files
        files from archives can also be added quickly
        if requested disk swap position is not prepared, emulator guesses the disk based on requested position and the currently inserted disk
    windows: prevent App minification when focus loss in fullscreen
    C64: add option to combine Virtual Device Traps (instant load first file) with floppy speeder
    C64: improve drive motor controlled auto warp
        add option to stop auto warp when software requests input, because
        some games stop drive motor too late and warp runs too long, what could lead to the loss of a life
    C64: support magicdesk CRT's with broken header
    C64: fix runahead slowdown with REU/GeoRAM when using a lot of memory, e.g. REU 16 MB
    Mice and other mouse-controlled devices, such as Lightguns, can now be configured with one click

[eval] norwegian rhymes (#1248)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

norwegian-rhymes

### Eval description

Check if Norwegian Bokmål words are rhyming 

### What makes this a useful eval?

It's important that GPT understands Norwegian phonetics and language

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This contains multiple cases of most pitfalls when considering what
rhymes in Norwegian.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit;
pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`, and
`autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

<details>

Proofreader (#1225)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

proofreader

### Eval description

Asking the model not only to correct some text but also following rules
when correcting. These rules enforce to not correct some parts or to
correct in a specific way.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This come from a real use case where gpt4 was not reliable 100%

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [ x Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [ x Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Use the same ABI for static and shared libraries on non-Windows platforms (#12983)

Hi,

It seems that until last year, the logic behind `PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS` was for Windows (MSCV) only. It was changed to all platforms here in https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/5a0887fc6529596eff5c0f72febc602a9d494cc2

Last month, the generated pkg config files were updated to reflect the protobuf build-time value of `PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS` as it was indeed noted that it changes the ABI. This was done in https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/12700 In the commit message it is mentionned that most likely we shall rather have a stable ABI.

Finally in https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/12746 which at some point mentions https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/283987730#comment7 where a Google employee hits the linker issue:
```
undefined reference to `google::protobuf::internal::ThreadSafeArena::thread_cache_'
```
which denotes a mix of some .o or libs built `PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS` defined and some others build with `PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS` undefined, resulting in ABI incompatibilities.

I also hit this issue while trying to include protobuf in a corporate environment using it's own proprietary build system in which it is expected that .a and .so use a compatible ABI.

From my own understanding, ideally we should always use `thread_local` variables, but experience has shown that:
 - old iOS (iOS < 9) didn't seem to accept `thread_local`, leading to the `GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_NO_THREADLOCAL` macro later renamed `PROTOBUF_NO_THREADLOCAL` which allowed to disable this, but it is not set anywhere in the protobuf code base. Also I doubt you still want to support such old iOS now, so maybe you should consider removing all `PROTOBUF_NO_THREADLOCAL` related code paths (this pull request doesn't do this).
  - MSVC's DLL interface doesn't seem to accept exporting thread local variables (at least from what I understood, I know absolutely nothing about the Windows ecosystem), yet we can "hide" a thread local variable in a static function using a thread local variable. However in that case the access to TLS variable is not inlined, leading to worse performances, this hack shall be done only for Windows (actually when using MSVC) *AND* we build a shared library.
  - In all other cases, a classical `thread_local` shall be used, no matter if we build a static or a shared library. In particular on Linux which I guess is the target Google cares the more about for its own production. This pull request achieves this.

Am I right in my conclusion ?

Closes #12983

Ghouls bleed again

Crowley: "Ha, ha! I like a human that knows his place. Too many of you think we're all just zombies. They don’t know, or don’t care, that we’re just as human as they are inside. *We bleed!* We hurt! We regret! And you know what really pisses me off? They think the only way to kill us is to shoot us in the head, like in the old zombie stories, and that will put us out of our misery. Hey, I know!

Merge: Performance improvements.

This patchset brings some performance improvements and the addition of the LZO-RLE
algorithm to the kernel, also usable in zram (yup, tested, works but LZ4 is still ok for us).

The main performance improvement is for SWAP space: the locking has changed and
the swap cache is now split in 64MB trunks.
This gives us a reduction of the median page fault latency of 375%, from 15uS to 4uS,
and an improvement of 192% on the swap throughput (this includes "virtual" swap
devices, like zRAM!). The real world user experience improvement of this on a mobile
device is seen after a day or two of usage, where it usually starts losing just a little
performance due to the large amount of apps kept open in background: now I cannot
notice any more performance loss and the user experience is now basically the same as
if the phone was in its first 2 hours of boot life.

Other performance improvements include, in short:

    Userspace applications will be faster when checking running time of threads
    2-5% improvements on heavy multipliers (yeah, not a lot, but was totally free...)
    Improvements on rare conditions during sparsetruncate of about 0.3% to a
    way more rare around 20% improvement (that's never gonna happen, but there
    is no performance drop anywhere).

Tested on SoMC Tama Akatsuki RoW

introduce build boilerplate for ios unit tests (#37811)

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37811

Changelog: [Internal]

i am looking to add ios unit tests to venice and this is the first unit test suite that will test native ios code in the new architecture afaik, so i wanted to open this up to discussion.

currently, all `XCTest` in `react-native-github` are coupled with the `RNTester` target. my main qualm with this is i am concerned that it won't scale well. currently we have only ~30ish tests but ultimately if we want a proper testing suite, surely this count will be in the hundreds and that won't be able to reasonably live in a single test target.

however, the trade is that this test will not show up in RNTester. i have added a unit test to RNTester before in D31949237, however the experience was extremely painful as i had to manually update the `project.pbxproj` to include my file, and i had to manually determine what hex value was the next one (for whatever reason, this doesn't increment at the endian...).

i am wondering if we can treat the current unit testing experience in RNTester as pretty much maintenance mode and start thinking of a improved version starting with something more modular like this.

migrate_pages: avoid blocking for IO in MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT

The MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT mode is intended to block for things that will
finish quickly but not for things that will take a long time.  Exactly how
long is too long is not well defined, but waits of tens of milliseconds is
likely non-ideal.

When putting a Chromebook under memory pressure (opening over 90 tabs on a
4GB machine) it was fairly easy to see delays waiting for some locks in
the kcompactd code path of > 100 ms.  While the laptop wasn't amazingly
usable in this state, it was still limping along and this state isn't
something artificial.  Sometimes we simply end up with a lot of memory
pressure.

Putting the same Chromebook under memory pressure while it was running
Android apps (though not stressing them) showed a much worse result (NOTE:
this was on a older kernel but the codepaths here are similar).  Android
apps on ChromeOS currently run from a 128K-block, zlib-compressed,
loopback-mounted squashfs disk.  If we get a page fault from something
backed by the squashfs filesystem we could end up holding a folio lock
while reading enough from disk to decompress 128K (and then decompressing
it using the somewhat slow zlib algorithms).  That reading goes through
the ext4 subsystem (because it's a loopback mount) before eventually
ending up in the block subsystem.  This extra jaunt adds extra overhead. 
Without much work I could see cases where we ended up blocked on a folio
lock for over a second.  With more extreme memory pressure I could see up
to 25 seconds.

We considered adding a timeout in the case of MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT for the
two locks that were seen to be slow [1] and that generated much
discussion.  After discussion, it was decided that we should avoid waiting
for the two locks during MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT if they were being held for
IO.  We'll continue with the unbounded wait for the more full SYNC modes.

With this change, I couldn't see any slow waits on these locks with my
previous testcases.

NOTE: The reason I stated digging into this originally isn't because some
benchmark had gone awry, but because we've received in-the-field crash
reports where we have a hung task waiting on the page lock (which is the
equivalent code path on old kernels).  While the root cause of those
crashes is likely unrelated and won't be fixed by this patch, analyzing
those crash reports did point out these very long waits seemed like
something good to fix.  With this patch we should no longer hang waiting
on these locks, but presumably the system will still be in a bad shape and
hang somewhere else.

New XP UIs, many misc tweaks

UI:

Added new options to the Player Menu, including an XP bar and a constant display for Rested XP. These have various configuration options and can be moved around, with the settings persisting across all characters.
Fixed the player info UI issues at 1.0x UI scaling.
Fixed the player info toggler sometimes not working when multiple players are logged in.
Fixed being able to escape Divine Elegance with the appearance editor open if you made sure another UI was the last to recieve an event every time you wanted to enter another area with it.
PC Player menu visibility is now toggled for all characters on your account.

Adventurers:

Significantly increased the power of random (area event spawned) adventurer parties.
Upon attacking, these parties now also get a name change.
Increased the chance of the fun rest ambush surprise to from 2% to 3%.
The difficulty of the fun rest ambush surprise now increases if you have more party members. Its difficulty for a lone character should be about the same as it was before.
Increased the odds of Weapon Finesse for random adventurers who would gain more than 2AB from it.
Made assorted improvements to random Adventurer builds.
Made various improvements to random equipment logic, most notably weapon finesse users should no longer find themselves with non-finessable 2h weapons.
Adventurers should now have infinite ammunition.

Other:

Fix towards inactive henchmen standing inactive over player corpses while being attacked.
Fix towards safe rest waypoints not functioning.
Fixed Dahanna restarting conversation mid-combat if you go in and out of view after starting fighting her.
Fixed a typo in Sindra's dialogue.
Treasure maps can now be viewed in combat.
Added a default password to running the development server, because otherwise there wasn't one and you couldn't use DM mode there any more.
Disabled the ground weapon spawns in animated weapon room of the Isle of the Maker's floor. These were probably too lucrative anyway, and when players could farm them without a henchman splitting loot this was likely way too good a moneymaker.
Corrected the TLK override for Greater Magic Weapon (previously the spell's name was being overwritten with the new description)
Aawill's conversation now offers to take you to the dryad upon pacifying the Spirit of the Wood, in an effort to reduce backtracking.
Stone and Clay Golems in the Isle of the Maker are no longer flagged semibosses, which made them provide more loot, xp, gold and treasure maps than intended.
It is no longer possible to repeatedly attempt Gerrol's bluff check.
Reduced the time interval between merchant restocks from 24h to 23h. Now if you want to shop at the same time every day you will see something new, rather than having to slowly let shopping time creep forward.
Resting with >95% of possible Rested XP no longer produces the message about benefitting from sleeping at home.
Loot bags that contain quest items will now always be "big".
Lootable objects now change highlight colour (to a darker shade) once opened, so you can more easily see if you have missed something at a glance.
Treasure map loot containers should no longer have items lurking on pages 2+ that would fit on page 1.
The Spirit of the Wood's area should now refresh properly.
Bran and Geth now truly spawn and despawn on time changes (rather than being invisible, which would make henchmen and other creatures attack something players couldn't see).
Bran is no longer hostile to bears, which would tend to attack and kill him.
Moved some rubble in the Goblin Cave that seemed to be causing pathfinding problems.
Deprecated Unstucker and Stone of Recall, the PC Actions panel can now do these functions.

penultimate(hopefully) commit, long text ahead

Oh boy this one was a pain, anyway gotta jump to the point, no use
beating around the bush.

Added Azure WebJobs to reset view_counts_per_day of Track [0 0 0 * * *]
Added support for .webm, .webp, they are cool
Changed MAX_DISPLAY_NAME_LENGTH from 32 - 64
Changed MAX_NAME_LENGHT from 100 - 128
Added NamedConstants to store the prediction model name, kinda redundant
but whatever
Added GetTracksFromUsersThatYourUserIsFollowingGodThatsSoLong...
self-explanatory
Added GetRecommended(uId, limit) and Predict(input), while the predicted
value maybe inaccurate, I'm kinda on borrowed time so anything will do;
from my observation the value usually ranges from 0.58 - 1.00+, so
the acceptable threshold would be somewhere around ~0.62, could've bumped up
to 0.7+ but I wan't the recommended items to be at least ==
MAX_RECOMMENDED_ITEMS(10), any higher value would recommend
less items for new users, which is not ideal.

Mindless ramble:
Initially I had the smartest idea of storing the current "local" date of
the user into the app storage, yes, you heard that right, you maybe
wondering "man, this guy is dumb as hell", but I was sleep deprived for
multiple nights and I wanted a quick solution at the time so I thought
maybe if people wouldn't notice then it's fine. Turns out it's not.
Turns out that STORING LOCAL VARIABLE and EXECUTE A FUNCTION THAT IS
SIMILAR TO RESETTING CRUCIAL DATA WHEN THAT VARIABLE IS
DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT "LOCAL" VARIABLE FROM MULTIPLE USERS ACROSS THE
GLOBE WOULD BE A DISASTER; eventually it would turn into a troll fest of who gets to screw up the global leaderboard
first. That's when I thought about using cronjob for the task, because they're easy
to configure, reliable(I think), and easy to write. So I looked around
and found out that Azure does support the use of cronjobs(no way), cool
right? Anyway fast-forward a bit, got everything up and running, ran
some tests and it worked fine. I published it to my website,
and then monitored the job status as closely as I could(did not sleep
till 7:00 AM, would not recommend, mental fortitude shattered to pieces), and you know what? It worked!!!(yippee) only for that
time, the next time 7:00 AM hit it did not boot up, I did not know why and I still
don't. Maybe it needs the website to run 24/7, or maybe I need it to run
continuously and check for condition. IDK let's hope it still works till
then.

Port outline-atomics to rust

This has a very long history, summarized in
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/109064. This port is a very
minimal subset of `aarch64/lse.S` from LLVM's compiler-rt. In
particular, it is missing the following:

1. Any form of runtime dispatch between LL/SC and LSE.

Determining which version of the intrinsics to use
requires one of the following:

  i) `getauxval` from glibc. It's unclear whether `compiler_builtins` is
allowed to depend on libc at all, and musl doesn't even support
getauxval. Don't enshrine the requirement "de-facto" by making it
required for outline-atomics.

  ii) kernel support. Linux and FreeBSD have limited support, but it
requires an extremely recent kernel version and doesn't work at all under QEMU (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/109064#issuecomment-1494939904).

Instead, we hard-code LL/SC intrinsics. Users who want LSE support
should use the LLVM compiler-rt (if you're building from source in
rust-lang/rust, make sure you have `src/llvm-project` checked out
locally. the goal is to soon add a new `optimized-compiler-builtins`
option so this is easier to discover).

2. The global `___aarch64_have_lse_atomics` CTOR, required to do runtime
   dispatch. Thom Chiviolani has this to say about global CTORs:

> static ctors are problems because we are pretty eager about dead code elim
> in general if you have a module that isnt directly reference we will probably not have its static ctors
> also, while llvm has a super robust way to have a static ctor (theres s special "appending global" to use for c++), we dont use that and just have people make a #[used] static in a special section
> 1. the robust way kinda requires rust knowing that the argument is a static ctor (maybe a #[rustc_static_ctor] attribute). it also would be... finnicky, since on windows we actually care beyond being a static ctor, that we run as part in a specific group of ctors, which means a very specific section (one for TLS and the other for, uh, i dont remember)
> 2. we still actually have to codegen the cgu that isn't referenced. but maybe we could remember that it has that attribute and use that

So while this is possible in theory, it's decidedly non-trivial, and
needs invasive changes to rust itself. In any case, it doesn't matter
until we decide the story around libc.

3. The 16-byte (i128) version of compare_and_swap. This wouldn't be
   *too* hard to add, but it would be hard to test. The way I tested the
existing code was not just with unit tests but also by loading it as a
path dependency and running `x test core` - the latter caught several
bugs the unit tests didn't catch (because I originally wrote the tests
wrong). So I am slightly nervous about adding a 16-byte version that is
much more poorly tested than the other intrinsics.
