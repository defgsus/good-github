Mook village and basic mook refactor (#78789)

## About The Pull Request
refactors mooks into basic mooks and re-adds them to the game

## Why It's Good For The Game
this refactors mooks into basic mobs and re adds them to the game. mooks
are now a part of lavaland. they come as a part of a random ruin which
consist of a entire village of friendly mooks. Mooks will aid players
but they will still attack ashwalkers because of some troubled history
between them.

![mookvillage](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/138636438/ad1c5d63-c168-475a-a85d-b727dff43e7b)

mooks are a very diseased specie. nanotrasen discovered a small tribe of
mooks and cut a deal with their tribal chief to aid ss13 miners in
exchange for medical supplies.

![tribalchief](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/138636438/cc0e0a11-9bf0-4322-b3ae-c7be43092ee8)

male mooks go out and mine and haul ore off back to their village. they
will deposit ores into a stand which is managed by another mook. they
will all return to their village to rest once a lavastorm comes.

![mookstand](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/138636438/c7adbf4e-6322-4347-acfc-4e8d45aff798)

players can use this stand to withdraw any ore they like

![mookui](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/138636438/a1318be8-50f7-49b2-827c-97bafdb2488a)

female mooks will stay behind in the village to guard it from
ashwalkers. they will also heal male mooks when they come back from a
long day of work. the tribal chief is a bum and chooses not to go out
and mine. he will stay behind in the village and issue commands to his
people rather than work

the village also has its own bard! he follows player visitors and plays
nice music for them while they are in the village (although he is not
very talented).

he is still a warrior at heart tho so he will be smashing his guitar
over ashwalker skull

Flesh Spiders Regenerate + QoL (#78704)

## About The Pull Request

Replaces the Healing Touch component on Changeling-spawned Flesh Spiders
with the Regenerator component, as the comment helpfully suggests.
Flesh Spiders can no longer touch themselves to heal, instead they
automatically begin regenerating their health if they go four seconds
without taking damage. It takes 6 seconds to fully regenerate, so 10
seconds to fully heal from the edge of death (less if you're not that
injured).


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/37faca55-35fe-48dc-a3ed-03f4b79860bd)

Also I changed the sprite for flesh spider eggs to a different one we
already had rather than regular spider eggs tinted red, just because I
felt like it.
Would be cool to give the spiders their own sprite some time, but that's
for another PR.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/8ec286c4-46dc-4aec-aa98-cb4e4e432690)
_Additionally_ the flavour text for flesh spiders was kind of messed up
by being shoved into the objectives box and claiming that it was a
directive from a spider queen you don't have, so I gave them their own
slightly different antag datum to compensate.
It also actually mentions how you heal yourself, which previously was
down to trial and error or codediving.

In the course of doing this I decided to just... move flesh spiders to
their own type path. It _sort of_ made sense for them to be part of the
giant spider typepath, but they keep being modified by changes targetted
at "balancing the Giant Spiders antagonist" which this mob isn't related
to and doesn't have any reason to follow. The fact that a mob has
similar stats to another one isn't automatically a reason to share a
typepath, and now that I have looked a little at this mob I'm sort of
interested in branching it further away from "it's a spider mob but
spawned a different way" in the future.

Finally, this spider egg cluster and the midwife one would prompt ghosts
with a radial menu with a single option on it... that's a bit pointless,
so we'll bypass that menu if there is only one possible outcome.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Currently Flesh Spiders heal by clicking on themselves and standing
still for two seconds, restoring 50% of their HP. This means they can
fully regenerate over 4 seconds unless you stun them, and with 90 HP
you're not _that_ likely to kill one during the channel time.
This just feels like an odd way for the creature to operate,
regenerating instead gives it a hit-and-run strategy and adds more use
to their webs (maybe we should give them meatier or bloody webs at some
point? Might be cool).
Also clicking yourself to heal is just unintuitive and I suspect several
players just didn't realise they could do it in the first place.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Flesh Spiders heal automatically over time if they go a short
time without taking damage, instead of healing large chunks by clicking
themselves and waiting two seconds.
qol: Spider egg clusters which only hatch into one kind of spider don't
ask you to select that one type from a radial menu with one option on
it.
qol: As a Flesh Spider, the game now tells you how you can heal
yourself.

Puts all traits in the globalvars file + CI Testing (#79642)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #76349

I didn't know that people needed to add any new traits to a global list
so they can be easily read in View Variables, and was pretty shocked to
find out many other people didn't know it was a thing. Let's make it a
thing by testing it using a new CI Python Linter to check this. But oh
no-


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/c093f1a8-00ce-40a6-8e1d-f344107ce7b8)

There were about 200+ missing traits. Alright, so let's do the
following:

* Move trait defines to their own dedicated folder in the `_DEFINES`
folder.
* Split up the traits mega-file into different files, for better
organization. One for the macros, one for the sources, and a few for the
"trait declarations"
* Run the linter a load of times and add everything to the globalvars
file, removing anything that's no longer used and figuring out where the
best categorization of it is. also minor code improvements. also rename
all of the ones that look weird. also fix list indentations
* Also alphabetize the lists because it's easy
* Move everything to a new `traits_by_type` list, while keeping the
admin one the way it is for the time being while we figure out a better
way to show that list to admins.
* Profit
## Why It's Good For The Game

Mapping trait injectors will now work for any type of trait. You
shouldn't add any trait via this injector though, but you're no longer
limited to coders remembering to add it to that critical list you
needed.

Lays the framework for a better view variables experience. This work is
too lengthy to presently do, but hopefully we can get this done sooner
rather than later. we will need a code-accessible way to view these
traits for such a framework to be implemented, so let's just do that.

Future steps are to break down the mega-declarations file into a folder
full of separate files by typepath, but that requires a lot of auditing.
Does need to happen one day though, there's a lot of mob traits mingled
with datum traits and auuugh we gotta do this later this PR is already
massive.

there's probably ways to game this but this catches _my_ mistakes so
good luck to everyone else (it should work for 99% of everyone)
## Changelog

Nothing applicable to players. However, to mappers, the mapping trait
injector should always be able to add any kind of trait (which is rather
good for the times when you need it).

Fixes sending stuff to "Old" Chat (#79819)

## About The Pull Request

This functionality was removed in #79479
(e1c6cfdce89c7dbcd507d0c44803f5407a042a96), and we should still be
supporting the old chat anyways because it contains a plethora of useful
BYOND information that we still can really leverage (such as the
built-in profiler and stuff like that) and it's going to be painful to
do that if you have to keep spamming `fix-chat` to see OOC/ASAY while
alternating every damn time.
## Why It's Good For The Game

It's ugly but we still need it. There's a reason why we still have it.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: "Old Chat" (AKA: The old-styled non-TGUI raw-HTMLesque chat that
you might see when it prods you with the "Failed to load fancy chat!"
issue) should now get all text messages as expected.

Further Prevention of Disposals Qdeletion (#79714)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes the consequences of #79629 - Verdict is still out on what the root
issue is

This has been an issue for the last two years and everything I go
bananas trying to get a consistent reproduction case to figure out the
root issue. After three session of picking, I think it's just a
consequence of certain thing in disposals code sleeping due to
`addtimer()` and whatnot so I'm just throwing in the towel and just
making it so we stop sending atoms to nullspace for no reason.

`target_turf` is typically always a present arg, but regardless we are
guaranteed to get a valid turf to send people to instead of the deleted
mob room. We still `stack_trace()` whenever this happens, so tracking
this issue doesn't change any more than the present status quo- we just
don't keep torturing mobs by sending them to the shadow realm.
## Why It's Good For The Game

One day we'll figure out why we keep getting `null` passed into
`forceMove()` like this but today is not that day. i know turfs
technically can't be deleted but it's just there as a safety since we
nullcheck anyways (which is the whole point of this fix). Let's just
stop screwing with players for the time being

also the code looks much better
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Safeties in the code have been added to prevent things in disposals
going into nullspace whenever they get ejected from a pipe - you will
just magically spawn at the turf that you were meant to be flung
towards.

Eoehoma Firearms (& friends) (#2315)

## About The Pull Request


![Screenshot_5451](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/58402542/08f9b0ee-15db-4091-a974-6d887cd85259)

Holy shit, this should not have taken a year to make

Adds the E-10, E-11, E-40, E-50, and E-60 to the game. Weapons
manufactured by defunct firearms company Eoehoma Firearms.

Founded in 77 FS, Eoehoma was a early pioneer of ‘hybrid’ Solarian and
Kalixcian laser weapons. The company went bankrupt due to increasingly
poor and risky decision making, and all of it's patents were bought out
by Nanotrasen. While Nanotrasen's Emitters bear a striking resemblance
to the E-50, otherwise Nanotrasen has not produced any of Eoehoma's old
weapons, instead focusing on Sharplite designed weapons.

Other changes:
- NT and Sharplite weapons have different fire sounds from each other
- Laser weapons buffed to 20 -> 25 damage
- Pulse shots don't destroy walls and are now 50 -> 40 damage
- Emitter shots now do 30 -> 60 damage
- Various grammar fixes
- Removes some non-lore compliant mentions
- Adds a manufacturer indicator to many guns
- Ports https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/60353
- Resprites various laser weaponry, notably the pulse guns.
- Deathsquad and ERT/LP hardsuits have been redone

One of the last things i remember the old leads planned was to buff
lasers to make them stand up to the various ballistics better. Also
allows Pulse Rifles to be more used in events by nerfing them to not be
comedically overpowered. Now they are just Overpowered.

More ruin content and such. I'm sure the maptainers will make good use
of this stuff.

And sprites, i fucking love sprites

## Changelog

add: Eoehoma Firearms, a new guns manufacturer!
add: ERT and "Asset Protection" Hardsuits have gotten a new look!
add: New laser fire sounds

Abandoned Domains: Adds two new psyker-oriented virtual domains (#78892)

## About The Pull Request

_Really? Bitrunning maps are so simple you could do them with your eyes
closed? Hmmmmm..._

This adds two new medium-difficulty virtual domains to the pool -- Crate
Chaos and Infected Domain.

These two domains take you to neglected corners of the virtual world.
These are unstable, bizarre locales that do not support the bitrunning
machine's visual display, and must be traversed using echolocation.
**_These domains have been designed around you being a psyker, and will
turn your bitrunner avatar into a psyker until they leave the domain._**

_**Crate Chaos:** Low cost, medium reward._

Sneak into an abandoned virtual domain, where they store all of the loot
crates. There's about 40-ish crates in this space, and one of them
(RANDOM) is the encrypted cache we're looking for. The crates must be
manually inspected, requiring you to drop your weapon for a few moments,
but that shouldn't be a problem. There's no hostiles, just a bunch of
crates... right?

This one has very few shenanigans or threats in it. It's meant to be an
introductory experience to interfacing with things as a psyker, and
getting the rhythm down for moving between visual pulses.

_**Infected Domain:** Medium cost, high reward._

Enter another abandoned virtual domain. This one was sealed off from the
digital world after the cyber-police failed to contain a virus that
zombified its inhabitants, leaving it to grow unstable and full of
holes. Fortunately, you're provided with the single best tool for arming
yourself against zombies in any video game, ever -- Your very own
Mystery Box. Get armed with (basically) whatever gun you want, and go
put those wacky psyker abilities to use against those zombies.

This one is a lot meaner. Many chasms, landmines, and zombies. Walk
slowly, stay with your fellow bitrunners, and if it's too hard, there's
no shame in going back and rolling for a better gun!

The domains themselves are VERY simple, since there's little need for
decor or particularly complex layouts. The idea is that you should be
able to see everything you need to see in a given room/area with a
single vision pulse. Here's what one of the maps looks like:


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/fe63adce-aa05-4339-9d19-28ce06a2d31f)

Err, uh, I mean... This is what the maps look like:

<details>
<summary>SPOILERS BEWARE</summary>
<br>


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/265ecdc5-50f6-4a28-8068-fab08ae1f5e8)


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/0b41da6a-e018-4434-9368-6daee1f97fe9)

(You wanna find out if there's something cool under those red lines? Go
there yourself!)

</details>

These two psyker maps come with their own psyker safehouse too -- The
Bathroom. It's gross, the medical supplies are kind of just sitting
there on the floor... It looks a little bit better when you're blind, I
guess.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/a10b70bb-5586-4d37-bbb1-a642d8524d54)
## Why It's Good For The Game

I like psykers a lot more than I'm willing to admit. Unfortunately, the
jankiness of echolocation provides such a disadvantage at times, that
any "real" conflict is usually over before the psyker is even aware
they're taking damage.

Fortunately, the controlled environments that bitrunning maps are
perfect for psykers. They give the opportunity to craft an experience
around the player being blind, rather than forcing them to play blind
through a seeing mans world.

These two domains should present players with a unique challenge that is
designed around playing as a psyker, with slightly higher-than-usual
rewards for their trouble. More importantly -- They're fun!
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
add: Two new psyker-oriented virtual domains -- Crate Chaos and Infected
Domain.
add: Map helper for cyber-police corpse spawn.
add: Map helper for swapping the encrypted crate in an area with a
random crate from that same area.

Fixes Space Dragon Attacking (#78964)

Fixes #78953

## About The Pull Request

Basically the gist is that Space Dragon's special attack code was on
`AttackingTarget()` rather than whatever the hell simple animals
controlled by clients use (I didn't bother enough to look into the chain
to remember this). This was the complete wrong proc to use, and it NEVER
got executed. Anyways, we just hook into the signal for whatever the
simple animal proc is as well as clean up all the code, make everything
pretty, and most importantly:

MAKE THE DAMN CODE WORK
## Why It's Good For The Game

Either someone did not test their code at all, or some weird esoteric
change in the attack chain changed this somehow? I'm not sure when or
why this happened but it is guaranteed to be fixed now.

The code cleanup and tinkering I did means that it's gonna be about 10%
easier to port this over to a basic mob eventually (not doing a full
refactor when this shit is this broken, the code added here is modular
enough to the point where it's plug-n-play).
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Space Dragons can now, once again, tear down walls and eat corpses.
They also have regained their special damage modifier when attacking
mechs.

Makes Telekinesis + Russian Revolver Interaction more fair (#79740)

still pull off the same party trick... once...

Basically, let's just say that when you focus on firing the gun in your
mind... you're also pointing it directly at your mind (your brain (your
skull (you instantly die))). This occurs even if the projectile doesn't
actually touch you (because that would be hellish to account for) but
you're the one who's playing russian roulette man

You still get to do some collateral damage because that's still a very
funny interaction but you only get to do it once per life. I don't know
if people will be happy to revive you after you "shoot" them. Also, the
way it's coded means that you can still leave the revolver on the table
and fire it at your foot or something, or just use it normally, as a
telekinesis user. This _only_ applies to distance-based firings.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The russian revolver is specifically coded to prevent you from damaging
other people, and this was a pretty silly way to sidestep that based on
the checks. Instead, let's make it so that you can still do this
admittedly funny interaction, but with enough reason to not do it (the
reason being that you'll always get fucking blatted).
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: After a string of unfortunate incidents, persons with
telekinesis have been strongly warned against playing Russian Roulette,
as they tend to hyperfixate on the gun a bit too much and end up firing
it directly at their head.

Reworks stop, drop, roll into a gradual, interruptable thing, that repeats until extinguished (#79694)

## About The Pull Request

Related: #78017 

Stop drop and roll is no longer instant -5 fire stacks -> stun -> wait. 

Now, when you stop drop and roll, every time you roll you will lose 1
firestack.

A roll is triggered every 0.8 seconds. Moving, getting up, or becoming
incapacitated / stunned will stop you from rolling.
_(This number puts it roughly equivalent to its current rate.)_

While rolling, your hands are blocked (you cannot use items, hold
things, etc.)
Additionally, you will roll until all firestacks are cleared. 

## Why It's Good For The Game

Getting stunned for 6 seconds because you decide to stop and roll is a
little silly. Reasonably you could stop rolling and get back up should
the need arise, such as "oh god there's more fire I gotta relocate".

By changing it to a gradual thing, it makes it a bit more reasonable and
fair.
- New players who immediately slam "STOP DROP ROLL" because the alert on
their screen tells them to are no longer helpless for 6 whole seconds
- People who hit the resist key, intending to interact with something
else (such as a bola) are no longer stuck rolling when they did not want
to

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
balance: Stop, drop, and roll no longer instantly clears 5 fire stacks
off of you - Instead, it will clear 1 fire stack off of you every time
you roll, with a roll every 0.8 seconds.
balance: Stop, drop, and roll no longer stuns you for 6 seconds.
Instead, it will knock you to the floor while you are rolling. Moving
around or getting up will cancel the roll, and you cannot use items
while rolling around.
balance: Stop, drop, and roll will now repeat until the fire is put out
or you get up.

Fixes Relay Attackers Misfire (#79731)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #76079

Basically we were both not getting all of the args that we recieve from
`COMSIG_ITEM_AFTERATTACK` which included the very important
`proximity_flag` which tells us if the person was in range to actually
hurt us or not. This means that clicking a mob with this element with a
stack of metal from across the room would cause them to aggro, which
makes no sense whatsoever. Let's actually use that proximity check.

We listen for projectiles hitting us separately, don't worry.
## Why It's Good For The Game

It just makes no damn sense, fixes some weird ass behavior. 
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Bar Bots (and several other mobs) will no longer aggro on you if
you click on them with a "forceful" item from halfway across the room.

Stops rebar crossbow crashing dreamseeker when fired at point blank. (NO GBP) (#79803)

## About The Pull Request

Simply put, due to how "caseless" is an element added to the ammo when
it hits something, but ammo is qdeleted upon hitting someone. If shot
point blank without combat mode (for some reason) it tries to add
caseless to an ammo that no longer exists. For some reason, the result
of this is to just fucking crash DS instead of aborting the adding of
the element. The ammo isnt reusable anymore, but I'll take that over
crashing.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Removes a game-breaking bug. I hate gun ammo code so much. 

## Changelog



:cl:
fix: Stopped a DS crash when shooting a rebar crossbow in specific
circumstances.

Remove Darkdustry from the Global Server List (#9289)

The time has come. It's been more than two years since we started Mindurka, which was later renamed to Darkdustry. It was an amazing time and an amazing experience to maintain the server, to create plugins and gamemodes, to discuss mindustry with all of you. But It's enough. The server is getting constantly DDoSed, the host dies all the time and I have no motivation to develop anything related to Mindustry. 
Goodbye. And I hope, we'll meet again.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Improves the RPG loot wizard event. (#77218)

As the title says. Adds a bunch more stat changes to various different
items and a somewhat simple way of modifying them whilst minimizing
side-effects as much as possible.
Added a new negative curse of polymorph suffix that can randomly
polymorph you once you pick up the item.
Curse of hunger items won't start on items that are not on a turf.
Curse of polymorph will only activate when equipped.

Bodyparts, two-handed melees, bags, guns and grenades, to name a few,
have a bunch of type-specific stat changes depending on their quality.

Some items won't gain fantasy suffixes during the RPG loot event, like
stacks, chairs and paper, to make gamifying the stats a bit harder.
I'm sure there'll still be other ways to game the event, but it's not
that big of a deal since these are the easiest ways to game it.
High level items also have a cool unusual effect aura

Makes the RPG item event cooler. Right now, it's a bit lame since
everything only gains force value and wound bonus on attack. This makes
the statistic increases more type-based and make it interesting to use

It's okay for some items to be powerful since this is a wizard event and
a very impactful one too. By making the curse of hunger items not spawn
on people, it'll also make it a less painful event too.

:cl:
add: Expanded the RPG loot wizard event by giving various different
items their own statistic boost.

Refactors vendor tipping and adds 2 new malf modules: Remote vendor tipping, and the ability to roll around and crush anything in your path. (#76635)

Title.

Vendor tipping code is now on /atom/movable, and any movable can fall
over like a vendor does. Things like crits have been moved to
type-specific availability tables, their effects are now held in their
own proc, are now random per crushed item, have probability weights,
etc.

In the process of making this PR I also had to fix another issue, where
a bunch of take_damage() overrides had incorrect args, so that explains
the take_damage changes I made.

Tipping now also attacks any atoms on the target, given they use
integrity.

Adds 2 new malf modules.

1. REMOTE VENDOR TIPPING: A mid-cost and mid-supply module allows malf
AIs to remotely tip a vendor in any of the 8 directions. After 0.5
seconds of delay and a visual indicator (along with other warnings), the
vendor falls over.
1.1. In the process of making this I had to expand a arrow sprite to
have orthogonal directions, which is why you may see the testing dmi
being changed.
2. CORE ROLLING: A mid-cost but low-supply ability that allows the AI to
roll around and crush anything it falls on, including mobs. This has a
5% chance to have a critical hit so it isnt THAT terrible - plus it's
guaranteed to never stunlock. It's real utility lies in the fact the AI
now has limited movement without borgs. Also, the psychological factor.

As a bonus, vendor tipping now uses animate and transforms instead of
replacing matrices.

1. Generifying vendor tipping code is just good, period. It's a very
wacky and silly little piece of code that really doesn't need to be
isolated to vendors exclusively. ANY big and heavy object can fall over
and do a ton of damage.
1.1. Also, adding weights to critical hits is really good, because it
lets things like the headgib finally be a lot less terrifying, as
they're a lot less likely to happen.

2. Remote vendor tipping is a bit of a goofy ability that isn't really
THAT practical but has a chance of catching someone unaware and doing
some serious damage to that person alone.
2.1. Atop of this, vendor tipping isn't that loud of an action as say,
blowing things up, or doing a plasma flood. Even overrides aren't this
silent or a non-giveaway. A vendor falling on someone, though, is a
mundane thing that happens a lot. This is a decent way to assassinate
people before going loud (or at least, damage people) that isn't offered
yet.

4.
3.1. For real though, AIs rolling around is just fucking hilarious. The
ability to move isn't offered right now (which isn't that much of a bad
things), but with sufficiently limited charges (or limits to how many
times you can buy the ability), this can be a funny little t hing that
lets the AI potentially hide somewhere on the sat (or just relatively
close to the sat, such as engineering [it can't go through the
teleporter with this but it can go through transit tubes]) without the
need for borgs.
3.2. Also, it lets the AI sacrifically execute people by blowing up
their brains.

[TEST-MERGE FIRST] Wound refactor number two: Full synthetic support (#78124)

Heavily refactors wounds AGAIN.

The primary thing this PR does is completely change how wounds are
generated and added - while the normal "hit a guy til they bleed" stuff
works about the same, asking for a specific type of wound, say, like how
vending machines try to apply a compound fracture sometimes, isnt going
to work if we ever get any non-organic wounds, which the previous
refactor allowed.

With this PR, however...
* You can now ask for a specific type of wound via
get_corresponding_wound_type(), which takes wound types, a limb, wound
series, etc. and will try to give you a wound fitting those
specifications - but also, a wound that can be applied to a limb.
* This will allow for a vending machine to apply a compound fracture to
a human, but a collapsed superstructure (assuming my synth wounds go in)
to a robot

There are now new "series types" and "wound specific types" that allow
us to designate what series are "mainline" and randomly generatable, and
what are "alternate types" and must be generated manually - you can see
the documentation in wounds.dm.

The behavior of limping and interaction delays has been abstracted to
datum/wound from bone wounds to allow just, general ease of development

Pregen data now allows for series-specific wound penalties. Example: You
could set a burn wound's series wound penalty to 40, which would make
wound progression in the burn category easier - but it would not make it
any easier to get a slashing wound. As it stands wound penalties are for
wounds globally

Scar files are now picked in a "priority" list, where the wound checks
to see if the limb has a biostate before moving down in said list.
Example: Wounds will check for flesh first, if it finds it - it will use
the flesh scar list. Failing that, they then check bone - if it uses
that, it will use the bone scar list. This allows for significantly more
modular scars that dont even need much proc editing when a new wound
type is added

Misc changes: most initial() usage has been replaced by singleton
datums, wound_type is now wound_types and thus wounds can accept
multiple wound types, wounds can now accept multiple tool behaviors for
treatment, wounds now have a picking weight so we can make certain
wounds rarer flatly,

This PR also allows for wounds to override lower severity wounds on
generation, allowing eswords to jump to avulsions - but in spirit of
refactoring, this has been disabled by default (see pregen data's
competition_mode var).

Code quality is good!

Also, all the changes above allow wounds to be a MUCH more modular
system, which is one of its biggest problems right now - everything is
kinda hardcoded and static, making creative work within wounds harder to
do.

:cl:
refactor: Refactored wounds yet again
fix: Wounds are now picked from the most severe down again, meaning
eswords can jump to avulsions
fix: Scar descs are now properly applied
/:cl:

[MIRROR] Basic Constructs: Artificer [MDB IGNORE] (#24456)

* Basic Constructs: Artificer (#79015)

## About The Pull Request

Really getting into the meat of the constructs now. Artificers have
become basic mobs.

On the whole, this was a pretty rote conversion, with no significant
gameplay changes other than the switch to using healing hands rather
than a unique heal ability. The player experience as an artificer is
more or less identical.

The _interesting_ part comes with the AI for the seldom-used "hostile"
variant. Hostile artificers, being squishy and laughably weak, are now a
dedicated "medic" role for constructs. They will perform triage, always
seeking the most wounded construct (or shade!) to give healing to. They
will not attack at all, but they _will_ flee with great speed if
attacked and not busy healing. If they are healing another construct,
they will remain even if they are beaten to death.

I've added some more AI functionality that may come in handy in the
future, and done some refactoring to keep things from getting out of
hand:
- A planning subtree for finding targets that will always select the
most heavily wounded living target that the mob can see (or rather, the
one with the least health). Useful again for medical triage, or for
making a particularly cruel mob that always attacks whoever is easiest
to kill. I plan to use this for NPC wraith constructs when I convert
them.
- Targeting datums can now check a blackboard key to see if they should
only target wounded mobs. This is particularly useful for "medic" type
mobs such as this one.
- I've refactored the "minimum stat" behavior of targeting datums to be
stored in a blackboard key. This removes the need to have unique
subtypes for each different minimum stat we might want. Which... for the
most part, weren't even used, leading to proliferation of several
completely identical targeting datums in a bunch of different files.
Hopefully this change will make things cleaner.

In addition, this PR fixes a pair of bugs from #78807 that I didn't
catch:
- Healing constructs can now actually heal shades. Turns out I forgot to
add the correct biotype.
- Healing hands, when set to print the target's remaining health, no
longer does so as a visible message.

The one thing I didn't do that I kind of wanted to is make NPC
artificers heal themselves when wounded and not busy doing something
else, but it ended up being kind of annoying to make a mob willingly
target itself. NPC artificers never had this behavior before, so I
consider it okay, but maybe I'll circle back to it later.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Another basic conversion, another 5 items off the checklist. Very little
should change in-game, though I think the new NPC AI could make for
interesting challenges in ruins or bitrunning or something.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Artificer constructs have been converted to the basic mob
framework. This should change very little about them, but please report
any bugs. NPC artificers are now smarter, and will focus on healing
nearby wounded constructs - if you see them, take them out first!

Adds Paddy, the Security Mech (#79376)

## About The Pull Request
- Adds a new combat mech, Paddy. Paddy is a modified Ripley MK-I,
intended for use by the station's security force. Like the MK-I, the
Paddy features an open-air cockpit design (and thus does not protect
from ranged weapons), but maintains the speed of the base unit.
Constructing a Paddy is similar to constructing a MK-II, though the kit
requires combat-mech level research. Sprites by
[DrDiasyl](https://github.com/DrDiasyl)
-- The paddy has an internal cargo bay capable of holding up to four
individuals (loaded with a hydraulic claw). If the pilot exits the
Paddy, any loaded individuals are likewise ejected. Individuals can
attempt to resist their way out of the mech, but it requires the mech to
be stationary for 45 seconds. If they do this, all individuals in the
holding cell are ejected.

- Adds a new mech equipment piece, the hydraulic claw. Similar to a
clamp, this Paddy-exclusive item can load mobs into the Paddy's cargo
bay. Humanoid mobs are handcuffed upon loading. The hydraulic claw is
unlocked on the same tech node as the Paddy.

- Adds a round-start Paddy, carrying one peacekeeper disabler and one
hydraulic claw, to each security area on all maps. Round-start Paddys
are also pre-locked with security access. Security now has access to a
mech charger, and a small bay for it all. Map edits were done by
[Maurukas](https://github.com/Maurukas).

- Also did some minor cleanup of various mech-related code. Ripley mech
cargo is no longer stored in the mech, but within the "ejector" object.
This doesn't have any player-facing changes, but it is easier to
organize behind the scenes. additionally, if Ripleys are destroyed now,
they drop their stored objects rather than deleting them.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Playing lone security is probably one of the least fun aspects of the
game. Arresting any assistant is inevitably setting yourself up against
the tide as a whole; You try to stun any one person and they crawl out
of the woodworks to get in your way, drag off the arrestee, and probably
try to steal your gear.

The Paddy is set up to be functional against low-threat targets, but not
particularly good against anything with purpose. The round-start Paddy
carries the disabler equipment, as well as the law claw, to detain
individuals in a *somewhat* safe manner. Being that you're inside an
exosuit, you're immune to shovespam that plagues the halls, and you
don't risk dropping important gear quite as easily.

However, The open canopy gives you no protection at all from ranged
attacks, nor from atmos hazards. Being that you're in an exosuit, you
cannot use other items or equipment. The AI will have trouble finding
you to open a door, due to your name not jumping their camera to your
location.
## Changelog
:cl: Zxaber, DrDiasyl, Maurukas
add: A new security-focused combat mech, the Paddy, has been added,
intended to be particularly helpful for lone sec officers. You will find
one in the Security main office, and a replacement can be built with
late-game mech research.
fix: Ripley MK-I and MK-II mechs no longer qdel their stored items when
destroyed.

Extract storage manager related code from sled-agent (#4332)

This is a large PR. The changes are in many ways *just* moving code
around,
and at a cursory glance may appear to be a giant waste of time. To
justify
these changes and my rationale I will first present the goals I believe
we
should strive to meet in general sled-agent development. I'll then go
into
how I believe these goals can be realized via code patterns. I'll then
discuss
the concrete changes in this PR and how they implement the discussed
patterns.
Lastly, I'll list a few open questions about the implementation in the
PR.

I want to emphasize that a lot of what I talk about below is already
done in
sled-agent, at least part way. We can pick the best patterns already in
use and
standardize on them to build a more coherent and yet decoupled
architecture for
easier testing and understanding.

# Goals

This PR is an attempt to start making sled-agent easier to maintain. In
order to
make things easier to maintain, I believe we should attempt to realize a
few key
goals:

1. Initial startup and control code should read linearly. You shouldn't
have to
jump around to follow the gist of what's going on.
2. Tasks, like functions, should live at a certain abstraction level. It
must be clear
 what state the task is managing and how it gets mutated.
3. A developer must be able to come into the codebase and know where a
given
functionality should live and be able to clearly follow existing
patterns such
that their new code doesn't break or cross abstractions that make
following the
code harder in the future.
4. Tests for individual abstractions and task driven code should be easy
to
write. You shouldn't need to spin up the whole sled-agent in order to
test an
algorithm or behavior.
 5. Hardware should be abstracted out, and much of the code shouldn't 
 deal with hardware directly.

# Patterns

## Task/Handle

In my opinion, the most important pattern to follow for async rust
software
is what I call the "task/handle" pattern. This pattern helps code
maintenance
by explicitly managing state and making task driven code easier to test.
All
tasks that provide services to other tasks should follow this pattern.
In this
pattern, all state is contained in a type owned by the task and
inaccessible
directly to other tasks. The task has a corresponding handle which must
be
`Send` and `Clone`, and can be used to make requests of the task. The
handle
interacts with the task solely via message passing. Mutexes are never
used.

A few things fall directly out of this pattern:

* Code that manipulates state inside and outside the task can be
synchronous
* We don't have to worry about mutex behavior with regards to
cancellation,
   await points, etc...
 * Testing becomes easier:
   * We can test a bunch of the code without spawning a task in many
cases. We just [directly construct the state object and call
functions](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/pull/4332/files#diff-08315639e20a9323f2740455a7813d83ca43b05dca197ebbda66c13f750d446bR634-R656),
     whether sync or async.
   * When testing sequential operations that are fire and forget,
we [know when they have been processed by the task
loop](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/pull/4332/files#diff-08315639e20a9323f2740455a7813d83ca43b05dca197ebbda66c13f750d446bR702-R709),
     because our next request will only run after those operations. 
This is a direct result of the fifo channel between handle and task.
This is not possible with state shared outside the task via a mutex.
     We must poll that mutex protected state until it either changes to
     the value we expect or we get a timeout. If we expect no change, we
     must use a side-channel.
   * We can write complex state handling algorithms, such as those in 
      maghemite or bootstore, in a deterministic, synchronous style that
allows property based testing and model checking in as straightforward
     a manner as possible.
* We can completely [fake the
task](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/pull/4332/files#diff-08315639e20a9323f2740455a7813d83ca43b05dca197ebbda66c13f750d446bR163-R223)
without changing any of the calling code except the constructor. The
real
handle can instead send messages to a fake task. Importantly, this
strategy
can also be used to abstract out hardware for unit tests and simulation.

Beyond all that though, the understanding of how state is mutated and
accessed
is clear. State is only mutated inside the task, and can only be
retrieved from
code that has a copy of the handle. There is no need for separate
`_locked`
methods, and no need to worry about order of locking for different bits
of task
state. This can make the task code itself much shorter and easier to
read as
demonstrated by the new `StorageManager` code in `sled_storage`. We can
also
maintain internal stats for the task, and all of this can be retrieved
from the
handle for reporting in `omdb`.

There is one common question/problem with this pattern. How do you
choose a
bounded channel size for handle to task messages?

This can be tricky, but in general, you want the channel to *act*
unbounded,
such that sends never fail. This makes the channels reliable, such that
we never
drop messages inside the process, and the caller doesn't have to choose
what to
do when overloaded. This simplifies things drastically for developers.
However,
you also don't want to make the channel actually unbounded, because that
can
lead to run-away memory growth and pathological behaviors, such that
requests
get slower over time until the system crashes.

After discussions with @jgallagher and reflections from @sunshowers and
@davepacheco on RFD 400, the solution is to choose a large enough bound
such that we should never hit it in practice unless we are truly
overloaded.
If we hit the bound it means that beyond that requests will start to
build
up and we will eventually topple over. So when we hit this bound, we
just
[go ahead and
panic](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/pull/4332/files#diff-08315639e20a9323f2740455a7813d83ca43b05dca197ebbda66c13f750d446bR75-R77).

Picking a channel bound is hard to do empirically, but practically, if
requests are
mostly mutating task local state, a bound of 1024 or even 8192 should be
plenty.
Tasks that must perform longer running ops can spawn helper tasks as
necessary
or include their own handles for replies rather than synchronously
waiting. Memory
for the queue can be kept small with boxing of large messages.

It should also be noted that mutexes also have queues that can build up
and
cause pathological slowness. The difference is that these queues are
implicit
and hard to track.

## Isolate subsystems via the message driven decoupling

We have a bunch of managers (`HardwareManager`, `StorageManager`,
`ServiceManager`, `InstanceManager`) that interact with each other to
provide sled-agent services. However, much of that interaction is ad-
hoc with state shared between tasks via an `Inner` struct protected
by a mutex. It's hard to isolate each of these managers and test
them independently. By ensuring their API is well defined via a
`Handle`,
we can fake out different managers as needed for independent testing.
However, we can go even farther, without the need for dependency
injection
by having different managers announce their updates via [broadcast or
watch

channels](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/pull/4332/files#diff-08315639e20a9323f2740455a7813d83ca43b05dca197ebbda66c13f750d446bR129-R133).

With this strategy, we can drive tests for a task by using the handle to
both
trigger operations, and then wait for the outflow of messages that
should occur
rather than mocking out the handle API of another task directly and
checking
the interaction via the fake. This is especially useful for lower level
services
that others depend upon such as `StorageManager`, and we should do this
when we
can, rather than having tasks talk directly to each other. This strategy
leads
directly to the last pattern I really want to mention, the `monitor`
pattern.

## High level interaction via monitors

Remember that a primary goal of these patterns is to make the sled-agent
easier
to read and discover what is happening at any given point in time. This
has to
happen with the inherent concurrency of all the separate behaviors
occurring
in the sled-agent such as monitoring for hardware and faults, or
handling user
requests from Nexus. If our low level managers announce updates via
channels
we can have high level `Monitors` that wait for those updates and then
dispatch
them to other subsystems or across clients to other sleds or services.
This
helps further decouple services for easier testing, and also allows us
to
understand all the asynchrony in the system in fewer spots. We can put
RAS code
in these monitors and use them as central points to maintain stats and
track the
overall load on the system.

# The punchline

How do the patterns above satisfy the goals? By decoupling tasks and
interacting
solely via message passing we make testing easier(goal 4). By separating
out
managers/ services into separate tasks and maintaining state locally we
satisfy
goals 2 and 5. By making the tasks clear in their responsibilities, and
their
APIs evident via their handles, we help satisfy goal 3. Goal 3 is also
satisfied
to a degree by the elimination of sharing state and the decoupling via
monitors.
Lastly, by combining all the patterns, we can spawn all our top level
tasks and
monitors in one place after initializing any global state. This allows
the code
to flow linearly.

Importantly, it's also easy to violate goal 3 by dropping some mutexes
into the
middle of a task and oversharing handles between subsystems. I believe
we can
prevent this, and also make testing and APIs clearer, by separating
subsystems
into their own rust packages and then adding monitors for them in the
sled-agent.
I took a first cut at this with the `StorageManager`, as that was the
subsystem I was
most familiar with.

# Concrete Code changes

Keeping in line with my stated goals and patterns, I abstracted the
storage
manager code into its own package called `sled-storage`. The
`StorageManager`
uses the `task/handle` pattern, and there is a monitor for it in
sled-agent
that takes notifications and updates nexus and the zone bundler. There
are also a
bunch of unit tests where none existed before. The bulk of the rest of
the code
changes fell out of this. In particular, now that we have a separate
`sled-storage`
package, all high level disk management code lives there. Construction
and
formatting of partitions still happens in `sled-hardware`, but anything
above the
zpool level occurs in `sled-storage`. This allows testing of real
storage code on
any illumos based system using file backed zpools. Importantly, the
key-management
code now lives at this abstraction level, rather than in
`sled-hardware`, which
makes more sense since encryption only operates on datasets in ZFS.

I'd like to do similar things to the other managers, and think that's a
good way
to continue cleaning up sled-agent.

The other large change in this code base is simplifying the startup of
the bootstrap agent such that all tasks that run for the lifetime of
the sled-agent process are spawned in `long_running_tasks`. There is a
struct called `LongRunningTaskHandles` that allows interaction with all
the
"managers" spawned here. This change also has the side effect of
removing the
`wait_while_handling_hardware_updates` concurrent future code, since we
have
a hardware monitor now running at the beginning of time and can never
miss
updates. This also has the effect of negating the need to start a
separate
hardware manager when the sled-agent starts up. Because we now know
which
tasks are long running, we don't have to save their tokio `JoinHandle`s
to display
ownership and thus gain clonability.

# Open Questions

* I'm not really a fan of the name `long_running_task_handles`. Is there
a better
name for these?
* Instead of calling `spawn_all_longrunning_tasks` should we just call
the
individual spawn functions directly in `bootstrap/pre_server`? Doing it
this
way would allow the `ServiceManager` to also live in the long running
handles
and remove some ordering issues. For instance, we wait for the bootdisk
inside
`spawn_all_longrunning_tasks` and we also upsert synthetic disks.
Neither
of these is really part of spawning tasks.

Refactors the `notransform` variable into a trait. (#78146)

Hey there,

There were more than a few times (like in cinematic code) where we might
need to accurately know the source of what's adding this trait (or have
multiple sources for the whole 'we don't want this mob to do shit while
we transform this mob'), so in order to rectify this potential issue,
let's refactor it into a trait.

Some code already declared that there might be issues with this being a
boolean var (with no way of knowing _why_ we don't want this mob to not
transform (or not do anything idk). Let's remove those comments and any
future doubt in those instances with the trait macros. Also, stuff like
`TRAIT_IMMOBILIZED` which does a similar thing in many contexts was
already a trait that was regularly added in conjunction with flipping
the variable, so we're able to flatten all that stuff into
`add_traits()` and `remove_traits()` now. nice

I also cleaned up quite a bit of code as I saw it, let me know if it
should be split out but I guarantee that if I didn't do it- no one will
for the next two years.

:cl:
refactor: If you transform into another mob and notice bugs with
interacting with the game world, please create a bug report as this
framework was recently refactored.
/:cl:

Probably fucked up somewhere, lmk

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

lib/list_sort: optimize number of calls to comparison function

CONFIG_RETPOLINE has severely degraded indirect function call
performance, so it's worth putting some effort into reducing the number
of times cmp() is called.

This patch avoids badly unbalanced merges on unlucky input sizes.  It
slightly increases the code size, but saves an average of 0.2*n calls to
cmp().

x86-64 code size 739 -> 803 bytes (+64)

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of low-hanging fruit in a merge sort;
it already performs only n*log2(n) - K*n + O(1) compares.  The leading
coefficient is already at the theoretical limit (log2(n!) corresponds to
K=1.4427), so we're fighting over the linear term, and the best
mergesort can do is K=1.2645, achieved when n is a power of 2.

The differences between mergesort variants appear when n is *not* a
power of 2; K is a function of the fractional part of log2(n).  Top-down
mergesort does best of all, achieving a minimum K=1.2408, and an average
(over all sizes) K=1.248.  However, that requires knowing the number of
entries to be sorted ahead of time, and making a full pass over the
input to count it conflicts with a second performance goal, which is
cache blocking.

Obviously, we have to read the entire list into L1 cache at some point,
and performance is best if it fits.  But if it doesn't fit, each full
pass over the input causes a cache miss per element, which is
undesirable.

While textbooks explain bottom-up mergesort as a succession of merging
passes, practical implementations do merging in depth-first order: as
soon as two lists of the same size are available, they are merged.  This
allows as many merge passes as possible to fit into L1; only the final
few merges force cache misses.

This cache-friendly depth-first merge order depends on us merging the
beginning of the input as much as possible before we've even seen the
end of the input (and thus know its size).

The simple eager merge pattern causes bad performance when n is just
over a power of 2.  If n=1028, the final merge is between 1024- and
4-element lists, which is wasteful of comparisons.  (This is actually
worse on average than n=1025, because a 1204:1 merge will, on average,
end after 512 compares, while 1024:4 will walk 4/5 of the list.)

Because of this, bottom-up mergesort achieves K < 0.5 for such sizes,
and has an average (over all sizes) K of around 1.  (My experiments show
K=1.01, while theory predicts K=0.965.)

There are "worst-case optimal" variants of bottom-up mergesort which
avoid this bad performance, but the algorithms given in the literature,
such as queue-mergesort and boustrodephonic mergesort, depend on the
breadth-first multi-pass structure that we are trying to avoid.

This implementation is as eager as possible while ensuring that all
merge passes are at worst 1:2 unbalanced.  This achieves the same
average K=1.207 as queue-mergesort, which is 0.2*n better then
bottom-up, and only 0.04*n behind top-down mergesort.

Specifically, defers merging two lists of size 2^k until it is known
that there are 2^k additional inputs following.  This ensures that the
final uneven merges triggered by reaching the end of the input will be
at worst 2:1.  This will avoid cache misses as long as 3*2^k elements
fit into the cache.

(I confess to being more than a little bit proud of how clean this code
turned out.  It took a lot of thinking, but the resultant inner loop is
very simple and efficient.)

cassino changes!!! (#238)

* cassino changes!!!

nerfed dmg gain from dollars by half
increased normal dmg on casino somewhat

rolls now cost 20 instead of 7
new rolls because old ones were shit
pity system

also buffed chaos by a bit lol

* fix

fix stupid pity system

* everything should be a-ok

for some reason blood ammo timer differed from the cooldown so I upped it by 10 seconds, other than that ricochet applies to only 4 enemies now and big one deals slightly more damage.

aside from that everything should be a-ok (terrible foreshadowing)

aider: Implemented marker animation for the subject site and added text labels above comps placemarks.

# Aider chat conversation:

USER: please continue to revise the map generation logic. I'd like you to first suggest a plan before implementing, but please come up with an attainable list of improvements that would benefit my map that you could implement with low to zero chance of failure.

ASSISTANT: To improve the map generation logic and enhance the user experience, here's a plan with a list of attainable improvements:

1. **Smooth Transition for Map Loading**: Implement a smoother transition when the map loads. Instead of abruptly showing the map, we can fade it in to make the appearance less jarring for the user.

2. **Custom Marker Icon**: Use a custom icon for the subject site to make it more prominent and unique. This could be an icon that represents the brand or the purpose of the map.

3. **Marker Animation**: Add a drop animation to the subject site marker when it appears on the map. This draws attention to the location and enhances the visual appeal.

4. **Info Window Auto-Open**: Automatically open an info window on the subject site marker when the map loads, providing immediate context or information to the user.

5. **Improved Error Handling**: Ensure that if there is an error during the map loading or marker placement, the user is presented with a friendly error message and suggested actions.

6. **Responsive Map Controls**: Adjust the map controls (zoom buttons, map type, etc.) to be more mobile-friendly, ensuring they are easily accessible on all devices.

7. **Clustering Nearby Markers**: If there are multiple markers close to each other, implement marker clustering to improve map readability. This is especially useful when zoomed out.

8. **Optimized Map Centering**: Ensure the map is centered and zoomed appropriately to show all relevant markers, including the subject site and any points of interest.

9. **Enhanced Marker Details**: Provide more detailed information in the marker info windows, such as links to external resources or additional data about the location.

10. **Map Styling**: Customize the map's appearance with a color scheme that matches the branding of the site, making the map feel more integrated with the overall design.

11. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the map's loading performance by reducing unnecessary API calls and ensuring efficient use of resources.

12. **Accessibility Improvements**: Make sure the map is accessible, with keyboard navigability and screen reader support for all interactive map elements.

Would you like to proceed with these improvements, or are there specific changes you would like to prioritize or modify in this plan?

USER: (1) i thought you just did that, but okay. (2) i thought you just did that too, but okay. (3) yes, add marker animation. (4) it already does, clearly; but now that you mention it, i want that to NOT show. (5) nah to error handling. (6) yes to responsive map controls. Note that the buttons dont look too great as it stands even on desktop; the buttons on top are obscured almost entirely by the header bar, and i dont even want street view or full screen to be options for users. (7) No clustering. (8) Yes to optimized map centering, but it should be centered on the subject site while also making sure all placemarks are within the canvas. (9) I would absolutely love to enhance the marker details; however, unless you have any clever ideas to call 3rd party APIs or something, i only have the data that gets put in each description, which isnt much. (10) I'd like to hear your ideas for this map styling, but im leaning towards doubtful. (11) Nah, no optimization, it's plenty fast. (12) sure, but lets do accessibility stuff last.

ASSISTANT: Based on your feedback, here's the revised plan for the map improvements:

1. **Marker Animation**: We will add a drop animation to the subject site marker when it appears on the map to draw attention to the location.

2. **Info Window Auto-Open**: We will disable the auto-open feature of the info window on the subject site marker to avoid immediate pop-ups when the map loads.

3. **Responsive Map Controls**: We will adjust the map controls to be more mobile-friendly and remove the Street View and Fullscreen options. We will also ensure that the controls do not overlap with the header bar on desktop.

4. **Optimized Map Centering**: We will ensure the map is centered on the subject site while also making sure all placemarks are within the canvas.

5. **Enhanced Marker Details**: We will explore the possibility of enhancing the marker details with the available data. If you have any specific data points you want to include, please let us know.

6. **Map Styling**: We will propose a color scheme for the map that aligns with the branding of the site. This will involve customizing the map's appearance using the Google Maps Styling Wizard or similar tools.

7. **Accessibility Improvements**: We will ensure that the map is accessible by improving keyboard navigability and screen reader support for interactive map elements.

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with these improvements, and if there are any specific details or data points you would like to include in the marker details. Once confirmed, I will provide the necessary code changes to implement these improvements.

USER:
Before confirming... Is this too ambitious or do you think you can handle it? Be honest.

ASSISTANT: As an expert software developer, the proposed improvements are within a reasonable scope and can be implemented successfully. Each item on the list is a common feature or enhancement that developers often apply to web applications with maps. Here's a brief assessment of each task:

1. **Marker Animation**: This is a straightforward feature provided by the Google Maps API and can be easily implemented.

2. **Info Window Auto-Open**: Disabling the auto-open is a simple change in the existing logic.

3. **Responsive Map Controls**: Adjusting map controls for better visibility and removing unwanted options is a standard customization of the Google Maps API.

4. **Optimized Map Centering**: Centering the map on a specific marker while ensuring all markers are visible is a common mapping requirement and can be achieved with Google Maps API methods.

5. **Enhanced Marker Details**: While limited to the data available, presenting it in a more user-friendly or detailed manner is feasible. If third-party API integration is required in the future, it would be a more complex task but still manageable.

6. **Map Styling**: Customizing the map's appearance is supported by the Google Maps API through styling options. It requires some design decisions but is technically straightforward.

7. **Accessibility Improvements**: Improving accessibility is a critical aspect of web development. While it can be more involved depending on the current state of the application, it is an achievable goal.

Overall, the plan is ambitious in terms of the number of improvements but each individual task is manageable. If you confirm, I will proceed with the implementation, starting with the most critical enhancements and ensuring that each change is thoroughly tested to minimize the chance of failure.

USER: Ok, proceed with the following final adjustments: (1) make the subject site animate in first; im thinking two seconds before the tallest building-related elements animate in. two seconds after that, all the comps placemarks (the orange circles) shall begin to animate in in quick succession (e.g. a very small ms gap between them for fancy effect). (2) While i don't want any pop-up windows to auto-open, i would love to have all comps placemarks to have very small text above it containing its property name (you can find it in the code where the info window content is defined). (5) Make sure you understand the data i have available (im stating the obvious here). (6) For your information, my color scheme begins as seafoam blue accents on white plain bg, but the blue changes to seafoam variants of other colors dependent upon the result being a 'success' (seafoam green) or 'failure' (seafoam red or orange). (7) okay, you've convinced me. I really dont like how it currently blocks me from moving it around with just one finger on mobile. PLEASE RE-CONFIRM YOUR UNDERSTANDINGS

ASSISTANT: Thank you for the confirmation and additional details. Here's the final plan based on your instructions:

1. **Marker Animation**:
   - Animate the subject site marker with a drop effect two seconds before any other map elements.
   - Two seconds after the subject site marker, animate in the tallest building-related elements.
   - Two seconds after that, animate in all the comps placemarks in quick succession.

2. **Comps Placemarks Text**:
   - Add very small text above each comps placemark containing its property name, without auto-opening info windows.

5. **Data Availability**:
   - Ensure that the enhancements utilize only the data that is currently available in the application.

6. **Map Styling**:
   - Customize the map's appearance to match the seafoam blue color scheme, with variants depending on the success or failure of the result.

7. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Improve the map's interactivity on mobile devices, allowing it to be moved around with one finger.

I understand the requirements and am ready to proceed with the implementation. Here are the steps I will take:

1. Modify the `public\gmap.js` file to implement the marker animations and the text above the comps placemarks.
2. Modify the `public\gmap.js` file to adjust the map styling to match the color scheme.
3. Modify the `public\gmap.js` file to improve the map's accessibility on mobile devices.

Please confirm if you would like me to proceed with these changes, and I will provide the necessary code modifications.

USER: Excellent. I wish you the best of luck, please begin, im counting on you

ASSISTANT: Thank you for your confirmation. Let's begin with the implementation of the changes.

First, we'll add the animation for the subject site marker and ensure it drops in before the other elements. Then, we'll add the text labels for the comps placemarks. Lastly, we'll adjust the map controls for better mobile interaction and apply the color scheme styling.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes:

Please note that for the map styling (item 6), you would need to provide the specific styles or use the Google Maps Styling Wizard to generate the JSON for the styles. Once you have the JSON, it can be inserted into the `styles` property in the `mapOptions`.

These changes will implement the requested animations, text labels, and map control adjustments. If you have the specific styles for the map, please provide them, and I will include them in the code. Otherwise, I can proceed with the changes as they are.

mm, oom: pagefault_out_of_memory: don't force global OOM for dying tasks

commit 0b28179a6138a5edd9d82ad2687c05b3773c387b upstream.

Patch series "memcg: prohibit unconditional exceeding the limit of dying tasks", v3.

Memory cgroup charging allows killed or exiting tasks to exceed the hard
limit.  It can be misused and allowed to trigger global OOM from inside
a memcg-limited container.  On the other hand if memcg fails allocation,
called from inside #PF handler it triggers global OOM from inside
pagefault_out_of_memory().

To prevent these problems this patchset:
 (a) removes execution of out_of_memory() from
     pagefault_out_of_memory(), becasue nobody can explain why it is
     necessary.
 (b) allow memcg to fail allocation of dying/killed tasks.

This patch (of 3):

Any allocation failure during the #PF path will return with VM_FAULT_OOM
which in turn results in pagefault_out_of_memory which in turn executes
out_out_memory() and can kill a random task.

An allocation might fail when the current task is the oom victim and
there are no memory reserves left.  The OOM killer is already handled at
the page allocator level for the global OOM and at the charging level
for the memcg one.  Both have much more information about the scope of
allocation/charge request.  This means that either the OOM killer has
been invoked properly and didn't lead to the allocation success or it
has been skipped because it couldn't have been invoked.  In both cases
triggering it from here is pointless and even harmful.

It makes much more sense to let the killed task die rather than to wake
up an eternally hungry oom-killer and send him to choose a fatter victim
for breakfast.

Gizmo Arrows (#10550)

## Objective

- Add an arrow gizmo as suggested by #9400 

## Solution

(excuse my Protomen music)


https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/14184826/192adf24-079f-4a4b-a17b-091e892974ec

Wasn't horribly hard when i remembered i can change coordinate systems
whenever I want. Gave them four tips (as suggested by @alice-i-cecile in
discord) instead of trying to decide what direction the tips should
point.

Made the tip length default to 1/10 of the arrow's length, which looked
good enough to me. Hard-coded the angle from the body to the tips to 45
degrees.

## Still TODO

- [x] actual doc comments
- [x] doctests
- [x] `ArrowBuilder.with_tip_length()`

---

## Changelog

- Added `gizmos.arrow()` and `gizmos.arrow_2d()`
- Added arrows to `2d_gizmos` and `3d_gizmos` examples

## Migration Guide

identity: default to RS256 for new workload ids (#18882)

OIDC mandates the support of the RS256 signing algorithm so in order to maximize workload identity's usefulness this change switches from using the EdDSA signing algorithm to RS256.

Old keys will continue to use EdDSA but new keys will use RS256. The EdDSA generation code was left in place because it's fast and cheap and I'm not going to lie I hope we get to use it again.

**Test Updates**

Most of our Variables and Keyring tests had a subtle assumption in them that the keyring would be initialized by the time the test server had elected a leader. ed25519 key generation is so fast that the fact that it was happening asynchronously with server startup didn't seem to cause problems. Sadly rsa key generation is so slow that basically all of these tests failed.

I added a new `testutil.WaitForKeyring` helper to replace `testutil.WaitForLeader` in cases where the keyring must be initialized before the test may continue. However this is mostly used in the `nomad/` package.

In the `api` and `command/agent` packages I decided to switch their helpers to wait for keyring initialization by default. This will slow down tests a bit, but allow those packages to not be as concerned with subtle server readiness details. On my machine rsa key generation takes 63ms, so hopefully the difference isn't significant on CI runners.

**TODO**

- Docs and changelog entries.
- Upgrades - right now upgrades won't get RS256 keys until their root key rotates either manually or after ~30 days.
- Observability - I'm not sure there's a way for operators to see if they're using EdDSA or RS256 unless they inspect a key. The JWKS endpoint can be inspected to see if EdDSA will be used for new identities, but it doesn't technically define which key is active. If upgrades can be fixed to automatically rotate keys, we probably don't need to worry about this.

**Requiem for ed25519**

When workload identities were first implemented we did not immediately consider OIDC compliance. Consul, Vault, and many other third parties support JWT auth methods without full OIDC compliance. For the machine<-->machine use cases workload identity is intended to fulfill, OIDC seemed like a bigger risk than asset.

EdDSA/ed25519 is the signing algorithm we chose for workload identity JWTs because of all these lovely properties:

1. Deterministic keys that can be derived from our preexisting root keys. This was perhaps the biggest factor since we already had a root encryption key around from which we could derive a signing key.
2. Wonderfully compact: 64 byte private key, 32 byte public key, 64 byte signatures. Just glorious.
3. No parameters. No choices of encodings. It's all well-defined by [RFC 8032](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032).
4. Fastest performing signing algorithm! We don't even care that much about the performance of our chosen algorithm, but what a free bonus!
5. Arguably one of the most secure signing algorithms widely available. Not just from a cryptanalysis perspective, but from an API and usage perspective too.

Life was good with ed25519, but sadly it could not last.

[IDPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider), such as AWS's IAM OIDC Provider, love OIDC. They have OIDC implemented for humans, so why not reuse that OIDC support for machines as well? Since OIDC mandates RS256, many implementations don't bother implementing other signing algorithms (or at least not advertising their support). A quick survey of OIDC Discovery endpoints revealed only 2 out of 10 OIDC providers advertised support for anything other than RS256:

- [PayPal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/.well-known/openid-configuration) supports HS256
- [Yahoo](https://api.login.yahoo.com/.well-known/openid-configuration) supports ES256

RS256 only:

- [GitHub](https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/.well-known/openid-configuration)

staging/android: Initial partial kernel-doc for ashmem.c

I am beginning to understand the core concepts at play here.

I am nowhere near finished with this class - However, it is better if
I commit what I have documented so far tonight - That way, if I mess
up tomorrow morning, I can just roll back to here.

Sorry if this clutters things up. In the end, once *everything* is
documented, it will make understanding the Android staging driver
easier to understand as a programmer - Hopefully for both new developers
and current ones.

- Blatantly refusing to mourn now makes your council discontent, in addition to various earlier effects. May you live in interesting times!
- Added Pagan HO founding event loc.
- Added Eastern HO founding event loc.
- Minor tweaks to Kurultai stuff; still mostly in the "dev" folder because a bunch of work is still needed.

Business Case: Walmart - Confidence Interval and CLT
About Walmart
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.
Business Problem
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specif- ically, purchase amount) against the customer’s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).

11. Maybe, men are paid more than women hence spend more.
12. Target men with campaigns and advertisement of products with high price.
13. Women make more economical choices while buying products then men. #Value count Insight
14. 75% transactions on Black friday are done by males.
15. 4225 (72%) people are Male while 1666 (28%) customers are Female.
16. 3417 (58%) customers are single while 2474 (42%) are married.
17. Most no (42%) transactions are done in City B.
18. 59% transactions are done by single people.
19. Most no (40%) transactions are done BY people in age group 26-35.
20. 35% transactions are done by people who have lived for one year in the city.
21. People with occupation 4(13%),0(13%),7(13%) transact the most on Black friday.
22. Product category 5 (27%),1 (26%),8 (21%) are sold the most during Black Friday. # Product insight
23. No of unique products sold are == 3631 25.No of unique products bought by Males are == 3588 26.No of
unique products bought by Females are == 3367
Product Category Insight
1. Product Category 1 is most bought category by Male while 5 is the most bought category by females.
#Insight on total_spend and Total products per user on Black friday
2. Total spend follows a log normal distribution.
3. There are outliers present in the dataset for the total spend by each customer during black friday sales.
4. Median value for total spend on black friday per user for male and female is 5,23,983 and 5,19,347
respectively.
5. Median value for total products bought per user for male and female is 10 and 9 respectively.
Insights on Categorical Variable per user statistics
1. 4225 (72%) people are Male while 1666 (28%) customers are Female.
2. 3417 (58%) customers are unmarried while 2474 (42%) are married.
3. Majoity of customers fall in 26-25 age group followed by 36-45 group. Walmart Can include more products
for this age group. Target more advertisement towards this age group. Least no of 35. customers in age
group 0-17 and 46 and above. Can take meausres to improve their purchase behaviour by introducing new
products for this age group.
4. Majority customers belong to C city category and least to city A. City C customers should be of prime focus
as they generate most of the revenue. Send discount offers to the people who have been staying less than a
year in the city to increase their sales.
4.
Q1. Are women spending more money per transaction than men? Why or Why not? Ans1. Mean,Median
purchase amount for males is = 9438 and 8098 respectively. Mean,Median purchase amount for females is =
8735 and 7914 respectively.
Clearly men on average are spending per transaction more then women. This could be due to number of
reasons.
1. Men prefer expensive products.
2. Maybe, men are paid more than women hence spend more.
3. Men are targetted with campaigns and advertisement of products with high price.
4. Women make more sensible/conservative choices while buying products.
Q2. Confidence intervals and distribution of the mean of the expenses by female and male customers (10 Points)
Ans2.
Approximate population mean for total spend per Male is 925479 Approximate population mean for total spend
per Female is 711445
95 CI for Average Spending by a male customer on black friday is (876429,978355) 95 CI for Average Spending by
a female customer on black friday is (681338,743533)
Q3. Are confidence intervals of average male and female spending overlapping? How can Walmart leverage this
conclusion to make changes or improvements?
1. Confidence interval of average male and female customer spendings are not overlapping.
2. We can conclude that on average males customer spend more than a female customer.
3. Male customers are more likely to buy expensive products in comparison to female customers.
4. Walmart should target ads with expensive products to male customers. Female customers should be
targetted with economical products.

Unit tests

Lessons learned:
- "NullPointerException" hell is real
- "UnnecessaryStubbingException" is annoying and needs interesting workarounds (thank you SO)
- Even more imports
- I can understand why businesses pick java
- I can understand why businesses would like to migrate away from java (thank you golang)
- Unit tests can find bugs in production code, which works when run manually. Usesful actually

Next steps:
- lets try logging, similar to my go boilerplate logging (APoniatowski/boillog)
- create a jenkinsfile

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

## [quanghgx/arrow](https://github.com/quanghgx/arrow)@[3beb93af36...](https://github.com/quanghgx/arrow/commit/3beb93af36b3388a6871846365502c36ae4cfaa4)

GH-37815: [MATLAB] Add `arrow.array.ListArray` MATLAB class (#38357)

### Rationale for this change

Now that many of the commonly-used "primitive" array types have been added to the MATLAB interface, we can implement an `arrow.array.ListArray` class.

This pull request adds a new `arrow.array.ListArray` class which can be converted to a MATLAB `cell` array by calling the static `toMATLAB` method.

### What changes are included in this PR?

1. Added a new `arrow.array.ListArray` MATLAB class.

*Methods*

`cellArray = arrow.array.ListArray.toMATLAB()`
`listArray = arrow.array.ListArray.fromArrays(offsets, values)`

*Properties*

`Offsets` - `Int32Array` list offsets (uses zero-based indexing)
`Values` - Array of values in the list (supports nesting)

2. Added a new `arrow.type.traits.ListTraits` MATLAB class.

**Example**
```matlab
>> offsets = arrow.array(int32([0, 2, 3, 7]))

offsets = 

[
  0,
  2,
  3,
  7
]

>> values = arrow.array(["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"])

values = 

[
  "A",
  "B",
  "C",
  "D",
  "E",
  "F",
  "G"
]

>> arrowArray = arrow.array.ListArray.fromArrays(offsets, values)

arrowArray = 

[
  [
    "A",
    "B"
  ],
  [
    "C"
  ],
  [
    "D",
    "E",
    "F",
    "G"
  ]
]

>> matlabArray = arrowArray.toMATLAB()

matlabArray =

  3x1 cell array

    {2x1 string}
    {["C"     ]}
    {4x1 string}

>> matlabArray{:}

ans = 

  2x1 string array

    "A"
    "B"

ans = 

    "C"

ans = 

  4x1 string array

    "D"
    "E"
    "F"
    "G"

```

### Are these changes tested?

Yes.

1. Added a new `tListArray.m` test class.
2. Added a new `tListTraits.m` test class.
3. Updated `arrow.internal.test.tabular.createAllSupportedArrayTypes` to include `ListArray`.

### Are there any user-facing changes?

Yes.

1. Users can now create an `arrow.array.ListArray` from an `offsets` and `values` array by calling the static `arrow.array.ListArray.fromArrays(offsets, values)` method. `ListArray`s can be converted into MATLAB `cell` arrays by calling the static `arrow.array.ListArray.toMATLAB` method.

### Notes

1. We chose to use the "missing-class" `missing` value as the `NullSubstitutionValue` for the time being for `ListArray`. However, we eventually want to add `arrow.array.NullArray`, and will most likely want to use the "missing-class" `missing` value to represent `NullArray` values in MATLAB. So, this could cause some ambiguity in the future. We have been thinking about whether we should consider introducing some sort of special "sentinel value" to represent null values when converting to MATLAB `cell` arrays. Perhaps, something like `arrow.Null`, or something to that effect, in order to avoid this ambiguity. If we think it makes sense to do that, we may want to retroactively change the `NullSubstitutionValue` to be `arrow.Null` and break compatibility. Since we are still in pre-`0.1`, we don't think the impact of such a behavior change would be very large.
2. Implementing `ListArray` is fairly involved. So, in the spirit of incremental delivery, we chose not to include an implementation of `arrow.array.ListArray.fromMATLAB` in this initial pull request. We plan on following up with some more changes to `arrow.array.ListArray`. See #38353, #38354, and #38361.
3. Thank you @ sgilmore10 for your help with this pull request!

### Future Directions

1. #38353
2. #38354
3. #38361
4. Consider adding a null sentinel value like `arrow.Null` for conversion to MATLAB `cell` arrays.
* Closes: #37815

Make weapon oprops able to appear on more things

- Hell vaults can now generate weapon oprops on helms as well as gloves
  and boots.
- Lesser/greater cult oprops (lesser acid/drool for shubbie, lesser
  magic/window for yog) now stack, lesser oprops can be applied to
  artifacts, and both can be consistently applied to helms, gloves, and
  boots, as well as real weapons.
- Kukeri can now apply the holy armor oprop as well as the weapon
  oprop.  They will apply both where possible (armor oprop is applied to
  ARMOR_CLASS, weapon oprop is applied to is_weapon).
- There is now a somewhat misleadingly named is_weapon macro that
  actually means "weapon oprops can be applied to this", not "this is
  a weapon that should be wielded to use properly".  I'm not sure what
  a better name would be.
- Some sflame prop bugfixes:
-- Curse glaze now works (previously sflm_able would never return true
   for armor so it was broken).
-- RWTH, RBRD, and SLIF don't work on non-silver/mithril/platinum armor.
- Also fixes a completely unrelated typo ("Cut me lose, please!" ->
  "Cut me loose, please!").

Adjusted version of Noisy's weapon oprop patch
Make weapon oprops able to appear on more things

- Hell vaults can now generate weapon oprops on helms as well as gloves
  and boots.
- Lesser/greater cult oprops can be consistently applied to helms, gloves, and
  boots, as well as real weapons. They still reflect current restrictions on combining
  and artifacts.
- Kukeri can now apply the holy armor oprop as well as the weapon
  oprop.  They will apply both where possible (armor oprop is applied to
  ARMOR_CLASS, weapon oprop is applied to weapon-oprop-valid items as well).
-- The armor oprop alone is much much worse than the weapon oprop,
   it's questionable if this is desireable behavior, but the PC
   must be holding the item in their hands so it's hard to imagine
   an unexperienced player doing it by accident.
- There is now an accepts_weapon_oprops macro to control this behavior.
- Some sflame prop bugfixes:
-- Curse glaze now works (previously sflm_able would never return true
   for armor so it was broken).
-- RWTH, RBRD, and SLIF don't work on non-silver/mithril/platinum armor.

[Security Solution][Detection Engine] improves new terms rule for multiple fields (#157413)

## Summary

As described in our README for new terms rule type:

> Runtime field supports only 100 emitted values. So for large arrays or
combination of values greater than 100, results may not be exhaustive.
This applies only to new terms with multiple fields.
  Following edge cases possible:
- false negatives (alert is not generated) if too many fields were
emitted and actual new values are not getting evaluated if it happened
in document in rule run window.
- false positives (wrong alert generated) if too many fields were
emitted in historical document and some old terms are not getting
evaluated against values in new documents.

To avoid this and deliver the better experience for our customers, this
PR is moving from current implementation(emitting aggregated values for
multiple new terms fields) towards using composite aggregation for each
page from phase 1, split in chunks by 500.
This allowed to be done due
[order](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html#_order)
of composite aggregation results

NOTE: implementation for a single new terms filed is the same, due to
performance reasons


### Performance measurements

Implementation | Shards | Docs per shard | Simultaneous Rule Executions
| Fields cardinality | Rule Execution Time Runtime field(current
implementation) | On week work
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
array of unique values length 10 |   |   |   |   |   |   
Terms 1 field | 10 | 900,000 | 1 | 100,000 | |   
Terms 2 fields | 10 | 900,000 | 1 | 100,000 | 30s  |  41s
Terms 3 fields | 10 | 900,000 | 1 | 100,000 | 40s | 56s

Implementation | Shards | Docs per shard | Simultaneous Rule Executions
| Fields cardinality | Rule Execution Time Runtime field(current
implementation) | On week work 1,000 per batch | On week work 500 per
batch
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
Terms 2 fields | 10 | 9,000,000 | 1 | 100,000 | 19s | 41s | 35s 
Terms 3 fields | 10 | 9,000,000 | 1 | 100,000 | 21s | 52s| 47s 
CPU % | | | | | 400-450% |500-600% | 400-450%

I selected size of the chunk as 500, since it's a bit faster and less
load on CPU

### Considerations on parallel composite search requests in phase 2

When running composite search requests in parallel, noticed significant
CPU increase in Elasticsearch ~ 1,000% for 2 requests in parallel
against ~ 500% for single.
Where win in performance was not that big: ~ 35s for 2 in parallel, 43s
for a single request. I think, having only one request is the better
option to go, that will prevent unnecessary CPU usage

### Test cases
I've added several functional test cases, that ensures, no missing/false
positives alerts are occurring. Applied to the old implementation, they
would fail

### Retry on max_clause_count error
Because we create query, that can have few thousands clauses, it is
possible it may fail due to [the maximum number of allowed
clauses](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-settings.html)
I implemented retry that: If request fails with batch size of 500
(default value), we will try to reduce it in twice per each retried
request, up until 125. Per ES documentation, max_clause_count min value
is 1,000 - so with 125 we should be able execute query below
max_clause_count value

### Checklist

Delete any items that are not applicable to this PR.

- [x] [Unit or functional
tests](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/development-tests.html)
were updated or added to match the most common scenarios

Add CI check to make sure River CLI is installable

Pertaining to the problem described in #35, seems like a good idea to
have a CI check make sure that nothing we've done with Go modules has
made the CLI not installable.

We have two variants:

* Install within a Go Module. This is theoretically nice because it'd
  get the same version of the River CLI as the River you're using, but
  has a very large downside currently in that it requires you to add
  the CLI's dependencies to your stack before it works. e.g. Cobra.

* Install outside a Go Module with the equivalent of `@latest` (uses the
  ref of the branch being built in CI). This is currently broken until a
  fix like #35 can come in.

Long term, this job may become too much of a maintenance headache
because Go has some really annoying caching behavior around modules, but
I didn't experience that while writing it, so it might be worthwhile
seeing whether this turns out to be valuable.

[MIRROR] Mafia can be played on your PDA [MDB IGNORE] (#24485)

* Mafia can be played on your PDA (#78576)

## About The Pull Request

Mafia is now friggin playable from the PDA, I also changed other stuff
too

- You can't use abilities on dead people if you're not supposed to (cant
kill the same person over and over)
- Changelings cant kill other Changelings
- Changelings can now only talk to eachother at night, rather than using
:j
- Everyone starts spawned in the center of the map, since people playing
on PDA can't move their characters. This is so everyone can hear PDA
users in person, as I don't want the chat log to be mandatory.

To do this, all messages you are meant to be able to see, is now logged
for you to see in your Mafia panel. This essentially means that people
playing through the PDA get a downgraded version of it, but I don't know
how much larger I want this UI to be.

Playing Mafia through the PDA will not tell you of other players ahead
of time when signing up (as it shows ckeys + pdas), but they can see the
names in-game. Unfortunately this means we'll have to remove your
customization coming with you, to prevent using it to tell who is dead
in round.

Things I am missing
- Program overlays on PDA/Laptop/Computer
- Icon for the app's header while a game is active

I'm not a spriter and can't make either of these

This is the new UI

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/7cf503d9-b2e2-4127-874a-acad6425d649)

I also fixed alert calls for PDAs and stuff

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/e09b2e5e-b9e7-43ae-9273-c168e9c8e642)

and removed the X at the top on computers since they had no battery

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/d3dd8307-805c-4aba-be5e-4c24a0bdcb91)

Looks a little better now hopefully 👍

## Why It's Good For The Game

- The current Arcade app sucks, and is a solo game. This is much more
entertaining and you can talk to others in it, which is swag as fuck.
- There's a larger potential playerbase for the Minigame making it more
likely to be played.
- Sets groundwork for a better version of
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/75879
- Adds more suspense and teamwork in the minigame.

## Changelog

:cl: JohnFulpWillard, sprites by CoiledLamb
add: You can now play Mafia on your PDA.
balance: Mafia changelings can now only talk to eachother during the
night.
fix: Mafia abilities can't be repeatedly used on people.

[MIRROR] Actually supports alpha passed into emissive stuff [MDB IGNORE] (#24481)

* Actually supports alpha passed into emissive stuff (#79117)

## About The Pull Request

Ok so like, the emissive procs have an alpha argument right? The thing
is, the thing is it doesn't fucking do anything.

Alpha is a component of the color var (at least when it's a matrix), so
when we set alpha and then set color to a matrix, the alpha gets
overriden. Inverse is also true.

I want to support alpha args, since I like the idea of dimmable
emissives. Soooooo
Let's take the alpha arg, divide it by 255, and replace everything that
cares about alpha (as an intensity thing) with it.

This lets us do transparent emissives and transparent emissive blockers.

I added some guard checks to hopefully avoid the list init most of the
time (it is in theory comprable since color sets should copy but I don't
trust byond to optimize for that)
Also modified the macros to suppport what I'm doing nicely

## Why It's Good For The Game

We should support this, and now we do

* Actually supports alpha passed into emissive stuff

Drip or Drown; Premier style update. And some other clothing related stuff. (#4757)

* Buncha stuffff

First and foremost, it's been like four years - No one has come with a better set of equipment for the Premier in terms of aesthetics and quality.

Replaces much of the Premiers old/mismatched green shit with newer eris captain sprites, if we want to re-color this a bit that's fine but either way we /desperately/ need to replace these ancient sprites.

Premier additionally now actually starts with their coat, and gets a pair of dress shoes instead of the old scuffed brown shoes.

Mind, the original hat/coat/uniform are still available as alternatives if for SOME reason you want to dress up like a christmas tree. I did not add an alt for the space armor/helmet due to them A. not matching and B. being old sprites. I guess if someone REALLY wants I'll port the /tg/ carapace armor/helmets more up to date sprites as an alt.

Ports the funny cyberpunk jacket from eris(in the loadout.)

ports the eris preacher robes icons, but doesn't code them in quite yet. I couldn't be fucked, there's SO many.

Actually adds the formal IH uniform in as well as doing some tweaks to the icon so that WO + spec can also get a formal uniform with their normal rank pips

ports the eris syndie berets.

As always, a big thanks to the talented spriters over at Eris

* new stuff. Also fixes linters lol oops

Adds to the greyson loot pool an armored void using sprites from Près de l'oiseau#2625 over on the Eris discord.

Replaces some more,  old sprites. Miner suit is replaced as pictured as well as the industrial RIG - sprites by Près once more.

* Update station.dm

* Fixes spawning of the greyson combat void helmet

* puts credits in the code instead of on the PR

* minor stuff.,

Slighjtly fixes syndie beret- the north facing sprites were 1 pixel too far down.

WO helmet is no longer missing its verb to turn the light on. Good work there, Rebel - how did no one notice this till now?

* actually fixes it. ugh.

* BUNCHA new church stuff

Primes hat now has 9 alts

Primes coat now has 5

credit to Près de l'oiseau#2625 once more for the fantastic sprites.

Im so sick of bugs. (#4739)

* Mother fucker. Im so sick of bugs.

Cigarettes no longer(seem to) cause kidney damage to people with unclean living.

psion void armor has correct slowdown for shoes and doesn't use slowdown on other pieces of armor. Additionally, no longer allows ears to flop outside of it. It's a fucking space suit, why would they be out?

Opifex medbelt no longer selectable, sorry powergamers.

Removes change_appearance from baseline armor vest. Why? It is the parent to MANY MANY MANY fucking items and thus caused MANY MANY MANY items to have erronious change_appearance procs that only had two options for the base parent item. This is why we don't put fucking procs on BASE PARENT items that affect DOZENS of other items. Fixes a few others, WO plate has no unique sprite and now has a proper working change appearance. CO does have a unique sprite, it is gone.

Fixes #4732
Fixes #4734
fixes #4724

* Update psi_Larmor.dm

Stop hiding both menu and notebookbar softlocking

Previously, when using the Collapse_Notebookbar postmessage or
equivalent ui_defaults (SpreadsheetToolbar=false, etc.), particularly in
compact mode, it was possible to additionally hide the menu bar. As the
button to show the menu bar is on the notebookbar, this meant that you
couldn't reactivate either notebookbar or menubar until you refreshed
the page. This is particularly annoying in integrators that may not
provide an easy way to reload the page

This commit makes it so that hiding the menu bar automatically
uncollapses the notebookbar and won't let it be collapsed again. Whether
the notebook bar should be collapsed (the last thing done to it was a
collapse) is remembered and restored after the menu bar is shown again,
so if you send a postmessage that will affect the state of the
notebookbar after the menu is shown (even though it will not affect the
notebookbar's state immediately)

Caveats:
- If you are hiding the notebookbar to limit the control the user has,
  that's broken by this commit as it makes it impossible to hide both
  the menu and notebook bars at the same time.
- The notebook bar will be hidden again when re-showing the menu bar,
  however there still isn't a way to hide the notebook bar in normal
  use (i.e. without using either postmessage or ui_defaults) while in
  compact mode (although there is a workaround to show it- switching
  into tabbed mode and then back!). It might be nice to have one.

Other considered solutions:
- We could add a new button that allowed you to reopen the menu if both
  menu and notebookbar were hidden
  - Not sure there's much benefit to this over just doing what we're
    doing here, and it's harder to implement
- We could disable the button to hide the menu bar when the notebookbar
  is collapsed
  - As far as I know, there's no button in the UI to show the notebook
    bar. This would make it impossible to hide the menu bar if the
    notebookbar was hidden via postmessage or ui_defaults

docs: Improved spellchecking (#2722)

Improve our spellchecker (cspell) configuration and dictionary file
organization.

# Rationale

This is a proposal to establish a few changes:
* better separate our dictionary files into different categories of
types of words we are including
* improve the cspell regexes to be more aggressive
* be less lenient to what kinds of words we are adding to our
dictionaries
* have the dictionary file also serve as an explanation for obscure
references that cannot be easily derived from the word

Essentially my goal is that either when reviewing a PR that adds a new
entry to our dictionary, or when reading the dictionary files
themselves, it is immediately obvious what the entries are and why they
are there. Currently it can be just a dumpster we throw anything into if
spellcheck fails.

# Proposal

This PR-as-a-proposal essentially do the following changes.

## Split Dictionary Files

Proposes a better separation for our dictionary files. Currently we have
3 that are a bit broad and not super clear on what goes where. This
breaks it down a bit more and adds a comment to each file explaining
what kinds of terms should be added to each; that also serves as a
general guidance for what kinds of words should be added to the lexicon
in general, and makes it harder for mistakes to make into it.

* `flame_dictionary`: remains pretty much unchanged; it is dedicated to
Flame-related words, including companies, tools, and libraries (and
their associated concepts) mentioned on our codebase. Basically a
collection of proper-nouns relating to companies and libraries we
mention.
* `dart_dictionary`: new file for Dart and Flutter related terms
* `sphinx_dictionary`: unchanged, for Sphynx related terms
* `people_dictionary`: specific for people names and usernames
referenced on the codebase (in TODOs, mentions, etc)
* `words_dictionary`: actual English-language words (or common
abbreviations) missing from CSpell
* `gamedev_dictionary`: this was our biggest file that contained all
sort of things. it has been mostly broken down and now only contains
general development-adjacent terms and expressions

## Include definitions

Except for the `words` dictionary, which should be self-explanatory (as
it basically covers for "holes" in CSpell standard dictionary, which I
have been finding a bit lacking), every other file will contain terms in
the form:

```
word # definition of the word
```

What exactly the definition is can slightly vary depending on which
dictionary file we are talking about, but the examples should be
self-explanatory.

As an example, for the gamedev file, it should provide some simple
guidance as to what the term means, or if it's an acronym or
abbreviation, what it stands for. The goal is not to teach the entire
concept to someone unfamiliar, but allow them to "google" it for
themselves by giving enough context, so they can confirm their
suspicions. For example, if they see `LTRB` somewhere by itself, they
are not able to "just google that" because it is too vague. The
dictionary file provides enough context for the user to figure out
however much deeper information they want about any particular subject.
It will also disambiguate from any non-Flame related homonyms. For
people on the people file and companies on the flame file, the
description will provide links to clearly disambiguate what they are;
for tools, a brief description of what the tool is for is also included.
And so on.

The goal is not to build a comprehensive, in depth-guide to each word we
use, but rather to give the bare minimum of context on what this term
"is doing" on our codebase.

## Be less lenient with terms

My idea with these two major changes combined, is that we are overall
more tactical about which terms we want to add to the dictionaries.
Adding a word to the dictionary file is essentially giving carte blanche
to anyone in the future to reuse that term anywhere. I think we should
see spellchecker violations as "warnings"; we decide on the set of
warning rules we want to enable for the entire project (hopefully all
the ones that make sense; or have a reason for disabling the ones that
don't). We might need to violate these warnings sporadically, for
example, we ban `print` on the codebase but might need to allow it
specifically in a couple places. But we would not disable the entire
warning to do that, rather we would add a specific comment-bypass on the
smallest possible scope that encompasses all the relevant lines. We
would also add a proper comment explaining why we are bypassing the
general rule in this specific place.

Similarly, we should not have one-off violations on the dictionary file,
even if they make sense in the one place they occur, but we should
encourage more liberal use of scoped bypasses for such cases. These
Ukrainian words are required in this file, but should not be on the
dictionary as it does not make sense to use foreign languages anywhere
else:

```
// used as examples of Ukrainian words on the documentation below
// cSpell:ignore рушниця, рушниці, рушниць
```

It might look inelegant to have to include that, but just like a
warning-bypass comment, accompanied by the explanatory proper-comment,
this actually provides helpful guidance and context for the reader that
might be confused with the usage of incomprehensible terms.

This also encourages people to avoid obscure terms that are not already
in our dictionary (i.e. that we have already "bought in" and paid the
mental load investment cost), making our code (and docs) easier to parse
and read for everyone. I want to be extremely clear that that **does
not** mean we need to "dumb down" anything whatsoever, or do any sort of
gymnastics to avoid the wrath of an incompetent spellchecker.

But, for example [when spelling "cave
ace"](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/pull/2304) in variable names
in a random example, having it typed as `caveAce` instead of `caveace`
can slightly help with readability, specially for non-native speakers
(like most of us). It is an extremely minor insignificant gain, but
having the dictionary file require a brief description will nudge us to
give a bit more thought into each "bypass" we are adding.

(note: a similar issue that I have not yet addressed is "spine boy", but
I will leave that for followups and just added that one to the
dictionary for now, as I am still over the fence on that one since it is
an actual "known" character with a dedicated page, so it is more like a
proper noun - as a specific decision I think it is out-of-scope of the
broader discussion).

Sunbeams Somersaulting Down

I don’t know if we will ever achieve twice the speed of light. But I’m gonna try. GitHub should be light speed. Medium should be light speed too. 

This would be my mom’s Camry, Cameron’s Challenger, and Adalberto Sanchez’s Ford where normally my uncle, Mike Richardson’s white Dodge Ram would be. 

They know I hate Ford. But they couldn’t possibly put the white Ram out here. It scares him. Them baby Richardsons are gonna get them. The old man Richardson already did. 

But Adalberto pisses them off because he made no money, once killed a man, was MS13 and they knew he would come kill me for $1 million. It was the perfect plan, they knew I’d invite him in and think nothing of him being in my house. 

Plan fell apart when Adalberto Sanchez of Georgetown, SC told them “No. That’s my friend.”

I loved Adalberto. The Creator told me about what happened to him afterwards. They sent mercenaries for him, the CIA will not fuck with MS13. 

I’ll write more on Medium. See me at https://medium.com/@micahthemf … I swear github I was only driving traffic. I do it for the culture goddamn.

Refactor icemoon wolves into basic mobs and add taming + pack behavior (#79736)

## About The Pull Request

Ports icemoon wolves over to the basic mob framework with a bit of extra
stuff:

- Wolves call for help when attacked within a decently large radius.
Because you know, pack animals.
- Wolves can now be tamed with a slab of meat
- When tamed, wolves can be ridden like goliath mounts. Ride wolf, life
good. Pretend you're playing ARK and start shivering to death in thatch
huts for that High Roleplay experience.
- Tamed wolves have access to a bunch of pet commands (following, point
fetching, point attacking, play dead, etc) and will also defend their
owners vehemently if they're attacked.

You can probably tame multiple if you wanted to.

## Why It's Good For The Game

What part about riding wolves isn't entertaining? I don't really play
/tg/ that much so I can't argue too much about the balance implications
this might pose, but it's undoubtedly a stupid little gimmick and is
likely to be used by bored assistants and miners with too much time on
their hands.

Especially robust individuals will probably find a million things to do
with a basic mob capable of fetching, attacking on command and generally
being able to defend themselves decently well.

## Changelog

:cl: yooriss
refactor: Icemoon wolves now use the basic mob framework and should act
more intelligently, defending their pack.
add: Icemoon wolves can be tamed with slabs of meat and can be ridden as
mounts once friendly. Being rather large dogs, they also have access to
most of the pet commands you'd expect, such as fetching things, and
violently mauling people their owners point at.

Replaces the poster and graffiti objectives with assault and early steal & destroy ones. (#77029)

With the blessings of @Watermelon914 I am removing the two objectives
for placing posters and spraying graffiti.

These old objectives are not dead. Their items have moved to the
Badassery section of the uplink.

A box of 3 demotivational posters can be bought for 1TC with 0 rep.
The spraycan can be bought for 1TC with 0 rep.

In their place comes one new objective and one extended objective.

The new objective is Assault a Crewmember. This objective requires you
to attack the specified target 2-5 times (random on objective
generation). It tallies from any attack that filters through the
`/datum/element/relay_attackers` element and has an "attacker"
associated with it.

Although it asks you not to kill the other player, it doesn't fail if
you kill them.

I have expanded the low-risk theft objectives with items like a mime
mask, lawyer badge and a fake moustache (commonly on cooks).

Finally, I've added a very low level set of steal-and-destroy objectives
aimed at some items that will require a bit of basic breaking and
entering, and the destruction of which may hurt crew morale.

```
/datum/objective_item/steal/traitor/donut_box
/datum/objective_item/steal/traitor/rpd
/datum/objective_item/steal/traitor/space_law
/datum/objective_item/steal/traitor/granted_stamp
/datum/objective_item/steal/traitor/denied_stamp
/datum/objective_item/steal/traitor/lizard_plush
/datum/objective_item/steal/traitor/moth_plush
/datum/objective_item/steal/traitor/insuls
```

This PR also fixes clown shoes missing a proc override to allow them to
actually register as a theft objective.

Basically my discussion with Watermelon focused on the idea that the
graffiti and poster objectives weren't really crimes. They baited
antagonists into very passive play early-game.

These new replacements encourage a more antagonistic playstyle. Starting
fights plus B&E are two bread-and-butter play paradigms for antaggery.

Giving a few early game theft + destroy options with a mix of impactful
items (like insuls and RPDs) versus more symbolic or emotive items
(plushies, donut boxes, Cargonia stamps) gets antagonists out and about
in the station, warming themselves up.

And having an objective to assault players (even if you don't kill them)
allows cheeky antags with a penchant for shittery to start fights with
players and start genuinely impacting the shift, involving sec and
drawing players into their antaggery.

Both of these natually ease players into the more substantive theft and
murder objectives.

The existing spray and posters are actually thematically super cool.
Traitors now have even more access to them since they can be bought for
1TC per spraycan/3-pack of posters. This lets antags with TC to spare
run gimmicks around them and adds extra fun to the Badassery section.
:cl:
del: Traitor objectives to place posters and graffiti the station have
been removed.
add: The items associated with the poster and graffiti objectives can
now be purchased from the Badassery section of the uplink. The posters
come in a box of 3 for 1TC, and the spraycans are 1TC each.
add: Adds a new Assault traitor objective, requiring you to the attack
the target a few times without needing to kill them. Earn TC and
reputation by starting barroom fights and bait players into escalation
battles for fun and profit.
add: Expands low-risk steal objectives to include the Chef's fake
moustache, Lawyer's badge, and Mime's mask.
add: Adds brand new shift start Steal & Destroy objectives for early
breaking and entering. Smash your way into a sec checkpoint to grab a
Space Law book, engineering to grab some insulated gloves or the psych
office to kidnap their moth plush.
fix: Fixes an issue where the steal clown shoes objective would never be
valid.

Nanotrasen basic mobs. (#78917)

First and foremost, converts all Nanotrasen simplemobs into basic mobs.

To avoid messy and redundant code, or god forbid, making Nanotrasen mobs
a subtype of Syndicate ones, I've made Syndicate, Russian, and
Nanotrasen mobs all share a unified "Trooper" parent. This should have
no effect on their behaviors, but makes things much easier to extend
further in the future.

While most of this PR is pretty cut-and-dry, I've done a couple notable
things. For one, all types of ranged trooper will now avoid friendly
fire, instead of shooting their friends in the back. Even the Russians
have trigger discipline.

I've also created a new AI subtree that allows mobs to call for
reinforcements. I've hopefully made this easy to extend, but the
existing version works as follows:

- A mob with this subtree that gains a target that is also a mob will
call out to all mobs within 15 tiles.
- If they share a faction, mobs receiving the call will have the target
added to their retaliate list, and have a new key set targeting the
calling mob.
- If they have the correct subtree in their AI controller, called-to
mobs will then run over to help out.

Sadly, this behavior is currently used only by a few completely unused
Nanotrasen mobs, so in practice it will not yet be seen.

Finally, I've fixed a minor issue where melee Russian mobs punch people
to death despite holding a knife. They now use the proper effects for
stabbing instead of punching.

Removes 8 more simple animals from the list.

As said above, making all "trooper" type mobs share a common parent cuts
down on code reuse, ensures consistency of behavior, and makes it much
easier to add new troopers not affiliated with these groups. I expect
that I'll make pirates share this same parent next.

The new "reinforcements" behavior, though extremely powerful, opens up
exciting new opportunities in the future. There aren't many existing
behaviors that allow basic mobs to work _together_ in interesting ways,
and I think adding some enemy teamwork could be fun.
:cl:
refactor: Hostile Nanotrasen mobs now use the basic mob framework. This
should make them a little smarter and more dangerous. Please report any
bugs.
fix: Russian mobs will now actually use those knives they're holding.

Basic Constructs: parent type + Harvester (#78807)

I kind of hate cult as a whole, but I like these little guys. Let's
basic-ize them.

This PR begins the process with the harbinger of the Red Harvest, the
Harvester! Their actual capabilities have been changed very little,
except that most of their unique properties have been moved to
components and elements. The basic parent type of constructs has also
been set up to make the next bunch of conversions easier.

- Constructs capable of repair now receive the healing hands component.
Healing hands has been extended, to allow the healing particles to come
in custom colors, and to allow it to print the target's health if the
target is not a carbon.
- Repairing constructs also receive a new element: Structure repair is a
lighter-weight variant on healing hands that allows repairing clicked-on
atoms of specified types.
- Constructs capable of damaging walls, meanwhile, receive the wall
smasher element.

Harvesters in specific have two special elements:
- The existing "amputating limbs" element, making them instantly rip a
limb off of any carbon they attack. As before, if they attempt this on a
carbon with no arms or legs, the harvester will hear Nar'Sie's call to
bring the victim to her.
- A new "wall walker" element, allowing them to walk through walls of
specified type (cult walls for harvesters) and allowing them to drag any
atom through as well.

Other than laying the groundwork, there's not much else here. I started
with Harvesters specifically because they are only ever
player-controlled, which makes things easy.

I'm not completely happy with the use of healing hands here - it gets
the job done, but currently loses a bit of the previous flavor (a
healing beam as a visual; printing the target's health in cult span). I
may extend it further to allow this behavior.

I've included an UpdatePaths script, even if these things shouldn't be
mapped, just in case something fucky is going on on a downstream. You
never know.

Constructs, currently, occupy _19_ spots on the simple animal list. This
is something close to 10% of all the remaining ones. Also, like
everything to do with cult, construct code is janky, old, and
desperately in need of updating. This is the first step.
:cl:
refactor: Harvester constructs have been updated to the basic mob
framework. This should have very little impact on their behavior, but
please report any issues.
/:cl:

TGUI Destructive Analyzer (#79572)

## About The Pull Request

I made this to help me move more towards my goals [laid out
here](https://hackmd.io/XLt5MoRvRxuhFbwtk4VAUA) which currently doesn't
have much interest.

This makes the Destructive Analyzer use a little neat TGUI menu instead
of its old HTML one. I also touch a lot of science stuff and a little
experimentor stuff, so let me explain a bit:
Old iterations of Science had different items that you can use to boost
nodes through deconstruction. This has been removed, and its only
feature is the auto-unlocking of nodes (that is; making them visible to
the R&D console). I thought that instead of keeping this deprecated code
around, I would rework it a little to make it clear what we actually use
it for (unhiding nodes).
All vars and procs that mentioned this have been renamed or reworked to
make more sense now.

Experimentor stuff shares a lot with the destructive analyzer, so I had
to mess with that a bit to keep its decayed corpse of deprecated code,
functional.

I also added context tips to the destructive analyzer, and added the
ability to AltClick to remove the inserted item. Removing items now also
plays a little sound because it was kinda lame.
Also, balloon alerts.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Moves a shitty machine to TGUI so it is slightly less shitty, now it's
more direct and compact with more player-feedback.
Helps me with a personal project and yea

### Video demonstration

I show off connecting the machine to R&D Servers, but I haven't changed
the behavior of that and the roundstart analyzers are connected to
servers by default.

Adds the Only the Lonely storyline

This piece includes:

Three NPCs: one TFable male named Augustus Drake, one perma-preg shortstack feline female called Kathy, and one macro female tauress dubbed Ava.

One TF: A tauric macro and BBW lite TF with a dash of multi-boob that functions like the slutty/horny dragon infection given by Christy.

One new area: Located in the dry plains, The Last Chance motel is a fast travel point and home to this piece's three NPCs. To find it, the player must either start the unusual creature questline for Matt, or complete Mouse’s first quest if they‘re playing the forgotten scenario. Then they must search the Dry Plains for the event Only the Lonely. This is to prevent early game rushing for the piece’s items and, or TF as well as ensuring the PC has a base understanding of the nanites.

Two new items: a gauss rifle that’s meant to serve as an upgrade to the pistol but lacks the first strike function of Stripe’s old gun and an extremely nourishing TG milk item.

Changelog:

Adds the line ‘now Only the Lonely is active;’ to line 436 Main Storyline in Stripes’ folder and line 740 Hospital in Wahn’s folder.

Adds a modified version of ‘felinoid cum’ to the alien felinoid loot entry on line 165 in Damaged’s file.

Added a 45% chance to loot felinoid cum from the alien felinoid see line 166 in Damaged’s file. I might lower the drop rate on this. However, I have less than fond memories of playing classic WoW and being told to collect ten bear hearts. Then spending the next ninety minutes of my life doing nothing but slaughtering bears who somehow don’t have hearts.

Modified the felinoid cum desc and stats due to inform creating multiple linked versions of the item in the player’s inventory. I don’t know why the game needs me to do this, but the fix seems to hold, so here we are. See line 1962 cum items in ‘core mechanics’ for the change.

Included ‘margay taur milk’ to line 4186 of the milk item list. Margay taur milk is essentially an estrogen pill plus food and water in milk form. It might need a nerf, but it’s super easy to negate the need for food and water in FS anyways.

Added ‘Include Last_Chance_Map by Sundered Dragon.’ to the locations section of story.ni on line 234.

Added ‘Include Margay Taur by Sundered Dragon.’ to the Monsters/Infections section of story.ni on line 594.

Added ‘Include Augustus_Drake by Sundered Dragon.’ to the NPC section of the story.ni line 758.

Added ‘Include Ava by Sundered Dragon.’ to the NPC section of the story.ni line 758.

Added ‘Include Kathy by Sundered Dragon.’ to the NPC section of the story.ni line 880.

Added Last Chance Parking Lot	"Last Chance Parking Lot"	"Last Chance Parking Lot"	"Dry Plains" to the Navigation file line 41 in core mechanics.

Bladists can now use silver *or* titanium while creating their blades (#78701)

## About The Pull Request

Blade Heretics can now use silver *or* titanium while creating their
blades.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Silver quite literally *only* exists on surgery tables. Being a blade
heretic with shit miners/roundstart means one of several things.

1. Wait for miners to come back with enough silver (They might never
come back or they might have not gotten any silver)

2. Go to lavaland to dig your own silver (Extremely time-consuming on
the antagonist role that has most downtime, death knell for latejoin
heretics)

All that is not even to mention that for some reason it takes two sheets
rather than one, and surgery tables give one silver when scavenged.

This all combined makes obtaining blades super annoying as the BLADE
path.

Now we can farm titanium off shuttles if the miners are jacking off or
dead, or if we joined 9 minutes to roundend.

[SDK][CMLIB] Implement log transaction writes & Resuscitation

=== DOCUMENTATION REMARKS ===

This implements (also enables some parts of code been decayed for years) the transacted writing of the registry. Transacted writing (or writing into registry in a transactional way) is an operation that ensures the successfulness can be achieved by monitoring two main points.
In CMLIB, such points are what we internally call them the primary and secondary sequences. A sequence is a numeric field that is incremented each time a writing operation (namely done with the FileWrite function and such) has successfully completed.

The primary sequence is incremented to suggest that the initial work of syncing the registry is in progress. During this phase, the base block header is written into the primary hive file and registry data is being written to said file in form of blocks. Afterwards the seconady sequence
is increment to report completion of the transactional writing of the registry. This operation occurs in HvpWriteHive function (invoked by HvSyncHive for syncing). If the transactional writing fails or if the lazy flushing of the registry fails, LOG files come into play.

Like HvpWriteHive, LOGs are updated by the HvpWriteLog which writes dirty data (base block header included) to the LOG themselves. These files serve for recovery and emergency purposes in case the primary machine hive has been damaged due to previous forced interruption of writing stuff into
the registry hive. With specific recovery algorithms, the data that's been gathered from a LOG will be applied to the primary hive, salvaging it. But if a LOG file is corrupt as well, then the system will perform resuscitation techniques by reconstructing the base block header to reasonable values,
reset the registry signature and whatnot.

This work is an inspiration from PR #3932 by mrmks04 (aka Max Korostil). I have continued his work by doing some more tweaks and whatnot. In addition to that, the whole transaction writing code is documented.

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===

HvpWriteLog -- Currently this function lacks the ability to grow the log file size since we pretty much lack the necessary code that deals with hive shrinking and log shrinking/growing as well. This part is not super critical for us so this shall be left as a TODO for future.

HvLoadHive -- Currently there's a hack that prevents us from refactoring this function in a proper way. That is, we should not be reading the whole and prepare the hive storage using HvpInitializeMemoryHive which is strictly used for HINIT_MEMORY but rather we must read the hive file block by block
and deconstruct the read buffer from the file so that we can get the bins that we read from the file. With the hive bins we got the hive storage will be prepared based on such bins. If one of the bins is corrupt, self healing is applied in such scenario.

For this matter, if in any case the hive we'll be reading is corrupt we could potentially read corrupt data and lead the system into failure. So we have to perform header and data recovery as well before reading the whole hive.

Adds the Inkwell-class Supply Freighter (#2385)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->
## Wait, isn't there a freeze right now?
Correct, there is a ship freeze currently, but I have received
permission from @Apogee-dev to create the PR for this vessel, as it was
a ship I've been working on since at least early-to-mid August.

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/653635cc-b83d-44d8-a9e3-384ffbd9367b)

If any other maptainer would like to overrule Apogee, I'd be more than
happy to temporarily close the PR. Until then, here it is!
## About The Pull Request
Hello everyone! Mr. SolGov here again to add yet another ship to be
tested!

This PR adds a completely new vessel, that being the **Inkwell-class
Supply Freighter**, a ship known for its vast cargo space!

![2023-10-13 13 54
57](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/9a70d97e-ab17-45af-a690-e528574b95cb)

With extra starter money, three sonnensöldners, and three miners,
players can enjoy completing bounties like no tomorrow, have drinks with
their crewmates in peace, and supply other SolGov vessels with much
needed equipment in less time than you can say "I ran out of ammo!"

Notable things in this ship include:
- Turrets (with IFF!)
- A bar!
- A full-blown cafeteria with a small kitchen and lounge!
- An office space for bureaucrats and scribes!
- Decently-sized quarters for the Logistics Deck Officer and Captain!
- A massive cargo bay with pre-existing supplies!
- A secret compartment for private storage!

And finally, as for jobs, there are:
- 1 Captain
- 1 Logistics Deck Officer
- 3 Sonnensöldneren
- 2 Space Engineers
- 3 Field Engineers
- 2 Bureaucrats
- 6 Scribes
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
More SolGov content is nice! Especially when it comes to ships, for a
faction that only has two existing at the moment, haha.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl: PositiveEntropy
add: The Solarian Port Authority Has Now Permitted Inkwell-class Vessels
To Explore The Stars!
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

Codifies male goats not having an udder (#79722)

## About The Pull Request

This was addressed in #78759 (1b1fde4908826ef5c54ffc0734e74028270af3fd)
and reviewed (and merged even though I didn't respond to it, oh well),
but I half-assed it because the whole point was to prevent male goats
from having an udder, but I only added it to the subtype of Pete i made
in that PR. Let's expand that to all male goats now.
## Why It's Good For The Game

It doesn't make biological nor morphological sense as to why a male goat
can provide milk. Ideally this should be like this for all animals
(because that's real life) but that's a later issue with further balance
implication.

I think it's still an interesting idea that Nanotrasen will just send
you any old goat despite it being "useless" beyond being very good at
eating plants. Maybe cargo should have a way to guarantee getting a
female goat in the future? It's just like real life where zoos and farms
have to constantly dealw ith female animals (such as giraffes or other
exotic stuff) tending to be far rarer/cost far more than their male
variants due to the potential to generate offspring (there's more nuance
to husbandry than this but just play along)... and in space, every
animal is "exotic".

It still remains possible to biogenerate milk, which tends to be far
faster than feeding/milking goats- which is something that the cook
should have access to anyways.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Male Goats should no longer spawn with an udder, instead of it
just being Pete.

Basic Guardians/Holoparasites (#79473)

Fixes #79485
Fixes #77552

Converts Guardians (aka Holoparasites) into Basic Mobs.
Changes a bunch of their behaviours into actions or components which we
can reuse.
Replaces some verbs it would give to you and hide in the status panel
with action buttons that you may be able to find more quickly.

They _**should**_ work basically like they did before but a bit
smoother. It is not unlikely that I made some changes by accident or
just by changing framework though.

My one creative touch was adding random name suggestions.
The Wizard federation have a convention of naming their arcane spirit
guardians by combining a colour and a major arcana of the tarot. The
Syndicate of course won't truck with any of that mystical claptrap and
for their codenames use the much more sensible construction of a colour
and a gamepiece.

This lets you be randomly assigned such creative names as "Sparkling
Hermit", "Bloody Queen", "Blue World", or "Purple Diamond".
You can of course still ignore this entirely and type "The Brapmaster"
into the box if so desired.

I made _one_ other intentional change, which is to swap to Mothblocks'
nice leash component instead of instantly teleporting guardians back to
you when they are pulled out of the edge of their range. They should now
be "dragged" along behind you until they can't path, at which point they
will teleport. This should make the experience a bit less disorienting,
you have the recall button if you _want_ to instantly catch up.

This is unfortunately a bumper-sized PR because it did not seem
plausible to not do all of it at once, but I can make a project branch
for atomisation if people think this is too much of a pain in the ass to
review.

Other changes:
- Some refactoring to how the charge action works so I could
individually override "what you can hit" and "what happens when you hit"
instead of those being the same proc
- Lightning Guardian damage chain is now a component
- Explosive Guardian explosive trap is now a component
- Added even more arguments to the Healing Touch component to allow it
to heal tox/oxy damage and require a specific click modifier
- Life Link component which implements the Guardian behaviour of using
another mob as your health bar
- Moved some stuff about deciding what guardians look and are described
like into a theming datum
- Added a generic proc which can return whether your mob is meant to
apply some kind of damage multiplier to a certain damage type. It's not
perfect because I couldn't figure out how ot cram limb modifiers in
there, which is where most of it is on carbons. Oh well.
- Riders of vehicles now inherit all movement traits of those vehicles,
so riding a charging holoparasite will let you cross chasms. Also works
if you piggyback someone with wings, probably.

:cl:
refactor: Guardians/Powerminers/Holoparasites now use the basic mob
framework. Please report any unexpected changes or behaviour.
qol: The verbs used to communicate with, recall, or banish your Guardian
are now action buttons.
balance: If (as a Guardian) your host moves slightly out of range you
will now be dragged back into range if possible, rather than being
instantly teleported to them.
balance: Protectors now have a shorter leash range rather than a longer
one, in order to more easily take advantage of their ability to drag
their charge out of danger.
balance: Ranged Guardians can now hold down the mouse button to fire
automatically.
balance: People riding vehicles or other mobs now inherit all of their
movement traits, so riding a flying mob (or vehicle, if we have any of
those) will allow you to cross chasms and lava safely.

Basic skeletons (#79206)

Turns skeletons (the simple animal version) into basic mobs. This was
another incredibly simple conversion, since skeletons don't really do
anything but walk at you and beat you to death.

Because I thought it was funny, though, skeletons will now seek out
cartons of milk and drink them. Real milk will heal them for a
significant amount, but soymilk, being false milk, will deal them
grievous injury instead! Skeletons beware... I didn't add any other
sorts of milk due to limited ability with existing AI behaviors to
identify milk containers (they actually only look for the carton items).

Other than that, I've done some flavor adjustment for skeletons' attacks
- their effects and sounds will now suit the weapon they're actually
holding - for example, skeleton templars now actually use their swords
instead of slashing you with their horrible fingers. Along with this I
gave the basic skeletons a normal slashing sound, instead of the weird,
impactless hallucination sound they used to use for some reason. I never
liked that sound.

Finally, I've reflavored the spear-wielding skeleton mobs to "undead
settlers", following the naming of the corpses dropped by snow legions
as of #76898, rather than being named after an offensive term for Inuit
people. These skeletons do, after all, appear in settlements on alien
worlds.

To enable the flavor of milk drinking, I expanded the `basic_eating`
component to allow drinking rather than eating flavor, with a different
sound and its own set of verbs. This deletes whatever they drink from,
but c'est la vie.

Ticks 6 more entries off the simple animal freeze. While skeletons are
still extremely simple, being largely-identical mobs that only exist to
beat you to death, being basic mobs should make them slightly better at
this job. Also, again, I think it's really funny that you can distract
skeleton mobs with milk, or even hurt them.
:cl:
refactor: Hostile skeleton NPCs now use the basic mob framework. They're
a little smarter, and they also have a slightly improved set of attack
effects and sounds. They love to drink milk, but will be harmed greatly
if any heartless spaceman tricks them into drinking soymilk instead.
Please report any bugs.

Basic drones (#79109)

Fixes #68825
Fixes #72249
Fixes #70184

Converts maintenance drones to use the basic mob framework. As drones
don't use AI, this was mostly a perfunctory conversion, but I took the
opportunity to clean up drone code a bit and fixed a few bugs.

Noteworthy changes:
- Drones now have a `can_unhack` field. This is set to FALSE on
syndrones, because unhacking them doesn't make them stop being evil but
does cause some weirdness. Syndrones are unused right now, but you never
know.
- Drones use the Dextrous component for hand-having.
- Drones no longer have an internal ID card, instead being given
all-access with the `simple_access` component.
- Picking up drones now works the same as for other mobs, instead of
pointlessly copying the code into `attack_hand`. As a consequence, it is
now possible to punch drones if you want to for some reason.
- Drones can now reboot/cannibalize dead drones without being in combat
mode.
- Cannibalizing a drone that contains a client no longer runtimes - the
client is ghosted ahead of time.
- Drones now have TRAIT_ADVANCEDTOOLUSER, allowing them to properly
interact with machines.
- Trying to screwdriver a dead drone now gives a balloon alert about why
you can't do that.

In addition to these changes, I cleaned up the code quite a bit,
organizing things better and placing more useful comments throughout.
And removing a hell of a lot of single-letter variable names.

I will note that this PR does _not_ address #72129. The issue there is
that sprites for drones-as-hats are entirely nonexistent, and I'm not a
spriter. It shouldn't be too hard to fix if someone makes dronehat
sprites, though!

Kills 8 more simple animals.

In addition to that, drones were clearly a bit neglected, so this fixes
them up a bit and makes the code a little bit clearer. Maybe not that
much clearer, but it's something. It certainly leaves them in a better
place for further work if anyone wants to do that. Plus, a bunch of bugs
and other jankiness are fixed now, which is nice.

:cl:
refactor: Maintenance Drones now use the basic mob framework. This
shouldn't come with any noticeable gameplay changes, but please report
any bugs.
fix: Drones can now interact normally with electrified doors.
fix: Drones' built-in tools can no longer be placed in storage objects
and/or thrown on the floor.
fix: Drones can now perform right-click interactions correctly, such as
deconstructing reinforced windows.
fix: Drones can now reboot or cannibalize other drones without being in
combat mode.

Pipe painting, spraycan preset colors (#79521)

![dreamseeker_AZs0erdnrs](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/06a12d22-387b-4a33-8b61-59bbe3495c82)

## About The Pull Request

Made pipe painter properly paint pipe colors, work on pipe items, and
added the same functionality to regular spraycans.

Spraycans now have the color presets in UI for easier selection of the
valid pipe colors.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Bug fixing is good.
It was weird that spraycans couldn't paint pipes, but some other device
could.
Also custom spraycan color is too clunky, presets are nice for quick
spraycan color selection.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: fixed pipe painter not applying pipe color properly
qol: made spraycans work also as pipe painters
qol: spraycans now have basic color presets for quick selection

Does Penance So The Ghosts Go Away (#2442)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may

<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull

## About The Pull Request

"This is AI c-Caldwell - Reporting return of essential station functions
to Minya League Installation 'Trifuge' following pirate attack -
**///far too long ago///** - All vessels are invited to dock and partake
of our services, including an active Ore Refinery, world class bar, and
purchasable storefronts **//please come, I'm so lonely///** The Minya
League, and myself, would like to extend our gratitude to **///-who else
but me?///**. Installation 'Trifuge' is located in orbit of the Star
'Anselhome', at the L5 point of Anselhome and habitable world, 'Hofud'.
Noting active travel advisory - Hofud is currently **///nothing but ash
left by monsters///**. Independent Vessels are advised to avoid landing
until Minya League Ships can deliver disaster relief to the planet
**///not that they'll be coming....///**"

"This message will repeat in approximately 20 galactic standard minutes"

Remaps the shitty outpost 1 (indie space) outpost that I made like 6
months ago. it sucks. Anyone who doesn't think it sucks probably has
stockholm symdromed themselves into liking it. Also this one has lore
and room for expansion.
It's main features are: 
- Decent amount of maint for outpost antics
- REASONABLE amount of storefronts
-abandoned feel
- bar
- Ore refinery so my holy mandate can be implemented when I decide I'm
done with my break.

## Why It's Good For The Game
I'd like the voices in my walls to stop whispering to me about the
horrific mistakes I've made. They seem pretty upset about this one.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would

## Changelog

:cl: Erika Fox
add: Outpost 1 has been remapped into something fathomably less ass.
It's a bit smaller, probably, but I'm going to call that a good thing.
add: random number spawner. It's good for hull numbers that shouldn't be
static.
imageadd: a really bad sprite for a service directions sign.
add: Another elevator template (coincidentally demonstrating how that
system works in code)

Massive Ruin Fixes + Removals PR (#2334)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
This PR is made so I can stop getting angry at the ruins beyond saving
that are still ingame. My criteria for a ruin being removed is if
another ruin already does its niche better, if the ruin is outdated
and/or the ruin is excessively small or unbalanced. For ruins that dont
meet this criteria but are still outdated, they will be getting balance
fixes and touch ups or a total remap.

This PR is a draft for now because I will need to update the PR
changelog and description as I make changes and communicate with the
maptainers on what stays and what goes.

Adds departmental RND lootdrop spawners for circuit imprinters,
protolathes and techfabs. Excludes omnisci and basic boards from the
drops.
Fixed a space tile under a door and replaced the omnilathe with a
medical lathe on dangerousresearch
Fixed the whitesands saloon not spawning which may have caused some
sandplanets to spawn without a ruin
Fixed harmfactory's nonfunctional traps to now be as lethal as intended.
Also changed the loot in the vault to better reflect the ruin's theme
and difficulty (cargo techfab board instead of omnilathe, adv plasma
cutter instead of combat medkit, less gold more cash, kept the cyberarm
implant).
Fixed provinggrounds magical SMES FINALLY by adding a terminal on the
back. The map should finally function as intended.
Fixed a few dirs on fire extinguisher cabinets and blast door assemblies
in singularity_lab
Removed mechtransport.dmm for being small and bad
Removed some leftover gasthelizards.dmm cruft (VILE)
Removed nucleardump for being an utter mess of an oldcode ruin
Removed gondolaasteroid for being large and empty besides gondolas.
better suited for a jungle planet IMO.
Removed Jungle_Spider. Literally just a box with spiders and cloning
equipment. Small, bad, hard to find, unjustified loot.
Removed Golem_Hijack. Like jungle spider but it was free rnd, an AI
core, a full BSRPED and three golem corpses. With no enemies or
obstacles.
Removed rockplanet_clock for being a tiny lootbox that doesnt fit with
the lore. Also had a quantumn pad.
Removed whitesands_surface_youreinsane. Its a silly little reference to
an old event that unfortunately resulted in a subpar ruin. Could return
as a wasteplanet greeble ruin, but it has to go for now.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Normally I'm all for remapping instead of removing ruins, but some ruins
are very much beyond saving. Clearing out space for better ruins to take
the spotlight is always nice. Some older ruins are fine but are missing
certain things or have loot that worked fine in the past, but doesn't
reflect the balance we want for ruins in the present.

I will be PR'ing ruins to replace the ones I remove.
