Heretic Knock Path (#78108)

## About The Pull Request

other changes: GODMODEd mobs cannot receive embeds or bleed, admins can
now use the traitor panel to give heretics a focus

adds a new heretic path, the path of knock
its a path about opening shit and having access
wound opening included, and stealing
this is its award icon

![ascended](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/01473bf2-5c44-4574-850c-83fb5db204fd)
its knowledge is as follows:

### A Locksmith’s Secret
starting knowledge, unlocks the key blade which also works as a crowbar


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/3690232d-5687-4b0c-a9cc-b6374e7f1850

### Grasp of Knock
it literally just opens stuff (also makes a knocking sound)
unbolts bolted airlocks and opens them, opens locked closets, opens
mechas, logs you into consoles
(comms consoles are with barebones head-level access, no buying shuttle,
but hey you can shitpost over comms)
Sidepaths: Ashen Eyes, Codex Cicatrix


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/8b890d69-ee03-4d12-99dd-dde7b4483cd4

### Key Keepers Burden
transmute a rod,wallet, and some id card to create an eldritch id card
(very original naming), the ID card used is not preserved
this ID card functions essentially as a superior agent card, using other
IDs on it makes it be consumed by the eldritch ID and have its accesses
and forms added into it, you can use it inhand to turn it into any of
the cards that were consumed
in addition you can hit two airlocks with it to link them together to
create portals under the doors, which has a green glow
going through the portal as a Heretic gets you to the other destination
going through as a nonheretic lands you in a random onstation airlock,
SM chamber included if youre unlucky
1 id card can only have 1 set of portals, making another destroys the
former set, one of the airlocks being destroyed also destroys them


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/e96a518e-b35d-44aa-9a7c-8f2103feab6f

### Rite Of Passage
transmute a white crayon, a multitool, and a plank to create consecrated
lintel
heretics can use this cool looking book to create a 8 second shield that
knocks back any nonheretic that tries to pass
also its ranged


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/036e0875-c422-433e-87b3-71328cb2bf8a

### Mark Of Knock
the mansus grasp will now mark its victim for like 10 seconds
marked victims are denied access by all objects, public airlocks
included


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/6187ef36-30f4-4a92-af21-e5b288afb869

### Burglars Finesse
steal a random item from the victims backpack (or other storage item if
they dont have a backpack) and puts it into your hand
the victim will probably hear you and also gets a chat message about
this



https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/2529fa78-616d-4a46-ae18-3cb22efb1ab1

### Ritual of knowledge
this is nothing new i put this here to keep it in order

### Apetra Vulnera (sidepath with flesh)
the victim receives bleed wounds on every single bodypart that has more
than 15 brute
if they dont have a bodypart that has >= 15 brute they get a random
wound anyway so
side paths are: blood siphon and void cloak



https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/3c2cd21e-edbc-4956-8c2d-cd9a42b87f33

### Wave of Desperation (sidepath with flesh)
cannot be casted uncuffed with no bola, can be casted cuffed with no
bola, with a bola and no cuffs
adjacent mobs are knocked down, mobs are repulsed away, your cuffs and
bola are destroyed, and you gain a status effect that:
after 12 seconds makes you unconscious for 20 seconds
5 min cooldown


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/da480921-d5dd-4b46-b2e8-0cf543640bf9

### Opening Blade
your blade has a 35% chance to cause a weeping avulsion on hit


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/b6fd2837-6b0a-4a5a-bc7b-b9c3f7f715d1

### Caretakers Last Refuge
you can only cast this when not near sentient living beings
while in refuge you are invincible and near transparent, cannot use your
hands or spells
also immune to damage slowdown, being hit with a null rod cancels this
also if you lose your focus you get out of refuge


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/f053cfd8-2a16-4195-8004-17df077983ca



https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/72330486-5273-4123-a108-b437b56120c4

### Many secrets behind the Spider Door (Ascension)
ritual needs 3 bodies without organs in their chest
when successfully performed you ascend and;
open a tear in reality (not the BoH one) which;
Polls all ghosts with sentient mob enabled to spawn and siege the
station, ghosts can interact with the portal to spawn as a random
eldritch mob
spawned mobs are loyal to whoever ascended and on examine can identify
their master
also fills the entire room with purple light

also the heretics opening blade is upgraded to a 65% chance, and they
gain Ascended Shapeshift which allows them to shapeshift into eldritch
mobs, and its not 1 choice only



https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/8d06286e-789d-442f-b33c-878d26deab07

and stuff

[MIRROR] Only double HCR for impressive greentexts [MDB IGNORE] (#23778)

* Only double HCR for impressive greentexts (#78383)

There were a few exploits with free antags that would double your score.
This happened to me once by accident, but anyone could essentially
guarantee a point doubling.

I've changed the whole thing to only work for:
- Traitor
- Changeling
- Heretic
- Blood brother
- Headrev
- Wizard (you could get this with die of fate)
- Obsessed
- Magic and gun survivalists
- Holding the greentext book (because a cripple fighting for their life
for the greentext just seems funny and is rare enough)

Notably, revolutionairies, cult converts and brainwashed now no longer
pay out. Cult is pointless since you can't greentext without gibbing
(trust me I tried) and revolutionairy takes no effort other than having
strong teammates and doing nothing. There are a lot of other antags this
excludes, but those are mostly midrounds and non-humans (which are by
default excluded)

:cl:
balance: Only traitor, changeling, heretic, blood brother, headrev,
wizard, obsessed, magic/gun survivalists and greentext book holders can
now double their hardcore random score
qol: Redtexting as antag with hardcore random score will pay you default
points, instead of none (normal survival rules)
fix: End report screen will properly report hardcore random survival in
case of station destruction

* Only double HCR for impressive greentexts

dict updates

Primarily reshuffling the j/ch/sh conundrum.

basically, previously:
a) we had the letter j pronounced like in "jam"
b) the sound 'sh' in foreign words was assumed to be transliterated with the 's'

however, having just one extremely arbitrary affricate didn't actually make sense, but putting every sh/j/ch/etc sound with the 's' would make transliterating Mandarin a literal fucking nightmare (and it was already difficult), so we added/replaced j with the 'sh' sound, transliterated to a x because x is a weird stupid letter that no one knows how to pronounce anyway. and it's an 'sh' in pinyin anyway.

So I had to go back and fix all the transliterations this fucked up, repick words for all the newly formed duplicates, and just generally fuck with stuff.

[MIRROR] Gun kits don't need cable coil or tools, halved crafting time [MDB IGNORE] (#23802)

* Gun kits don't need cable coil or tools, halved crafting time (#78419)

## About The Pull Request

Crafting R&D guns from gun kits no longer requires tools or cable coil.
The decloner and energy crossbow still need reagents.

Halved R&D gun crafting time. 20->10 seconds.

## Why It's Good For The Game

These changes were made a long, long while ago and honestly while I
understand gun kits I don't understand why it was made So. Annoying. To
make the fucking guns once you got everything ready. It makes it a total
annoyance. You spent 40 minutes getting all the tech for it, you
shouldn't have to also get tools and cables and wait 20 seconds standing
still.

Anyone who has played ingame like any time after that change can attest
how underused any R&D gun is now. X-ray laser guns still DESTROY blobs
but people don't even THINK about them because of the dumb annoying
recipe (alongside RnD being a pain now).

Simply put this just. Makes life easier for security officers. And
reduces tool dependency.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Crafting R&D guns from gun kits no longer requires tools or cable
coil. The decloner and energy crossbow still need reagents.
qol: Halved R&D gun crafting time. 20->10 seconds.

[MIRROR] Rounded supermatter delamination times to 5 seconds, restored old mood messages [MDB IGNORE] (#23801)

* Rounded supermatter delamination times to 5 seconds, restored old mood messages (#78335)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Makes the supermatter delaminate in 15 seconds instead of 13 and 5
seconds instead of 3 if a sliver has been taken from it, mainly to
please perfectionists (me and some others who commented on the PR) as
well as giving people at least a chance to escape delam round removal.

I don't like it when flavorful text is replaced by bland and
not-as-funny alternatives.
Also, how the hell is it gamey for staff to know the engineers are in
charge of the power?
It's honestly more gamey for them to know what a resonance cascade or
supermatter delamination is, so I'd say you've done the opposite of what
the goal was with the message changes on top of making them less fun in
general. I disapprove.

Oh, yeah, and the SM now reports the times correctly due to it reporting
them every 5 seconds, meaning people would only see the 10 second
announcement. Now there is going to be a 15 second announcement as well.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

Watering down messages to be bland is just, like, less fun, ya know?
I didn't see a single person in support of the message changes apart
from the PR author, everyone else was just complaining about them,
including myself.

Also, several people mentioned the fact it could just be 15 instead of
13 for a nice round number, including myself. I also made the sliver
delamination time 5 seconds instead of 3 seconds because you pretty much
can't get out in time, especially if the game is laggy. 3 - 5 people
being round removed because of one traitor objective with no chance to
escape it is just bad gameplay.

Oh, and, bugfix good, I suppose.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
balance: Supermatter now takes 15 seconds to delaminate normally and 5
if a sliver has been taken from it. Gives a little more time to escape
in the case of the sliver and also evens out the times to please
perfectionists.
fix: Supermatter now accurately reports it's detonation time.
spellcheck: Supermatter mood descriptions have been reverted back to
their old, more flavorful selves.
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

ZEN: Implement zen-tune v4.20 over v4.14-arm64

4.9:
In a surprising turn of events, while benchmarking and testing
hierarchical scheduling with BFQ + writeback throttling, it turns out
that raising the number of requests in queue _actually_ improves
responsiveness and completely eliminates the random stalls that would
normally occur without hierarchical scheduling.

To make this test more intense, I used the following test:

Rotational disk1: rsync -a /source/of/data /target/to/disk1
Rotational disk2: rsync -a /source/of/data /target/to/disk2

And periodically attempted to write super fast with:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/target/to/disk1/block bs=4096

This wrote 10gb incredibly fast to writeback and I encountered zero
stalls through this entire test of 10-15 minutes.

My suspicion is that with cgroups, BFQ is more able to properly sort
among multiple drives, reducing the chance of a starved process.  This
plus writeback throttling completely eliminate any outstanding bugs with
high writeback ratios, letting the user enjoy low latency writes
(application thinks they're already done), and super high throughput due
to batched writes in writeback.

Please note however, without the following configuration, I cannot
guarantee you will not get stalls:

CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ=y
CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_BFQ=y
CONFIG_BFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED=y
CONFIG_DEFAULT_BFQ=y
CONFIG_SCSI_MQ_DEFAULT=n

Special thanks to h2, author of smxi and inxi, for providing evidence
that a configuration specific to Debian did not cause stalls found the
Liquorix kernels under heavy IO load.  This specific configuration
turned out to be hierarchical scheduling on CFQ (thus, BFQ as well).

4.10:
During some personal testing with the Dolphin emulator, MuQSS has
serious problems scaling its frequencies causing poor performance where
boosting the CPU frequencies would have fixed them.  Reducing the
up_threshold to 45 with MuQSS appears to fix the issue, letting the
introduction to "Star Wars: Rogue Leader" run at 100% speed versus about
80% on my test system.

Also, lets refactor the definitions and include some indentation to help
the reader discern what the scope of all the macros are.

4.11:
Increase MICRO_FREQUENCY_UP_THRESHOLD from 95 to 85
Increase MIN_FREQUENCY_UP_THRESHOLD from 11 to 6

These changes should help make using CFS feel a bit more responsive when
working with mostly idle workloads, browsing the web, scrolling through
text, etc.

Increasing the minimum frequency up threshold to 6% may be too
aggressive though.  Will revert this setting if it causes significant
battery drain.

4.12:
Make bfq the default MQ scheduler

Reduce default sampling down factor from 10 to 1

With the world eventually moving to a more laptop heavy configuration,
it's getting more important that we can reduce our frequencies quickly
after performing work.  This is normal with a ton of background
processes that need to perform burst work then sleep.

Since this doesn't really impact performance too much, lets not keep it
part of ZEN_INTERACTIVE.

Some time ago, the minimum frequency up threshold was set to 1 by
default, but the zen configuration was never updated to take advantage
of it.

Remove custom MIN_FREQUENCY_UP_THRESHOLD for MuQSS / ZEN_INTERACTIVE
configurations and make 1 the default for all choices.

4.18:
Prefer bfq-mq when available if zen interactive is enabled

The bfq-mq elevator is typically one major kernel version ahead in
optimizations and bug fixes due to early access patches in the
algodev/bfq-mq github repository.  Since these patches are typically low
risk and almost always improve performance and/or increase stability,
prefer bfq-mq over bfq when available.

Switch from MuQSS to PDS-mq.

4.19:
Switch from PDS-mq back to MuQSS

4.20:
During some experimentation to influence MuQSS into consolidating strong
single threaded workloads to single cores, I found that the up_threshold
just ends up forcing all cores to run at a higher frequency.

Instead, raising up_threshold back to defaults (95 with micro sampling),
and raising the sampling down factor to 5, the individual cores MuQSS
selects (typically the first few), tend to properly stick to their max
speed and because they complete their tasks faster, MuQSS selects them
again to for the earliest eligible deadline, causing a reciprocal cycle
that improves single thread performance.

Completely fair scheduler (CFS), never really had this issue, but we'll
leave sampling down factor high with CONFIG_ZEN_INTERACTIVE since it'll
benefit CFS users that want higher performance anyway.

Raise minimum CFS latency to 4ms to match 250hz configs.
Raise minimum MuQSS latency to 4ms to match 250hz configs.

Use [defer+madvise] as default khugepaged defrag strategy:

For some reason, the default strategy to respond to THP fault fallbacks
is still just madvise, meaning stall if the program wants transparent
hugepages, but don't trigger a background reclaim / compaction if THP
begins to fail allocations.  This creates a snowball affect where we
still use the THP code paths, but we almost always fail once a system
has been active and busy for a while.

The option "defer" was created for interactive systems where THP can
still improve performance.  If we have to fallback to a regular page due
to an allocation failure or anything else, we will trigger a background
reclaim and compaction so future THP attempts succeed and previous
attempts eventually have their smaller pages combined without stalling
running applications.

We still want madvise to stall applications that explicitely want THP,
so defer+madvise _does_ make a ton of sense.  Make it the default for
interactive systems, especially if the kernel maintainer left
transparent hugepages on "always".

Reasoning and details in the original patch: https://lwn.net/Articles/711248/

Add a scheduler even to multi-queue block devices:
We prefer interactivity to throughput and want BFQ if possible.

xfs: reserve less log space when recovering log intent items

Wengang Wang reports that a customer's system was running a number of
truncate operations on a filesystem with a very small log.  Contention
on the reserve heads lead to other threads stalling on smaller updates
(e.g.  mtime updates) long enough to result in the node being rebooted
on account of the lack of responsivenes.  The node failed to recover
because log recovery of an EFI became stuck waiting for a grant of
reserve space.  From Wengang's report:

"For the file deletion, log bytes are reserved basing on
xfs_mount->tr_itruncate which is:

    tr_logres = 175488,
    tr_logcount = 2,
    tr_logflags = XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES,

"You see it's a permanent log reservation with two log operations (two
transactions in rolling mode).  After calculation (xlog_calc_unit_res()
adds space for various log headers), the final log space needed per
transaction changes from  175488 to 180208 bytes.  So the total log
space needed is 360416 bytes (180208 * 2).  [That quantity] of log space
(360416 bytes) needs to be reserved for both run time inode removing
(xfs_inactive_truncate()) and EFI recover (xfs_efi_item_recover())."

In other words, runtime pre-reserves 360K of space in anticipation of
running a chain of two transactions in which each transaction gets a
180K reservation.

Now that we've allocated the transaction, we delete the bmap mapping,
log an EFI to free the space, and roll the transaction as part of
finishing the deferops chain.  Rolling creates a new xfs_trans which
shares its ticket with the old transaction.  Next, xfs_trans_roll calls
__xfs_trans_commit with regrant == true, which calls xlog_cil_commit
with the same regrant parameter.

xlog_cil_commit calls xfs_log_ticket_regrant, which decrements t_cnt and
subtracts t_curr_res from the reservation and write heads.

If the filesystem is fresh and the first transaction only used (say)
20K, then t_curr_res will be 160K, and we give that much reservation
back to the reservation head.  Or if the file is really fragmented and
the first transaction actually uses 170K, then t_curr_res will be 10K,
and that's what we give back to the reservation.

Having done that, we're now headed into the second transaction with an
EFI and 180K of reservation.  Other threads apparently consumed all the
reservation for smaller transactions, such as timestamp updates.

Now let's say the first transaction gets written to disk and we crash
without ever completing the second transaction.  Now we remount the fs,
log recovery finds the unfinished EFI, and calls xfs_efi_recover to
finish the EFI.  However, xfs_efi_recover starts a new tr_itruncate
tranasction, which asks for 360K log reservation.  This is a lot more
than the 180K that we had reserved at the time of the crash.  If the
first EFI to be recovered is also pinning the tail of the log, we will
be unable to free any space in the log, and recovery livelocks.

Wengang confirmed this:

"Now we have the second transaction which has 180208 log bytes reserved
too. The second transaction is supposed to process intents including
extent freeing.  With my hacking patch, I blocked the extent freeing 5
hours. So in that 5 hours, 180208 (NOT 360416) log bytes are reserved.

"With my test case, other transactions (update timestamps) then happen.
As my hacking patch pins the journal tail, those timestamp-updating
transactions finally use up (almost) all the left available log space
(in memory in on disk).  And finally the on disk (and in memory)
available log space goes down near to 180208 bytes.  Those 180208 bytes
are reserved by [the] second (extent-free) transaction [in the chain]."

Wengang and I noticed that EFI recovery starts a transaction, completes
one step of the chain, and commits the transaction without completing
any other steps of the chain.  Those subsequent steps are completed by
xlog_finish_defer_ops, which allocates yet another transaction to
finish the rest of the chain.  That transaction gets the same tr_logres
as the head transaction, but with tr_logcount = 1 to force regranting
with every roll to avoid livelocks.

In other words, we already figured this out in commit 929b92f64048d
("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction
reservation"), but should have applied that logic to each intent item's
recovery function.  For Wengang's case, the xfs_trans_alloc call in the
EFI recovery function should only be asking for a single transaction's
worth of log reservation -- 180K, not 360K.

Quoting Wengang again:

"With log recovery, during EFI recovery, we use tr_itruncate again to
reserve two transactions that needs 360416 log bytes.  Reserving 360416
bytes fails [stalls] because we now only have about 180208 available.

"Actually during the EFI recover, we only need one transaction to free
the extents just like the 2nd transaction at RUNTIME.  So it only needs
to reserve 180208 rather than 360416 bytes.  We have (a bit) more than
180208 available log bytes on disk, so [if we decrease the reservation
to 180K] the reservation goes and the recovery [finishes].  That is to
say: we can fix the log recover part to fix the issue. We can introduce
a new xfs_trans_res xfs_mount->tr_ext_free

{
  tr_logres = 175488,
  tr_logcount = 0,
  tr_logflags = 0,
}

"and use tr_ext_free instead of tr_itruncate in EFI recover."

However, I don't think it quite makes sense to create an entirely new
transaction reservation type to handle single-stepping during log
recovery.  Instead, we should copy the transaction reservation
information in the xfs_mount, change tr_logcount to 1, and pass that
into xfs_trans_alloc.  We know this won't risk changing the min log size
computation since we always ask for a fraction of the reservation for
all known transaction types.

This looks like it's been lurking in the codebase since commit
3d3c8b5222b92, which changed the xfs_trans_reserve call in
xlog_recover_process_efi to use the tr_logcount in tr_itruncate.
That changed the EFI recovery transaction from making a
non-XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for one transaction's worth of log
space to a XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for two transactions worth.

Fixes: 3d3c8b5222b92 ("xfs: refactor xfs_trans_reserve() interface")
Complements: 929b92f64048d ("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction reservation")

Add positive source filter

Source filtering is a really cool Nix feature that lets us avoid a
lot of rebuilds, which speeds up the iteration cycle a lot in cases
where the relevant source files aren't actually modified.

We used to have a source filter that marked a few files as irrelevant,
but this is the wrong approach, as we have many more files that are
irrelevant. We may call this negative filtering.

This commit switches the source filtering to positive filtering, which
is a lot more robust. Instead of marking which files we don't need
we marked the files that we do need.

It's a superior approach because it is fail safe. Instead of allowing
build performance problems to creep in over time, we require that all
source inputs are declared.

I shouldn't have to explain that declaring inputs is a good practice,
so I'll stop over-explaining here.

I do have to acknowledge that this will cause a build failure when the
filter is incomplete. This is *good*, because it's the only realistic
way we could be reminded of these problems. These events will be
infrequent, so the small cost of extending the filter is worth it,
compared to the hidden cost of longer dev cycles for things like tests,
docker image, etc, etc.

(Also rebuilding Nix for stupid unnecessary reasons makes my blood boil)

Update shot_adaptive to not mutate device shots (#4599)

**Context:**
`shot_adaptive.py` would change device wires, run a QNode with the
device, then change the wires back. We can just run the QNode with
different shots without changing the device!

**Description of the Change:**
Instead of changing device shots, pass `shots=new_shots` as a kwarg to
any QNode execution.

I also removed a silly test for something hacky that users probably
should not even be able to do... it's not that hard to add
`@qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit", shots=1000))` to the top of any
function : )

**Benefits:**
- It will work on the new device API without any changes (I ran the
tests locally with DQ2, worked perfectly)
- No more unnecessary try-finally blocks
- Not mutating object properties is always cool and wise

convert the eyeball a basic monster [MDB IGNORE] (#23043)

* convert the eyeball a basic monster (#77411)

## About The Pull Request
I have created a basic eyeball monster with new abilities and behaviors.
The eyeball has a unique power that allows it to glare at humans and
make them slow for a short period. However, this ability only works if
the human can see the eyeball monster. If a person is blind or unable to
see the eyeball, the ability won't affect them. Also, if someone turns
their back to the eyeball, it cannot use the ability on them. But be
cautious because the eyeball will try to position itself in front of the
person's face to use its power.

The eyeball is hostile towards all humans except for the blind ones and
those with significant eye damage. It has a compassionate side too, as
it loves to help people with eye damage by providing small healing to
their eyes.

Furthermore, the eyeball has a fondness for eating carrots, which not
only satisfies its appetite but also grants it a small health boost. To
add to its appearance, I've given it a new, larger, and scarier sprite.
However, I am open to changing it back to the old sprite if the player
prefers it that way.

Additionally, the eyeball displays emotions, and if you hit it, it will
cry tears as a sign of pain or sadness.

## Why It's Good For The Game
the eyeball now have more depth and character to his behavier.

## Changelog

Refactors Morphs into Basic Mobs (there is now a swag action for morphification) [MDB IGNORE] (#23046)

* Refactors Morphs into Basic Mobs (there is now a swag action for morphification) (#77503)

## About The Pull Request

I was bored, so did this. Probably one of the neatest refactors I've
done, sorry if there's some oddities because I was experimenting with
some other stuff in this so just tell me to clean them up whenever I
can.

Anyways, morphs are basic mobs now. We are able to easily refactor the
whole "eat items and corpses" stuff in the basic mob framework, but the
whole "morph into objects and people" turned out to be a bit trickier.
That was easily rectified with a datum mob cooldown action and
copy-pasting the old code into that code, as well as doing some nice
stuff with traits and signals to ensure the one-way communication from
the action to the mob.

Old Morph AI didn't seem to be existant whatsoever, they inappropriately
leveraged some old procs and I have no idea how to make it work with new
AI. They DEFINITELY don't spawn outside of admin interference/ the event
anymore, and will always be controlled by a player, so this shouldn't be
too bad of an issue. I gave them something to seem alive just in case
though, but I think adding legitimate prop-hunt AI would be such a
laborious task that I am unwilling to do it in this PR.
## Why It's Good For The Game

If admins want to add the ability for Ian to assume the form of the HoP,
they can do that now! The datum action cooldown is quite nice for simple
and basic mobs... but it is currently not compatible with carbons. That
is not within scope for this PR, but I am dwelling on ways to extend it
to carbon but they all sound really awfully bad.

Also morphs are smarter, and we tick another simple animal in need of
refactoring off the list.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Morphs are now basic mobs with a nice new ability to help you
change forms rather than the old shift-click method, much more
intuitive.
admin: With the morph rework comes a new ability you can add to mobs,
"Assume Form". Feel free to add that to any simple or basic mob for le
funnies as Runtime turns into a pen or something.
/:cl:

~~Does anyone know if there's a (sane) way to alias a cooldown action as
a keypress? I can't think of a good way to retain the old shift-click
functionality, because that does feel _kinda_ nice, but I think it can
be lived without.~~ I added it. Kinda fugly but whatever.

* SPECIES NUKING 2023: Head flags 3 & Knuckles: Fixes some growing pains with head flags  (#76440)

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/76422
This was caused by me somehow not using the wrapper there and not
noticing it

Also fixes hair gradients and facial hair gradients. I am pretty sure
they were uhh, being hidden behind the actual hair/facial hair. Oops.

Also also fixes spawning yourself as a human as admin and getting random
hair colors. That was just a failure to update the icon after updating
everything, I think?

Additionally, to totally babyproof all of this, ensures that head_flags
involved stuff gets applied AFTER species by creating a new preference
priority, and uses two separate wrappers to apply gradient style and
color.

Here's this absolute hellspawn to prove that everything works.

Bugs are bad they make you mad

:cl:
fix: Hair and facial hair gradients work again now
fix: Facial hair colors apply properly again
fix: Admin spawned characters will get hair color preferences applied
properly

* Fixed a compile error (whoops)

* Whoops fixed that wrong

* Okay now I compiled and made sure it was fixed for real, I swear!

* Fixes carbon bodytypes not always being synchronized with bodyparts (#76522)

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/76481
TLDR /mob/living/carbon/human/species subtypes were NOT updating their
bodytypes on spawn due to absurd and wacky carbon bodypart creation code
that meant try_attach_limb() never got called (What the FUCK?)

* Fixes CI too

* [NO GBP] Fixes dumb usage of TRAIT_LIVERLESS_METABOLISM i caused (#76500)

## About The Pull Request

TRAIT_LIVERLESS_METABOLISM should do what it implies, and make you
always metabolize as if you were liverless.
This was a stupid mistake on my part because I wasn't aware
TRAIT_STABLELIVER was a thing.

## Why It's Good For The Game

TRAIT_LIVERLESS_METABOLISM and TRAIT_STABLELIVER should not behave the
exact same.

## Changelog

Not quite player facing.

* I fucking swear I fixed this before

#### Wednesday 2023-09-20 13:31:00 by thor

libmpg123: purge off_t out of the core, offer 64 bit portable API (bug 344)

This now is the result of way to much time of thinking hard about disentangling
the various I/O paths in libmpg123. It needed days of hacking, way too many
hours continuously, to figure out how this would work. So this is my draft
that I tested in various settings and am hopeful that it fulfills the ideas
drafted in bug 344, the relentless discussion with manx about how portable
API should look.

Instead of just adding some 64 bit functions, this is a refactoring of the
reader code, moving the parts actually dealing with OS calls and largefile
support into lfs_wrap.c, which now offers wrappers and aliases. All file I/O
is now routed through the interface of mpg123_reader64() and could neatly be
split into a separate library, weren't it for only a handful of internal hooks.

I fixed up the autoconf and the CMake build. Ideally, both break only on
a limited set of platforms. I am pushing this directly to trunk as a)
I did testing on x86-64 and i686 with some largefile switchery and think
it should work and b) I want people to quickly tell me what does not work.

Let's see how many iterations we'll need until 1.32.0 can finally be released.

The symbolic names are good for the *other* bits (ie sticky bit, and
the inode mode _type_ numbers etc), but for the permission bits, the
symbolic names are just insane crap. Nobody sane should ever use them.

Skrem's Quick Ballistic Glanceover (#2354)

## About The Pull Request

If maintainers want me to shorten the changelog, I can, I tend to start
there so I know what to talk about up here.

What started as a PR meant to buff up rubber rounds ended up turning
into a general passover I gave to much of the syntax and presentation of
ballistics. PR doesn't actually change that much function-wise, but it
changes a lot of lines due to a lot of changed pathing to better
establish consistency within ballistic code as well as overviewing a lot
of descriptions, names, and inherit moments.

Functionally, less-lethals and sniper rounds have been changed the most
by this PR. To a lesser extent, .38 special and shotgun rounds have been
tweaked. Finally, the PR stamps out a missing sprite bug with the WT-550
magazines, buffs up the surplus rifle (yeah, that old thing), tinkers
with some projectile speeds, makes match rounds slightly better, and
goes over A LOT of descriptions. I apologize for the massive wall of
text that's to follow.

Will take a look at energy weapons when I feel like it (might kill
disablers, I don't like mapping though).

## Why It's Good For The Game

### Slug and Pellet Changes
The pellet changes are actually just systemizing what was supposed to be
intentional design according to code comments, it just hadn't reached
every single pellet-based shotgun projectile. The improvised shell buff
is to make it not a potential complete whiff because RNG mechanics are
generally bad and not fun to play with.

### Less-Lethal Changes
Several implementations of less-lethal (rubber) ammunition on shiptest
are strictly worse than their standard alternatives. While this isn't a
PvP server, it feels very not-fun meta-wise to POTENTIALLY arm for SOME
insubordination and still fire what may as well be a round that bleeds
someone out (as they'll cause bleeding anyway). Increasing the stamina
damage on each of these makes it so they actually have a vague trade-off
(maybe stamina damage can do something like slow simplemobs in the
future, I don't know, I'd love to do it but simplemob code makes me
screech).

To make them not directly better in PvP and not the staple of taking
down the Super Scary Syndicate Shocktrooper Guy, they've had their
negative AP doubled. Not as good against combatants, but still perfectly
adept, if not better at general riot control against civilians. Makes
sense and puts them in their niche a little better.

### .38 Changes
The .38 special round relatively has more "power" and "velocity"
compared to the 9mm round, though it does not quite reach the levels
that .45 automatic or 10mm does in the IRL server. Furthermore, .38
special was specifically designed not to over-penetrate targets so as to
minimize the chance of collateral damage in police work. These are the
ultimate justifications behind giving it the worst AP out of all the
pistol calibers (-30, instead of -20) while still raising its damage to
25.

This should make the Winchester a better staple for taking out weaker
enemies such as legions or unarmored hermits, but it'll perform worse
against goliaths, frontiersmen, and the like. All-in-all, a more
"early-game" caliber, if you will, which is kinda what it's always been.

### Projectile Speed and Match Changes
Match rounds don't really exist as far as I've seen. That being said,
they're meant to be of higher quality, so their getting slightly higher
AP and speed makes sense, even if they're mostly just a meme round.

The speed increase of DMR/sniper rounds is primarily meant to
differentiate them better from AR rounds beyond having 20 more AP.
Assault rifles so far have pretty much dominated with better magazine
size, fire rate, and the exact same force as the DMR calibers, just
doing less damage against armored targets (doesn't matter too much when
you can just vomit rounds). I'd like to buff up the DMR damage even more
(sniper is fine), but I'd rather get some feedback on changing them to
35 baseline before doing so.

The speed decrease on shotguns is meant to cement them as CQC weapons.
Slugs are heavy. Shotguns are meant for close range. It's not much, but
it's thematically a good way to keep them in their lane, not that
they're even that problematic, hence only the slight change.

### Sniper Rifle Knockdown Change
Having a big-ass bullet that does 70 damage with 50 AP hit you is
already a middle finger. Making it potentially knock off an arm or a leg
is another middle finger. Being hardstunned for ten seconds after is the
icing on the cake. Changed it to a knockdown because we hate ranged
tasers.

### Surplus Rifle Fire Rate Buff
This thing is a joke. I haven't even seen it on the server, but I'd
rather make it vaguely competitive considering 10mm isn't super deadly
and only otherwise exists on the stechkin or the one Inteq SMG that you
never see (Colossus-only).

It's still clunky and terrible, but it should be less comedic and more
of a potential option if you have NOTHING else (will never happen).

### Boarder Magazine Change
Top-loading magazine fits into a standard assault rifle? No. Doesn't
make sense. Someone should probably just kill this gun, it's stupid and
looks stupid last I checked.

### WT-550 Magazine Fix
Don't think I've seen anyone use this weapon, I've only printed out
their magazines to dump AP rounds into my NT-SVG carbine. Noticed they
were invisible then. Someone increased their capacity to 30 without a
care for how its update_icon works. Not cool. Anyway, fixes are good.
Moving on.

### Syntax, Description, Spelling, and Overall Presentation Changes
Something very important when maintaining code is generally keeping
consistency in how things are not only presented, but how they're stored
as well. While I'd love to do EVEN more in the method of refactoring to
better align how so much of gun code works, this was something I wanted
to keep as a one-day project, so I mostly tinkered with pathing,
inherits, and groupings.

In the avenue of spelling and description changes, that's just 1)
Cleaning up errors that PR authors and maintainers missed and 2) Making
things more concise and just... better. Some of the SolGov descriptions
were a real headache to look at, and not because of the frequent
spelling and syntax errors.

Whoever misspelled and caused an entire series of items to be
/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/assualt may wish to avoid any crows
for the next three months.

Perfectly willing to adjust or reel back some of my descriptions if
someone can offer something better than what I've written out if there's
some soul they REALLY want to keep.

## Changelog

:cl:
tweak: The NT 'Boarder' ARG now loads standard P-16 magazines, rather
than the M-90gl toploaders.
balance: .38 special does 25 damage up from 20. AP has been reduced to
-30 from -20.
balance: Standardizes pellet projectiles to lose 10% damage of both
types per tile across the board. Improvised pellets no longer have a
hardcapped 1-8 tile range.
balance: Less-lethal rounds now do 50% more stamina than the force of
their lethal counterparts, with 25% the normal force and double the
negative AP. If the round had positive or zero AP, it was subtracted by
20.
balance: Shotgun slugs do 40 damage, down from 60, but have zero AP,
rather than -10. FRAG-12 and meteor slugs have had their damage adjusted
to reflect their relative force.
balance: Surplus rifle fire_delay has been cut to 1 second from 3.
balance: .50 BMG knocks down instead of hardstunning.
balance: Any DMR, match, or sniper round now travels slightly faster
than other bullets. Shotgun slugs and pellets now travel slightly slower
than other bullets.
balance: Match rounds have had their AP slightly increased.
fix: Fixed WT-550 magazines not displaying properly.
spellcheck: Went over (almost) every single ballistic description,
including the guns themselves, magazines, ballistic casings, and speed
loaders/stripper clips to not only have better consistency and
readability, but also be more clear on the general effectiveness of each
caliber.
spellcheck: Assualt is gone.
code: Repaths/renames most ballistic ammo pathing to maintain
consistency or take advantage of inherits, when possible.

chore(back-e2e): split maps.e2e-spec.ts

I'M SORRY FOR DUMPING THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PR BUT THIS FILE IS NUKING MY EDITOR.
So, Jest sucks. You're forced to run tests on a per-file basis, and we have to set up a Nest instance for at once.
If we ran Nest in the global test env, we can't access the instance in code, which we need to override providers in some cases.
So each separate file slows down CI so I try to avoid too many. Since this file is so monstrous and slowing down WebStorm,
I'm just splitting it in two. There's *probably* a better way of doing it, but honestly, Jest makes it difficult.
I'd rather not mess with it RN, so just doing this.

[global] switched repo from abandoned rome to it's successor biome (#770)

## Motivation and Context

Several monthes ago I switched repo from prettier and eslint to rome.
And not so long time ago it's got abandoned.

I am switching it to it's successor biome – it has same api and all
migration took like a 10 minutes.

Why I switched to biome and not back to eslint+prettier:
1. I am still not very satisfied with performance of eslint and
prettier.
2. Biome is under the active development – it's even getting JetBrains
IDE support very soon.
3. Migration to biome is really fast because api is the same.  

So, from reasons above I want to give that tool a second chance. I it
fill fuck up as the rome – migration to eslint and prettier would be
inevitable.

## How has this been tested?

No tests :)

## Types of changes

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue).
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality).
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing
functionality to not work as expected).
- [x] Nice improve.

## Checklist:

<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes
that apply. -->
<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask. We're
here to help! -->

- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.
- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly or it's not required.
- [x] Unit tests are not broken.
- [ ] I have added changelog note to corresponding `CHANGELOG.md` file
with planned publish date.
- [ ] I have added new unit tests on added of fixed functionality.

feat(D1): DMAC Driver 2: Electric Boogaloo (#281)

This branch kinda rewrites a bunch of the DMAC code. Now, DMA channels
are capable of being dynamically allocated on demand using a cool atomic
bitset thingy, and released back to the DMAC pool when they're no longer
in use. This will allow us to have multiple drivers that consume
basically as many DMA channels as they want to, rather than having a
fixed assignment of DMA channels to drivers which has to be maintained
by manually updating the DMAC IRQ handler every time we add a new driver
that wants to do a DMA. A channel can be allocated from the pool once
and used for multiple transfers, if a driver needs to make a bunch of
transfers in sequence and doesn't want to have to round trip through the
channel pool, but they can also be grabbed for oneshot transfers and
immediately released.

I also fixed the cancel safety of the async `Channel::transfer`
(formerly `Channel::run_descriptor`) method, which would previously
leave the transfer running if the future is dropped. This means that if
a caller assumed dropping the transfer future meant that the transfer
descriptor's buffer could be freed, the transfer might complete later
and trample memory that has been reallocated. THAT SEEMS KINDA BAD LOL.
So, now, dropping a `Channel::transfer` future will cancel the transfer
if it hasn't finished yet, allowing fun stuff like attaching a timeout
to a transfer if you really want to. Of course, the transfer may still
have completed partially, and if we were writing to a device, the device
may be unhappy to have only gotten some of the data it wanted. But, at
least we don't have abandoned DMA transfers running around in random
parts of the heap you probably wanted to use for normal stuff like
having strings, or whatever it is that people do on the computer. So
that's better.

Unfortunately, while we can easily make the DMA transfers `Drop`-safe,
we can't really make them `mem::forget`-safe without passing the DMA
buffer into the future and leaking it if it gets forgetted. This is
probably a good idea but would require a nice higher-level interface
around constructing DMA descriptors from buffer-shaped memory regions,
which I didn't want to do tonight. So, the DMA transfer APIs are still
`unsafe` and maybe we can add a nicer thing on top later. In the
meantime, probably don't `mem::forget` DMA transfers. Honestly there is
no reason for normal people to do that so I don't feel super bad about
it.

Remove balancer.fi from blocklist (#13609)

Balancer has recovered control of balancer.fi after a social engineering attack at our registrar allowed hackers to take over the account.

We have confirmed that correct IPs have propigated.  If possible, please leave web.balancer.fi on the blocklist as we do not use it, and it seems like this name was used as part of the recent attack.

We have a war room open that we contacted via the seal-911 chat and I have been speaking to Tay.  You can find me that way if you have questions.

Several Months Of Progress All At Once

alright let me check what i've done HOLY SHIT.

Added several fully functional items; made someone being bloodthirsty available to see via GAME_STATE; added debug tools such as initiate_specific_encounter; created the Insurgent Messiah, a boss who has a barrier that nullifies damage completely and ends your turn early; reworked bloodthirstiness to be stackable: if you keep killing things, you keep taking turns; each boss now has a guaranteed accessory tied to the boss, that allows you to emulate their behavior; cleaned up and optimized a couple functions that I don't even remember anymore

Context-free-grammars (#1097)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

context-free-grammar

### Eval description

This tests the ability for GPT-4 to evaluate whether or not a string can
be produced by a given context-free grammar.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is an interesting computational task. Context-free languages are
important in linguistics, and it will be interesting to see
how a language model fares in handling this task.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [✅] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [✅] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [✅] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [✅] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)
I've handcrafted a lot of these examples. Some of them are there to
'trick' the model––I think it will be a useful test to see how well the
language model can do at those.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [✅] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [✅] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [✅] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [✅] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [✅] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [✅] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [✅] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [✅] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [✅] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Russian verse (#979)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
russian-verse

### Eval description

The most popular Russian poems that nearly every Russian speaker can
recall

### What makes this a useful eval?

Understanding a basic Russian poem or any foreign literature is
significant for a Language Learning Model (LLM) like GPT-4 because it
enhances multilingual ability, provides cultural context, and improves
understanding of language structure. It makes the model globally useful,
and culturally sensitive.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

You can do revival surgery on Ian (#78288)

## About The Pull Request

Allows you to perform revival surgery on any mob which is organic or
looks humanoid.
This means yes: Corgis, Goliaths, ~~Syndicate mobs~~ not those because
they spawn human corpses and delete themselves.
No: Slimes, Ghosts, General Beepsky.

Splits revival surgery into a subtype used for "mobs" and a subtype for
"mobs with brains" as the former don't have any brains to damage.

Additionally by special request, Ian can now wear an eyepatch and will
automatically put one on if he is brought back from death.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/eff91bf6-4f80-4d8b-9062-1a5d4af85d39)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Currently you revive dead pets either by creating a magical reagent out
of holy water or by buying a mining item which also brainwashes them,
however reasonably our skilled medical team should be able to put a dog
back together and now can.
When you fuck up one of the stages of Tend Wounds on a kitten and stab
it to death with your scalpel, now you can fix it.
Expands the possibilities of vetinerary roleplay.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Many kinds of mobs can now be brought back to life through revival
surgery.
add: Dogs can wear eyepatches.

add try_insert to entity commands (#9844)

# Objective

- I spoke with some users in the ECS channel of bevy discord today and
they suggested that I implement a fallible form of .insert for
components.

- In my opinion, it would be nice to have a fallible .insert like
.try_insert (or to just make insert be fallible!) because it was causing
a lot of panics in my game. In my game, I am spawning terrain chunks and
despawning them in the Update loop. However, this was causing bevy_xpbd
to panic because it was trying to .insert some physics components on my
chunks and a race condition meant that its check to see if the entity
exists would pass but then the next execution step it would not exist
and would do an .insert and then panic. This means that there is no way
to avoid a panic with conditionals.

Luckily, bevy_xpbd does not care about inserting these components if the
entity is being deleted and so if there were a .try_insert, like this PR
provides it could use that instead in order to NOT panic.

( My interim solution for my own game has been to run the entity despawn
events in the Last schedule but really this is just a hack and I should
not be expected to manage the scheduling of despawns like this - it
should just be easy and simple. IF it just so happened that bevy_xpbd
ran .inserts in the Last schedule also, this would be an untenable soln
overall )

## Solution

- Describe the solution used to achieve the objective above.

Add a new command named TryInsert (entitycommands.try_insert) which
functions exactly like .insert except if the entity does not exist it
will not panic. Instead, it will log to info. This way, crates that are
attaching components in ways which they do not mind that the entity no
longer exists can just use try_insert instead of insert.

---

## Changelog

 

## Additional Thoughts

In my opinion, NOT panicing should really be the default and having an
.insert that does panic should be the odd edgecase but removing the
panic! from .insert seems a bit above my paygrade -- although i would
love to see it. My other thought is it would be good for .insert to
return an Option AND not panic but it seems it uses an event bus right
now so that seems to be impossible w the current architecture.

[MIRROR] Nerfs Confusion symptom for diseases [MDB IGNORE] (#23478)

* Nerfs Confusion symptom for diseases (#77991)

## About The Pull Request

Removed the threshold for confusion symptom that adds illiteracy to the
disease.

Clamps confusion symptom's confusion to a maximum of 30 seconds.

Confusion as a debuff no longer guarantees random movement if you're
resting.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Removed the threshold for confusion symptom that adds illiteracy to
the disease.

This virus makes you unable to actually treat yourself when cured, which
is frankly bonkers. Viruses are too virulent and it's rare that a doctor
actually gets to a biosuit in time to inoculate themselves, and if they
forget internals they're screwed anyways. People should be able to fix
their own got damn disease, this is asinine.

> Clamps confusion symptom's confusion to a maximum of 30 seconds.

The lack of clamping literally makes this symptom send your confusion
level to the fucking atmosphere, you can easily get upwards of 5 minutes
of confusion left because it doesn't clamp, adds 16 seconds per
activation, which is made even worse by the fact that confusion gets
stronger the more duration confusion has on you.

> Confusion as a debuff no longer guarantees random movement if you're
resting.

This remedies the last bit by not making it a literal guarantee that you
can't move in any direction after...... *3* triggers of confusion. It
should be obvious to anyone how absurd this is.

Honestly, it's plain as day that the only reason any of this ended up
like it is because of poor coding and oversights. This is just bringing
things down to their designed level.

## Changelog

:cl:
del: Removed the threshold for confusion symptom that adds illiteracy to
the disease.
balance: Clamps confusion symptom's confusion to a maximum of 30
seconds.
qol: Confusion as a debuff no longer guarantees random movement if
you're resting.

[MIRROR] Replaces Ascended Blade Heretic stun imminuty with a stun absorption effect (it's not as cool as it sounds)  [MDB IGNORE] (#23472)

* Replaces Ascended Blade Heretic stun imminuty with a stun absorption effect (it's not as cool as it sounds)  (#78060)

## About The Pull Request

Instead of being completely immune to stuns after ascension, blade
heretics now have a stun absorption. This is the effect that His Grace
and the Bastard Sword use.

It functions similarly, in that it stops you from being hardstunned, but
the difference it is they are only immune to a limited amount of stuns
for a limited amount of time before it recharges.

Currently that number is 45 seconds of stuns, with a 2 minute recharge,
meaning if you take more than 45 seconds of stun effects you will stop
being immune.

Bear in mind this still provides full immunity to being stamcrit*, as
stam doesn't contribute towards "seconds stunned" number.

*Unless you used all 45 seconds of stun immunity then you will no longer
be immune until you recharge.

Also to compensate, I gave them a slightly modifier protecting against
knockdowns.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I forgot Stun Absorptions were a thing entirely when making this even
though I refactored the darn things.

Anyways, the reason why I'm doing this is that Stun Absorptions are just
a slightly more fair, less overt way of providing stun immunity, and I
think it fits the theme more.

You're supposed to be a master duelist, but being able to take on a
dozen people at once is not entirely intended (even though this is the
ascension, I know). Stun Absorptions lend better to that, since you run
out of stun juice eventually before you have to pull back.

Though ultimately this doesn't change very much, as we use very few
hardstuns now-a-days:

- A flashbang will contribute about 10 seconds of stun time
- A flash is similar to a flashbang
- Bodythrows and tackles are less than 5 seconds
- Beepsky, 10 seconds
- Stamcrit, 0 seconds, but you are still slowed by stamina damage
- A banana peel, default is roughly 6 seconds. <-- (This is why I gave
them a knockdown modifier)

However it does mean you can't really tank an AI stun turret all day.
That's Rust's thing. Go play Rust Heretic.

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
balance: Ascended Blade Heretics no longer have blanket stun immunity,
they now have 45 seconds of stun absorption that recharges after 2
minutes - think His Grace. This doesn't affect stamcrit (still immune to
that) (assuming you haven't consumed all of your immunity charge) but
does affect hard CC such as slips, flashbangs, or beepsky.
balance: Ascended Blade Heretics now have a 0.75 modifier to incoming
knockdowns.
/:cl:

* Replaces Ascended Blade Heretic stun imminuty with a stun absorption effect (it's not as cool as it sounds)

Misc mapping fixes and QoL additions (#78176)

## About The Pull Request

fix: #78135
fix: #78059

This PR remaps Birdshot's disposals room, makes several small fixes on
Icebox and Metastation, adds cell timers to isolation cells where such
cells are present (they don't open the door, effectively just an in-game
timer) (in-cell flashes are now controlled with the timer, where
applicable); and adds translator glove modules to the stacks of
"accessibility" modules found in most security, medical, and engineering
storage rooms. (adds these stacks in their entirety to Northstar).

Specific changes are as follows:
Birdshot
- Adds a roll of package paper to the cargo office
- Translator module [med,sec]
- Accessibility modules [eng]
- Recycler remap

Delta
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timer

Icebox
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Remove duplicate hand labeler on the rack near brig cells
- Adds a hand labeler to armory desk in gear room
- Isolation cell timer

Meta
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timer
- Mends a broken corpse disposal pipe from aux surgery to the morgue

Northstar
- Accessibility modules [med,sec,eng]
- Nudges the binoculars off of the mass driver controls in ordnance
- Fixes the SM starting out hotwired (Rewires the SM room)

Tram
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timers
## Why It's Good For The Game

Bug fixes with respect to Birdshot's recycler, Meta's corpse disposal,
Northstar starting out hotwired, and Icebox's duplicated hand labeler.

Nudging Northstar's ordnance binoculars should make it a bit easier to
find the mass driver controls.

Adding some packaging paper to Birdshot to make the techs' lives a
little easier with a little less round-start fuss.

Adding a hand labeler to Icebox's gear room brings it in line with other
maps in terms of rounds-start gear and locker labeling potential.

For players with characters running the Mute/Signer quirks, stock
MODsuits are a pain to use. Suit gauntlets will replace their translator
gloves. Unless they're able to get a suit put together ahead of time,
they'll be stuck doing the retract gauntlets > send radio message >
Extend Gauntlets shuffle. Adding a translator glove module to the stack
of similar items (plasma fixation module / therma regulator) should
alleviate that issue some.

Getting abandoned in an isolation cell sucks, and setting timers on your
phone or some such is a hassle. Adding cell timers to isolation cells
should go some way to alleviating those frustrations.

Minor Edit to Assest List

Joy did a fantastic job with the assest list, very thankful for their hard week. I know we can get way more done, but these are the bare essentials for the game. In addition, life happens. This game isn't a dedicated project, it's for a class. Of course, we're going to elevate the concept and make it awesome, but it's not a guaranteed time commitment. I want to focus on finished and functional before worrying about putting out the next big hit.

Added my own webscraper library

Sorry for leaving this repo empty! I tried to make a webscraper but I failed due to incompetence, after 3 more attempts to get it to work, this version passed both of my tests (a website that was auto-generated (like wix) (name of site withheld due to it being personally identifying) and cock.li which is much more rudimentary)

I'll admit, this code is awful and I am ashamed to put this code out on the internet in such an unrefined state but I think a commit is warranted after TWO months!!!

The code is "multi-threaded." I put this into quotation marks not because it isn't multi-threaded but because this is the first time I have ever used python threading and the system I made may be really bad!

XXX WIP More refactoring

This might not be XXX anymore, it seems to work!!! Amazing, this opens
up the future for extra tabs so much.

I considered something simpler than a defaultdict(bool), like a good old
int representing flags, but decided to stick with defaultdict(bool) for
two reasons:
 1. It's nicer in the debugger. "{'ini_store': True, 'mod_store': True}"
    is much more readable than "36" (1 << 2 | 1 << 4).
 2. I was concerned about the final syntax being ugly for dicts, but the
    helpers in tab_comms alleviated my worry - turns out
    defaultdict(int, {0: 1}) | defaultdict(int, {1, 0}) works and
    results in defaultdict(int, {0: 1, 1: 0}). Thanks, py3!
 3. In the future, we may want to pass more info along in
    refresh_others. For example, one could imagine an API like this in
    the (far) future:
      refresh_others=SAVES(redraw=target_saves)

Add emotional intelligence evaluation (#589)

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Emotional Intelligence

### Eval description
Evaluates GPT's ability to understand and manage emotional situations
using modified versions of the well-validated, public (i.e.
license-unrestricted) tests first developed by MacCann & Roberts (2008).
Items have actually here been aggregated across three different scales--
the STEU and STEM adult measures, along with a dozen questions from the
youth measure.

Keep in mind that there is not expectation that AI models like GPT-4
should be able to process emotions, so applying any emotional
intelligence test to them should be taken with a grain of salt. These
tests can only measure the AI's ability to understand and analyze
emotional information, not the AI's emotional intelligence in the human
sense.

### What makes this a useful eval?
This eval is useful because it assesses the AI model's ability to
navigate complex or ambiguous emotional situations, which is an
important aspect of human-like communication and problem-solving. By
evaluating the model's performance in this unique domain, we can
identify areas for improvement and better understand its limitations
when it comes to handling emotional contexts. This is particularly
important when considering AI applications that involve interactions
with humans, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and customer support
systems. A better understanding of emotional intelligence can
potentially lead to more natural and effective interactions between AI
models and their users.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This Emotional Intelligence eval provides a unique value because by
testing GPT's capacity to understand and manage emotions, we can gain
insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in a more
human-centric context. Relatedly, this eval also emphasizes the
importance of empathy and emotional understanding in AI systems that are
designed to interact with humans. By evaluating GPT's performance in
this way, we can contribute to the ongoing development of AI models that
are more attuned to human emotions and can provide better support in
emotionally charged situations, such as mental health counseling, crisis
management, and conflict resolution. Moreover, this Emotional
Intelligence eval can serve as a foundation for further research and
development in the field of AI and emotional understanding, paving the
way for more sophisticated AI models capable of handling complex human
emotions and fostering more effective communication.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval
(data is publicly available on OSF, and does not have usage
restrictions)

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

**_I already have access to the 8k GPT-4 API, but I am kindly requesting
access to the 32k as soon as it becomes available._**

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Performance:
GPT-4: accuracy=0.48

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Heart Disease Prediction (#538)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Heart Disease Prediction

### Eval description

This eval tests the models ability to correctly predict the probability
of a patient to have heart disease. The dataset is constructed from the
[Heart Failure Prediction
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
on Kaggle. The data includes the patient's age, sex, and a number of
medical signals relevant to the diagnosis of heart disease.

The data is provided under the Open Database License (ODbL).

fedesoriano. (September 2021). Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. Retrieved [Mar 31, 2023] from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction.
```

### What makes this a useful eval?

This assesses the model's ability to correctly predict adverse medical
events. Correctly predicting heart disease shows the model's capability
for a strong understanding of medicine. The GPT-3.5-turbo models
currently receives an accuracy of 0.778.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

As far as I can tell, this is the only eval so far related to making
medical diagnoses. To make sure it was a high quality eval, I tried to
find a dataset with a lot of observations and created by doctors with
the relevant expertise.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

[LSP] Adjust language server code to fix bugs when compiling with GCC (#23464)

This PR fixes several compiler errors that only appear when compiling
the language server with GCC. Shamefully, I forgot to test my build of
#22861 w/ GCC, and let in some bugs as I only develop with Clang.

The most frustrating bug here by far was "full specialization in
non-namespace scope", which I finally tracked down to the following
defect report: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=85282

This is still not fixed yet as of GCC 12 as far as I know (haven't
used 12, so don't quote me on it), so it certainly isn't a feature
we can rely on.

I worked around the bug by using `constexpr` folding instead of
specialization, but it's a solution I'm still not quite happy with.

Another frustrating bug involved parameter-packing and recursive
template instantiation. While Clang knew to terminate recursive
instantiation of `withChapel` early and eagerly, GCC opted to blow
out its instantiation stack instead. The only solution was to
rewrite the problematic overload to avoid a recursive call. I'm not
sure which of GCC or Clang is in the right, here.

I've left comments in the code indicating why certain patterns exist.

This PR marks the first time I've opted to use [LSP] as a tag to
indicate that this effort is for the "Language Server (Protocol)".
I'm preferring this tag over "chpldef" as the team has indicated
they'd like a different name for the server in the future. While
I haven't changed the server name yet, it's on the agenda.

TESTING

- [x] LSP/tests on `linux64`
- [x] LSP/tests on `osx`

ugh

- spiking is fixed
-> OnTriggerStay2D is a shit function and we shouldn't use it
-> OnTriggerEnter/Exit2D now used to set a bool value for hit range checking, then Update is used to detect spike input

- bots are OP again, sorry :3

- KO wall is sorta fixed, no longer get stuck to inner walls when holding against them
-> however, walking onto the KO floor without jumping will snap you to the arena side of the inner wall instead of the KO zone, so you'll be stuck in the arena waiting out the KO cooldown

- game end text changed from "PLAYER 1/PLAYER2" to "HOME TEAM/AWAY TEAM"

- scoring updated to work as intended; spiking below the score line gives other team a point, possessing the ball but not spiking it grants other team a point, spiking ball above score line with possession gives your team the point

- player max speed increased from 3 to 4

- hitting the ball reworked
-> ball hit direction now based on which way player is facing. ball is always hit with full hitForce value

Polymorph belt blacklists several biotypes instead of allowing only organics (#78229)

## About The Pull Request

Title; this makes the belt able to morph into _more_ mobs, but _less
problematic/abusable_ mobs hopefully. It still only functions on
basic/simple_animals, however.

~~Headslugs get a `MOB_UNDEAD` bioflag to prevent morphing into them
completely. Though catching a sentient ling slug and morphing everyone
into it is funny, it's only funny the first 5 times someone does it.
(disclaimer: this is an approximation, i did not actually see a
polymorph belt in-game because i currently play miner and like 10 games
a week tops)
Arguably, this isn't ideal, but it's the closest we get unless we rename
`MOB_EPIC` or something into `MOB_SPECIAL` and let that one be the go-to
bioflag for mobs we don't want **fun** things happen to.~~
`MOB_EPIC` is now `MOB_SPECIAL`. Headslugs get that.
I think the alternative methow could use whatever the gold cores use to
determine what to spawn but that would shift the mobs available for the
belt even more and I can't be assed to figure out how _much_ of a shift
that would be. Dragons or slimes or lavaland mobs would be out, for
example. Don't really vibe with that.

Fixes headslug's description bit that discerns a sentient slug from an
AI one showing up on a dead slug. It can't move while it's dead, no
matter its mind/AI.

Also adds simple dmdoc comments to the defines to help discern a few of
them more easily. Non-quip text suggestions welcome.

## Why It's Good For The Game
- Resolves #77756
- Resolves #78227

More mobs available for the funny belt but less _fun_ mobs should allow
for more stable use of the damn thing. Arguably, some of the mobs that
have been found to be incompatible with the belt are simply lacking a
`MOB_ORGANIC` flag, some of them with no apparent reason. However,
blacklisting potentially problematic biotypes should be easier to design
the unwanted mobs around.
Also consistency, less all-ling stations, code clarity. Whatever.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: polymorph belt now blacklists mobs that are undead, humanoid,
robotic or spiritual (in nature, not religiously), as well as megafauna
balance: however, this means that it works with more mobs that it should
logically work with, like slimes/bugs/lightgeists etc
fix: fixed headslug shenanigans with the polymorph belt hopefully for
good this time
fix: fixed headslug description mentioning its movement despite the slug
being dead
