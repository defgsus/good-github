[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

aot autograd refactor: make all synthetic base logic layered in a single location (#96235)

This  refactor doesn't significantly change LoC in aot autograd, but I think this nets out to making it clearer (interested in peoples' thoughts).

The idea is that I tried to re-write the part of aot autograd that deals with synthetic bases in a layered way, similar to how Ed wrote the logic for dedup'ing inputs: it happens in one place, and all of the downstream transformation in aot autograd don't have to worry about it.

Specifically, I added a new function `aot_wrapper_synthetic_base`, similar to the existing `aot_wrapper_dedupe`.

The benefit: none of the other code in aot autograd needs to think about synthetic bases (previously, synthetic base code was intertwined in several places).

The downsides: there are two.

(1) `aot_wrapper_synthetic_base()` needs to have its own epilogue. There is one particularly hairy case, where factoring the synthetic base logic to a single location was painful: If you have two inputs that alias each other, where one gets a data mutation, and the other gets a metadata mutation.

Ordinarily, metadata mutations are handled by the runtime epilogue, in `create_runtime_wrapper`. However, now that things are factored this way, the runtime wrapper operates only on synthetic bases instead of operating on the original inputs. For data mutations, it is fine to apply the data mutation to the synthetic base instead of the original input alias. But for metadata mutations, we **need** to apply the metadata mutation directly to the original inputs.

The way that I handled this was by tracking which inputs slot into this specific case (part of a synthetic base, and get metadata mutations), and updateing the flat_fn() that we pass downstream to return these updated inputs as extra outputs. From the perspective of downstream logic, these are real user outputs, that it can treat like any other user outputs. `aot_wrapper_synthetic_base` will know to grab these extra outputs and use them to apply the metadata mutations.

This was pretty annoying, but has the benefit that all of that logic is encapsulated entirely in `aot_wrapper_synthetic_base()`.

(2) input mutations are now performed on the synthetic base instead of the individual aliases.

You can see the original code comment [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/b0b5f3c6c681896febbd9ff7ad7649b13def345d/torch/_functorch/aot_autograd.py#L1131) for details. We used to do the optimized thing in this case, and now we do the less optimized thing (copying the entire synthetic base, instead of the potentially smaller alias).

To be fair, we had no data showing that this optimization was showing improvements on any models in practice. I also think that the main reason anyone would ever run across this problem is because of a graph break - so if you care about perf, you probably want to avoid the extra graph breaks to begin with. I haven't added any warnings for this, but we probably could depending on what people think.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

# Tests + Formatting

Haven't even looked at stdlib `tests.nu` yet.

Other todos:
* address module todos.
* integrate into std lib, rather than as standalone module. Somehow
arrange for `use .../standard_library/std.nu` to load this module
without having to put all the source in `std.nu`?
*  Maybe command should be `std dirs ...`?   
* what else do `enter` and `exit` do that this should do? Then deprecate
those commands.

Don't forget to add tests that cover your changes.

Make sure you've run and fixed any issues with these commands:

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to check standard code formatting (`cargo
fmt --all` applies these changes)
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used -A
clippy::needless_collect` to check that you're using the standard code
style
- `cargo test --workspace` to check that all tests pass

Post-Revolutionary Fervor station trait, revolutionary bedsheets, and a megaphone (#73799)

## About The Pull Request

Upon revolution success, the chosen headrev will now also receive a
megaphone, and a "revolutionary bedsheet" repurposed from a stolen CC
bedsheet to commemorate their success. The post-revs confusion and lack
of command/security usually leads to an instantaneous, total breakdown
in cohesion. It's every man for himself -- that's no way to run a
commune! Just because the revolution has succeeded and nobody can see
your big blue "R" anymore doesn't mean you can't be a leader!


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28870487/222981576-e62e457b-1b2d-4756-8c87-7a9093c92c2d.png)

This also adds a new revolution-themed negative station trait --
Post-Revolutionary Fervor. When present, this trait trashes the command
areas at the start of the round. This means cracked windows, broken
consoles, vendors getting knocked over, and the occasional dead
greytider.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28870487/222981095-14ce9336-2320-406e-b0a6-dc91cb8f9479.png)

If you start cleaning at the start of the round, you might finish right
as the next batch of revs decides to crop up.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Giving one of the headrevs a bigger voice and a cool cape (or uncool,
depending on how you view the sprite) means that there's a chance for
them to step up and try to keep the wheels on. Just remember -- Nobody
is obligated to actually listen to this person, it's just a bedsheet.

Adds a neato station trait, which probably counts as command gameplay
content.

## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
add: The headrev who receives the revolutionary banner after a win will
also receive a commemorative bedsheet and megaphone.
add: Post-Revolutionary Fervor station trait. I hope you enjoy fixing
broken computer screens.
spriteadd: A revolutionary bedsheet.

Fix for varediting bitflags. (#2735)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

I am honestly at a loss as to what is happening here. I do not speak
HTML all too well, and at cursory reading buttons _should_ be returning
their value, which is `1`, `2` and so on. But on debugging, they
actually return their text (`Save`, `Cancel`), which does not proceed to
work with the code receiving it. Changed that code accordingly, and then
edited the values for good measure in case somebody better versed in
HTML would get a heart attack from my folly.

Also, this looks ugly to me. Which button is which flag here?

This, in my humble opinion, is easier to read (would actually look
better outside of local server messing fancy windows as is its wont):

In the process, I confess, my HTML illiteracy broke a little something
again. But we are not actually _using_ `slidecolor`, so hopefully it is
not actually important.

[SDPA] Add an optional scale kwarg (#95259)

# Summary
This PR adds an optional kwarg to torch torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention()
The new kwarg is a scaling factor that is applied after the q@k.T step of the computation. Made updates to the efficient kernel to support but flash and math were minimally updated to support as well.

Will reduce the complexity of: #94729 and has been asked for by a couple of users.

# Review Highlights
- As far as I know I did this the correct way and this both BC and FC compliant. However I always seem to break internal workloads so I would love if someone can advice I did this right?
- I named the optional arg 'scale'. This is probably dumb and I should name it 'scale_factor'. I will make this change but this is annoying and it will require someone thinking we should rename.
- 'scale' is interpreted as `Q@K.T * (scale)`

## About The Pull Request

This is bullshit. Splurting out 180 damage with high AP with no delay is
not okay. Its as bullshit as most FCU we had. Mainly removed scatter on

the mining tool (as there is no way to increase firerate on a
projectile.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Ever got hit at close range by the particle defender on main? Yeah that
is not fun.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Scattershot on high powered weapons nerfed. Heavy laser and
laser cannon beam and electrode now wont create submunitions. Stun beam
submunition count lowered.

Mashes several of the Whitesands Survivor Camp ruins into one extra large ruin (#1640)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Combines the whitesands surface camp adobe, farm, gunslingers,
survivors, hunters and saloon into one massive, 59x59 ruin. Some various
extra loot and changes have been made throughout, generally to improve
the experience of digging through the trash for goodies. Changes the
riot shotgun in the saloon to a double barrel shotgun. Also cleans up
the various issues with the ruins, like walls under doors, or area
passthroughs being used excessively over the outside of the ruins,
resulting in them generating in the middle of mountains buried in the
rock.

"Well, why didn't you add the drugstore?" The loot in it was too good.
The stuff in there can really help a ship get on its feet, and I am not
gonna deprive them of that just to shove it in an already packed massive
ruin area. I'm not saying it doesn't need its own remap, just that it
doesn't fit well with the other camps put into this ruin.

any issues found during tested have been addressed.

## Why It's Good For The Game
"a ruin that is tiny and sucks on purpose is still bad" and holy shit
did most of the camps fit this criteria. Survivor, Gunslinger, and
Hunter camp variants were the smallest ruins in the game next to the one
that was just a single tumor, and constantly took up entire map
generations just to be a massive dissapointment to any player that came
across them. Or they would spawn in the middle of an acid lake. Either
way this ruin is massive and should provide a breath of fresh air for
scavengers and combat hungry miners alike.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

Station Trait: Spider Infestation (#73893)

## About The Pull Request

Hate having your cables eaten by mice? Nanotrasen have heard your
complaints and settled on a natural, _organic_, and eco-friendly
solution.

When this station trait is active, roundstart and event mouse spawns
have a chance to instead be replaced with duct spiders (both will exist,
it doesn't remove mice).
Duct spiders are largely harmless to humans, actively hunt other
maintenance creatures (such as mice), and have only one _tiny_ downside.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/224345781-2627be98-67f2-4cab-ac40-c6c9b35ea909.png)

These mobs can also sometimes be spawned by a minor scrubber clog event.

As a side note, all spider basic mobs with AI (except Araneus) will now
try to automatically fill a small area around them with webs.

Also I made it so that mobs will ignore their random_walking behaviour
if they're engaged in a `do_after`, just in case.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Adds a little bit of variety to things which can slightly annoy you in
maintenance.
Spiders will automatically make places they live in look like spiders
live there.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: A station trait which sometimes populates maintenance with small
spiders. You can wear them as a hat if you wanted to have a spider on
your head for some reason.
add: Spider mobs will automatically start webbing up their environment.

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

lib/list_sort: optimize number of calls to comparison function

CONFIG_RETPOLINE has severely degraded indirect function call
performance, so it's worth putting some effort into reducing the number
of times cmp() is called.

This patch avoids badly unbalanced merges on unlucky input sizes.  It
slightly increases the code size, but saves an average of 0.2*n calls to
cmp().

x86-64 code size 739 -> 803 bytes (+64)

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of low-hanging fruit in a merge sort;
it already performs only n*log2(n) - K*n + O(1) compares.  The leading
coefficient is already at the theoretical limit (log2(n!) corresponds to
K=1.4427), so we're fighting over the linear term, and the best
mergesort can do is K=1.2645, achieved when n is a power of 2.

The differences between mergesort variants appear when n is *not* a
power of 2; K is a function of the fractional part of log2(n).  Top-down
mergesort does best of all, achieving a minimum K=1.2408, and an average
(over all sizes) K=1.248.  However, that requires knowing the number of
entries to be sorted ahead of time, and making a full pass over the
input to count it conflicts with a second performance goal, which is
cache blocking.

Obviously, we have to read the entire list into L1 cache at some point,
and performance is best if it fits.  But if it doesn't fit, each full
pass over the input causes a cache miss per element, which is
undesirable.

While textbooks explain bottom-up mergesort as a succession of merging
passes, practical implementations do merging in depth-first order: as
soon as two lists of the same size are available, they are merged.  This
allows as many merge passes as possible to fit into L1; only the final
few merges force cache misses.

This cache-friendly depth-first merge order depends on us merging the
beginning of the input as much as possible before we've even seen the
end of the input (and thus know its size).

The simple eager merge pattern causes bad performance when n is just
over a power of 2.  If n=1028, the final merge is between 1024- and
4-element lists, which is wasteful of comparisons.  (This is actually
worse on average than n=1025, because a 1204:1 merge will, on average,
end after 512 compares, while 1024:4 will walk 4/5 of the list.)

Because of this, bottom-up mergesort achieves K < 0.5 for such sizes,
and has an average (over all sizes) K of around 1.  (My experiments show
K=1.01, while theory predicts K=0.965.)

There are "worst-case optimal" variants of bottom-up mergesort which
avoid this bad performance, but the algorithms given in the literature,
such as queue-mergesort and boustrodephonic mergesort, depend on the
breadth-first multi-pass structure that we are trying to avoid.

This implementation is as eager as possible while ensuring that all
merge passes are at worst 1:2 unbalanced.  This achieves the same
average K=1.207 as queue-mergesort, which is 0.2*n better then
bottom-up, and only 0.04*n behind top-down mergesort.

Specifically, defers merging two lists of size 2^k until it is known
that there are 2^k additional inputs following.  This ensures that the
final uneven merges triggered by reaching the end of the input will be
at worst 2:1.  This will avoid cache misses as long as 3*2^k elements
fit into the cache.

(I confess to being more than a little bit proud of how clean this code
turned out.  It took a lot of thinking, but the resultant inner loop is
very simple and efficient.)

Reworks trashbags slightly (#73761)

## About The Pull Request

I'm a bit sad about the state of trashbags. 
They're very clunky to use, so they almost never get touched. S
depressing. Let's try and fix that.

Let's make em fit in the belt slot (again), but as a tradeoff we'll make
it harder to pull one thing from your bag.
We'll give it a say, 1.5 second delay, so you can't quickdraw from em.
If you try and dump them out into something else, we'll throw any
spillover on the ground below you

I'm also doing some general code cleanup here. Making procs more
readable, vars more direct, removing some old legacy stuff.
I've added a remove_single proc to hook into via subtype, which takes a
mob as input. this has required placing extra requirement on some helper
procs, but fortunately it's not something they're unable to meet.

My hope is this will make garbage bags usable without being stupid.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I don't see these get used at all, cause they're a pain to carry around.
They got gimped because people were using them as infinite storage for
shotgun shells and other small items.
I've made using them for this sort of thing hard and slow, so I think we
oughta be fine. If not I'll do some more touching, maybe give the
autodrop a delay.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: The janitor's trashbag now fits on his belt. In exchange,
taking something out of it sends a visible message, and has a delay.

All hail The Pickle Jar, harbringer of better crafting (#73939)

## About The Pull Request
Fixes #73841 

---

_It is the 12th of March, 2023. Around 3am. I have published a Pull
Request which involves circuits, and got reminded of my low GBP. I go
into the issues tab to see if there's anything someone of my low skill
caliber could tackle. I see it; Pickles.
"How hard could I be?" I ask myself, foolishly unaware of the dangers
that would soon overcome me.
Surely it must've been a mistype, I thought. Surely someone accidentally
confused pickles and cucumbers.
"Wait, the pickles are supposed to be created on the jar when the jar is
created", I say foolishly.
"Wait, its putting the ingredients used for the jar in the jar, that
doesn't explain why the pickles aren't there though", I say foolishly
"Wait, whoever tried fixing this earlier fucking qdel'd the beaker and
called it a day????", I say, foolishly._

---

Anyways I changed how the crafting menu distincts between categories,
instead of checking whether or not the path is for food, it checks the
actual categories themselves (why didn't it do this already), meaning
that you can have non-food items on the food tab if it has a food
category. Did this by adding a list that includes all crafting
categories, so in the future when adding new categories you'll have to
add them twice, which sucks, but oh well.

Also added a new variable to craftable items, which makes it so that you
can not delete a container's contents if you so wish (why was this the
default).

All this so that when you craft pickles, it actually crafts pickles
instead of cucumbers.

I spent hours on this, its 6:30am as I'm typing this. I'm tired. Fucking
pickles.

Super duper ultra thanks to FinalPotato for guiding me and suffering
with me through this and teaching me so much about DM and BYOND. I
cannot emphasize just how helpful and awesome they were thank you thank
you thank you <3
## Why It's Good For The Game

Bug fixing be good
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: The jar of pickles, after millenia, finally actually contains
pickles. All hail the jar of pickles.

Polishes some side sources of light and color (#73936)

## About The Pull Request

[Circuit Floor
Polish](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/6b0ee9813271f693ceb44ad42277c36ef2e71268)

Circuit floors glow! but it looks like crap cause it's dim and the
colors are washed out.
I'd like to make them look nicer. Let's make them more intense and
longer range, and change the colors over to more vivid replacements.

While I'm here, these should really use power and turn on and off based
off that.
Simple enough to do, just need to hook into a signal (and add a setter
for turf area, which cleans up other code too).

[Desklamp
Upgrade](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/8506b13b9c97bf740c3e97db04450555387dd126)

Desklamps look bad. They're fullwhite, have a way too large
range.Crummy.
Let's lower their lightrange from 5 to 3.5, and make the ornate ones
warmer, and the more utilitarian ones cooler. The clown one can be
yellow because it's funny

I'm renaming a color define here so I'm touching more files then you'd
expect

[Brightens
Niknacks](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/73936/commits/835bae28e9eb9946be53c9f5dac0a0a39f15ef21)

Increases the light range of request consoles, status displays,
newscasters, and air alarms (keycard machines too, when they're awaiting
input at least)
Increases the brightness of air alarms, I think they should be on par
with apcs, should be able to tell when they're good/bad.
Increases the brightness of vending machines (I want them to light up
the tiles around them very lightly, I think it's a vibe)

Fixes a bug with ai status displays where they'd display an emissive
even if they didn't have anything on their screen, looking stupid.
This was decently easy but required a define. Looked really bad tho

The niknack changes are more minor so I'm not gonna grab photos for
them. I can if you'd like but I don't think it's necessary. Mostly a
vibes in dark spaces sorta thing
 
## Changelog

:cl:
add: I made circuit floors brighter and more vivid.
add: Made air alarms, vending machines, newscasters, request consoles,
status displays and keycard machines slightly "brighter" (larger light
range, tho I did make air alarms a bit brighter too)
add: Tweaked desklamps. Lower range, and each type gets its own coloring
instead of just fullwhite.
fix: AI displays are no longer always emissive, they'll stop doing it if
they aren't displaying anything. Hopefully this'll look nicer

You can't instantly resist out of an unlocked labor camp teleporter if you are handcuffed (#73983)

## About The Pull Request

If you are restrained, and placed into an unlocked labor camp
teleporter, you cannot instantly resist out of it. However the resist
timer is cut in half while unlocked.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Getting someone into the gulag teleporter is an incredibly un-necessary
pain in the rear because simply *spamming resist* turns it into a game
where you have to shove them in, then really quick go over to the
computer and slam the lock button. This is... kinda lame. A lot of new
player security officers get got by this, and I think it's sad. Inb4
"Skill issue"

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
balance: If you are handcuffed, you can't instantly resist out of an
unlocked labor camp teleporter (however, resist time is halved).

platform: always reconfigure IP routes even if removed externally

NML3Cfg is stateful, that means it remembers which address/route it
configured earlier. That is important because the API users of NML3Cfg
only say what the want to configure now, and NML3Cfg needs to remove
addresses/routes that it configured earlier but are no longer to be
present. Also, NetworkManager wants to allow the user to add
addresses/routes externally with `ip addr|route add` and NetworkManager
not removing it. This is a common use case for dispatcher scripts, but
in general, we want to allow other components to add addresses/routes.

We try something similar with the removal of routes/addresses managed by
NetworkManager. When NetworkManager adds a route/address, which later
disappears, then we assume that the user intentionally removed the
address/route and take the hint to not re-add it.

However, it doesn't work. It is problematic for two reasons:

- kernel can automatically remove routes. For example, deleting an IPv4
  address that is the prefsrc of a route, will cause kernel to delete
  that route. Sure, we may be unable to re-configure the route at this
  moment, but we shouldn't remember indefinitely that the route is
  supposed to be absent. Rather, we should re-add it when possible.

- kernel is a pain with validating consistencies of routes. For example,
  when a route has a nexthop gateway, then the gateway must be onlink
  (directly reachable), or kernel refuses to add it with "Nexthop has
  invalid gateway". Of course, when removing the onlink route kernel is
  fine leaving the gateway route behind, which it would otherwise refuse
  to add.
  Anyway. Such interdependencies for when kernel rejects adding a route
  with "Nexthop has invalid gateway" are non-trivial. We try to work
  around that by always adding the necessary onlink routes. See
  nm_l3_config_data_add_dependent_onlink_routes(). But if the user
  externally removed the dependent onlink route, and NetworkManager
  remembers to not re-adding it, then the efforts from
  nm_l3_config_data_add_dependent_onlink_routes() are ignored. This
  causes ripple effects and NetworkManager will also be unable to add the
  nexthop route.

Trying to preserve absence of routes that NetworkManager would like to
configure is not tenable. Don't do it anymore. There was anyway no
guarantee that on the next update NetworkManager wouldn't try to re-add
the route in question. For example, if the route came from DHCP, and the
lease temporarily went away and came back, then NetworkManager probably
would have (correctly) forgotten that the user wished that the route be
absent. This did not work reliably and it just causes problems.

Full-PWA

Yay! So happy to have things getting this far now. I did some more cross-browser testing today, and everything is working great in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on desktop, as well as Safari on mobile, iPad *and* iOS!

Gonna start adding more nice-to-have PWA features, like Web Share, Web Share Target, File Handling, File System Access, you name it.

I didn't quite realize that both the Web App Manifest, and the Theme Color entry are both supported on Standalone mode on iOS! Just found that out in person today, and I was very suprised to see that! I think it was added a while back, but I think it took a little while for it to fully roll out, and be bug free.

https://firt.dev/notes/pwa-ios/

This makes PWA setup so much nicer now! You don't have to worry about iOS-specific meta tags anymore, it all just works exactly like you want it to. This is also the case for PWA icons, which is an even better thing to find out! Now you essentially only have to make two icon sizes (maybe 3, now that iOS is using them. I was using 192 and 512 before, and I think iOS likes to look for 180).

So I added fullscreen support using the Safe Area Insets style properties, created an initial app icon, Window Controls Overlay support, and a Web App Manifest for full (cross-platform) PWA installations.

Listened to almost 3 PT records so far tonight. Started with Stupid Dream, next Lightbulb Sun, and I'm at 'The Creator Has a Mastertape' on In Absentia now. That made me think of a new thing I haven't done before: Listen to a given artist's catalog fully all the way through in one go! That would be a very long day, but I'm gonna do it sometime. I really like the sound of that. I can't wait to try that with Marco Minnemann's solo work! I have all of his albums in my library, can't believe I have them all. I definitely recommend his work too! There's SOO much to listen to there. I'm starting to do that with Mike Keneally's catalog too, that's also taking some time for it to soak into my brain. Sometimes albums from those guys can take a while to really click, any of the progger guys for that matter XD. I think that's what I'm striving to have with my own writing too. Started listening through my next album projects, may start doing initial mixing for them tomorrow!

Consolidates some XSS under hivecore (#2738)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

Spawn pool and evo pods are removed and their functionality is
umbrella'd under the hive core. Sprites still exist though.

# Explain why it's good for the game

"Roleplay" has become an increasingly more popular and touchy subject
within the community as of recently. I, wholeheartedly agree, that
roleplay is an important aspect of the game, and there are ways to
improve it. One of these ways is through immersion. In this MR, it is
intended to increase player immersion.

One of the most memorable and haunting scenes in Aliens was when they
reached the hive and they found the bodies. This very unique and
cinematic scene was often able to be replicated in CM, with the marines
busting open the hive and finding all the chestbursted bodies of their
comrades. Roleplaying this out was commonplace. "Dear God... what did
they do to you..." or acting out in disgust are just a few of the many
ways having bodies in the hive positively impacted the game.

XSS was a failed attempt at spicing up the xenomorph gameplay loop at
the expense of immersion and should be at least somewhat reverted while
keeping balance in mind. A brief discussion with many prominent
xenomorph players, including those most experienced in queen, have not
particularly expressed favor to XSS either.

To start, let us remember why XSS (xeno special structures - hive core,
evo pods, morpher, pool, etc) was added.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_zDUmLdxpUzxj-GuWu7F4bSj4zBYzmZ39s_N5X7kQ0/edit
- This is the original development document for XSS.
Let us examine the major points:
1.Introduce a way for Xenomorph players to recycle - This idea was never
reached.

2.Reduce Xenomorph attrition - Grand objective was unsuccessful. Very
little changed.

3. Offer new avenues of play "by reducing the punishment of xenos dying"
- This never happened. Dying was still just as punishing, especially
with facehug nerfs.

The spawn pool - The idea of the spawn pool was successful and has
remained unchanged since. I would argue, however, it is not immersive.
Xenomorphs do not have bright, glowing, acidic pools in their hives.
(Yes I know there was a comic with a pool, and this is not how it was
used)

Egg Morpher - These used to be TURRETS. They are no longer turrets, and
their sprites have been broken for almost 4 years (the bodies put inside
of them used to show their face in the little purple part) They are
currently defunct facehugger reservoirs. I am in favor of removing them,
but I would argue that is a balance issue (number of huggers in play)

Evolution Pod - It was intended for these to be able to be eaten in
order to evolve. They haven't done this for years. Why do we still have
them? They take up 18 spaces of precious hive weeds, provide light,
(xenomorphs HATE light) and wherever a hive core is built, these are
also built. We can just merge them with the hive core because there is
no reason to have them anymore.

This PR currently completely removes the spawn pool and evolution pod
from gameplay, while reimagining their functions for current balance.
This PR is not intended to change balance in any way.

All functionality from the spawn pool in regards to "pooled" larva has
been given to the hive core, and they are now called "burrowed" larva.
Chestbursts now give two larva, this is to be kept with current balance
of two xenos per capture.

Evopod functionality and evolution speed boost was merged with the hive
core.

experimental_use(promise) (#25084)

* Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises

This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when 
something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
can run, then continue in a new task.

I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
separate commit.

* Move throwException to after work loop resumes

throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right 
before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
render the fiber again.

This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
(RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the 
RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
from appearing.

* Use expando to check whether promise has resolved

Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
resolved.

In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
the resolved value.

This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
by `Promise.allSettled`.

The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
without waiting a microtask.

* Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook

Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
implement it yet.

* use(promise)

Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components, 
but that is planned.

If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
"immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in 
previous commits.

Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing 
whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.

When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
principles largely apply.

The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
be deprecated.

Update Stylelint to v14, extend SCSS plugins, remove primer-* configs, resolve issues (#821)

This is a catch-all PR that modernizes and updates our Stylelint config, and resolves all open issues. This is a pretty big change - so I want to update all of our related dependencies in lockstep.

In particular, this PR

- [x] updates stylelint to `v14`
- [x] adds in the standard stylelint config for SCSS (`stylelint-config-standard-scss`)
- [x] swaps out `stylelint-config-prettier` for `stylelint-config-prettier-scss`
- [x] ~~properly update `@primer`-related plugins:~~ completely remove `primer` from our configuration
- [x] autofix, manually resolve, or disable all newly-introduced lint errors; **I've avoided manually resolving errors that would be a behavioural change**
- [x] re-runs `npm run format`

See the "next steps" section on some extra thoughts on disabling errors.

(implicitly, I'm also using node 16/the new package-lock format).

I've introduced several new disabled rules. Let me quickly explain what's going on; there are two categories of rules I've disabled:

1. rules that were temporary disables; they were frequent enough that I couldn't manually resolve them, but should be simple. **I plan on opening issues to re-enable each of these rules**, just after this PR
    - `declaration-block-no-redundant-longhand-properties`: this is just tedious and error-prone
    - `no-descending-specificity`: this one is tricky since it could have impacts on the cascade (though that seems unlikely)
    - `scss/no-global-function-names`: I think we need to [import map and then use `map.get`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64210390/sass-map-get-doesnt-work-map-get-does-what-gives), but I'll leave this as out of scope for now
2. rules that are long-term disables; due to the SASS-based nature of our theme, I think we'll keep these in limbo
    - `alpha-value-notation` causes problems with SASS using the `modern` syntax - literals like `50%` are not properly interpolated, and they cause formatting issues on the site
    - `color-function-notation` also causes problems with SASS, but in this case the `modern` syntax breaks SASS compilation; we're not alone (see this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71805735/error-function-rgb-is-missing-argument-green-in-sass)).

In addition, we have many inline `stylelint-disable` comments. I'd open a separate issue to audit them, especially since I think some disables are unnecessary.

**note: there hasn't been much other discussion, so I'm going to remove primer's stylelint config.**

If I do add `@primer/stylelint-config`, I get *a ton* of errors about now using `@primer`'s in-built SCSS variables. I imagine that we probably won't want to use these presets (though I could be wrong). In that case, I think we could either:

1. disable all of those rules
4. not use `@primer/stylelint-config`, since we're not actually using primer, and shift back to the standard SCSS config provided by Stylelint

~~Any thoughts here? I also don't have the original context as to why we do use the primer rules, perhaps @pmarsceill can chime in?~~

Boiler rework Part 1: Globber base boiler (#965)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

## About The Pull Request


A total redesign of the base boiler reminiscent of the old premoba
boiler that would shoot projectile "Globs" with a modern CM take.

Base boiler as it is right now, is completely unfun, to play against and
to even play as. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who enjoys
playing it past the first 10 minutes of doing so. It is this way not
because it's weak, but because it's unchallenging and 100% "safe"
gameplay. There are no combos, cool moves you can do, or even satisfying
effects, you just hit a button to spawn a telegraph which becomes a gas
cloud.

This PR, turns that right ontop of its head. Instead of "safe" gameplay,
globber's design philosophy is centered around being challenging, fun
and even adding new gameplay dynamics.

Globber will have higher HP, faster walkspeed, and faster firing bombard
compared to premoba.

However, globber will have their fellow xenos making plays to cover for
boiler, either directly through bodyblocking shots or making plays to
distract marines due to a minimal zoom range.

These both, in theory, will create a new gameplay dynamic where boilers
will still be able to block marine spearheads, but Globber needs to help
make a small counter push with their fellow brethren in order for
Globber to directly strike at marines and giving the Xenos the choice to
either capitalize on their advantage or heal up upon a successful glob.

Design doc
https://hackmd.io/@-h91mVK3RhaURcykLHRxJQ/S1W0FCZPj

### Details:
Globber will feature [TENTATIVE] higher HP and [TENTATIVE] faster walk
speed. It however will be slightly more vulnerable to fire as fire deals
[TENTATIVE]% more damage to it!


https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458150341742166017/1013647188313776148/2022-08-28_17-10-53.mov

Globber Active 1 - Bombard: Spit a large acid glob that will, upon
impact, immediately spread a gas glob of your choice

- Cooldown: 30 seconds
- cost: 200 plasma
- Windup: 5 seconds

Globber Active 2 - Acid spray, instantly sprays a line of acid, May make
it a cone spray if it is too weak

- 8 second c/d
- No windup
- 40 plasma
- 6 tile range

Globber Active 3 - Shift spits: Switch between acid and neuro gas globs.
Acid deals more raw damage while neuro slows,blinds and eventually
knocks down marines. Neuro has a larger radius than acid

Globber Active 4 - Acid shroud: A quick windup action that dumps an acid
cloud over the boiler. Cooldowns other abilities similar to dump acid.

Globber Active 5 - Zoom: Short ranged zoom with short windup. Trades
awareness for zoom

Globber Passive: Brute armor, Globber features brute armor, however, it
does not protect against flames! Globber takes 1.5x damage to fire!

Acid glob: Pretty much the same as before. May adjust numbers.

Neuro smoke rework:
- Instead of insta blindness and deafness, these will now have a chance
of applying for every tick you are in the smoke. You still have
blurry/weldervision though
- Oxyloss toned down, it was 9 per tick, now two
- Knockdown chance lowered to 5% per tick. Stamina damage replaces RNG
knockdowns
+ Now deals stamina damage, and am making it stack fast, targeted
knockdown time is 2-3 seconds
+ Minor immediate slowdown applied. May remove as it stacks with stamina
damage slow
+ chance of dealing minor tox damage

### Boiler rework as a whole

The boiler rework is a total rework of the boiler strain and it's
strains.

I'm not gonna write the entire design doc here, but in short:

-Base boiler will be reworked (as shown here), named Globber
- trapper will be totally scrapped for 'Grenadier', a heavy siege strain
that lobs devastating nades that's counterable and challenging.
Grenadier will have the same zoom as Globber
- A long-range, general-purpose strain will be added, named "Striker
Boiler", which combines both the Railgun boiler and the mostly forgotten
"Acid Splatter" strains in the past, with a modern CM twist.

## Why It's Good For The Game
TL;DR base boiler is a literal NPC strain that no one likes to play as
or against. Attempt to make it more fun or die trying

if the design philosophy fails, then we can simply just tweak a few
values and have premoba boiler again.

Design doc is already made but its ancient as shit and I'm just gonna
make a new one so its WIP for now.

[FIX] stock,purchase,mrp: accumulative security days

Usecase to reproduce:
- Set the warehouse as 3 steps receipt
- Put a security delay of 3 days for purchase
- Set a product with a vendor and 1 days as LT
- Replenish with the orderpoint

You expect to have a schedule date for tomorrow that contains all the
product needed in the incoming 4 days.

Currenly the internal transfer from QC -> Stock is for tomorrow (ok).
The transfer from Inpur -> QC is plan for 2 days in the past. (not ok)
The PO date is plan for 5 days in the past. (not ok)

It happens because the system check at each `stock.rule` application if
purchase is part of the route. If it's then it applies the security lead
time. It's a mistake because we should apply it only the first time.

To fix it we directly set it when the orderpoint run and not during
`stock.move` creation.
However for MTO it's not that easy. We don't want to deliver too
early the customer. So we keep applying the delay during the
`stock.move` creation but only when it goes under the warehouse stock
location.

kmod: add init function to usermodehelper

About 6 months ago, I made a set of changes to how the core-dump-to-a-pipe
feature in the kernel works.  We had reports of several races, including
some reports of apps bypassing our recursion check so that a process that
was forked as part of a core_pattern setup could infinitely crash and
refork until the system crashed.

We fixed those by improving our recursion checks.  The new check basically
refuses to fork a process if its core limit is zero, which works well.

Unfortunately, I've been getting grief from maintainer of user space
programs that are inserted as the forked process of core_pattern.  They
contend that in order for their programs (such as abrt and apport) to
work, all the running processes in a system must have their core limits
set to a non-zero value, to which I say 'yes'.  I did this by design, and
think thats the right way to do things.

But I've been asked to ease this burden on user space enough times that I
thought I would take a look at it.  The first suggestion was to make the
recursion check fail on a non-zero 'special' number, like one.  That way
the core collector process could set its core size ulimit to 1, and enable
the kernel's recursion detection.  This isn't a bad idea on the surface,
but I don't like it since its opt-in, in that if a program like abrt or
apport has a bug and fails to set such a core limit, we're left with a
recursively crashing system again.

So I've come up with this.  What I've done is modify the
call_usermodehelper api such that an extra parameter is added, a function
pointer which will be called by the user helper task, after it forks, but
before it exec's the required process.  This will give the caller the
opportunity to get a call back in the processes context, allowing it to do
whatever it needs to to the process in the kernel prior to exec-ing the
user space code.  In the case of do_coredump, this callback is ues to set
the core ulimit of the helper process to 1.  This elimnates the opt-in
problem that I had above, as it allows the ulimit for core sizes to be set
to the value of 1, which is what the recursion check looks for in
do_coredump.

This patch:

Create new function call_usermodehelper_fns() and allow it to assign both
an init and cleanup function, as we'll as arbitrary data.

The init function is called from the context of the forked process and
allows for customization of the helper process prior to calling exec.  Its
return code gates the continuation of the process, or causes its exit.
Also add an arbitrary data pointer to the subprocess_info struct allowing
for data to be passed from the caller to the new process, and the
subsequent cleanup process

Also, use this patch to cleanup the cleanup function.  It currently takes
an argp and envp pointer for freeing, which is ugly.  Lets instead just
make the subprocess_info structure public, and pass that to the cleanup
and init routines

Loadout - Sniper facepaint (#2015)

# About the pull request

This PR is here to add the sniper facepaint into the loadout for 4
points like the skull facepaint.
 
 I tested it and it worked well as expected.
 
I saw a lot of marines asking the sniper for their bodypaint recently,
and i thought, that since it doesnt change anything game-wise we could
give it on the loadout, as the sniper isnt always here and sometime even
throw it to the trash...also people wont annoy the sniper for his paint
too.

((sorry for the webedit i ran into some problem doing the PR with visual
code studio))

# Explain why it's good for the game

I think its good because it add more customisation to characters with
one more good looking facepaint and like i said earlier, i saw some
marines asking the sniper for it (talked about it on discord and people
seemed to be ok with it)

macsec: avoid heap overflow in skb_to_sgvec

While this may appear as a humdrum one line change, it's actually quite
important. An sk_buff stores data in three places:

1. A linear chunk of allocated memory in skb->data. This is the easiest
   one to work with, but it precludes using scatterdata since the memory
   must be linear.
2. The array skb_shinfo(skb)->frags, which is of maximum length
   MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This is nice for scattergather, since these fragments
   can point to different pages.
3. skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list, which is a pointer to another sk_buff,
   which in turn can have data in either (1) or (2).

The first two are rather easy to deal with, since they're of a fixed
maximum length, while the third one is not, since there can be
potentially limitless chains of fragments. Fortunately dealing with
frag_list is opt-in for drivers, so drivers don't actually have to deal
with this mess. For whatever reason, macsec decided it wanted pain, and
so it explicitly specified NETIF_F_FRAGLIST.

Because dealing with (1), (2), and (3) is insane, most users of sk_buff
doing any sort of crypto or paging operation calls a convenient function
called skb_to_sgvec (which happens to be recursive if (3) is in use!).
This takes a sk_buff as input, and writes into its output pointer an
array of scattergather list items. Sometimes people like to declare a
fixed size scattergather list on the stack; othertimes people like to
allocate a fixed size scattergather list on the heap. However, if you're
doing it in a fixed-size fashion, you really shouldn't be using
NETIF_F_FRAGLIST too (unless you're also ensuring the sk_buff and its
frag_list children arent't shared and then you check the number of
fragments in total required.)

Macsec specifically does this:

        size += sizeof(struct scatterlist) * (MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1);
        tmp = kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);
        *sg = (struct scatterlist *)(tmp + sg_offset);
	...
        sg_init_table(sg, MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1);
        skb_to_sgvec(skb, sg, 0, skb->len);

Specifying MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1 is the right answer usually, but not if you're
using NETIF_F_FRAGLIST, in which case the call to skb_to_sgvec will
overflow the heap, and disaster ensues.

signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].

Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."

So instead, use a bog-standard check that isn't nearly as ugly.

Incorret theme should not prevent napari from start (#5605)

# Description
<!-- What does this pull request (PR) do? Why is it necessary? -->
<!-- Tell us about your new feature, improvement, or fix! -->
<!-- If your change includes user interface changes, please add an
image, or an animation "An image is worth a thousand words!" -->
<!-- You can use https://www.cockos.com/licecap/ or similar to create
animations -->

For the current implementation, the error in theme registration prevents
the napari form from starting. It may be problematic for bundle users.

In this PR I add `try: ... except` to handle an error during theme
registration and convert it to logging exceptions. I use logging because
it happened before creating GUI.

## Final checklist:
- [ ] My PR is the minimum possible work for the desired functionality
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my
feature works
- [ ] If I included new strings, I have used `trans.` to make them
localizable.

Matterforge Recipe expansion (#5168)

## About The Pull Request

This PR adds a few more matterforge recipes, some of stupidly high
difficulty and pointless rewards if miners are doing their job (looking
at you steel to gold), some of more usefulness (gold to plat, plat to
osmium). All require different temperature and energy ranges so they
cannot be rushed thoroughly. Not much thought was put into realism but
eh who cares, the matterforge is a cool thing ingame and its fun to use.
Some temperatures ranges (Steel to gold) are very narrow hence the use
of a gyrotron would be needed to get the most out of it. Or precise
heating (temperature can be raised to exorbitant amounts to prevent
heater cheese). This also would allow for Research to collab with cargo
for exports specially if dynamic prices ever come. In particular looking
at the gold to plat transmutation here. Plat can be exported by cargo in
which cargo can order more shit from.

I aint a good coder else I would add specific atmospheric conditions
needed, not just temperature (e.g. N2O must be present).
Reminded me a bit of TGs gas reactions but less gamy. 

## Why It's Good For The Game

More Matterforge recipes. Most relatively pointless and niche, some
allow science to give cargo something to sell, others can help with
theres an overabundance of Plat due to new miners. Mostly just giving
some extra uses for the forge. Oh and an alternative way to get plasteel
while sacrificing phoron sheets. Also bragging rights of effectively
turning iron (and carbon) into gold at specific temperatures and energy
levels on the particle focus.

A proper coder should check if these recipes are fine. Its 2:30 AM and I
thought this would just be neat.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Various matterforge recipes

Admins can now choose where fish go (#73109)

## About The Pull Request

I've pigeonholed myself as the fish guy now. It seems like someone made
events easier to add admin controls for so I thought I'd add some to the
event I most recently touched.

Instead of letting the RNG choose admins can now direct a circle of carp
to converge upon a specific location, or even a trail of specific
locations if they want the carp to just sort of swim in a circle around
the space station (although the ones on the far side of the station from
the starting point will travel all the way through it to get there).
This also works with magicarp.
They don't really move fast enough for you to use this to punish a
specific person but you can use it to annoy a specific location full of
people.

Plausibly there's no reason the code _wouldn't_ work for a specified
atom instead of a turf (as long as it sticks to one z level) but I
couldn't think of an elegant way of selecting that whereas "use my
current ghost location" is very intuitive, so I didn't add one.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Plausibly this permits admins do more fun things.

## Changelog

:cl:
admin: Admins can direct where carp (or magicarp) are interested in
going when manually triggering the event

Create kiwisucks.html

Kiwi is a very bad parakeet, there is no wonder why nobody likes her, first of all, she is trying to impersonate Goose, who is better then kiwi. First, shes green, Second, shes annoying, and lastly, she is a bad bird who gets sensetive at everything. At the end of the day, everyone knows that kiwi sucks, and Goose is better then her in every possible way.

supplies sprite

The unenlightened masses
They cannot make the judgment call
Give up free will forever
Their voices won't be heard at all
Display obedience
While never stepping out of line
And blindly swear allegiance
Let your country control your mind
Live in ignorance
And purchase your happiness
When blood and sweat is the real cost
Thinking ceases, the truth is lost
Don't you worry
You'll be told exactly what to do
I give my people the lives they need
The righteous will succeed
The fires of greed will burn the weak
So we'll make freedom obsolete
Making whole the fabric of society
Collective consciousness controlled as you will see
MIND CONTROL
Let your country control your soul
Let your country control your soul
Let your country control your soul
Let your country control your soul

[MIRROR] Brings the monkey back down (body horror edition/addition.) [MDB IGNORE] (#19572)

* Brings the monkey back down (body horror edition/addition.) (#73325)

## About The Pull Request
Let me paint you a story.
A long time ago monkeys once rested their feet on the floor, this was a
time of bliss and peace. But sometime around the horrors of making
monkeys subtypes of humans did an atrocity occur.

**The monkeys were moved up.**
I thought this was bad, and alot of people on the forum tended to agree
with me

This was do to some purpose of adjusting them so it could be easier to
fit item sprites onto them instead of preforming the hours of work
refractoring to make the heights of the items dynamic and adjustable. A
simple pixel shift may have sufficed, but you see, such a change would
NEVER allow the frankensteining of monkey and human features together.
This is that refractor.

In essence, the following is now true.
A top_offset can now be generated for a human based on a varible on
their chest and legs. By default, and as is true with human legs and
chests, this variable is ZERO by default. Monkey legs and chest have
NEGATIVE values proportionate and onto how much smaller their sprite is
compared to humans. Other bodyparts, as well as any other accociated
overlays, or clothing will automatically be offset to this axis. THIS
MEANS THAT MONKEYS ARE ON THE FLOOR. But is means something else too.
Something more freakish,

**What abominable monsters**, unreachable by players as long as we can't
stitch monkeys and humans together (oh but just wait until the feature
freeze ends)
Oh but you might be thinking, if legs can make a mob go down.
can it make a mob

**go**
**up??**

**OH NO**

These lads are stepping, and have been implemented solely for proof of
concept as a way to flex the system I have created and remain
inaccessible without admin intervention.

But really, when all is said and done, all this PR does in terms of
player facing changes is move the monkey back down.

Oh and fixed monkey husked which have been broken for who knows how
long.

## Why It's Good For The Game
The monkey is restored to its original position. Tools now exist to have
legs and torsos of varying heights. Monkey Husking is fixed.
## Changelog
:cl: itseasytosee
fix: Monkeys ues the proper husk sprites.
imageadd: The monkey has been moved back down to its lower, more
submissive position.
refactor: Your bodyparts are now dynamically rendered at a height
relevant to the length of your legs and torso, what does this mean for
you? Not much to be honest, but you might see a monkey pop up a bit if
you cut its legs off.
admin: The Tallboy is here

Command Line Interface for the new gpt-4 model. Just a demo for shaking out the dust on this connection. Usage should be apparent from the code but here's a basic:
python CLI_GPT4.py -u "it's raining" -a "Dogs like people."
prints the outgoing message:
[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a happy idea bot, you give people ideas that make them happy'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "it's raining"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Dogs like people.'}]
and the reply:
How about having a fun indoor game day with your family or friends? You can play board games, video games, or even create your own DIY games. Enjoy some healthy competition and laughter as you make the most of the rainy day. Don't forget to prepare some snacks and cozy beverages like hot chocolate or warm tea to complete the experience.
