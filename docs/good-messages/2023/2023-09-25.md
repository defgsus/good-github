Gun kits don't need cable coil or tools, halved crafting time (#78419)

## About The Pull Request

Crafting R&D guns from gun kits no longer requires tools or cable coil.
The decloner and energy crossbow still need reagents.

Halved R&D gun crafting time. 20->10 seconds.

## Why It's Good For The Game

These changes were made a long, long while ago and honestly while I
understand gun kits I don't understand why it was made So. Annoying. To
make the fucking guns once you got everything ready. It makes it a total
annoyance. You spent 40 minutes getting all the tech for it, you
shouldn't have to also get tools and cables and wait 20 seconds standing
still.

Anyone who has played ingame like any time after that change can attest
how underused any R&D gun is now. X-ray laser guns still DESTROY blobs
but people don't even THINK about them because of the dumb annoying
recipe (alongside RnD being a pain now).

Simply put this just. Makes life easier for security officers. And
reduces tool dependency.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Crafting R&D guns from gun kits no longer requires tools or cable
coil. The decloner and energy crossbow still need reagents.
qol: Halved R&D gun crafting time. 20->10 seconds.

Rounded supermatter delamination times to 5 seconds, restored old mood messages (#78335)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Makes the supermatter delaminate in 15 seconds instead of 13 and 5
seconds instead of 3 if a sliver has been taken from it, mainly to
please perfectionists (me and some others who commented on the PR) as
well as giving people at least a chance to escape delam round removal.

I don't like it when flavorful text is replaced by bland and
not-as-funny alternatives.
Also, how the hell is it gamey for staff to know the engineers are in
charge of the power?
It's honestly more gamey for them to know what a resonance cascade or
supermatter delamination is, so I'd say you've done the opposite of what
the goal was with the message changes on top of making them less fun in
general. I disapprove.

Oh, yeah, and the SM now reports the times correctly due to it reporting
them every 5 seconds, meaning people would only see the 10 second
announcement. Now there is going to be a 15 second announcement as well.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

Watering down messages to be bland is just, like, less fun, ya know?
I didn't see a single person in support of the message changes apart
from the PR author, everyone else was just complaining about them,
including myself.

Also, several people mentioned the fact it could just be 15 instead of
13 for a nice round number, including myself. I also made the sliver
delamination time 5 seconds instead of 3 seconds because you pretty much
can't get out in time, especially if the game is laggy. 3 - 5 people
being round removed because of one traitor objective with no chance to
escape it is just bad gameplay.

Oh, and, bugfix good, I suppose.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP

note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
balance: Supermatter now takes 15 seconds to delaminate normally and 5
if a sliver has been taken from it. Gives a little more time to escape
in the case of the sliver and also evens out the times to please
perfectionists.
fix: Supermatter now accurately reports it's detonation time.
spellcheck: Supermatter mood descriptions have been reverted back to
their old, more flavorful selves.

xfs: reserve less log space when recovering log intent items

Wengang Wang reports that a customer's system was running a number of
truncate operations on a filesystem with a very small log.  Contention
on the reserve heads lead to other threads stalling on smaller updates
(e.g.  mtime updates) long enough to result in the node being rebooted
on account of the lack of responsivenes.  The node failed to recover
because log recovery of an EFI became stuck waiting for a grant of
reserve space.  From Wengang's report:

"For the file deletion, log bytes are reserved basing on
xfs_mount->tr_itruncate which is:

    tr_logres = 175488,
    tr_logcount = 2,
    tr_logflags = XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES,

"You see it's a permanent log reservation with two log operations (two
transactions in rolling mode).  After calculation (xlog_calc_unit_res()
adds space for various log headers), the final log space needed per
transaction changes from  175488 to 180208 bytes.  So the total log
space needed is 360416 bytes (180208 * 2).  [That quantity] of log space
(360416 bytes) needs to be reserved for both run time inode removing
(xfs_inactive_truncate()) and EFI recover (xfs_efi_item_recover())."

In other words, runtime pre-reserves 360K of space in anticipation of
running a chain of two transactions in which each transaction gets a
180K reservation.

Now that we've allocated the transaction, we delete the bmap mapping,
log an EFI to free the space, and roll the transaction as part of
finishing the deferops chain.  Rolling creates a new xfs_trans which
shares its ticket with the old transaction.  Next, xfs_trans_roll calls
__xfs_trans_commit with regrant == true, which calls xlog_cil_commit
with the same regrant parameter.

xlog_cil_commit calls xfs_log_ticket_regrant, which decrements t_cnt and
subtracts t_curr_res from the reservation and write heads.

If the filesystem is fresh and the first transaction only used (say)
20K, then t_curr_res will be 160K, and we give that much reservation
back to the reservation head.  Or if the file is really fragmented and
the first transaction actually uses 170K, then t_curr_res will be 10K,
and that's what we give back to the reservation.

Having done that, we're now headed into the second transaction with an
EFI and 180K of reservation.  Other threads apparently consumed all the
reservation for smaller transactions, such as timestamp updates.

Now let's say the first transaction gets written to disk and we crash
without ever completing the second transaction.  Now we remount the fs,
log recovery finds the unfinished EFI, and calls xfs_efi_recover to
finish the EFI.  However, xfs_efi_recover starts a new tr_itruncate
tranasction, which asks for 360K log reservation.  This is a lot more
than the 180K that we had reserved at the time of the crash.  If the
first EFI to be recovered is also pinning the tail of the log, we will
be unable to free any space in the log, and recovery livelocks.

Wengang confirmed this:

"Now we have the second transaction which has 180208 log bytes reserved
too. The second transaction is supposed to process intents including
extent freeing.  With my hacking patch, I blocked the extent freeing 5
hours. So in that 5 hours, 180208 (NOT 360416) log bytes are reserved.

"With my test case, other transactions (update timestamps) then happen.
As my hacking patch pins the journal tail, those timestamp-updating
transactions finally use up (almost) all the left available log space
(in memory in on disk).  And finally the on disk (and in memory)
available log space goes down near to 180208 bytes.  Those 180208 bytes
are reserved by [the] second (extent-free) transaction [in the chain]."

Wengang and I noticed that EFI recovery starts a transaction, completes
one step of the chain, and commits the transaction without completing
any other steps of the chain.  Those subsequent steps are completed by
xlog_finish_defer_ops, which allocates yet another transaction to
finish the rest of the chain.  That transaction gets the same tr_logres
as the head transaction, but with tr_logcount = 1 to force regranting
with every roll to avoid livelocks.

In other words, we already figured this out in commit 929b92f64048d
("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction
reservation"), but should have applied that logic to each intent item's
recovery function.  For Wengang's case, the xfs_trans_alloc call in the
EFI recovery function should only be asking for a single transaction's
worth of log reservation -- 180K, not 360K.

Quoting Wengang again:

"With log recovery, during EFI recovery, we use tr_itruncate again to
reserve two transactions that needs 360416 log bytes.  Reserving 360416
bytes fails [stalls] because we now only have about 180208 available.

"Actually during the EFI recover, we only need one transaction to free
the extents just like the 2nd transaction at RUNTIME.  So it only needs
to reserve 180208 rather than 360416 bytes.  We have (a bit) more than
180208 available log bytes on disk, so [if we decrease the reservation
to 180K] the reservation goes and the recovery [finishes].  That is to
say: we can fix the log recover part to fix the issue. We can introduce
a new xfs_trans_res xfs_mount->tr_ext_free

{
  tr_logres = 175488,
  tr_logcount = 0,
  tr_logflags = 0,
}

"and use tr_ext_free instead of tr_itruncate in EFI recover."

However, I don't think it quite makes sense to create an entirely new
transaction reservation type to handle single-stepping during log
recovery.  Instead, we should copy the transaction reservation
information in the xfs_mount, change tr_logcount to 1, and pass that
into xfs_trans_alloc.  We know this won't risk changing the min log size
computation since we always ask for a fraction of the reservation for
all known transaction types.

This looks like it's been lurking in the codebase since commit
3d3c8b5222b92, which changed the xfs_trans_reserve call in
xlog_recover_process_efi to use the tr_logcount in tr_itruncate.
That changed the EFI recovery transaction from making a
non-XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for one transaction's worth of log
space to a XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for two transactions worth.

Fixes: 3d3c8b5222b92 ("xfs: refactor xfs_trans_reserve() interface")
Complements: 929b92f64048d ("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction reservation")

App Menus!

Been wanting to set this up for a long time now! It's actually really nice to set up the defaults. TypeScript really helps with this especially too.

https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/accelerator (I thought this was to do with the menus, but this is instead the keyboard shortcuts standalone, themselves)
https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/menu#examples (Big help here, this is great actually!)
https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/menu-item (Related to the last part, it's the actual class instance that is built after using the templates. It's the instances which hold the menu metadata and options themselves on there)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aIanHYViOM (A great big help for this too, thank you!)

Been listening to some of the albums in this playlist last night and today during this session. I've felt like I'm in a creative stagnation for music writing recently, so I'm trying to go back to older songs, and try out new stuff to get my ideas reset a little bit again. These first two bands are sick, I really like the both two albums this playlist starts with 🔥 (This is much heavier than what I listen to normally, but I think it's what I've been looking for maybe? looked up 'ambient metal' the other day, and found this and other gems, because of that. I think I looked up black metal/progressive black metal to find this one though hehe)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHDAKPW4lgk&list=PL9FMwl2Y6WAdiuvoMqGrVdktDPuFts51Q&index=2

I'm very surprised and sad about the departure of Salvatore from Thank You Scientist; just heard today he's leaving the band. Sounds like he heavily misses his family though, so I totally feel for him in his choice to do that. I'd rather him be honest like that and make that call, than to deal with not doing what he truly wants do/has to. I'm glad I found Thank You Scientist when I did, I hope they keep going, I'd love to see them live someday!

just so we all know: my family or friends of my family do not represent all of India or Indian culture, whatsoever, especially my overseas relatives. None of this has or ever will. It's always been about individual motivations. No one can own an entire country's history or culture, and anyone who attempted to say they were right about me because they are related to or of the same origins as me are just liars whom should not be trusted with financial or political boons of any kind, and such a thing should serve a valuable lesson to future organizations. That said, and I will address this elsewhere in detail, I do understand how some corporate and political leaders could not say "no" to some of the people involved, because you feared looking rascist. Anyway, I'm sure we can all agree had you found a way to say "no" behind closed doors months or years ago, this would have ended and would never have caused you as much trouble or pain. That said, it's been extremely validating to me and my reasons to keep distance from parts of my family. The largest lesson I learned is that I should protect my direct relatives - particularly my mother and father - from getting tied into these things again as it will be taken out of their control by their overseas relatives. I'm sorry for all the trouble they have caused you, particularly political and corporate leaders. I wish the best of luck to the upcoming negotiations and hope they go as smoothly as the recent ones this weekend.

You can do revival surgery on Ian (#78288)

## About The Pull Request

Allows you to perform revival surgery on any mob which is organic or
looks humanoid.
This means yes: Corgis, Goliaths, ~~Syndicate mobs~~ not those because
they spawn human corpses and delete themselves.
No: Slimes, Ghosts, General Beepsky.

Splits revival surgery into a subtype used for "mobs" and a subtype for
"mobs with brains" as the former don't have any brains to damage.

Additionally by special request, Ian can now wear an eyepatch and will
automatically put one on if he is brought back from death.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/eff91bf6-4f80-4d8b-9062-1a5d4af85d39)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Currently you revive dead pets either by creating a magical reagent out
of holy water or by buying a mining item which also brainwashes them,
however reasonably our skilled medical team should be able to put a dog
back together and now can.
When you fuck up one of the stages of Tend Wounds on a kitten and stab
it to death with your scalpel, now you can fix it.
Expands the possibilities of vetinerary roleplay.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Many kinds of mobs can now be brought back to life through revival
surgery.
add: Dogs can wear eyepatches.

[MIRROR] Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms [MDB IGNORE] (#23881)

* Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms (#78121)

## About The Pull Request

Remade from #77961 because coders dont like bloat in prs

Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms. Paramedics don't get
one.

You can now swear the Hippocratic oath with these busts! It'll give you
pacifism but nothing else. The process is reversible.

There's a very small chance that the Hippocrates bust was once wielded
by a certain German doctor. This chance is increased for coroner
heirlooms.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms. Paramedics don't get
one.

I got this idea and I just couldn't get it out of my head, it's too
funny. Paramedics don't get one because they're powergamers and laugh at
the Oath, and also it doesn't feel like a paramedic thing.

> You can now swear the Hippocratic oath with these busts! It'll give
you pacifism but nothing else. The process is reversible.

This is just a little fun thing you can choose to do, i think it'd be
cute to see doctors swearing the oath in medbay. Plus it's reversible
which can be even funnier depending on the occassion.

> There's a very small chance that the Hippocrates bust was once wielded
by a certain German doctor. This chance is increased for coroner
heirlooms.

We DO already have precedent for references with the entrenching tool
after all. The buff isn't all that special in reality, getting a medical
hud while in your hand is... basically irrelevant for the roles that
literally spawn with a med hud? It's just for accuracy and rule of
cool's sake.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

I remember I coded the first few versions using "returns of dereferences" the beginning of this year the first week I created this repository

N' now I'm getting praised for that "ET technology" again

Personally I only see it as I broke my code myself trying to make it better b' it turned out it had been the thing n' since it's github so we can check on the original #.c/#.h files

[cli][frameworks][fs-detectors][next] detect framework versions (#9009)

This PR:

- updates `packages/frameworks` to have most supported frameworks specify which dependency version should reflect the overall framework version
- updates `packages/fs-detectors` to allow framework detection that returns the full `Framework` record instead of just the slug
- updates `packages/next` to return the detected Next.js version in the build result
- updates `packages/cli` to leverage these changes so that `vc build` can add `framework: { version: string; }` to `config.json` output

The result is that Build Output API and supported frameworks will return their framework version in the build result of `vc build` when possible, which is used by the build container  when creating the deployment. The dashboard later retrieves this value to display in richer deployment outputs.

Supports:

- https://github.com/vercel/api/pull/15601
- https://github.com/vercel/front/pull/18319

---

With the related build container updates, we get to see Next.js version in the build output. You'll see this with BOA+Prebuilt or a normal deploy:

<img width="1228" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 2 48 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41545/206793639-f9cd3bdf-b822-45dd-9564-95b94994271d.png">

---

### The Path to this PR

I went through all the supported frameworks and figured out how to best determine their versions. For most of them, we can check a known dependency's installed version number. 

We can get most of the way only checking npm. For a handful, we'd have to support Go/Ruby/Rust/Whatever dependencies.

I started with a more complex method signature to allow for later expansion without changing the signature. It looked like this, in practice:

```
async getVersion(dependencies: DependencyMap) => depedencies['next']
```

However, after checking all currently supported frameworks, I don't think this will end up being necessary. It also has the constraint that all dependencies have to be gathered and presented to the function even though it only needs to check for one or two. That's not a huge deal if we have them already where we need them, but we don't. We could use a variant here where this function does its own lookups, but this seemed unnecessary and would beg for duplication and small variances that could cause bugs.

Further, if we only look at `package.json`, we're going to either see a specific version of a version range. To be precise, we have to look at the installed version of the package. That means checking one of the various types of lockfiles that can exist or poking into node_modules.

If we poke into node_modules to detect the installed version, we introduce another point where Yarn 3 (default mode) will not be supported. If we read lockfiles, we have to potentially parse `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn` lockfiles.

If we use `npm ls <package-name>`, that also fails in Yarn 3 (default mode). We could accept that and go forward anyway, which would look like:

```
const args = `ls ${packageName} --depth=0 --json`.split(' ');
const { stdout } = await execa('npm', args, { cwd });
const regex = new RegExp(String.raw`${packageName}@([\.\d]+)`);
const matches = stdout.match(regex);
if (matches) {
  return matches[1];
}
```

But it turns out there's a `--json` option! That's what I ended up using, for now.

We could explore the lockfile route more, but after some initial digging, it' non-trivial. There are 3 main lockfiles we'd want to check for (npm, pnpm, and yarn) and there are different lockfile versions that put necessary data in different places. I looked for existing tools that parse this, but I didn't find any. We could certainly go down this path, but the effort doesn't seem worth it when `npm ls` gets us really close.

---

### Follow-up Versioning

Now that we know how to determine version per framework, we can vary configuration by version. In a future PR, we could allow a given value to vary by version number:

```
name: (version) => {
  if (semver.gt(version, '9.8.7')) {
    return 'some-framework-2''
  }

  return 'some-framework';
}
```

However, it may still be easier to differentiate significant versions by adding multiple entries in the list.

Desouls Hivelord (#78213)

## About The Pull Request


![dreammaker_RJz4brjobM](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/e5e4a3e9-ea6b-47f9-887c-3339d24d3fa8)

Replaces the sprite of the hivelord with a new one, in my continuing
quest to annihilate the old asteroid mob sprites.
A (never completed) asteroid mob resprite was actually my first PR, this
one is my 200th.
I am also planning on fucking with basic mob versions of these mobs some
time but the sprites can be atomised out.

In addition to replacing the old-ass MSPaint sprites, this PR also adds
a short death animation effect to the hivelord brood (from hivelords or
legions) which looks nicer than them just vanishing instantly upon
death.

Look at this video for an example of the animation:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKaskN5-y2A

## Why It's Good For The Game

Looks nicer.

## Changelog

[TEST-MERGE FIRST] Wound refactor number two: Full synthetic support (#78124)

## About The Pull Request

Heavily refactors wounds AGAIN.

The primary thing this PR does is completely change how wounds are
generated and added - while the normal "hit a guy til they bleed" stuff
works about the same, asking for a specific type of wound, say, like how
vending machines try to apply a compound fracture sometimes, isnt going
to work if we ever get any non-organic wounds, which the previous
refactor allowed.

With this PR, however...
* You can now ask for a specific type of wound via
get_corresponding_wound_type(), which takes wound types, a limb, wound
series, etc. and will try to give you a wound fitting those
specifications - but also, a wound that can be applied to a limb.
* This will allow for a vending machine to apply a compound fracture to
a human, but a collapsed superstructure (assuming my synth wounds go in)
to a robot

There are now new "series types" and "wound specific types" that allow
us to designate what series are "mainline" and randomly generatable, and
what are "alternate types" and must be generated manually - you can see
the documentation in wounds.dm.

The behavior of limping and interaction delays has been abstracted to
datum/wound from bone wounds to allow just, general ease of development

Pregen data now allows for series-specific wound penalties. Example: You
could set a burn wound's series wound penalty to 40, which would make
wound progression in the burn category easier - but it would not make it
any easier to get a slashing wound. As it stands wound penalties are for
wounds globally

Scar files are now picked in a "priority" list, where the wound checks
to see if the limb has a biostate before moving down in said list.
Example: Wounds will check for flesh first, if it finds it - it will use
the flesh scar list. Failing that, they then check bone - if it uses
that, it will use the bone scar list. This allows for significantly more
modular scars that dont even need much proc editing when a new wound
type is added

Misc changes: most initial() usage has been replaced by singleton
datums, wound_type is now wound_types and thus wounds can accept
multiple wound types, wounds can now accept multiple tool behaviors for
treatment, wounds now have a picking weight so we can make certain
wounds rarer flatly,

This PR also allows for wounds to override lower severity wounds on
generation, allowing eswords to jump to avulsions - but in spirit of
refactoring, this has been disabled by default (see pregen data's
competition_mode var).
## Why It's Good For The Game

Code quality is good!

Also, all the changes above allow wounds to be a MUCH more modular
system, which is one of its biggest problems right now - everything is
kinda hardcoded and static, making creative work within wounds harder to
do.

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Refactored wounds yet again
fix: Wounds are now picked from the most severe down again, meaning
eswords can jump to avulsions
fix: Scar descs are now properly applied

levels: various QOL fixes.

Generally there should be nothing *necessary to finish a level* that requires any of:
- straferunning;
- extremely sensitive timing that could softlock you if you're on keyboard, lagging in multiplayer or have motor issues;
- checking only for a sound cue that something has happened;
- remembering how to distinguish two visually nearly identical areas; or
- backtracking to a previous area on the map that you had previously been given no reason to revisit.

I haven't caught all of them by any stretch of the imagination but it's a start.

Also some regular minor fixes.

E1M9
- Fixed some textures around the big blue-trimmed lift and removed an extraneous use line that triggered a faraway lift for no reason.
- The red key bridge lowerable section is now textured differently from the rest of the bridge.

E3M5
- Teleporter platform to get back up to the catwalk from the northeastern blood maze is now clearly marked as having a switch, as it is a mandatory progression rather than a secret.

E4M8
- Got rid of some fake contrasts on the noodles at the start.
- Added a radsuit for the northwest switch. While it is possible to avoid damage even without straferun, unless you've got a tic counter display and can time it to the damage interval this is basically RNG.
- The water flat on top of the lowering wall in the east was very, very noticeable. The switch is now stepped on instead of hit. (Not too sure if the secret isn't *too* obscure now...)
- Removed asymmetrical doortrak on the slime bridge on the southeastern piston switch.
- The linedefs of said slime bridge pit are flipped so a deathmatch opponent trying to grab the berserk in there is not magically immune to rocket blasts. (see #996)
- Realigned the four pistons by the gate to the starship. They also reveal moving parts when activated - not nearly as good as the crushers on the original DI, but better than nothing.
- Made the southern walls use PLAT1 to make it more obvious that those walls will lower later (with the added bonus that they match the four pistons).
- The southern light bronze area now has a strip to guide the player towards the switch in case they lose track of their direction while fighting monsters and forget to explore inside that area, as well as to better distinguish it from the southeast.
- The gate threshold to the southern light bronze area now matches that of the pre-opened southeast.
- There is now actually a threshold where you can tell where the starport ends and the ship begins.
- The two light bronze areas are a bit too similar-looking. Added a few health boosts so the player can spot/be attacked by them and know this is an unexplored area.

Map11
- The lift going down into the yellow key room requires a switch that is out of sight from the lift itself, which is not clearly marked as a lift to begin with. The only real way to realize what's going on if you don't already know about the lift is to locate the sound and immediately turn to investigate before the lift comes back up. I thought this was annoying when I first did my big overhaul of this map, but ultimately left the basic mechanism alone out of an abundance of caution; however, with the recent discussion of accessibility in the proposed changes to the documentation I'm revisiting this. That upper switch now lowers a wall to reveal the lift which is triggered by a walk line.
- The lower far switch on that same lift was actually literally *impossible* to make on keyboard and no straferun (and no vanilla wallbounce exploit), even if I change it to a regular lift instead of fast. This is completely unacceptable for something necessary to progression (rather than an obscure secret). The lower switches are now permanent repeatable floor-lowerers, while the line crossing from the lift into the lower chamber is a permanent repeatable floor-raiser, with the line crossing into the lift from above being a simple lift line.
- Retextured the stairs out of the water in the eastern branch so it's not an unreadable mess of criss-crossing grey lines.
- Realigned the new skull switch texture in the skull room.

Map19
- One of the stealth worms was stuck in a burning barrel.
- Removed monster block flag on line 2083.
- Unmerged and remerged a few identical sectors to better match the intended sound travel.
- Flagged line 281 as a monster blocker. This allows the player to always be able to make the jump onto that bottom stair without being blocked by the octaminator.
- That octaminator is now a pain bringer in easy mode. The far end of that platform path is well outside the maximum vertical autoaim range in vanilla, which means that to actually hit the octaminator without up/down aiming you'd have to be on one of the later platforms - i.e., confined to a relatively narrow area with no cover *against an opponent that has seeker missiles*. The best way to solve this is to charge towards the octaminator as fast and as soon as possible with the SSG, minigun, or ripsaw+prayer to RNGsus that you'll get a good painlock. This is not the kind of tactic the sort of person who *needs* to play on easy will think to do, or could do while also being ready to sidestep if the octaminator fires at the wrong time.
- 347 and 249 are now also monster blockers, and the worms in that slime pit have been moved to the platform just behind the combat slug since they're awakened early on and that's where you'll first encounter them anyway.
- Replaced the teleport pad in the vertical platforming sequence with a lift, to minimize disorientation and going the wrong way. (In retrospect I probably could have just made the teleport destination face the pit you came in from, but the lift worked aesthetically better anyway.)
- A good chunk of that entire platforming area has been moved 8 units to the west so that things would align with the flat grid.
- Lines 307 and 309 are now also monster blockers. The worm that would be trapped between them is now moved further down the route and marked ambush.

Map20
- Removed the useless, misleading skull switch texture on the bars at the start.
- The door leading into the blue key arena needs no blue key; the door leading out needs a blue key. Both are marked with blue-light trim. Removed the blue lights on the first one.
- The lowering wall leading to the teleporter now uses a pipe texture.
- The door leading out of the giant quadruped arena now has a bright flickering light.
- Yellow key is another case of effectively-randomly-mandatory damage. Added a path.
- Same with the lava tunnel on the red key route.

Map25
- The silver lift near the river and shack is now activated by SW1GSTON switch right on the wall at eye level, rather than counterintuitively and invisibly recessed into additional sectors.
- The painlord ambush lift is now accessible after the encounter. A small health refill has been added there for easy and medium.

pseudo: Fix to work with glibc 2.38

This adds a horrible hack to get pseudo working with glibc 2.38. We can't
drop _GNU_SOURCE to something like _DEFAULT_SOURCE since we need the defines
the gnu options bring in. That leaves using internal glibc defines to disable
the c23 versions of strtol/fscanf and friends. Which would break pseudo
build with 2.38 from running on hosts with older glibc.

We'll probably need to come up with something better but this gets glibc 2.38
and working and avoids autobuilder failures.

aider: Add option for users to input a URL and fetch data from it.

# Aider chat conversation:

USER: Add proper description and tags to the github repo

ASSISTANT: As an AI, I don't have the ability to directly interact with GitHub to add a description and tags to your repository. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

1. **Adding a Description to Your Repository**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the "Edit" button near the repository name.
   - In the "Description" field, enter a brief summary of your project. For example, "A Streamlit web application for exploring and manipulating CSV datasets."
   - Click "Save".

2. **Adding Tags (Topics) to Your Repository**
   - Under your repository name, click the "Manage topics" link.
   - In the "Topics" field, enter topics that are relevant to your project. These could include "python", "streamlit", "data-visualization", "csv", "data-analysis", etc.
   - Press
^C KeyboardInterrupt

USER: Can I host this project in github

ASSISTANT: Yes, you can host the code for this project on GitHub. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub.**
   - Go to your GitHub account.
   - Click on the '+' icon in the upper right corner and select 'New repository'.
   - Name your repository and provide a description.
   - Choose whether to make your repository public or private.
   - Initialize the repository with a README if you want.
   - Click 'Create repository'.

2. **Push your local project to the GitHub repository.**
   - Open Terminal or Command Prompt on your computer.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Initialize the local directory as a Git repository:
     ```
     git init
     ```
   - Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit:
     ```
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository:
     ```
     git commit -m 'First commit'
     ```
   - In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed:
     ```
     git remote add origin remote repository URL
     ```
   - Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub:
     ```
     git push -u origin master
     ```

Now your project is hosted on GitHub.

However, if you want to host the application itself (i.e., make it accessible as a web app), you'll need to use a platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform. GitHub itself does not host web applications, it only hosts the code for projects.

USER: Can I use github pages to host streamlit apps

ASSISTANT: No, unfortunately, you cannot use GitHub Pages to host Streamlit apps. GitHub Pages is designed to host static websites, i.e., websites that consist of fixed content. Streamlit apps, on the other hand, are dynamic and require a server to run Python code, which GitHub Pages does not support.

To host a Streamlit app, you would need to use a service that supports running Python applications. Some popular options include:

- **Heroku:** A platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It supports Python and is free for small applications.

- **Streamlit Sharing:** A platform provided by Streamlit itself for hosting Streamlit apps. It's free but currently in beta and requires an invitation.

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** A secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality. It's not free, but it's very flexible and powerful.

- **Google Cloud Platform:** Similar to AWS, it provides a variety of cloud services on Google infrastructure. It's also not free, but offers a wide range of services and is quite flexible.

Remember, deploying a Streamlit app on these platforms usually involves providing a requirements.txt file that lists all of the Python libraries that your app needs to run, and possibly also providing some configuration files.

USER: What other features can I add to this streamlit app

ASSISTANT: There are many features you could add to your Streamlit app to enhance its functionality and user experience. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **User Authentication:** Implement a login system to control access to your app. This could be useful if you want to restrict access to certain users or track user activity.

2. **Data Upload from URL:** In addition to uploading files, allow users to input a URL from which the app can fetch and load data.

3. **More Data Transformations:** Add more options for users to manipulate the data. This could include more complex operations like normalization, standardization, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, etc.

4. **Machine Learning Models:** Allow users to apply machine learning models to the data. You could provide a selection of pre-trained models for common tasks, or allow users to train their own models on the data.

5. **Interactive Visualizations:** Use libraries like Plotly or Bokeh to create interactive plots that users can zoom, pan, and hover to get more detailed information.

6. **Real-time Data:** If applicable, you could add functionality to handle real-time data streams.

7. **Exporting Results:** Allow users to export the results of their data analysis, either by downloading files or by sending the results to an email address.

8. **User Feedback:** Implement a system for users to provide feedback on the app, report issues, or request new features.

Remember, the features you choose to add should depend on the needs of your users and the purpose of your app. Always consider the user experience when adding new features.

USER:  Data Upload from URL: In addition to uploading files, allow users to input a URL from which the app can fetch and
   load data.

ASSISTANT: To implement the feature of data upload from a URL, we need to modify the `translate_app.py` file. We will add a new option for the user to input a URL, and then use the `pandas.read_csv()` function to fetch and load the data from the URL.

Here are the changes to make in the `translate_app.py` file:

<source>python
translate_app.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a CSV file", type="csv")
    if uploaded_file is not None:
        data = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
        st.write(data)
=======

This change will add a new option for the user to input a URL from which the app will fetch and load data. If the URL does not point to a valid CSV file, an error message will be displayed.

Remove balancer.fi from blocklist (#13609)

Balancer has recovered control of balancer.fi after a social engineering attack at our registrar allowed hackers to take over the account.

We have confirmed that correct IPs have propigated.  If possible, please leave web.balancer.fi on the blocklist as we do not use it, and it seems like this name was used as part of the recent attack.

We have a war room open that we contacted via the seal-911 chat and I have been speaking to Tay.  You can find me that way if you have questions. 

Thank you

Makefile.lib: Lower kernel gzip compression to fastest

You're reading this - so you're trying to understand "JUST WHY OMG".
That's already a good step.

First of all, this is a downstream kernel - always keep that in mind!
Now, this kernel is targeting new *very powerful* Qualcomm platforms
like SM8250 and the Sony Edo platform - which has a very fast UFS card.

Keep in mind that the bootloader sets the CPU at a frequency that is
slightly faster than the "in the middle" ones, which is anyway not
veeeery fast - but that's good, really. I agree.

So.. check this out:   for Image.gz-dtb.....
COMP_LEVEL    SIZE
9             20116171
5	      20220479
2	      20940223
1	      21231290

Remember again that we're loading from a UFS card and that
we are loading ~1.1MB more out of a 20MB file.
If you're smart enough you surely know already about RAM and CPU
overhead of very high compression levels.

If you still disagree with what I just did, read this commit description
another 20 times, or more, until you understand it. :)))

Skrem's Quick Ballistic Glanceover (#2354)

## About The Pull Request

If maintainers want me to shorten the changelog, I can, I tend to start
there so I know what to talk about up here.

What started as a PR meant to buff up rubber rounds ended up turning
into a general passover I gave to much of the syntax and presentation of
ballistics. PR doesn't actually change that much function-wise, but it
changes a lot of lines due to a lot of changed pathing to better
establish consistency within ballistic code as well as overviewing a lot
of descriptions, names, and inherit moments.

Functionally, less-lethals and sniper rounds have been changed the most
by this PR. To a lesser extent, .38 special and shotgun rounds have been
tweaked. Finally, the PR stamps out a missing sprite bug with the WT-550
magazines, buffs up the surplus rifle (yeah, that old thing), tinkers
with some projectile speeds, makes match rounds slightly better, and
goes over A LOT of descriptions. I apologize for the massive wall of
text that's to follow.

Will take a look at energy weapons when I feel like it (might kill
disablers, I don't like mapping though).

## Why It's Good For The Game

### Slug and Pellet Changes
The pellet changes are actually just systemizing what was supposed to be
intentional design according to code comments, it just hadn't reached
every single pellet-based shotgun projectile. The improvised shell buff
is to make it not a potential complete whiff because RNG mechanics are
generally bad and not fun to play with.

### Less-Lethal Changes
Several implementations of less-lethal (rubber) ammunition on shiptest
are strictly worse than their standard alternatives. While this isn't a
PvP server, it feels very not-fun meta-wise to POTENTIALLY arm for SOME
insubordination and still fire what may as well be a round that bleeds
someone out (as they'll cause bleeding anyway). Increasing the stamina
damage on each of these makes it so they actually have a vague trade-off
(maybe stamina damage can do something like slow simplemobs in the
future, I don't know, I'd love to do it but simplemob code makes me
screech).

To make them not directly better in PvP and not the staple of taking
down the Super Scary Syndicate Shocktrooper Guy, they've had their
negative AP doubled. Not as good against combatants, but still perfectly
adept, if not better at general riot control against civilians. Makes
sense and puts them in their niche a little better.

### .38 Changes
The .38 special round relatively has more "power" and "velocity"
compared to the 9mm round, though it does not quite reach the levels
that .45 automatic or 10mm does in the IRL server. Furthermore, .38
special was specifically designed not to over-penetrate targets so as to
minimize the chance of collateral damage in police work. These are the
ultimate justifications behind giving it the worst AP out of all the
pistol calibers (-30, instead of -20) while still raising its damage to
25.

This should make the Winchester a better staple for taking out weaker
enemies such as legions or unarmored hermits, but it'll perform worse
against goliaths, frontiersmen, and the like. All-in-all, a more
"early-game" caliber, if you will, which is kinda what it's always been.

### Projectile Speed and Match Changes
Match rounds don't really exist as far as I've seen. That being said,
they're meant to be of higher quality, so their getting slightly higher
AP and speed makes sense, even if they're mostly just a meme round.

The speed increase of DMR/sniper rounds is primarily meant to
differentiate them better from AR rounds beyond having 20 more AP.
Assault rifles so far have pretty much dominated with better magazine
size, fire rate, and the exact same force as the DMR calibers, just
doing less damage against armored targets (doesn't matter too much when
you can just vomit rounds). I'd like to buff up the DMR damage even more
(sniper is fine), but I'd rather get some feedback on changing them to
35 baseline before doing so.

The speed decrease on shotguns is meant to cement them as CQC weapons.
Slugs are heavy. Shotguns are meant for close range. It's not much, but
it's thematically a good way to keep them in their lane, not that
they're even that problematic, hence only the slight change.

### Sniper Rifle Knockdown Change
Having a big-ass bullet that does 70 damage with 50 AP hit you is
already a middle finger. Making it potentially knock off an arm or a leg
is another middle finger. Being hardstunned for ten seconds after is the
icing on the cake. Changed it to a knockdown because we hate ranged
tasers.

### Surplus Rifle Fire Rate Buff
This thing is a joke. I haven't even seen it on the server, but I'd
rather make it vaguely competitive considering 10mm isn't super deadly
and only otherwise exists on the stechkin or the one Inteq SMG that you
never see (Colossus-only).

It's still clunky and terrible, but it should be less comedic and more
of a potential option if you have NOTHING else (will never happen).

### Boarder Magazine Change
Top-loading magazine fits into a standard assault rifle? No. Doesn't
make sense. Someone should probably just kill this gun, it's stupid and
looks stupid last I checked.

### WT-550 Magazine Fix
Don't think I've seen anyone use this weapon, I've only printed out
their magazines to dump AP rounds into my NT-SVG carbine. Noticed they
were invisible then. Someone increased their capacity to 30 without a
care for how its update_icon works. Not cool. Anyway, fixes are good.
Moving on.

### Syntax, Description, Spelling, and Overall Presentation Changes
Something very important when maintaining code is generally keeping
consistency in how things are not only presented, but how they're stored
as well. While I'd love to do EVEN more in the method of refactoring to
better align how so much of gun code works, this was something I wanted
to keep as a one-day project, so I mostly tinkered with pathing,
inherits, and groupings.

In the avenue of spelling and description changes, that's just 1)
Cleaning up errors that PR authors and maintainers missed and 2) Making
things more concise and just... better. Some of the SolGov descriptions
were a real headache to look at, and not because of the frequent
spelling and syntax errors.

Whoever misspelled and caused an entire series of items to be
/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/assualt may wish to avoid any crows
for the next three months.

Perfectly willing to adjust or reel back some of my descriptions if
someone can offer something better than what I've written out if there's
some soul they REALLY want to keep.

## Changelog

:cl:
tweak: The NT 'Boarder' ARG now loads standard P-16 magazines, rather
than the M-90gl toploaders.
balance: .38 special does 25 damage up from 20. AP has been reduced to
-30 from -20.
balance: Standardizes pellet projectiles to lose 10% damage of both
types per tile across the board. Improvised pellets no longer have a
hardcapped 1-8 tile range.
balance: Less-lethal rounds now do 50% more stamina than the force of
their lethal counterparts, with 25% the normal force and double the
negative AP. If the round had positive or zero AP, it was subtracted by
20.
balance: Shotgun slugs do 40 damage, down from 60, but have zero AP,
rather than -10. FRAG-12 and meteor slugs have had their damage adjusted
to reflect their relative force.
balance: Surplus rifle fire_delay has been cut to 1 second from 3.
balance: .50 BMG knocks down instead of hardstunning.
balance: Any DMR, match, or sniper round now travels slightly faster
than other bullets. Shotgun slugs and pellets now travel slightly slower
than other bullets.
balance: Match rounds have had their AP slightly increased.
fix: Fixed WT-550 magazines not displaying properly.
spellcheck: Went over (almost) every single ballistic description,
including the guns themselves, magazines, ballistic casings, and speed
loaders/stripper clips to not only have better consistency and
readability, but also be more clear on the general effectiveness of each
caliber.
spellcheck: Assualt is gone.
code: Repaths/renames most ballistic ammo pathing to maintain
consistency or take advantage of inherits, when possible.

Polymorph belt blacklists several biotypes instead of allowing only organics [MDB IGNORE] (#23620)

* Polymorph belt blacklists several biotypes instead of allowing only organics (#78229)

## About The Pull Request

Title; this makes the belt able to morph into _more_ mobs, but _less
problematic/abusable_ mobs hopefully. It still only functions on
basic/simple_animals, however.

~~Headslugs get a `MOB_UNDEAD` bioflag to prevent morphing into them
completely. Though catching a sentient ling slug and morphing everyone
into it is funny, it's only funny the first 5 times someone does it.
(disclaimer: this is an approximation, i did not actually see a
polymorph belt in-game because i currently play miner and like 10 games
a week tops)
Arguably, this isn't ideal, but it's the closest we get unless we rename
`MOB_EPIC` or something into `MOB_SPECIAL` and let that one be the go-to
bioflag for mobs we don't want **fun** things happen to.~~
`MOB_EPIC` is now `MOB_SPECIAL`. Headslugs get that.
I think the alternative methow could use whatever the gold cores use to
determine what to spawn but that would shift the mobs available for the
belt even more and I can't be assed to figure out how _much_ of a shift
that would be. Dragons or slimes or lavaland mobs would be out, for
example. Don't really vibe with that.

Fixes headslug's description bit that discerns a sentient slug from an
AI one showing up on a dead slug. It can't move while it's dead, no
matter its mind/AI.

Also adds simple dmdoc comments to the defines to help discern a few of
them more easily. Non-quip text suggestions welcome.

## Why It's Good For The Game
- Resolves #77756
- Resolves #78227

More mobs available for the funny belt but less _fun_ mobs should allow
for more stable use of the damn thing. Arguably, some of the mobs that
have been found to be incompatible with the belt are simply lacking a
`MOB_ORGANIC` flag, some of them with no apparent reason. However,
blacklisting potentially problematic biotypes should be easier to design
the unwanted mobs around.
Also consistency, less all-ling stations, code clarity. Whatever.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: polymorph belt now blacklists mobs that are undead, humanoid,
robotic or spiritual (in nature, not religiously), as well as megafauna
balance: however, this means that it works with more mobs that it should
logically work with, like slimes/bugs/lightgeists etc
fix: fixed headslug shenanigans with the polymorph belt hopefully for
good this time
fix: fixed headslug description mentioning its movement despite the slug
being dead
/:cl:

* Polymorph belt blacklists several biotypes instead of allowing only organics

Trait trampolines: declare `_flat_index` as uint32

This is to silence GCC when it decides to make warnings based on bad assumptions
about the values that an argument may take.

Or at least, that is what I think is going on. Original issue was reported by
@gwikland. I have not been able to create a minimal reproducer, which is why
this lacks a test.

The seemingly stochastic nature of the issue _does_ terrify me -- making me
doubt myself and wondering if the warning is actually based on a concrete usage
rather than GCC assuming something to be possible. However, based on an
inspection of the generated code and my previous experience of a similarly
stupid error (see #204) I've thoroughly convinced myself that no, GCC really
_is_ just deciding to be dumb.

Defang type inference.

So far the prelude and some of the libraries work but I haven't updated the
tests or the examples. I'm going to keep working in this state as I add
expressions-in-types.

My goal here is to make the type inference pass simpler so that we can modify it
more easily, particularly adding expressions in types. I also want the type
inference process to be more legible to users. It should be easy to reason about
what type inference can do and we should be able to provide feedback about what
it did.

The main principle I'm trying out is that type inference should be (1) local and
(2) feed-forward. "Local" means I don't want inference variables spanning
multiple expressions. "Feed-forward" means that type information should flow in
the same direction as ordinary data - you get the type of an expression, given
the types of its free variables, by looking at the types of its subexpressions.
You don't figure out the type of a binder based on its occurrences.

Here are the main changes to type inference. "Fully known" means "contains no
inference variables, including in the definitions and types of its free
variables".

  1. All variables have fully-known types, and let-bound variables have fully-known
     definitions too.
  2. Each UExpr is either processed "top-down" (i.e. checking it against a
     fully-known type) or "bottom-up" (inferring a fully-known type). There's no
     "partial checking" where you check a term against, say `?a -> ?b` where
     `?a` and `?b` are inference variables.
  3. Inference variables only exist for the duration of a single (n-ary)
     function application.
  4. Lambda-like binders (including `for` binders) must either be explicitly
     annotated or their type must be evident from the top-down type we're
     checking against. The latter case lets us still write things like `each xs
     \x. x + x` without annotating the `x` binder. The `\x` behaves more like a
     `let` binder than a lambda binder in this context. This is also the reason
     we can't adopt truly brutalist type inference and do *everything*
     bottom-up.

Some things are better now:
  * ~1000 loc removed
  * "cheap reduction" is now well-typed because there are no inference variables
    in either the term we're reducing or its environment.
  * We now tend to ask "are these types equal?" rather than "what would these
    variables need to be for these types to be equal?". The latter question
    doesn't work so well when we move beyond syntactic equality and start
    talking about equivalence relations.
  * We can now reliably use features that require fully-known types, like dot
    method resolution.

Other things look worse but I think they're actually better:
   * To support inference, functions should appear last in an argument list. For
     example, we should prefer `each` to its flipped version, `map` (I actually
     deleted `map` from the prelude). This is so that we see the table argument
     first, which tells us the element type, which tells us the type of the
     binder of the per-element function. But function arguments should go last
     anyway, for syntactic reasons. And even before this change, if you put a
     function argument first, it might type check but you wouldn't be able to
     use type-dispatch features (like dot method resolution). This just forces
     us to be more consistent.
   * No more defaults. I got rid of these because they require non-local
     inference. But I think they were confusing anyway for exactly that reason.
     Now you have to be explicit, writing `n = 10 :: Nat` or `n : Nat = 10` (we
     should standardize on one or the other) instead of `n = 10`.
   * `for i.` now usually requries an annotated `i`. But I think it ends up
     being more readable. And for the very common case where you're just using
     `i` to index into a single table, it's better to use `each` anyway.

Other things are actually bad
  * `Nothing`. Sometimes we now have to write `Nothing :: Maybe Nat`. (We should
    be able to write it as `Nothing(a=Nat)` but that doesn't work yet.)
  * `0 + x` will fail now. You can write `x + 0` just fine, because the type of
    `0` is obtained from the type of `x` but if you want to write it in the
    other order you have to write `(0::Nat) + x` or something. It's frustrating
    because `+` is such an obviously symmetric operator. There's a similar thing
    with `case`, where the order of the cases influences whether inference
    succeeds or fails (it wasn't perfect before either - the order could still
    influence whether dot-notation would work).

I'm not sure how to fix these. "Backwards" type inference is just really useful
in handling polymorphic constants like `0` and `Nothing`. (In my opinion this is
the *only* place it's useful.) I'm tempted to just say that we should get in the
habit of annotating these constants or supplying explicit type arguments. Maybe
`Nothing` should take its type argument explicitly so by default so you write
`Nothing(Nat)` or `Nothing(_)` if you're sure you're in top-down checking mode.
Then you can at least avoid the redundant `Maybe` in `Nothing :: Maybe Nat`.

URP? (No.) Gap sculpture. Point light.

- Quite a bit of stuff in this one including an attempt to move to the URP pipeline and then backing away because it seemed worse or at the very least seemed as bad as the default. Codrin recommended it briefly and I believe it's cool, but I suspect I've sunk enough effort into the default engine that unless URP had been just amazing by default I don't think I want to go back to square one. I can try again later if I want to again. I did a big ol' discard changes to get rid of it successfully.
- I moved the current iteration of the exhibiting room  onto an actual space on the island, put in a point light, and a cube, and had it cast a shadow into the corner, which creates quite a nice form in the interaction between the shadow and the corner's structure. In doing it I realized I think I *do* want a "physical" representative of the light, so I put the light inside a small luminous sphere (to symbolize point lighting) and I do think that helps make the scene more legible.
- Also made a series of poles with their spacing reducing by half each time to see when the shadows no longer render - though it's very (utterly) related to the angle of the sun and I suppose I now realize I should make sure they have the perfect perpendicular angle.  The point being yeah when is it all shadow and no light? I had been thinking about making a version of that with holes in the wall of the room
- I think the performance took a hit from the point light? That classic thing where it stutters because you even look near to where a point light is? I will put triggers to switch the light on and off for that reason - should help as there are more lights. Only one would be on at any given time.

Removes debug species from magic mirror (#78541)

## About The Pull Request

Tallboys strike again
Fixes #78538
Removes "Tall Boys" from the magic mirror, again.
Also gives the two fucked up monkey species names and removes _them_
from the magic mirror.
When the magic mirror was looping through available species it was
finding these monkey subtypes with fucked up limbs, noting that they
were not forbidden, then adding them to the assoc list.
Because all of them were called "monkey" it would overwrite "monkey"
with "monkey who has human arms and torso" which is... not what you
wanted to turn into.

Additionally I made external organ feature name fall back to the species
default if not provided because I kept getting a runtime on monkey tail
insertion (nobody has a monkey tail feature in their prefs or DNA) which
I originally thought was the cause of this bug, until I fixed it and
learned that actually it was something much stupider.

Polymorphic Inverter tweaks (#77675)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #77649

You can no longer use the belt to turn into any kind of carbon mob,
sorry gamers it was a cool dream but it leads to too many problems.
Also I made space dragon "there's an alive guy in my stomach" code now
work on signals instead of on Life tick which is slightly more efficient
and also resolves an issue with the funny belt.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Too much room for weird edge cases as a result of doing this (messing
with monkey DNA, producing infinite xeno organs, blocking legit xeno
queens from being created) which had no graceful solution.
Moving stuff off Life if it can be event based is nice.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Turning into a space dragon with the polymorphic inverter will no
longer leave you existing in two places
balance: You can no longer use the belt to transform into monkeys or
xenomorphs, for technical reasons.

Settler Quirk: Tame the Outdoors! Have trouble with tall shelves... (#77654)

## About The Pull Request

Adds the Settler quirk. This gives you bonuses to taming animals and
fishing, as well as making you gain hunger slower than others.

However, you are quite a bit slower than most people, and have trouble
with vaulting objects. You do, however, suffer significantly less from
equipment slowdown. (to the point that it is almost zero)

Settler riders are faster on their mounts than others if they're at
least sane. They start to slow down if they're less sane.

You are also shorter than most people.

</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game

I wanted to add a lightweight quirk that was kind of the 'opposite' of
Spacer, but a little more focused on interacting with elements of the
game world that would enjoy some attention. So, I thought 'what about an
outdoorsman quirk?'

So, I based it around being from people who lived out on the rim, under
unideal circumstances (and probably heavier gravity than Earth), and
taming the land. The slower movespeed encourages finding an animal to
tame that you can ride, and the bonuses to taming should help make that
a bit easier. The other additions just made sense for someone living it
a bit rough in the wilderness.

Having a bunch of settlers taming cows and riding around on them all
shift just kind of sounds hilarious to me.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Settler quirk! Conqueror the great outdoors....in space. Just make
sure nobody asks you to get anything from the top shelf.

xfs: logging the on disk inode LSN can make it go backwards

commit 32baa63d82ee3f5ab3bd51bae6bf7d1c15aed8c7 upstream.

When we log an inode, we format the "log inode" core and set an LSN
in that inode core. We do that via xfs_inode_item_format_core(),
which calls:

	xfs_inode_to_log_dinode(ip, dic, ip->i_itemp->ili_item.li_lsn);

to format the log inode. It writes the LSN from the inode item into
the log inode, and if recovery decides the inode item needs to be
replayed, it recovers the log inode LSN field and writes it into the
on disk inode LSN field.

Now this might seem like a reasonable thing to do, but it is wrong
on multiple levels. Firstly, if the item is not yet in the AIL,
item->li_lsn is zero. i.e. the first time the inode it is logged and
formatted, the LSN we write into the log inode will be zero. If we
only log it once, recovery will run and can write this zero LSN into
the inode.

This means that the next time the inode is logged and log recovery
runs, it will *always* replay changes to the inode regardless of
whether the inode is newer on disk than the version in the log and
that violates the entire purpose of recording the LSN in the inode
at writeback time (i.e. to stop it going backwards in time on disk
during recovery).

Secondly, if we commit the CIL to the journal so the inode item
moves to the AIL, and then relog the inode, the LSN that gets
stamped into the log inode will be the LSN of the inode's current
location in the AIL, not it's age on disk. And it's not the LSN that
will be associated with the current change. That means when log
recovery replays this inode item, the LSN that ends up on disk is
the LSN for the previous changes in the log, not the current
changes being replayed. IOWs, after recovery the LSN on disk is not
in sync with the LSN of the modifications that were replayed into
the inode. This, again, violates the recovery ordering semantics
that on-disk writeback LSNs provide.

Hence the inode LSN in the log dinode is -always- invalid.

Thirdly, recovery actually has the LSN of the log transaction it is
replaying right at hand - it uses it to determine if it should
replay the inode by comparing it to the on-disk inode's LSN. But it
doesn't use that LSN to stamp the LSN into the inode which will be
written back when the transaction is fully replayed. It uses the one
in the log dinode, which we know is always going to be incorrect.

Looking back at the change history, the inode logging was broken by
commit 93f958f9c41f ("xfs: cull unnecessary icdinode fields") way
back in 2016 by a stupid idiot who thought he knew how this code
worked. i.e. me. That commit replaced an in memory di_lsn field that
was updated only at inode writeback time from the inode item.li_lsn
value - and hence always contained the same LSN that appeared in the
on-disk inode - with a read of the inode item LSN at inode format
time. CLearly these are not the same thing.

Before 93f958f9c41f, the log recovery behaviour was irrelevant,
because the LSN in the log inode always matched the on-disk LSN at
the time the inode was logged, hence recovery of the transaction
would never make the on-disk LSN in the inode go backwards or get
out of sync.

A symptom of the problem is this, caught from a failure of
generic/482. Before log recovery, the inode has been allocated but
never used:

xfs_db> inode 393388
xfs_db> p
core.magic = 0x494e
core.mode = 0
....
v3.crc = 0x99126961 (correct)
v3.change_count = 0
v3.lsn = 0
v3.flags2 = 0
v3.cowextsize = 0
v3.crtime.sec = Thu Jan  1 10:00:00 1970
v3.crtime.nsec = 0

After log recovery:

xfs_db> p
core.magic = 0x494e
core.mode = 020444
....
v3.crc = 0x23e68f23 (correct)
v3.change_count = 2
v3.lsn = 0
v3.flags2 = 0
v3.cowextsize = 0
v3.crtime.sec = Thu Jul 22 17:03:03 2021
v3.crtime.nsec = 751000000
...

You can see that the LSN of the on-disk inode is 0, even though it
clearly has been written to disk. I point out this inode, because
the generic/482 failure occurred because several adjacent inodes in
this specific inode cluster were not replayed correctly and still
appeared to be zero on disk when all the other metadata (inobt,
finobt, directories, etc) indicated they should be allocated and
written back.

The fix for this is two-fold. The first is that we need to either
revert the LSN changes in 93f958f9c41f or stop logging the inode LSN
altogether. If we do the former, log recovery does not need to
change but we add 8 bytes of memory per inode to store what is
largely a write-only inode field. If we do the latter, log recovery
needs to stamp the on-disk inode in the same manner that inode
writeback does.

I prefer the latter, because we shouldn't really be trying to log
and replay changes to the on disk LSN as the on-disk value is the
canonical source of the on-disk version of the inode. It also
matches the way we recover buffer items - we create a buf_log_item
that carries the current recovery transaction LSN that gets stamped
into the buffer by the write verifier when it gets written back
when the transaction is fully recovered.

However, this might break log recovery on older kernels even more,
so I'm going to simply ignore the logged value in recovery and stamp
the on-disk inode with the LSN of the transaction being recovered
that will trigger writeback on transaction recovery completion. This
will ensure that the on-disk inode LSN always reflects the LSN of
the last change that was written to disk, regardless of whether it
comes from log recovery or runtime writeback.

Add Postpone API (#27238)

This adds an experimental `unstable_postpone(reason)` API.

Currently we don't have a way to model effectively an Infinite Promise.
I.e. something that suspends but never resolves. The reason this is
useful is because you might have something else that unblocks it later.
E.g. by updating in place later, or by client rendering.

On the client this works to model as an Infinite Promise (in fact,
that's what this implementation does). However, in Fizz and Flight that
doesn't work because the stream needs to end at some point. We don't
have any way of knowing that we're suspended on infinite promises. It's
not enough to tag the promises because you could await those and thus
creating new promises. The only way we really have to signal this
through a series of indirections like async functions, is by throwing.
It's not 100% safe because these values can be caught but it's the best
we can do.

Effectively `postpone(reason)` behaves like a built-in [Catch
Boundary](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26854). It's like
`raise(Postpone, reason)` except it's built-in so it needs to be able to
be encoded and caught by Suspense boundaries.

In Flight and Fizz these behave pretty much the same as errors. Flight
just forwards it to retrigger on the client. In Fizz they just trigger
client rendering which itself might just postpone again or fill in the
value. The difference is how they get logged.

In Flight and Fizz they log to `onPostpone(reason)` instead of
`onError(error)`. This log is meant to help find deopts on the server
like finding places where you fall back to client rendering. The reason
that you pass in is for that purpose to help the reason for any deopts.

I do track the stack trace in DEV but I don't currently expose it to
`onPostpone`. This seems like a limitation. It might be better to expose
the Postpone object which is an Error object but that's more of an
implementation detail. I could also pass it as a second argument.

On the client after hydration they don't get passed to
`onRecoverableError`. There's no global `onPostpone` API to capture
postponed things on the client just like there's no `onError`. At that
point it's just assumed to be intentional. It doesn't have any `digest`
or reason passed to the client since it's not logged.

There are some hacky solutions that currently just tries to reuse as
much of the existing code as possible but should be more properly
implemented.
- Fiber is currently just converting it to a fake Promise object so that
it behaves like an infinite Promise.
- Fizz is encoding the magic digest string `"POSTPONE"` in the HTML so
we know to ignore it but it should probably just be something neater
that doesn't share namespace with digests.

Next I plan on using this in the `/static` entry points for additional
features.

Why "postpone"? It's basically a synonym to "defer" but we plan on using
"defer" for other purposes and it's overloaded anyway.

add try_insert to entity commands (#9844)

# Objective

- I spoke with some users in the ECS channel of bevy discord today and
they suggested that I implement a fallible form of .insert for
components.

- In my opinion, it would be nice to have a fallible .insert like
.try_insert (or to just make insert be fallible!) because it was causing
a lot of panics in my game. In my game, I am spawning terrain chunks and
despawning them in the Update loop. However, this was causing bevy_xpbd
to panic because it was trying to .insert some physics components on my
chunks and a race condition meant that its check to see if the entity
exists would pass but then the next execution step it would not exist
and would do an .insert and then panic. This means that there is no way
to avoid a panic with conditionals.

Luckily, bevy_xpbd does not care about inserting these components if the
entity is being deleted and so if there were a .try_insert, like this PR
provides it could use that instead in order to NOT panic.

( My interim solution for my own game has been to run the entity despawn
events in the Last schedule but really this is just a hack and I should
not be expected to manage the scheduling of despawns like this - it
should just be easy and simple. IF it just so happened that bevy_xpbd
ran .inserts in the Last schedule also, this would be an untenable soln
overall )

## Solution

- Describe the solution used to achieve the objective above.

Add a new command named TryInsert (entitycommands.try_insert) which
functions exactly like .insert except if the entity does not exist it
will not panic. Instead, it will log to info. This way, crates that are
attaching components in ways which they do not mind that the entity no
longer exists can just use try_insert instead of insert.

---

## Changelog

 

## Additional Thoughts

In my opinion, NOT panicing should really be the default and having an
.insert that does panic should be the odd edgecase but removing the
panic! from .insert seems a bit above my paygrade -- although i would
love to see it. My other thought is it would be good for .insert to
return an Option AND not panic but it seems it uses an event bus right
now so that seems to be impossible w the current architecture.

Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine treatment. Updated first aid analyzer information. (#77746)

## About The Pull Request

Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine
treatment.

Drinking tea will help mend (non-bone) wounds over time.

Flour and corn starch may be splashed onto wounds to help dry them up,
though they'll have a negative effect on burn wounds.

Added a new reagent, saltwater, made by combining table salt with water.

Table salt and saltwater can be splashed onto wounds as well, reducing
bleeding and improving sanitization and disinfection significantly.
However, the coarse undiluted salt will irritate the wounds, reducing
clot rate and flesh healing, and both of the reagents will increase a
burn wound's infestation rate.

Altered Table Salt's recipe to just need sodium and chloride. Changed
the recipe of Pentetic Acid and Heparin to need table salt (sodium x
chloride) and thus slightly altered the total output of those reagents
(pentacid went from 5u per reaction to 4u, heparin 4u->3u)

Saline-Glucose Solution now needs 2u of saltwater and 1u of sugar,
meaning the overall recipe should be completely unchanged in practice.
Contact me on discord if any issues arise from these chemical changes!

First aid analyzers now give easy-to-understand direct information, with
the specific recommended treatments bolded in the analysis text. They
also have a 'unique' extra bit of info, telling you about improvised
ways to remedy your wound.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Wounds have a very poor amount of interaction with the rest of the game
and have not had much added to them post-merge, especially in
'improvised' ways to help Not Die to a wound while you crawl your way to
a emergency medkit or medbay. I researched info on this and found some
interesting ideas - some of them I'll have to leave for later because
this PR kept growing out of scope (Improvised bone gel, ice on wounds
which turned into wound temperature mechanics, crutches, a 'suture item'
component refactor...)

As for what this actually does to benefit the game, it allows more
dynamic wound Gameplay as people use first aid analyzers to get
information on treatment when medbay blows up, helps them stabilize by
splashing flour onto themselves before looking for some actual
treatment, helps traitors realize how they can self-treat many crippling
wounds (at risk, of course). It expands treatment options to things
beside medkits and medbay, but always does so in ways that have
downsides that make them not ideal as _treatment_, and more beneficial
as stabilizing before seeking true professional help. This thus
significantly increases the rather shallow depth of wounds as a system
to interact with.

> Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine
treatment.

From what I could tell by looking at several sources for each
'realistic' treatment, these are indeed semi-reasonable things that are
done to wounds by some people as household treatment.

It goes without saying that you should **not do any of these things in
real life** without consulting a doctor unless your blood is also
spilling out by the gallon into the floor. All these 'realistic
treatments' have drastic downsides and are meant for the short-term
only. Except the tea.

> Drinking tea will help mend (non-bone) wounds over time.

Tea is healthy, we all know that.

> Flour and corn starch may be splashed onto wounds to help dry them up,
though they'll have a negative effect on burn wounds.

Flour and apparently starch dries wounds up but risks infection. That's
not a thing for blood wounds yet but oh well.

> Table salt and saltwater can be splashed onto wounds as well, reducing
bleeding and improving sanitization and disinfection significantly.
However, the coarse undiluted salt will irritate the wounds, reducing
clot rate and flesh healing, and both of the reagents will increase a
burn wound's infestation rate.

Salt kills bacteria via osmosis, but it also kills your own cells, and
some bacteria like salt.

> Added a new reagent, saltwater, made by combining table salt with
water.

> Altered Table Salt's recipe to just need sodium and chloride. Changed
the recipe of Pentetic Acid and Heparin to need table salt (sodium x
chloride) and thus slightly altered the total output of those reagents

> Saline-Glucose Solution now needs 2u of saltwater and 1u of sugar,

I wish I hadn't had to mess with reagents like this, but I needed to
because just adding mixing salt and water caused the saline glucose
recipe to basically split itself into half saltwater half glucose.

I removed the water requirement for table salt (Why did it even have
that, salt ain't wet bro?), made saline-glucose need 2u saltwater and 1u
sugar, and altered relevant recipes so they didn't also cause unwanted
table salt to react from their sodium and chloride ingredients.

A happy side-effect is that saline glucose solution is even easier to
make now as an improvised chem by mixing salt, water, and sugar, which
fits pretty perfectly (especially as a temporary blood substitute)

> First aid analyzers now give easy-to-understand direct information,
with the specific recommended treatments bolded in the analysis text.
They also have a 'unique' extra bit of info, telling you about
improvised ways to remedy your wound.

You might notice that as the wounds get more serious the text gets more
direct and concise and reluctantly hands out more and more improvised
treatment options, so that's fun. As for the improvised section itself,
it helps people be actually aware of these ways to help treat themselves
rather than delegating it to hyper-gamer knowledge.

The bolded treatment bit is pretty neat and means your eyes can
inmediately focus on what you can do to save yourself - very useful if
you have a weeping avulsion and no bandages.

#### Monday 2023-09-25 21:54:56 by Linus Torvalds

Merge branch 'work.openat2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs

Pull openat2 support from Al Viro:
 "This is the openat2() series from Aleksa Sarai.

  I'm afraid that the rest of namei stuff will have to wait - it got
  zero review the last time I'd posted #work.namei, and there had been a
  leak in the posted series I'd caught only last weekend. I was going to
  repost it on Monday, but the window opened and the odds of getting any
  review during that... Oh, well.

  Anyway, openat2 part should be ready; that _did_ get sane amount of
  review and public testing, so here it comes"

From Aleksa's description of the series:
 "For a very long time, extending openat(2) with new features has been
  incredibly frustrating. This stems from the fact that openat(2) is
  possibly the most famous counter-example to the mantra "don't silently
  accept garbage from userspace" -- it doesn't check whether unknown
  flags are present[1].

  This means that (generally) the addition of new flags to openat(2) has
  been fraught with backwards-compatibility issues (O_TMPFILE has to be
  defined as __O_TMPFILE|O_DIRECTORY|[O_RDWR or O_WRONLY] to ensure old
  kernels gave errors, since it's insecure to silently ignore the
  flag[2]). All new security-related flags therefore have a tough road
  to being added to openat(2).

  Furthermore, the need for some sort of control over VFS's path
  resolution (to avoid malicious paths resulting in inadvertent
  breakouts) has been a very long-standing desire of many userspace
  applications.

  This patchset is a revival of Al Viro's old AT_NO_JUMPS[3] patchset
  (which was a variant of David Drysdale's O_BENEATH patchset[4] which
  was a spin-off of the Capsicum project[5]) with a few additions and
  changes made based on the previous discussion within [6] as well as
  others I felt were useful.

  In line with the conclusions of the original discussion of
  AT_NO_JUMPS, the flag has been split up into separate flags. However,
  instead of being an openat(2) flag it is provided through a new
  syscall openat2(2) which provides several other improvements to the
  openat(2) interface (see the patch description for more details). The
  following new LOOKUP_* flags are added:

  LOOKUP_NO_XDEV:

     Blocks all mountpoint crossings (upwards, downwards, or through
     absolute links). Absolute pathnames alone in openat(2) do not
     trigger this. Magic-link traversal which implies a vfsmount jump is
     also blocked (though magic-link jumps on the same vfsmount are
     permitted).

  LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS:

     Blocks resolution through /proc/$pid/fd-style links. This is done
     by blocking the usage of nd_jump_link() during resolution in a
     filesystem. The term "magic-links" is used to match with the only
     reference to these links in Documentation/, but I'm happy to change
     the name.

     It should be noted that this is different to the scope of
     ~LOOKUP_FOLLOW in that it applies to all path components. However,
     you can do openat2(NO_FOLLOW|NO_MAGICLINKS) on a magic-link and it
     will *not* fail (assuming that no parent component was a
     magic-link), and you will have an fd for the magic-link.

     In order to correctly detect magic-links, the introduction of a new
     LOOKUP_MAGICLINK_JUMPED state flag was required.

  LOOKUP_BENEATH:

     Disallows escapes to outside the starting dirfd's
     tree, using techniques such as ".." or absolute links. Absolute
     paths in openat(2) are also disallowed.

     Conceptually this flag is to ensure you "stay below" a certain
     point in the filesystem tree -- but this requires some additional
     to protect against various races that would allow escape using
     "..".

     Currently LOOKUP_BENEATH implies LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS, because it
     can trivially beam you around the filesystem (breaking the
     protection). In future, there might be similar safety checks done
     as in LOOKUP_IN_ROOT, but that requires more discussion.

  In addition, two new flags are added that expand on the above ideas:

  LOOKUP_NO_SYMLINKS:

     Does what it says on the tin. No symlink resolution is allowed at
     all, including magic-links. Just as with LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS this
     can still be used with NOFOLLOW to open an fd for the symlink as
     long as no parent path had a symlink component.

  LOOKUP_IN_ROOT:

     This is an extension of LOOKUP_BENEATH that, rather than blocking
     attempts to move past the root, forces all such movements to be
     scoped to the starting point. This provides chroot(2)-like
     protection but without the cost of a chroot(2) for each filesystem
     operation, as well as being safe against race attacks that
     chroot(2) is not.

     If a race is detected (as with LOOKUP_BENEATH) then an error is
     generated, and similar to LOOKUP_BENEATH it is not permitted to
     cross magic-links with LOOKUP_IN_ROOT.

     The primary need for this is from container runtimes, which
     currently need to do symlink scoping in userspace[7] when opening
     paths in a potentially malicious container.

     There is a long list of CVEs that could have bene mitigated by
     having RESOLVE_THIS_ROOT (such as CVE-2017-1002101,
     CVE-2017-1002102, CVE-2018-15664, and CVE-2019-5736, just to name a
     few).

  In order to make all of the above more usable, I'm working on
  libpathrs[8] which is a C-friendly library for safe path resolution.
  It features a userspace-emulated backend if the kernel doesn't support
  openat2(2). Hopefully we can get userspace to switch to using it, and
  thus get openat2(2) support for free once it's ready.

  Future work would include implementing things like
  RESOLVE_NO_AUTOMOUNT and possibly a RESOLVE_NO_REMOTE (to allow
  programs to be sure they don't hit DoSes though stale NFS handles)"

gdb/testsuite: add test for core file with a 0 pid

This patch contains a test for this commit:

  commit c820c52a914cc9d7c63cb41ad396f4ddffff2196
  Date:   Fri Aug 6 19:45:58 2010 +0000

              * thread.c (add_thread_silent): Use null_ptid instead of
              minus_one_ptid while getting rid of stale inferior_ptid.

This is another test that has been carried in the Fedora GDB tree for
some time, and I thought that it would be worth merging to master.  I
don't believe there is any test like this currently in the testsuite.

The original issue was reported in this thread:

  https://inbox.sourceware.org/gdb-patches/AANLkTi=zuEDw6qiZ1jRatkdwHO99xF2Qu+WZ7i0EQjef@mail.gmail.com/

The problem was that when GDB was used to open a vmcore (core file)
image generated by the Linux kernel GDB would (sometimes) crash with
an assertion failure:

  thread.c:884: internal-error: switch_to_thread: Assertion `inf != NULL' failed.

To understand what's going on we need some background; a vmcore file
represents each processor core in the same way that a standard
application core file represents threads.  Thus, we might say, a
vmcore file represents cores as threads.

When writing a vmcore file, the kernel will store the pid of the
process currently running on that core as the thread's lwpid.

However, if a core is idle, with no process currently running on it,
then the lwpid for that thread is stored as 0 in the vmcore file.  If
multiple cores are idle then multiple threads will have a lwpid of 0.

Back in 2010, the original issue reported tried to change the kernel's
behaviour in this thread:

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/3/75

This change was rejected by the kernel team, the current
behaviour (lwpid of 0) was considered correct.  I've checked the
source of a recent kernel.  The code mentioned in the lkml.org posting
has moved, it's now in the function crash_save_cpu in the file
kernel/kexec_core.c, but the general behaviour is unchanged, an idle
core will have an lwpid of 0, so I think GDB still needs to be able to
handle this case.

When GDB loads a vmcore file (which is handled just like any other
core file) the sections are processed in core_open to generate the
threads for the core file.  The processing is done by calling
add_to_thread_list, a function which looks for sections named .reg/NN
where NN is the lwpid of the thread, GDB then builds a ptid_t for the
new thread and calls add_thread.

Remember, in our case the lwpid is 0.  Now for the first thread this
is fine, if a little weird, 0 isn't usually a valid lwpid, but that's
OK, GDB creates a thread with lwpid of 0 and carries on.

When we find the next thread (core) with lwpid of 0, we attempt to
create another thread with an lwpid of 0.  This of course clashes with
the previously created thread, they have the same ptid_t, so GDB tries
to delete the first thread.

And it was within this thread delete code that we triggered a bug
which would then cause GDB to assert -- when deleting we tried to
switch to a thread with minus_one_ptid, this resulted in a call to
find_inferior_pid (passing in minus_one_ptid's pid, which is -1), the
find_inferior_pid call fails and returns NULL, which then triggered an
assert in switch_to_thread.

The actual details of the why the assert triggered are really not
important.  What's important (I think) is that a vmcore file might
have this interesting lwpid of 0 characteristic, which isn't something
we see in "normal" application core files, and it is this that I think
we should be testing.

Now, you might be thinking: isn't deleting the first thread the wrong
thing to do?  If the vmcore file has two threads that represent two
cores, and both have an lwpid of 0 (indicating both cores are idle),
then surely GDB should still represent this as two threads?  You're
not wrong.  This was mentioned by Pedro in the original GDB mailing
list thread here:

  https://inbox.sourceware.org/gdb-patches/201008061057.03037.pedro@codesourcery.com/

This is indeed a problem, and this problem is still present in GDB
today.  I plan to try and address this in a later commit, however,
this first commit is about getting a test in place to confirm that GDB
at a minimum doesn't crash when loading such a vmcore file.

And so, finally, what's in this commit?

This commit contains a new test.  The test doesn't actually contain a
vmcore file.  Instead I've created a standard application core file
that contains two threads, and then manually edited the core file to
set the lwpid of each thread to 0.

To further reduce the size of the core file (as it will be stored in
git), I've zeroed all of the LOAD-able segments in the core file.
This test really doesn't care about that part of the core file, we
only really care about loading the register's, this is enough to
confirm that the GDB doesn't crash.

Obviously as the core file is pre-generated, this test is architecture
specific.  There are already a few tests in gdb.arch/ that include
pre-generate core files.  Just as those existing tests do, I've
compressed the core file with bzip2, which reduces it to just 750
bytes.  I have structured the test so that if/when this patch is
merged I can add some additional core files for other architectures,
however, these are not included in this commit.

The test simply expands the core file, and then loads it into GDB.
One interesting thing to note is that GDB reports the core file
loading like this:

  (gdb) core-file ./gdb/testsuite/outputs/gdb.arch/core-file-pid0/core-file-pid0.x86-64.core
  [New process 1]
  [New process 1]
  Failed to read a valid object file image from memory.
  Core was generated by `./segv-mt'.
  Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  The current thread has terminated
  (gdb)

There's two interesting things here: first, the repeated "New process
1" message.  This is caused because linux_core_pid_to_str reports
anything with an lwpid of 0 as a process, rather than an LWP.  And
second, the "The current thread has terminated" message.  This is
because the first thread in the core file is the current thread, but
when GDB loads the second thread (which also has lwpid 0) this causes
the first thread to be deleted, as a result GDB thinks that the
current (first) thread has terminated.

As I said previously, both of these problems are a result of the lwpid
0 aliasing, which is not being fixed in this commit -- this commit is
just confirming that GDB doesn't crash when loading this core file.

BSP 5.0

Changes in v5.0 - Colin Phipps, 8/2000:

Based on BSP v3.0, this version brings together a number of enhancements to
BSP that have been floating around by various people.

There is no significant difference, in terms of the nodes produced, between
this version and BSP v3.0. In fact on my computer (FreeBSD 4.1-STABLE, PII),
the output is byte-for-byte identical with BSP v3.0. This is not true for the
binary DOS and Win32 versions I'm distributing though, because they are linked
against a different math library, but they are still effectively identical to
BSP v3.0 I believe.

So what changes are there you ask? Well...

- better UNIX support, from Udo Monk and Andre Majorel
- big endian support, from Oliver Kraus
- from myself:
  - major clean-up of the source code, splitting some stuff out into separate
   files so there is less mixing of unrelated code.
  - vastly more memory-efficient when working on large multi-level WADs
  - more flexibility about input and output
    - can read from and write to pipes on UNIX systems
    - output file can be the same as the input file
  - Win32 version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2000/08/27

Fixed up a large number of memory leaks. Basically BSP was designed to do
one level only, and the multi-level support was an afterthought. It
did multiple levels, but memory-wise it assumed it needn't bother to
free one level's stuff before moving on the the next. Since it's easy to
fix, I fixed it. It's now practical to use it for multi-level PWADs.
Builds doom.wad in < 1.5megs now (as compared to 15megs before).

Added big endian support. Imported the extra code from the xwadtools
version. I rely on autoconf to detect if the machine is big endian.
No adverse affects on x86 - I also verified that it compiles if
WORDS_BIGENDIAN is defined. Can't do a real test myself though.

2000/08/26

Support for pipes and stuff was today's business. Added the isatty()
test from the yadex version of BSP that supresses the spinning
progress thingy when stdout is redirected.

Added support for input being from a pipe. I'm writing for UNIX damnit,
so it ought to be usable like other UNIX programs! :-)

For input pipes, it just reads to a temp file, then reads back from the
temp file. For output I was less sure what to do: there are 3
senarios:

1) output to a file that either doesn't exist, or can be overwritten in any
 case.
2) output to a file which we only want overwritten once the build is complete
 and sucessful (e.g. writing the output back to the input filename)
3) output to a pipe

For (3), we need to write to a temp file then copy to the pipe, because
we have to be able to fseek(3) on the output file to write a Doom WAD.
For (2), we need to write to a temp file then copy to the output when
we're done.

In the end, I went for an easy compromise. If the output file already
exists (includes the case of a pipe), then we write the WAD to a temporary
file, then copy it to the real output file once we're done. That copes
with (2) and (3) fine.

2000/08/25

Made a makefile to built the test wads. I copied the test WADs to another
machine, and ran original DOS BSP 3.0 on them, then made a note of the MD5
sums of the resulting files. Using these I can check that my version is still
producing identical results to the original v3.0.

2000/08/23

Checked in the BSP 3.0 source. Immediately ditched the existing makefiles and
created GNU autoconf/automake ones - much less messy.

First major problem to overcome was the crude existing build system - all the
.c files were #include'd into bsp.c, which was kinda ugly. And whoever wrote
this had an obsession with labelling everything "static" even though there was
only one source file. Fun.

Misc mapping fixes and QoL additions (#78176)

## About The Pull Request

fix: #78135
fix: #78059

This PR remaps Birdshot's disposals room, makes several small fixes on
Icebox and Metastation, adds cell timers to isolation cells where such
cells are present (they don't open the door, effectively just an in-game
timer) (in-cell flashes are now controlled with the timer, where
applicable); and adds translator glove modules to the stacks of
"accessibility" modules found in most security, medical, and engineering
storage rooms. (adds these stacks in their entirety to Northstar).

Specific changes are as follows:
Birdshot
- Adds a roll of package paper to the cargo office
- Translator module [med,sec]
- Accessibility modules [eng]
- Recycler remap

Delta
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timer

Icebox
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Remove duplicate hand labeler on the rack near brig cells
- Adds a hand labeler to armory desk in gear room
- Isolation cell timer

Meta
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timer
- Mends a broken corpse disposal pipe from aux surgery to the morgue

Northstar
- Accessibility modules [med,sec,eng]
- Nudges the binoculars off of the mass driver controls in ordnance
- Fixes the SM starting out hotwired (Rewires the SM room)

Tram
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timers
## Why It's Good For The Game

Bug fixes with respect to Birdshot's recycler, Meta's corpse disposal,
Northstar starting out hotwired, and Icebox's duplicated hand labeler.

Nudging Northstar's ordnance binoculars should make it a bit easier to
find the mass driver controls.

Adding some packaging paper to Birdshot to make the techs' lives a
little easier with a little less round-start fuss.

Adding a hand labeler to Icebox's gear room brings it in line with other
maps in terms of rounds-start gear and locker labeling potential.

For players with characters running the Mute/Signer quirks, stock
MODsuits are a pain to use. Suit gauntlets will replace their translator
gloves. Unless they're able to get a suit put together ahead of time,
they'll be stuck doing the retract gauntlets > send radio message >
Extend Gauntlets shuffle. Adding a translator glove module to the stack
of similar items (plasma fixation module / therma regulator) should
alleviate that issue some.

Getting abandoned in an isolation cell sucks, and setting timers on your
phone or some such is a hassle. Adding cell timers to isolation cells
should go some way to alleviating those frustrations.
