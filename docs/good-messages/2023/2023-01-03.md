[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Add Croissants & Traitorous Baking Techniques (#3915)

* Add Croissants & Traitorous Baking Techniques (#72232)

## About The Pull Request

This is my Christmas present to mimes everywhere.

First of all this adds Croissants, because I thought they already
existed and was shocked to learn that they did not.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/209454610-4e69563f-b83d-465b-b28e-7e0b482ff01b.png)
Here's a croissant and an unbaked croissant.
In terms of food they are GRAIN, DAIRY, and BREAKFAST and made fairly
simply from sugar, dough, and butter.

Secondly it adds this pack of traitor gear, exclusively for Mimes and
Chefs.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/209454613-059759b2-774c-45e2-9e1e-97adb43f75f1.png)
The contents of this pack are:
- One combat baguette, indistinguishable from a regular baguette. If
wielded as a sword it gains a 50% block chance (equal to the Captain's
sabre) and does 20 damage.
- Two throwing croissants, which do 20 throwing damage and return to
your hand like boomerangs.
- A cookbook which teaches you the secret to turning croissaints into
deadly boomerang weapons.

You make a croissant into a throwing croissant simply by inserting an
expertly bent iron rod into it.
The chef can't make any use of the baguette unless they also gain the
ability to mime, but they can use it to make food.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/209454703-feafcf4c-6d0a-4e9a-ac4a-d3e2fc7c0ffb.mp4

Watch me here struggle to use them to kill an ape (they don't return to
your hands if thrown at an adjacent tile).

## Why It's Good For The Game

It's insane that croissants aren't already in the game.
This gives mimes an "invisible" sword to go with their invisible gun (it
announces to everyone nearby when you're about to use it, but they can't
know if it's just a _regular_ baguette).
It's funny to throw bread at people.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: You can now bake croissants to add to your breakfast.
add: Traitorous chefs can bake dangerous throwing croissants, Mimes can
do this and gain the additional benefit of a deadly combat baguette.
/:cl:

* Add Croissants & Traitorous Baking Techniques

* merge skew

Refactor MssubMcp API & Runtime Assumptions

Much to unpack in this commit.

The first thing to address is we preliminarily settle a debate about
where the primary runtime boundaries lie in regard to what is just a
collection of supervisors and services and where we should be defining
OTP Applications.  In this case the subsystem level becomes the level of
the OTP Application.  This means we make firmly establish what processes
exist, how they're identified or accessed, how they are started and
updated, and how everything is bootstrapped.  The original think was to
leave many of these decisions to the top level application for the
maximum flexibility, but in retrospect that's not really necessary and
adds additional complexity.  By the time we have a subsystem defined we
can have stronger opinions about what the runtime properties should be
that the subsystem supports, leaving the top level application to really
be a consumer of the services provided as is.  My feeling right now is
that this will leave the supervisory trees and service access in the
correct state that we'll want to see in the overall running application
into which the subsystem has been incorporated.  I feel reasonably
confident that this is a correct level of abstraction, though working
problems of a more distributed architecture and runtime environment
could still change my mind on this.

The second item addressed is that MssubMcp now wraps the APIs of its
components and offers its own Public API for those component functions.
This I am much less confident about; indeed my gut feeling is that this
is ultimately going to be proved an incorrect approach, but there are
some positive arguments that do support the approach that are currently
driving the decision.  It was looking like there could be a fair amount
of ceremony in executing component processes in the MCP Subsystem
runtime service context (correct database, correct enums service,
correct settings service).  By wrapping the component APIs in calls
which ensure the correct service context is set and then returned to the
prior state, we can remove that burden from the calling code.  We also
relieve the development process of the top level application from the
cognitive load of understanding all of the underlying components and
their individual APIs. And then I would also expect that the subsystem
API could remain more stable over time where component APIs may need to
be more volatile.  On the downside we have increased indirection between
the top level caller and the code actually doing the work; we have code
that only serves as wrapper code to maintain or add when a component
does change in a way that needs to be surfaced at the subsystem API
level; probably small performance impacts to manage the indirection;
leaks in the abstraction, such as not eliding the component types &
typespecs which would cause even more duplication or extra maintenance
to address.  The work is done and I'm going to see if there is some
value in it or not by working the application proper.  At the time the
decision was taken some of the service context support from the
subsystem wasn't there and was only developed to make the wrapped API
easier... but I think those components may make the feared ceremony of
the top level caller dealing with the service context moot and the
component API wrapping unnecessary; this includes the mcp_opfn macro
(terrible name, will probably change), the start_mcp_service_context &
stop_mcp_service_context functions, and the process_operation function.

Anyway this commit makes these changes and also sets up the
documentation required for the wrapped API.  Tests have been updated as
well, though we do not focus on testing the wrapped API beyond the
incidental integration test usages.  This is something to be rectified
should the commitment to the wrapped API become stronger (I'm kinda
hoping I end up ripping it out).

I stopped trying to get the perfect answer

Basically longestCommonSubsequence helps alot, but I can't figure
out the best way to handle repeats in the sequence,if I delete the
wrong thing, it messes everything up.

I was thinking: "Jesus fucking christ im gonna have to write a BFS
style search routine to compute minimum number of inserts/deletes
aren't I?"

Then I realized, this assignment doesn't say I HAVE to do that. If
my main goal is to do compression, I've done it. I realized all I
really had to do was just re-run my routine against itself a few times
to get things to pass. Even after ALL the iterations its still possible
that the edits can be wrong in that case I can modify the
stupidScan(..) to FORCE the right edits into the document(costs many
deltas).

[grub] add yet another frigging patch to GRUB "2.04"

* GRUB 2.0 maintainer think they're doing a fine job, even when there are
  CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES that should warrant an immediate out of bound
  release, and instead consider that waiting MONTHS or YEARS to release
  anything is not a big deal at all.
* Ergo, distros, such as Ubuntu, start to pick whatever security patches
  they see fit, since they can simply not RELY on the upstream project to
  produce security releases in a timely manner. One such patch is:
  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2021-03/msg00012.html
* But since there is no new GRUB release per se, they still call their GRUB
  version, onto which they applied patches that have come into existence
  more than 2 years after the actual 2.04 release, "GRUB 2.04".
* Obviously, since GRUB 2.04 + literally hundreds of cherry picked patches
  does deviate a lot from the last release, THINGS BREAK IN SPECTACULAR
  FASHION, such as the recently released Ubuntu 21.04 failing to boot with
  the error: grub_register_command_lockdown not found.
* Oh, and of course, regardless of all the above, if you ask anyone, they'll
  tell you that there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the GRUB release
  process (even if they should long have released 2.05, 2.05-1 and 2.05-2,
  were their maintainer ready to acknowledge that delaying releases DOES
  CREATES MAJOR ISSUES DOWSTREAM, as many people REPEATEDLY pointed to them
  on the GRUB mailing list) or with the Ubuntu GRUB versioning process (that
  really shouldn't be calling their version of GRUB "grub-2.04" but instead
  something like "grub-2.04_ubuntu"). Oh no siree! Instead, the problem must
  all be with Rufus and its maintainer, who should either spend their lives
  pre-emptively figuring which breaking patch every other distro applied out
  there, or limit media creation to DD mode, like any "sensible" person
  would do, since DD mode is the ultimate panacea (Narrator: "It wasn't").
* So, once again, a massive thanks to all the people who have been involved
  in the current GRUB 2.0 shit show, whose DIRECT result is to make end
  users' lives miserable, while GRUB maintainers are hell bent on continuing
  to pretend that everything's just peachy and are busy patting themselves
  on the back on account that "Fedora recently dropped more than 100 of the
  custom patches they had to apply to their GRUB fork" (sic). Nothing to see
  here, it's just GRUB maintainer's Jedi business as usual. Besides, who the
  hell cares about Windows users trying to transition to Linux in a friendly
  manner anyway. I mean, as long as something doesn't affect existing Linux
  users, it isn't a REAL problem, right?...

ZEN: Implement zen-tune v4.12

4.9:
In a surprising turn of events, while benchmarking and testing
hierarchical scheduling with BFQ + writeback throttling, it turns out
that raising the number of requests in queue _actually_ improves
responsiveness and completely eliminates the random stalls that would
normally occur without hierarchical scheduling.

To make this test more intense, I used the following test:

Rotational disk1: rsync -a /source/of/data /target/to/disk1
Rotational disk2: rsync -a /source/of/data /target/to/disk2

And periodically attempted to write super fast with:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/target/to/disk1/block bs=4096

This wrote 10gb incredibly fast to writeback and I encountered zero
stalls through this entire test of 10-15 minutes.

My suspicion is that with cgroups, BFQ is more able to properly sort
among multiple drives, reducing the chance of a starved process.  This
plus writeback throttling completely eliminate any outstanding bugs with
high writeback ratios, letting the user enjoy low latency writes
(application thinks they're already done), and super high throughput due
to batched writes in writeback.

Please note however, without the following configuration, I cannot
guarantee you will not get stalls:

CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ=y
CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_BFQ=y
CONFIG_BFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED=y
CONFIG_DEFAULT_BFQ=y
CONFIG_SCSI_MQ_DEFAULT=n

Special thanks to h2, author of smxi and inxi, for providing evidence
that a configuration specific to Debian did not cause stalls found the
Liquorix kernels under heavy IO load.  This specific configuration
turned out to be hierarchical scheduling on CFQ (thus, BFQ as well).

4.10:
During some personal testing with the Dolphin emulator, MuQSS has
serious problems scaling its frequencies causing poor performance where
boosting the CPU frequencies would have fixed them.  Reducing the
up_threshold to 45 with MuQSS appears to fix the issue, letting the
introduction to "Star Wars: Rogue Leader" run at 100% speed versus about
80% on my test system.

Also, lets refactor the definitions and include some indentation to help
the reader discern what the scope of all the macros are.

4.11:
Increase MICRO_FREQUENCY_UP_THRESHOLD from 95 to 85
Increase MIN_FREQUENCY_UP_THRESHOLD from 11 to 6

These changes should help make using CFS feel a bit more responsive when
working with mostly idle workloads, browsing the web, scrolling through
text, etc.

Increasing the minimum frequency up threshold to 6% may be too
aggressive though.  Will revert this setting if it causes significant
battery drain.

4.12:
Make bfq the default MQ scheduler

Reduce default sampling down factor from 10 to 1

With the world eventually moving to a more laptop heavy configuration,
it's getting more important that we can reduce our frequencies quickly
after performing work.  This is normal with a ton of background
processes that need to perform burst work then sleep.

Since this doesn't really impact performance too much, lets not keep it
part of ZEN_INTERACTIVE.

Some time ago, the minimum frequency up threshold was set to 1 by
default, but the zen configuration was never updated to take advantage
of it.

Remove custom MIN_FREQUENCY_UP_THRESHOLD for MuQSS / ZEN_INTERACTIVE
configurations and make 1 the default for all choices.

Introducing KLapse - A kernel level livedisplay module v4.0:

Author: @tanish2k09 (email: tanish2k09.dev@gmail.com)

What is it?
Kernel-based Lapse ("K-Lapse") is a linear RGB scaling module that 'shifts' RGB based on time (of the day/selected by user), or (since v2.0) brightness. This concept is inspired from
LineageOS (formerly known as 'CyanogenMod') ROM's feature "livedisplay" which also changes the display settings (RGB, hue, temperature, etc) based on time.

Why did you decide to make this? (Tell me a story).
I (personally) am a big fan of the livedisplay feature found on LineageOS ROM. I used it every single day, since Android Lollipop. Starting from Android Nougat, a native night mode
solution was added to AOSP and it felt like livedisplay was still way superior, thanks to its various options (you could say it spoiled me, sure). I also maintained a kernel (Venom
kernel) for the device I was using at that time. It was all good until the OEM dropped support for the device at Android M, and XDA being XDA, was already working on N ROMs. The issue
was, these ROMs weren't LineageOS or based on it, so livedisplay was... gone. I decided I'll try to bring that feature to every other ROM. How would I do that? Of course! The kernel! It
worked on every single ROM, it was the key! I started to work on it ASAP and here it is, up on GitHub, licensed under GPL (check klapse.c), open to everyone :)

How does it work?
Think of it like a fancy night mode, but not really. Klapse is dependent on an RGB interface (like Gamma on MTK and KCAL on SD chipsets). It fetches time from the kernel, converts it to
local time, and selects and RGB set based on the time. The result is really smooth shifting of RGB over time.

How does it really work (dev)?
Klapse mode 1 (time-based scaling) uses a method void klapse_pulse(void) that should ideally be called every minute. This can be done by injecting a pulse call inside another method that
is called repeatedly naturally, like cpufreq or atomic or frame commits. It can be anything, whatever you like, even a kthread, as long as it is called repeatedly naturally. To execute
every 60 seconds, use jiffies or ktime, or any similar method. The pulse function fetches the current time and makes calculations based on the current hour and the values of the tunables
listed down below.

Klapse mode 2 (brightness-based scaling) uses a method void set_rgb_slider(<type> bl_lvl) where is the data type of the brightness level used in your kernel source. (OnePlus 6 uses u32
data type for bl_lvl) set_rgb_slider needs to be called/injected inside a function that sets brightness for your device. (OnePlus 6 uses dsi_panel.c for that, check out the diff for that
file in /op6)

What all stuff can it do?

1, Emulate night mode with the proper RGB settings
2, Smoothly scale from one set of RGB to another set of RGB in integral intervals over time.
3, Reduce perceived brightness using brightness_factor by reducing the amount of color on screen. Allows lower apparent brightness than system permits.
4, Scale RGB based on brightness of display (low brightness usually implies a dark environment, where yellowness is probably useful).
5, Automate the perceived brightness independent of whether klapse is enabled, using its own set of start and stop hours.
6, Be more efficient,faster by residing inside the kernel instead of having to use the HWC HAL like android's night mode.
7, (On older devices) Reduce stuttering or frame lags caused by native night mode.
8, An easier solution against overlay-based apps that run as service in userspace/Android and sometimes block apps asking for permissions.
9, Give you a Livedisplay alternative if it doesn't work in your ROM.
10, Impress your crush so you can get a date (Hey, don't forget to credit me if it works).

Alright, so this is a replacement for night mode?
NO! Not at all. One can say this is merely an alternative for LineageOS' Livedisplay, but inside a kernel. Night mode is a sub-function of both Livedisplay and KLapse. Most comparisons
here were made with night mode because that's what an average user uses, and will relate to the most. There is absolutely no reason for your Android kernel to not have KLapse. Go ahead
and add it or ask your kernel maintainer to. It's super-easy!

What can it NOT do (yet)?

1, Calculate scaling to the level of minutes, like "Start from 5:37pm till 7:19am". --TODO
2, Make coffee for you.
3, Fly you to the moon. Without a heavy suit.
4, Get you a monthly subscription of free food, cereal included.

All these following tunables are found in their respective files in /sys/klapse/

1. enable_klapse : A switch to enable or disable klapse. Values : 0 = off, 1 = on (since v2.0, 2 = brightness-dependent mode)
2. klapse_start_hour : The hour at which klapse should start scaling the RGB values from daytime to target (see next points). Values : 0-23
3. klapse_stop_hour : The hour by which klapse should scale back the RGB values from target to daytime (see next points). Values : 0-23
4. daytime_rgb : The RGB set that must be used for all the time outside of start and stop hour range.
5. target_rgb : The RGB set that must be scaled towards for all the time inside of start and stop hour range.
6. klapse_scaling_rate : Controls how soon the RGB reaches from daytime to target inside of start and stop hour range. Once target is reached, it remains constant till 30 minutes before
   stop hour, where target RGB scales back to daytime RGB.
7. brightness_factor : From the name itself, this value has the ability to bend perception and make your display appear as if it is at a lesser brightness level than it actually is at.
   It works by reducing the RGB values by the same factor. Values : 2-10, (10 means accurate brightness, 5 means 50% of current brightness, you get it)
8. brightness_factor_auto : A switch that allows you to automatically set the brightness factor in a set time range. Value : 0 = off, 1 = on
9. brightness_factor_auto_start_hour : The hour at which brightness_factor should be applied. Works only if #8 is 1. Values : 0-23
10. brightness_factor_auto_stop_hour : The hour at which brightness_factor should be reverted to 10. Works only if #8 is 1. Values : 0-23
11. backlight_range : The brightness range within which klapse should scale from daytime to target_rgb. Works only if #1 is 2. Values : MIN_BRIGHTNESS-MAX_BRIGHTNESS

Aimed shot and spotting now have laser beams. (#1905)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

Aiming a shot on a sniper rifle now adds a red laser beam that connects
the target and the aimer. Spotting designators will emanate a faint
yellow one. Both will slowly increase in alpha from 0 to max as the
tracking progresses.

The sniper's laser beam can be disabled with a button, but keeping it
enabled reduces aiming shot time. Cloaked spotters will not cause a beam
to appear.

Completely resprited the indicators for spotting (it's now yellow) and
aiming (it's now red, usually)

The XM42B and PMC sniper rifles have more intense blue lasers and
reticles.

Stepping through laser beams will check for eye protection, if it isn't
sufficient, and the small probability chance passes, the target will
scream in pain! Completely flavor. If they have enough eye protection,
it will bounce off their headgear, and if said protection is BiMex
patented personal shades it will create a cool visual effect.

Refactored eye_protection to have three levels, flavor, flashes, and
welding. Sunglasses have flavor protection, sechuds have flash
protection, welding gear has welding protection.

The spotter's designator now has a white band on it to distinguish it
from the rest.

> Aiming a shot on a sniper rifle now adds a red laser beam that

The primary reason for this addition is because it looks sick as FUCK.
The secondary one is to help xenos see where they're being shot from.

> The sniper's laser beam can be disabled with a button, but keeping it
enabled reduces aiming shot time. Cloaked spotters will not cause a beam
to appear.

Makes sense, cloaked sniper/spotters shouldn't be made completely
useless due to the beam. It makes sense for the laser to reduce aim time
and it isn't a pain for xenomorphs to deal with as they know exactly
where it is coming from and where they can run for cover (And other
xenos can protect them better)

> Completely resprited the indicators for spotting (it's now yellow) and
aiming (it's now red, usually)

It made no sense for sniper reticles to be blue. Red is danger, yellow
is warning, blue is.... good? Additionally, since both reticles for
spotting and aiming were nigh-identical, it caused quite the amount of
confusion. I've tested it myself, you can spook away xenos with only
spotting because they think it's the aimed shot reticle.

> The XM42B and PMC sniper rifles have more intense blue lasers and
reticles.

Look, I know what I just said makes this sound stupid. But I think it
makes a lot of sense for the dangerous high-tech sniper rifles to have
stronger blue lasers, it just feels like a 'strong sci fi laser' color.
Like the pulse rifle in base ss13, it looks similar to the disabler but
you don't see anyone complaining. The base sniper reticle being red is
enough for people to realize this is a more dangerous version anyways.

> Stepping through laser beams will check for eye protection, if it
isn't sufficient, and the small probability chance passes, the target
will scream in pain! Completely flavor. If they have enough eye

Cool flavor. Also lore-accurate!

:cl:
add: Aiming a shot on a sniper rifle now adds a red laser beam that
connects the target and the aimer. Spotting designators will emanate a
faint yellow one. Both will slowly increase in alpha from 0 to max as
the tracking progresses.
bal: The sniper's laser beam can be disabled with a button, but keeping
it enabled reduces aiming shot time. Cloaked spotters will not cause a
beam to appear.
imageadd: Completely resprited the indicators for spotting (it's now
yellow) and aiming (it's now red, usually)
imageadd: The XM42B and PMC sniper rifles have more intense blue lasers
and reticles.
add: Stepping through laser beams will check for eye protection, if it
isn't sufficient, and the small probability chance passes, the target
will scream in pain! Completely flavor. If they have enough eye
protection, it will bounce off their headgear, and if said protection is
BiMex patented personal shades it will create a cool visual effect.
refactor: Refactored eye_protection to have three levels, flavor,
flashes, and welding. Sunglasses have flavor protection, sechuds have
flash protection, welding gear has welding protection.
imageadd: The spotter's designator now has a white band on it to
distinguish it from the rest.

[core] WIP - mixed 32/64 implementation

I'm checking this in because there are some interesting ideas in here
for dealing with, eg, a 32-bit wide heap even on 64-bit machines, using
relative addressing. There are interesting questions about when you want
to deal with relative vs absolute addresses, when to convert them, etc.
I came to the conclusion that it made the most sense to always push
absolute addresses onto the stack - and @ and ! and friends would expect
absolute addresses - only converting them to relative form when writing
them into or reading them from a heap cell.

NEXT would be a bit slower because it has to do this conversion - when
reading an xt (a 32-bit relative pointer), it has to make it absolute (by
adding the heap origin address) before fetching the code field - which
is also a relative address, but this time relative to mu_do_colon;
chosen carefully so that colon words would always have a code field with
all zeros, so it would be easily recognizable. ;-)

I've decided to pursue a different approach. Instead of having a nice
compact heap on all platforms, instead let's favor the address size of
the machine. On a 32-bit machine, heap cells - which mostly contain
addresses - are 32 bits wide. And on a 64-bit machine they are 64 bits.
We can write a very natural NEXT that uses machine pointers in most
obvious and efficient way.

The tricky part comes with dealing with *values*. I want to keep the
64-bit computational nature of muforth intact, so the stacks will remain
64 bits wide on all platforms. This works cleanly on a 64-bit machine:
the stacks and the heap are both 64-bits wide. On a 32-bit machine,
we have to store values in two consecutive cells, and be careful about
alignment or do 64-bit fetches and stores in two 32-bit pieces. I'm not
too concerned about this because 32-bit machines are not the "intended"
host platform for muforth; I'm much more interested in a stellar
experience on 64-bit machines. But if I can get it to work reasonably
well on 32-bit machines, great.

Some of the changes I've made while experimenting with the
relative-addressed heap still apply, and there are also some changes in
the way that values are communicated between C and Forth that I want to
keep, so I'm going to start from here as I continue on this adventure
into the heap!

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

Uytterhoeven.

useless update_appearance reduction, emissive_blocker micro optimization (saves a second of init) (#71658)

## About The Pull Request

[Saves 0.2 seconds of init time. 50% of emissive
blockers](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/8318b648f6d32844aacbfb4c309152cd45801f5c)

Emissive blockers are a decent expense during init, even these, which
are the ones that update outside of initialize.
I've inlined them, removed some redundant vars and checks, reduced the
arg count, and shifted some things around. This ends up saving 200ms, or
50% of its total cost.

I also shifted mutable_appearance about a bit. it's not a massive
saving, but it is technically faster

[Prevents a few redundant appearance_updates, saves 0.8 seconds of
init](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/5475cd778b66b22b1e2c8d86b2c6d59fb84f219a)

Prequisit info: update_appearance is decently expensive
It's good then to only do it if we have a reason to, right?

Me and moth were shooting the shit about just general init time, and we
came up with the idea of tracking which update_appearances actually
"worked" and which didn't.

That bit comes later, let's enjoy the fruits of that work first

First, holograms were calling update_appearance on process, for almost
no reason.
I patched the one event they don't already "react" to, and then locked
it behind a change decection if.
good for live, doesn't impact init.

Next, decals. If you add a decal to something before it inits, it'll
react to the after successful init signal.
The trouble is the same atom could have its appearance updated from this
MORE then once, since decals can be stacked on tiles, and signal
unregisters don't work once the signal is sent.
So we add a flag to track if we've had this happen to us or not, so it
only happens once.
saves 80 ms

Power! lots of things call power_change on init, often more then once.
We'll update appearance for each of those calls, even if only one is an
actual change.
That's silly, better to track what sort of power we're using for our
appearance and go off that changing

This was taking about 300ms. Really stupid

Icon smoothing. After emissive blockers were added, any change to
something's icon smoothing would lead to an update_appearance call.
Nasty shit, specially cause of walls, which don't even use emissive
blockers.
Ok then, so we'll always update appearance for movables, and will allow
turfs that are interested to hook it manually.
Not many of those anyhow
This is slightly a dev ux thing, but it saves 600ms so I think it's
worth it. Rare case anyway

Telecomms:
telecomm machines were updating appearance on process. This is to cover
for them turning on/off on process.
Better then to just check if on actually changed.
This cost adds up midgame, doesn't impact init tho

Materials:
There's this update_appearance call in material on_apply. it doesn't do
anything.
The logs will lie to you and say it does, but it's just like reapplying
emissives. It doesn't need to exist
Saves like 50ms

Canisters:
Live thing, lots of time wasted updating appearance for no reason, lets
see if we change anything first yes?

[Uses defines to wrap update_appearance for
tracking](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/4fa82e1c9d93577aadb3c743f17196331f62e67c)

[Undoes _update_appearance changes, instead reccomends 2 regexes to
use](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/a8c8fec57a4e43d1fa636b5ac68459903faa9fc5)

I need file and line number for my tracking, so I need to override
update_appearance calls, and also preferably not require every override
of update_appearance to handle dummy file + line args.

So instead, I created a wrapper proc that checks to see if appearanaces
match (they're unique remember, the two of the same visual appearance
will be equivalent)
The trouble is I can't intercept JUST proc calls, or JUST function
definitions with defines. it needs to be both.

So I renamed the /update_appearance proc to /_update_appearance

this way I can capture old uses, and don't need to worry about merge/dev
brain skew

~~It does mean that all update_appearance proc definitions now look
weird tho.
My profiling is leaking into dev ux. I wish I had better templating.~~

**The above is no longer being pr'd**, it's instead just recommended via
a few regexes adjacent to the define.
Smelled wrong anyhow

[Adds a setter for panel_open, so I can update_appearance on
it](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/71658/commits/cf1df8a69fc1a816391d085ee7419b14f9fe9167)

Minor plane cube cleanup (#72038)

## About The Pull Request

[Fixes area lighting not working on turf change in multiz
cases](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/7b92deffbca92a834cb0a361fd685de51a12ea53)

If you modify a area lit turf when using multiz, it'd end up using the
wrong plane for its light, because of stupid shit on my part.
Stupid shit resolved

[Fixes some uses of plane masters that only specified one rather then
all](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/a59ec96d29710b967bf8b3ffe8210b230cb194b3)

Transpile packages on demand, validate all TS projects (#146212)

## Dearest Reviewers 👋 

I've been working on this branch with @mistic and @tylersmalley and
we're really confident in these changes. Additionally, this changes code
in nearly every package in the repo so we don't plan to wait for reviews
to get in before merging this. If you'd like to have a concern
addressed, please feel free to leave a review, but assuming that nobody
raises a blocker in the next 24 hours we plan to merge this EOD pacific
tomorrow, 12/22.

We'll be paying close attention to any issues this causes after merging
and work on getting those fixed ASAP. 🚀

---

The operations team is not confident that we'll have the time to achieve
what we originally set out to accomplish by moving to Bazel with the
time and resources we have available. We have also bought ourselves some
headroom with improvements to babel-register, optimizer caching, and
typescript project structure.

In order to make sure we deliver packages as quickly as possible (many
teams really want them), with a usable and familiar developer
experience, this PR removes Bazel for building packages in favor of
using the same JIT transpilation we use for plugins.

Additionally, packages now use `kbn_references` (again, just copying the
dx from plugins to packages).

Because of the complex relationships between packages/plugins and in
order to prepare ourselves for automatic dependency detection tools we
plan to use in the future, this PR also introduces a "TS Project Linter"
which will validate that every tsconfig.json file meets a few
requirements:

1. the chain of base config files extended by each config includes
`tsconfig.base.json` and not `tsconfig.json`
1. the `include` config is used, and not `files`
2. the `exclude` config includes `target/**/*`
3. the `outDir` compiler option is specified as `target/types`
1. none of these compiler options are specified: `declaration`,
`declarationMap`, `emitDeclarationOnly`, `skipLibCheck`, `target`,
`paths`

4. all references to other packages/plugins use their pkg id, ie:
	
	```js
    // valid
    {
      "kbn_references": ["@kbn/core"]
    }
    // not valid
    {
      "kbn_references": [{ "path": "../../../src/core/tsconfig.json" }]
    }
    ```

5. only packages/plugins which are imported somewhere in the ts code are
listed in `kbn_references`

This linter is not only validating all of the tsconfig.json files, but
it also will fix these config files to deal with just about any
violation that can be produced. Just run `node scripts/ts_project_linter
--fix` locally to apply these fixes, or let CI take care of
automatically fixing things and pushing the changes to your PR.

> **Example:** [`64e93e5`
(#146212)](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/146212/commits/64e93e580679dd55f4fdf19bd01402bc478a1a75)
When I merged main into my PR it included a change which removed the
`@kbn/core-injected-metadata-browser` package. After resolving the
conflicts I missed a few tsconfig files which included references to the
now removed package. The TS Project Linter identified that these
references were removed from the code and pushed a change to the PR to
remove them from the tsconfig.json files.

## No bazel? Does that mean no packages??
Nope! We're still doing packages but we're pretty sure now that we won't
be using Bazel to accomplish the 'distributed caching' and 'change-based
tasks' portions of the packages project.

This PR actually makes packages much easier to work with and will be
followed up with the bundling benefits described by the original
packages RFC. Then we'll work on documentation and advocacy for using
packages for any and all new code.

We're pretty confident that implementing distributed caching and
change-based tasks will be necessary in the future, but because of
recent improvements in the repo we think we can live without them for
**at least** a year.

## Wait, there are still BUILD.bazel files in the repo
Yes, there are still three webpack bundles which are built by Bazel: the
`@kbn/ui-shared-deps-npm` DLL, `@kbn/ui-shared-deps-src` externals, and
the `@kbn/monaco` workers. These three webpack bundles are still created
during bootstrap and remotely cached using bazel. The next phase of this
project is to figure out how to get the package bundling features
described in the RFC with the current optimizer, and we expect these
bundles to go away then. Until then any package that is used in those
three bundles still needs to have a BUILD.bazel file so that they can be
referenced by the remaining webpack builds.

Create #ReviseWithArsh

https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/submissions/870331892/
Leetcode_Microsoft_/#ReviseWithArsh

# Intuition
<!-- Describing  first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
In the question they are basically talking about a game Bulls and Cows in which suppose you and your friend are playing a game in which you have written down a secret number in a paper and now you are asking your friend to make a guess...
Suppose you have written a secret number "4566" and now you asked your friend to guess. So there are two possibilities:
1.Either your friend will guess BULL.
2.Or he/she will guess COW.

THINGS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BULL AND COW MEANS:
BULL denotes the digits of guess number which are also present in secret number and are at the right position as the digit in the secret number.
COWS denotes the digits of guess number which are also in the secret number but not at the right position as in the secret number.

# Approach
<!-- Describing the approach to solving the problem. -->
First of all, we will consider two arrays:
1. An array of SecretFrequency of integer type which will contain occurrences of a particular number in the secret number.
2. Another array of GuessFrequecy of integer type which will contain occurrences of the digits in the guess number.

Firsty we initilaize Both COWS and BULLS as 0 then call the loop and check if both digit in the guess number is a COW or BULL if both position and value is correct, we will increment the value of BULLS
IF NOT
THEN, suppose if the digit on the first index in the secret and guess string does not match then we will increment both the arrays 
(i). Array SecretFre with the digit on the (suppose)first index of secret string.
(ii).Array GuessFre with the digit on the (suppose)first index of guess string.

THEN we will find the number of COWS by finding the mininmum occurence of the number in both the arrays.

THEN FINALLY WILL RETURN THE ANS IN THE FORMAT "xAyB"
where x is the number of BULLS and y is the number of COWS...

REMEMBER WE HAVE DIGITS[0,9] i.e. 10 digits
ALSO LINE 16 AND 17 , it is done to convert string into integer because we have to store integer in the aaray...

[FIX] website, *: allow to re-edit company team snippet images

*: web_editor

Since [1], it was not possible to edit a company team snippet image
anymore as soon as the page was saved once. Indeed that commit added
o_not_editable/contenteditable="false" on the parent column to make sure
no text can be added in that column and contenteditable="true" on the
images so that they are still editable (even though HTML-specs-wise
adding contenteditable="true" on images probably does not mean much as
images are self-closing tags, our editor understand that as the ability
to edit the image anyway). That contenteditable="true" part is however
removed when leaving edit mode... and was not restored upon entering
edit mode again.

This fixes the problems with an ugly patch. We'll review what to do in
master.

Funny enough, that bug was actually gone in 15.0... by mistake. A recent
bug fix actually reintroduced that isolated bug at [2] (by reintroducing
the fact that images in a non-editable environment are not possible to
edit). The 3 opened tickets this commit mentions were actually reported
for 15.0 immediately after that, while the 14.0 being broken about this
since the beginning apparently did not bother anyone.

Loadout - Sniper facepaint (#2015)

# About the pull request

This PR is here to add the sniper facepaint into the loadout for 4
points like the skull facepaint.
 
 I tested it and it worked well as expected.
 
I saw a lot of marines asking the sniper for their bodypaint recently,
and i thought, that since it doesnt change anything game-wise we could
give it on the loadout, as the sniper isnt always here and sometime even
throw it to the trash...also people wont annoy the sniper for his paint
too.

((sorry for the webedit i ran into some problem doing the PR with visual
code studio))

# Explain why it's good for the game

I think its good because it add more customisation to characters with
one more good looking facepaint and like i said earlier, i saw some
marines asking the sniper for it (talked about it on discord and people
seemed to be ok with it)

Fishing Odds Code Improvements and Rescue Hooks (#71415)

## About The Pull Request
I wanted to try and implement an easier way for people to fish out
corpses from chasms, as I heard many tales of people trying to fish
others out of chasms and it taking over one IRL hour, with some cases
where it would take over two hours. Obviously, that's not really
interesting gameplay, and it doesn't really give people an incentive to
fish, it just turns it into an annoyance that people won't want to do
for fun. Now, we don't want that, do we?

As such, I've created the rescue hook, a special fishing hook that can
only be used in chasms (as that's currently the only place you can find
people into), which will only be able to fish out duds, skeleton
corpses, any mob that's fallen into a chasm and hasn't been rescued yet,
or rarely, a hostile monster lurking below. It has, at the time of
writing this, a weight of 5 (50 without bait, lower with bait) for duds
and a weight of 30 for chasm detritus, which themselves have a 50%
chance to be a random skeleton corpse, or a lobstrosity, and the
remaining 50% chance of fishing out a mob that's fallen into a chasm.
I'm open to tweaking these values if we think it's too easy or too hard,
but it's still a rather expensive item, so I'd consider it quite fine
the way it is myself, as it's still not risk-free.

It's currently only obtainable through buying it from cargo in the
goodies section, at a default price of 600 credits (making it
SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive than the rest of the fishing content, and
making it something that assistants will have to put some elbow grease
into if they want to be able to afford it).

As it stands currently, it can't be used to recover the fallen's
belongings that weren't on their person (i.e., their crusher if they
were holding it in hands), ~*but* I'm down to make that easier to fish
out using, for instance, the magnet hook, while also making it
incompatible with fishing out bodies, which would make it a nice way to
recover those lost items without spending over an hour fishing for them,
if that's something that maintainers would want.~ Maintainers did want
it, and as such...

The Magnetic hook is now the go-to hook to retrieve objects from chasms!
Not only does it inherently do a much better job at fishing out
non-fishes, it also has a lesser chance of retrieving random junk from
chasms, and an even lower chance of fishing out lobstrosities!

I also improved the code for the fishing weights calculation so that the
hooks and the rods can have an effect on the odds of certain types of
rewards more easily, with the option of offloading a more of what's
currently being calculated on `fishing_challenge` over on the rods or
even the hooks themselves.

I finished by fixing a handful of capitalization and punctuation issues
in various fishing items, as that bugged me when I was testing my
changes.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Corpses being recoverable from chasms was a great idea, however making
it so people would have to sink a major portion of their shift for a
chance at recovering a corpse doesn't create a particularly interesting
gameplay loop. However, being able to spend your hard-earned funds in
order to streamline that process without really being able to use that
to cheese other mechanics sounds like a great deal to me.

## Changelog

:cl: GoldenAlpharex
add: Added a Rescue Hook, that will allow the fishing rod it's attached
onto to become a lot more proficient at recovering corpses from chasms,
at the expense of making it unusable for more traditional fishing. It
isn't entirely lobstrosity-proof, however...
balance: The magnetic hook can no longer fish out corpses from chasms,
but will fish out items much more efficiently than any other hooks,
while also being much less attractive to lobstrosities. Some still fall
for it regardless, however.
spellcheck: Fixed the capitalization and punctuation in the description
of multiple fishing accessories.
code: Improved the code for fishing weights, to allow for different
hooks to have some more noticeable results on the weights without having
to add to an already massive proc.

serial: core: Allow processing sysrq at port unlock time

[ Upstream commit d6e1935819db0c91ce4a5af82466f3ab50d17346 ]

Right now serial drivers process sysrq keys deep in their character
receiving code.  This means that they've already grabbed their
port->lock spinlock.  This can end up getting in the way if we've go
to do serial stuff (especially kgdb) in response to the sysrq.

Serial drivers have various hacks in them to handle this.  Looking at
'8250_port.c' you can see that the console_write() skips locking if
we're in the sysrq handler.  Looking at 'msm_serial.c' you can see
that the port lock is dropped around uart_handle_sysrq_char().

It turns out that these hacks aren't exactly perfect.  If you have
lockdep turned on and use something like the 8250_port hack you'll get
a splat that looks like:

  WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
  [...] is trying to acquire lock:
  ... (console_owner){-.-.}, at: console_unlock+0x2e0/0x5e4

  but task is already holding lock:
  ... (&port_lock_key){-.-.}, at: serial8250_handle_irq+0x30/0xe4

  which lock already depends on the new lock.

  the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:

                                 lock(console_owner);
                                 lock(&port_lock_key);
    lock(console_owner);

   *** DEADLOCK ***

The hack used in 'msm_serial.c' doesn't cause the above splats but it
seems a bit ugly to unlock / lock our spinlock deep in our irq
handler.

It seems like we could defer processing the sysrq until the end of the
interrupt handler right after we've unlocked the port.  With this
scheme if a whole batch of sysrq characters comes in one irq then we
won't handle them all, but that seems like it should be a fine
compromise.

Traitor UI only shows Unlock/Failsafe Code if you have it (#72114)

## About The Pull Request

There are cases in which you don't have an unlock code (if the uplink is
implanted in you from the start) and you obviously don't always start
with with a failsafe code (need to buy it). So, let's only fill in this
fields in the UI should they exist.

There might be something to be said about wanting to ensure that people
remember that they can check this UI screen to find the failsafe code
should they lose it later, and I wouldn't mind changing the string to be
something like "Failsafe: None" in that case. However, I just think that
keeping it as:

```txt
Code:
Failsafe:
```

is silly and should be changed somehow.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Note: That white box isn't part of the UI, that's a part of the edit I
did to the screenshot in the area where the stuff... isn't? What was i
thinking

I think the UI looks a lot cleaner for those cases when you just don't

Bug 1763005 - Improve tracing logging to be cross-thread.

The initial explanation mechanism used the "set this subscriber to be
used on this thread only" using a guard for lifecycle purposes.  This
provide a linearized JSON log that wouldn't contaminate other threads,
but was inherently single-threaded because after the tokio 0.2 overhaul,
tokio didn't really have a good way to propagate that subscriber to
other threads along with the span.

Notionally
https://docs.rs/tracing-futures/0.2.5/tracing_futures/trait.WithSubscriber.html
would provide this, but as explained at
https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/593 and also somewhat at
https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/discussions/1626 which gave rise
to our initial implementation (or a related issue did?), that doesn't
work currently.

In the bigger picture, we also do potentially want to do more than
per-"query" logging.  That said our use cases are strongly biased to
"here's this top-level span and I want a hierarchy of everything that
happened in this span and I'm going to report this back to the user or
the test case" as opposed to I want an omniscient view of everything
going on right now".  So something global was always desired.

The approach I've gone with is to discover tracing-forest and decide
that it's great for our next step, and maybe forever.  The primary
trade-off is that it buffers the span tree until it's ready to be
flushed but there are potentially a bunch of up-sides to this and also:
- Understanding what's going on in the system is most important.
- Our logging implemented thus far already has a concept of having the
  request explicitly be told that we want its logging, and this seems
  like a reasonable approach to continue.  Especially because I think
  it's likely we'll also want to support a "needle" mechanism where we
  conditionalize either the log or its output on being related to the
  needle.
- We're already throwing a fair bit of RAM at searchfox and both for
  performance reasons and just human ability to comprehend things, the
  "needle" mechanism I describe above likely means that our 80% case
  for the logging would be trying very hard to not exceed a megabyte
  of logs.
- tracing-forest explicitly has the concept of "a worker should
  process the logs" which is well suited for being able to use
  parallelism to our advantage in the processing and also to leverage
  the abstract span reps to potentially do log decimation on that
  worker thread.

All that said, I do expect to learn a bunch from this, but the most
important thing is that I can tell people how to run a query in explain
mode and have them see something reasonable and non-overwhelming and
am very willing to take a hit to efficiency in this opt-in logging
mode.

The main lesson learned in this whole experience is that things will
break badly if you try and hold an entered span across an await()
call.  The tracing docs are clear that you shouldn't do this, and
in some cases the type system will prevent you from doing this
(maybe the problem was I prefixed the entered guard with a `_`?),
but if we mess this up, it can absolutely cause tracing-forest to
be unable to close out the span hierarchy because a reference to a
span can end up stuck in a thread's thread-local-storage resulting
in `on_close` never being invoked for the span.

Tenstorrent chips are the ones I am the most hyped about, so I am going to post that there and apply for the SDK. I want to see what kind of programming model it has. I'll know right away then whether I am right or not to be hyped about it. If it is like Graphcore's with building up raw AST nodes in C++, I'll ditch it like garbage that it is and set my sights upon PIM chips.

script: New script to download Node source files

This will be used for fetching NodeJS source and headers, and other
related files, which are used for running certain tests
having to do with building native C/C++ modules.

(Updating the version of Node's source/headers we build against in the
tests has proven necessary from time to time, for reasons that aren't
entirely clear. It seems most likely to me that `node-gyp` has trouble
running on a recent NodeJS version but building against a much older
Node version, perhaps due to subtle changes in Node over time, and due
to assumptions made in node-gyp that the running version of Node will
have similar properties to the target version of Node, with those
assumptions failing to anticipate the actual scope of changes made to
newer Node compared to older versions?)

So, we do have to update these source/header files every do often.

Newer NodeJS versions are getting bigger and bigger, to the point
where checking in all the necessary files would amount to over 100
megabytes, and potentially triple the bandwitdth/disk space needed to
clone this repository. And it would be at least as bad all over again
if we even needed to bump these files to even newer Node later on.

To this day, one of the largest contributors to this repo's size was
the bump to Node v10.20.1 I did over a year ago. Small text files
compress incredibly efficiently, whereas binary files don't compress
anywhere near as well (like Node's source tarballs, for example).

GitHub also warns when you upload files over 50 megabytes,
whereas some of these tarballs are closer to 70 or 80 megabytes now.

So, this script ensures we can fetch & populate the files into this
repo's spec/fixtures dir just before running the tests.

If you've already run it once, this script  will simply check the
cryptographic hashes of the files, to make sure they were downloaded
correctly. If the hash is incorrect, it will attempt to redownload
at most once per already-existing file before giving up.

This should do a reasonable job at ensuring we reliably have these
files, without having to check them in to the repo in git, and without
wasting a lot of bandwidth and disk space for a simple clone of this
repo.

(Git submodules were another option, but their tooling is somewhat
clunky in my opinion, and it would just be punting the
"really large files" problem to somewhere else on GitHub. I think it's
much better to simply fetch these large files off the web as-needed,
and make some attempt to cache them/keep them around afterward, rather
than checking them in to any sort of main git repo or submodule repo.
So that's what this script does instead -- fetch files from the web.)

[MIRROR] Gatfruit will no longer drop from ice portals. [MDB IGNORE] (#18202)

* Gatfruit will no longer drop from ice portals. (#72048)

## About The Pull Request

For some god-forsaken reason, somebody decided that ice portals should
be able to drop one of the most disruptive items in the game. This PR
amends this by removing it from the drop pool.

## Why It's Good For The Game

In 2013 gatfruit was introduced in the following PR #2000 . This was
almost a decade ago at this point, repeatedly through the PR the creator
states his belief that this item should only ever be obtainable through
admin intervention due to its ridiculous capabilities. At the time
everyone in the PR agreed it was a reasonable item to add **as it was
unobtainable without admin intervention**. Over the years, it has crept
its way to become more prevalent and openly obtainable, the most
offensive of these options is the ice moon portal. As is, there is a 1
in 28 chance of obtaining the seeds, this sounds pretty inoffensive
right? That's just 3.44% probability. Now, let us search the instances
of the portal that spawns this.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16896032/208220173-bbefe604-0885-44a5-9add-b5f0c62067cc.png)

That is a big number, a lot of chances to get that seed packet and other
gamer looters. Now, let's take a look at the probability of being able
to get these seeds, assuming you wipe out all of the portals.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16896032/208220460-3f59a2ac-d936-4f3a-aa14-9c637af6a9d7.png)

92.8% chance to be able to get these seeds each shift if you focus
entirely on gaming the portals. That's a pretty insane probability of
being able to obtain the gatfruit seeds.

While I dislike people who sprint to the seed vault, there is at least
the possibility of a pod person telling them to fuck off when they
demand their _free_ gamer seed. There is also the fact that the ruin
isn't a guaranteed spawn every shift.

[SDK][CMLIB] Implement log transaction writes & Resuscitation

=== DOCUMENTATION REMARKS ===

This implements (also enables some parts of code been decayed for years) the transacted writing of the registry. Transacted writing (or writing into registry in a transactional way) is an operation that ensures the successfulness can be achieved by monitoring two main points.
In CMLIB, such points are what we internally call them the primary and secondary sequences. A sequence is a numeric field that is incremented each time a writing operation (namely done with the FileWrite function and such) has successfully completed.

The primary sequence is incremented to suggest that the initial work of syncing the registry is in progress. During this phase, the base block header is written into the primary hive file and registry data is being written to said file in form of blocks. Afterwards the seconady sequence
is increment to report completion of the transactional writing of the registry. This operation occurs in HvpWriteHive function (invoked by HvSyncHive for syncing). If the transactional writing fails or if the lazy flushing of the registry fails, LOG files come into play.

Like HvpWriteHive, LOGs are updated by the HvpWriteLog which writes dirty data (base block header included) to the LOG themselves. These files serve for recovery and emergency purposes in case the primary machine hive has been damaged due to previous forced interruption of writing stuff into
the registry hive. With specific recovery algorithms, the data that's been gathered from a LOG will be applied to the primary hive, salvaging it. But if a LOG file is corrupt as well, then the system will perform resuscitation techniques by reconstructing the base block header to reasonable values,
reset the registry signature and whatnot.

This work is an inspiration from PR #3932 by mrmks04 (aka Max Korostil). I have continued his work by doing some more tweaks and whatnot. In addition to that, the whole transaction writing code is documented.

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===

HvpWriteLog -- Currently this function lacks the ability to grow the log file size since we pretty much lack the necessary code that deals with hive shrinking and log shrinking/growing as well. This part is not super critical for us so this shall be left as a TODO for future.

HvLoadHive -- Currently there's a hack that prevents us from refactoring this function in a proper way. That is, we should not be reading the whole and prepare the hive storage using HvpInitializeMemoryHive which is strictly used for HINIT_MEMORY but rather we must read the hive file block by block
and deconstruct the read buffer from the file so that we can get the bins that we read from the file. With the hive bins we got the hive storage will be prepared based on such bins. If one of the bins is corrupt, self healing is applied in such scenario.

For this matter, if in any case the hive we'll be reading is corrupt we could potentially read corrupt data and lead the system into failure. So we have to perform header and data recovery as well before reading the whole hive.

Another important note is that the added code grew up the binary size of x64 FreeLdr and that makes a PE image check fail because the bootloader is too large. Currently such code is disabled for AMD64, until
a real fix comes into place.

Refactors memories to be less painful to add and apply, moves memory detail / text to memory subtypes. Adds some new memories to demonstrate.  (#72110)

## About The Pull Request

So, a huge issue with memories and - what I personally believe is the
reason why not many have been added since their inception is - they're
very annoying to add!

Normally, adding subtypes of stuff like traumas or hallucinations are as
easy as doing just that, adding a subtype.

But memories used this factory argument passing method combined with
holding all their strings in a JSON file which made it just frustrating
to add, debug, or just mess with.

It also made it much harder to organize new memories keep it clean for
stuff like downstreams.

So I refactored it. Memories are now handled on a subtype by subtype
basis, instead of all memories being a `/datum/memory`.

Any variety of arguments can be passed into memories like addcomponent
(KWARGS) so each subtype can have their own `new` parameters.

This makes it much much easier to add a new memory. All you need to do
is make your subtype and add it somewhere. Don't need to mess with jsons
or defines or anything.

To demonstrate this, I added a few memories. Some existing memories had
their story values tweak to compensate.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Makes it way simpler to add new memories. Maybe we'll get some more fun
ones now?

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
add: Roundstart captains will now memorize the code to the spare ID
safe.
add: Traitors will now memorize the location and code to their uplink.
add: Heads of staff winning a revolution will now get a memory of their
success.
add: Heads of staff and head revolutionaries who lose their respective
sides of the revolution also get a memory of their failure.
add: Completing a ritual of knowledge as a heretic grants you a quality
memory.
add: Successfully defusing a bomb now grants you a cool memory. Failing
it will also grant you a memory, though you will likely not be alive to
see it.
add: Planting bombs now increase their memory quality depending on how
cool the bomb is.
refactor: Memories have been refactored to be much easier to add.

Feature: introduce native (ambient) TS types

- Add type definitions and type tests.
- Explicitly specify the SemVer policy in the README.
- Configure CI to run type tests against the package.
- Add a note to the migration docs about how to update to use these.

This will shortly be superceded by types published from source *and*
using the types published by Ember itself. Publishing this ahead of
this provides a path for teams to start using `ember-qunit` with
TypeScript *without* pulling it from DefinitelyTyped, allows us to
remove `ember-qunit` from DefinitelyTyped entirely, and does not block
either of those wins on the timeline of a full TS conversion.

To make this work, we need (because one of our dependencies needs) a
peer and dev dep on `@glimmer/interfaces` and `@glimmer/interfaces`, so
that types which use those will type check. This is: annoying in the
extreme. We will want to keep thinking about how to tackle this as an
ecosystem; for now, they are marked as *optional* so no one will have
things blow up as a result of this at least (and that's also correct:
we *only* need them for TS).

Fishing-themed Escape Shuttle (#71805)

## About The Pull Request

I can't do much coding until you review my other PRs so I'm making a
mapping PR instead.
I actually made this a while ago while I was trying out strongDMM. It
turns out: it's a good tool and easy to use.

![2022 12 09-10 51
26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/206686234-ae952ba3-2cb4-4093-80a0-d086fe95a3fc.png)

This mid-tier shuttle isn't enormous and is shaped like a fish. It
dedicates much of its internal space to an artificial fishing
environment, plus fishing equipment storage. Plus look at that lovely
wood panelling!
There's not a lot of seating or a large medbay, but there's five fishing
rods for people to wrestle each other over plus some aquariums to store
your catches in.

It contains a variety of fishing biomes (ocean, moisture trap, hole,
portal) but I couldn't fit "lava" in there even though I wanted to
because it's hardcoded to only have fish in it on the mining z-level.
If you're very lucky and nobody shoves you, the time between the shuttle
docking at the station and arriving at Centcomm might be enough time for
you to catch maybe four entire fish. Wow!

## Why It's Good For The Game

There are plenty of novelty shuttle options but I think this one is good
for a personal touch of "the Captain would rather be fishing than
hearing you complain about the nuclear operatives".

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Tell your crew how much you care by ordering a shuttle where half
of the seats have been removed so that you can get some angling done
before you clock out.

Bug 1805694 - Allow browser_selectpopup_large to partially fail on win7. r=Gijs

I can't repro this at all on win10 with either native or non-native
menus, nor hacking my way so that all win7 styles apply, nor on win7 by
hand on a VM... So that kinda sucks :(

Let's take this very minor regression in this subtest? I don't think
it's particularly worrisome (the select looks good in the mochitest
failure screenshot and works ok in local testing...).

[READY] DRAMATIC SHUTTLES!! You can now fly around the shuttle (#71906)

You can move around shuttles during transport now! Instead of them
teleporting you instantly into deepspace, you can move around somewhat
depending on your space-mobility and grip-strength.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7501474/206866132-3fae024c-a8a2-4f4a-b4b8-37c96a254498.png)

**Please watch the demonstration aswell, it should answer most
questions:**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os77qDOVSXE

Interactions:
- Being within armsreach of a wall or solid object means you 'cling',
where the shuttle pull is very weak and you can basically run around the
shutt;e (but dont fuck up or you're gone)
- Being in range of nothing gives you a very heavy pull, you can barely
resist if you have a decent jetpack
- Objects are instantly power-yeeted
- Being pulled or riding something excempts you from hyperspace pull
- Touching a space tile while being on hyperspace dumps you in
deepspace, you either go back to the shuttle or enjoy deepspace
- On shuttle hyperspace tiles are a lot less dangerous, and will instead
launch and freeze you instead of teleporting you into deepspace
- In-case it wasn't obvious, you can rest outside the shuttle as long as
something is blocking your path. I think it's funny but I might nerf it

:cl:
add: You can now fly around the shuttle during transit! Woohoo! You can
either cling to the side or grab a jetpack and try and keep up with the
shuttle! Carps can move around freely in hyperspace
qol: Increased shuttle hyperspace size from 8 tiles to 16
/:cl:

- [x] Find a way to detect when a shuttle arrives and do something with
the shit left in hyperspace

Things I will do in another PR: 
- Engines spit fire and hurt (almost finished but I want to keep this
small)
- Random shuttle events. You might run into dust meteors or migrating
carps OR A CHANGELING INFILTRATOR
- Hyperspace turfs on the shuttle pull you under the shuttle

### Why it's good for the game
It's so much more immersive than being instantly teleported into
deepspace. It gives you a chance to recover if you get spaced or for
daredevils to look cool

It's also just very cool idk

Adds the Cursed quirk  (#72317)

## About The Pull Request
Adds a silly negative quirk inspired by fallout's bloody mess.

Bad luck interactions for
- Microwaving
- Cigarette coupons
- Russian roulette
- Vending machines
- Ledges
- Slipping

All of which have a chance to kill you, which, by the way, causes you to
**delimb and explode**.

This changes the admin smite as well since it's all the omen component.
Giving permanent omens will mean the player will gib on death, which is
super probable given the insane base damage from bonking your head.
Permanent omen smites are basically dooming someone to die of natural
causes.

implement all keypresses (numbers and operations)

this is ugly as shit but it does work. Included a refactor to make it so
maps are from textcontent -> action rather than button to action.

a future refactor should separate the calculator and the DOM and the
keypressing into separate controllers because this is a bit of a
hilarious mess at the moment.
