[MIRROR] Grilles take 0-1 damage when shocking something, power sinks are available at lower reputation [MDB IGNORE] (#23278)

* Grilles take 0-1 damage when shocking something, power sinks are available at lower reputation (#77860)

## About The Pull Request
Ports BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet#3590. As it is right now, it's
trivial to set up a contraption using a conveyor belt and a shocked
grille to continuously shock monkey bodies. While this is very funny, it
also serves as a ghetto powersink that's hard to locate, easy to
replicate, and lasts effectively forever, since you can just keep
shocking the same bodies over and over again.

This doesn't completely remove the ability to make these, but it makes
them require at least a little maintenance and provides a way for them
to stop working even if the crew isn't able to locate them.

In an attempt to finally get people using the _actual_ powersink,
they'll show up a bit earlier in progression now. I'm not convinced 20
minutes is enough, but I don't want to put them in early enough that it
fucks with Engineering's ability to set things up at round start. We can
turn this down further if need be.

I'm also up for turning the TC requirement down, but 11 feels about
right for what they're supposed to do, so I'd prefer we try this first
and see how that works.

## Why It's Good For The Game
I'm all for goofy weird shit players have found, but there's an issue
with being able to do what an antag item is supposed to do but just
plain better. This shouldn't make creating these impossible or make them
unusable, but it'll require players to actively monitor them if they
want it to run for an extended period.

Additionally, we don't really see powersinks much anymore, and while
that might be more because powernets are kind of buggy and unreliable, I
think making them easier to get will make them show up a little more.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
balance: Grilles will now take 0-1 damage every time they shock
something.
balance: Powersinks are now available earlier in traitor progression.

fix: Improve nvim detection (#1946)

* Improve nvim detection:

Don't rely on the shell specific `exists", instead run `nvim -v`.
Additionally, if there's unexpected output, for example if your shell is
configured wrongly to output something when run in non-interactive mode,
it will tell you so, instead of failing with very strange errors later.

The `neovim-bin` argument has also been changed to always require the
binary to exist, instead if falling back to `nvim` as that's probably
not what the user wants. If `nevoim-bin` contains path separators the
binary will be tried directly, otherwise `which` will be used to find
the correct executable.

The which command has also been changed to always use the which crate
first to avoid shell specific issues (for example nushell).

The output is printed directly to stderr instead of the log, for a more
user friendly experience. Furthermore, the maybe disown call has been
moved so that the user actually has a chance to see the errors in the
console.

* fix(command): correct typos and clarify help message

* fix: preliminarly restore forking behavior

This however also loses possible error messages at startup about the
nvim binary not being found.

* codestyle: calm rustfmt

* fix(command): make error message about missing/errornous nvim visible

Removes COMSIG_AREA_INITIALIZED_IN (#78143)

Literally just me stealing #77207 completely muhahahhahahah screw you
@Mothblocks
I did add some documentation and some radnebula related cleaning and
testing to make it work well

Copied from original PR:

> Please do NOT add code to InitAtom, it is extremely hot. The
conditions on this alone were costing nearly 200ms on my extremely
powerful machine.
> 
> Changes the radioactive nebula to perform its work by looping over
every space tile on init (which on my machine is faster than the time
being wasted on this signal), and adds a subsystem that does this in
SS_BACKGROUND every 30 seconds (usually completeable in about half a
second) for any new atoms, because the effect is hardly noticeable
anyway with how green space is.

Honestly we really don't care that much about stuff being initialized in
space. Everything that walks into space (about everything that matters
to players), is completely unaffected by this change, but roundstart is
now slightly faster

Manually copy trailing attributes on a resize (#12637)

## THE WHITE WHALE

This is a fairly naive fix for this bug. It's not terribly performant,
but neither is resize in the first place.

When the buffer gets resized, typically we only copy the text up to the
`MeasureRight` point, the last printable char in the row. Then we'd just
use the last char's attributes to fill the remainder of the row.

Instead, this PR changes how reflow behaves when it gets to the end of
the row. After we finish copying text, then manually walk through the
attributes at the end of the row, and copy them over. This ensures that
cells that just have a colored space in them get copied into the new
buffer as well, and we don't just blat the last character's attributes
into the rest of the row. We'll do a similar thing once we get to the
last printable char in the buffer, copying the remaining attributes.

This could DEFINITELY be more performant. I think this current
implementation walks the attrs _on every cell_, then appends the new
attrs to the new ATTR_ROW. That could be optimized by just using the
actual iterator. The copy after the last printable char bit is also
especially bad in this regard. That could likely be a blind copy - I
just wanted to get this into the world.

Finally, we now copy the final attributes to the correct buffer: the new
one.  We used to copy them to the _old_ buffer, which we were about to
destroy.

## Validation

I'll add more gifs in the morning, not enough time to finish spinning a
release Terminal build with this tonight.

Closes #32 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Closes #12567

Disable the VT color quirk for pwsh and modern inbox powershell (#13352)

In #6810, we introduced a "quirk" for all known versions of PowerShell
that suppressed their requests for black background/gray foreground.
This was done to avoid an [issue in PSReadline] where it would paint
black bars all over the screen if the default background color wasn't
the same as the ANSI black color.

Years have passed since that quirk was introduced. The underlying bug
was fixed, and the fix was released broadly long ago. It's time for us
to remove the quirk... almost.

Terminal still runs on versions of Windows that ship a broken version of
PSReadline. We must maintain the quirk there -- the user can't do
anything about it, and we would make their experience worse if we
removed the quirk entirely.

PowerShell 7.0 also ships a broken version of PSReadline. It is still in
support for another 6 months, but updates have been available for some
time. We can encourage users to update.

Therefore, we only need the quirk for Windows PowerShell, and then only
for specific versions of Windows.

_Inside Windows_, we don't even need that: we're guaranteed to be built
alongside a fixed version of PowerShell!

Closes #6807

Refactors the `notransform` variable into a trait. (#78146)

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

There were more than a few times (like in cinematic code) where we might
need to accurately know the source of what's adding this trait (or have
multiple sources for the whole 'we don't want this mob to do shit while
we transform this mob'), so in order to rectify this potential issue,
let's refactor it into a trait.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Some code already declared that there might be issues with this being a
boolean var (with no way of knowing _why_ we don't want this mob to not
transform (or not do anything idk). Let's remove those comments and any
future doubt in those instances with the trait macros. Also, stuff like
`TRAIT_IMMOBILIZED` which does a similar thing in many contexts was
already a trait that was regularly added in conjunction with flipping
the variable, so we're able to flatten all that stuff into
`add_traits()` and `remove_traits()` now. nice

I also cleaned up quite a bit of code as I saw it, let me know if it
should be split out but I guarantee that if I didn't do it- no one will
for the next two years.

## Changelog

:cl:
refactor: If you transform into another mob and notice bugs with
interacting with the game world, please create a bug report as this
framework was recently refactored.
/:cl:

Probably fucked up somewhere, lmk

Clearing CTTs while being executed at Texaco Riverdale

— discussions were short lived.
— gatech is in danger. they need to make a mirror with anonymous access!

Here’s what I typed:
## git the mission
we encourage everyone to git it! our mission is about your long, healthy life. stay informed, keep those who desire to harm it in check. 

git nerds: clone our repos and pull often. read those extended commit descriptions! recruit others, show them the ways, this is not just a war, but a revenge of the nerds! #staymeek #takingbackearth 

non-git nerds: github makes it easy. use the [mission23 wiki](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki) it is a great place to start and to learn. we will do everything we can to keep it current. 

## discussions offline!
the government wants to obtain who is viewing the discussions. so we are taking them offline again.

here are the discussions they need to know if you've read, and the broader issues. 

### georgia tech
**all students at georgia tech** are practically targets now because of gigs the cia employed **some students** for. 

remember: there is safety in numbers!

before reporting someone missing make sure you've told all of your friends and family you are about to report someone missing and refer them here (https://github.com/mission23). 

ga tech police: please anonymize all missing persons reports. do not put any name or address of the person making the report. please see the [massacre at mount calvary baptist church](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/wiki/Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) entry. it will shed some light as to why you must anonymize the reports. 

### gift certificates
under no circumstances do you use a gift certificate you've received as payment, unsolicited, or to a place you've never heard of. this is a newly developed cia method to get to people they feel the need to kill. see [connor's steak and seafood](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/Connor’s-Steak-and-Seafood)

### reddit post
a post was made to /r/gatech warning students, but was removed. the sotCmission23 logged in app showed the post active, but a check from an anonymized browser showed it removed.

Adds Blood-drunk and demonic frost miner boss music. (#78123)

Acts as a continuation of PR #77149 for boss music functionality and
implements a BDM and demonic frost miner boss music theme.

More music is good, but I do have some gripes with my own PR. This
particular track relies on instrumentation that when compressed just
doesn't sound as good, and the in-game version is noticeably less
enjoyable that the high quality version. I wish I could help the track
out more, but as is it's already at 811 kb which is barely in line with
file requirements, so i just can't justify bloating the audio file sizes
to make it sound better. You notice this kind of problem a lot with the
higher runtime music and background tracks. It just feels a bit more
clunky than hierophant, but what are you gonna do right?

refactor(map): enhanced implementation, Clean Code™, etc etc

This involves two redesigns of the map.c implementations:

1. Change of macro style and code organization

The old khash.h and map.c implementation used huge #define blocks with a
lot of backslash line continuations.

This instead uses the "implementation file" .c.h pattern. Such a file is
meant to be included multiple times, with different macros set prior to
inclusion as parameters. we already use this pattern e.g. for
eval/typval_encode.c.h to implement different typval encoders reusing a
similar structure.

We can structure this code into two parts. one that only depends on key
type and is enough to implement sets, and one which depends on both key
and value to implement maps (as a wrapper around sets, with an added
value[] array)

2. Separate the main hash buckets from the key / value arrays

Change the hack buckets to only contain an index into separate key /
value arrays
This is a common pattern in modern, state of the art hashmap
implementations. Even though this leads to one more allocated array, it
is this often is a net reduction of memory consumption. Consider
key+value consuming at least 12 bytes per pair. On average, we will have
twice as many buckets per item.
Thus old implementation:

  2*12 = 24 bytes per item

New implementation

  1*12 + 2*4 = 20 bytes per item

And the difference gets bigger with larger items.
One might think we have pulled a fast one here, as wouldn't the average size of
the new key/value arrays be 1.5 slots per items due to amortized grows?
But remember, these arrays are fully dense, and thus the accessed memory,
measured in _cache lines_, the unit which actually matters, will be the
fully used memory but just rounded up to the nearest cache line
boundary.

This has some other interesting properties, such as an insert-only
set/map will be fully ordered by insert only. Preserving this ordering
in face of deletions is more tricky tho. As we currently don't use
ordered maps, the "delete" operation maintains compactness of the item
arrays in the simplest way by breaking the ordering. It would be
possible to implement an order-preserving delete although at some cost,
like allowing the items array to become non-dense until the next rehash.

Finally, in face of these two major changes, all code used in khash.h
has been integrated into map.c and friends. Given the heavy edits it
makes no sense to "layer" the code into a vendored and a wrapper part.
Rather, the layered cake follows the specialization depth: code shared
for all maps, code specialized to a key type (and its equivalence
relation), and finally code specialized to value+key type.

Adds Summon Cheese (#77778)

oh apparently this is my 100th PR on tg, which is weird because github
reports 99 total, and i made at least one to the old voidcrew repo, and
filtering tg prs by my name still shows 99. weird. here's to 100 more i
guess?

<sub>could have been better if it was a get, jhonflupwliiard watch ur
back 🔫 </sub>

## About The Pull Request

Adds a new spell granter book to the Wizard's Den - Summon Cheese, which
grants the spell by the same name, which summons 9 heads of cheese.
That's about it, I think.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Wizards are a hungry bunch, so why can't they just summon food? They can
even share, if they'd like, since the notion of a friendly wizard still
exists

<details>
<summary>... </summary>

alright fine
i'm slightly malding over not getting the 77777 get so no more
roleplaying in the pr body

Wizard Grand Ritual now has a hidden goal of sacrificing 50 cheese
wheels. Sacrificing a cheese wheel is done with invoking the grand rune,
and each invocation/pulse of the rune will whisk away more cheese until
all cheese on the rune is taken by whichever entity lurks in the other
realm. The sacrifice will be hinted at in an _ancient parchment_ which
will be on the bookshelf (when i add it lmao) alongside the spell book.

Meeting this cheese goal will lock the wizard's grand finale rune and
grand finale effect to special ones. The cheese rune is mostly identical
to the normal grand rune, barring the custom sprites/animations.
The cheese finale consists of the wizard getting permanent Levitation
(nogravity + free space movement), a 0.5 modifier(reducing incoming
damage in half) to every damage type, a comically strong mood buff and
**The Wabbajack**(separate sprite pending) - a juiced up chaos staff
which can fire a lot more projectiles than a normal one can (it will get
more, I may even make a few just for it).
Everybody else (including any invader antags) gets hallucinations, 175
brain damage and a comically strong mood debuff, as well as a vendetta
against the wizard. If the victim was already suffering from
hallucinations from a trauma (including the quirk), they are instead
healed.

if you didn't catch the obvious reference, this entire shtick is a
tribute to Sheogorath. the rune makes use of daedric script, and most of
the catchphrases are a direct quotation of the Daedric Prince of
Madness, so if any of those things can get us in trouble somehow, let me
know. i will be sad but i will comply.

This shtick is intended as an easter egg, really, so I wasn't really
planning on expanding the wizard grand finale into heretic paths thing
or whatever.

Oh, and finale grand runes now allow the wizard to select the effect
even if it's time-gated. If it is, you just won't be able to invoke it
until the time comes. The rune will tell you how much time is left until
you can invoke it. And grand finale runes with a finale effect selected
also glow in the color of their effect. I also think I fixed some step
of the grand rune animation not triggering but I'm not sure.

Cursed Slot Machine Fixes (#77989)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

A lot of these were stuff I did in response to reviews but apparently
didn't test extremely thoroughly. My bad.

* The proc for checking if the machine is in use is split out into its
own thing for clarity, and for potential reuse.
* The signal is no longer fucked up so you can actually get more than
one curse out of the slot machine as intended.
* Admin heals (and admin heals only) can remove the status effect. This
is just in case someone fucks up a variable when running an event and
wants to quickly heal some people while they varedit it to actually be a
proper event.
* Some nice code stuff while I was there, we don't need to be
typecasting to human anymore so it's nice to fix that.

pyproject: more (hopefully the last?) porting

Here's the last bits of what I think we should port to pyproject.toml
before releasing.

* I dropped the "Alpha" Classifier, we're beyond alpha, I've been using
  qtile as a daily driver for nearly 15 years
* I dropped the point-release python version Classifiers (i.e. 3.8, 3.9,
  etc.). These are not that interesting and a pain to maintain.
* I dropped Sean Vig as the listed maintainer. We list all the maintainers
  at the bottom of the readme, which ends up in the long_description. No
  reason to maintain two maintainer lists.
* I dropped Aldo as the Author:. There are lots of authors of qtile, this
  info is available from the git log.

My hope is that this will not give a syntax error when uploading source
now during the release workflow. I've inspected the output with:

    python3 setup.py bdist_wheel --keep-temp && cat build/bdist.linux-x86_64/wheel/qtile-*.dist-info/METADATA

and it looks pretty similar to the METADATA from the current release.

M707 "Vulture" Anti-Materiel Rifle (#4253)

# About the pull request

## The M707 is not made player-accessible in this PR.

Adds the M707 "Vulture" anti-materiel rifle to the game. [Design doc
here.](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/files/12433899/M707_Final.pdf)

The M707 is meant to take the place of a heavy support weapon, not
unlike the mortar. It is a 20mm bolt-action rifle, capable of loading
from 4-round magazines. Each round does 400 damage with full AP (50),
but it is not a simple task to fire the weapon. The gun, being as
high-caliber as it is, will immediately break your arm & hand if you do
not fire it without use of the built-in bipod. In addition, its accuracy
is massively reduced below its ideal range (10 tiles), which means the
scope is necessary to be used.

The scope does not function like a regular scope. (see screenshot
section for details) Instead, it shows a 5x5 area (the rest is blacked
out) 12 tiles ahead, with an aiming reticle in the center. The aiming
reticle will drift over time within the 5x5, requiring you to re-adjust
or use the **Hold Breath** ability to temporarily stop the sway. If you
open up the scope's UI, you will be able to modify the scope and the
reticle's location, one tile at a time, very slowly.

To assist with this, the Vulture comes with a spotting scope & tripod. A
secondary user is able to assemble and use the spotting scope. The scope
is a complement to the Vulture's, allowing a communicative team to
become far more effective. The spotter's view, on use, will be locked to
the location of the Vulture scope. However, the spotter's view is not
locked to a 5x5 area, instead getting a view of the full area, on top of
an extra 2 tiles (in each direction) of view range. Finally, both the
spotter and sniper's scopes have night vision equivalent to an SG's
goggles.

The bullet itself is a powerful beast. Powerful enough to pierce walls,
people, and barricades, but with 2 caveats. The first is that every
wall/cade penetration removes 75 damage from the round, and any
cades/tables that the round passes over will be immediately destroyed by
the round. In addition, anyone in a large range will hear the report of
the rifle sound and the direction it came from.

Update as of 8/31:
Vulture and its spotter scope now require a pamphlet to use (a pamphlet
gives the trait needed to use both), guncase spawns with 2.

# Explain why it's good for the game

It's a unique weapon that encourages communication inside a team, while
simultaneously not contributing to the IFF ungaball. The weapon promotes
thoughtful gameplay and repositioning to be able to hit a target without
friendlies getting in the way or getting overrun.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

    core: Refactor Pixel features

    * Magic Eraser is wonky and hard to
      enable and all this mess isn't really worth
      the trouble so just stick to the older setup.

    * Default Pixel 5 spoof for Photos and only switch
      to Pixel XL when spoof is toggled.

    * We will try to bypass 2021 features and Raven
      props for non-Pixel 2021 devices as apps usage
      requires TPU.

    * Remove P21 experience system feature check

more misc fixes/enhancements, including lightsaber form training and spiritual rapiers ignoring passives

issue #307 - AT_WISP/AT_SHDW effect on passive attacks got lost. todo: #style for this. ill probably do that not at 3am
issue #1145 - Adjust how god-given minions are chosen. basically - averages depth & player level, factors in bard/healer status + bm skill for odds, and makes them loyal. odds went effectively up to 1/12 for bards/healers at xp15 w exp beast mastery, or 1/8 with max luck too.
issue #1296 - Allow training of lightsaber forms without requisite weapon skill to use them. now you are no longer blocked from viewing/enhancing those skills unless wielding a saber, or capped at your saber skill. this improves parity with 2wep skill and also the odd thing where you can be a lightsaber GOD and be shown as awful if you're not wielding one at that minute.
issue #2117 - Longbow of Diana weighs 1 aum. artifact weights now bypass the 0 aum -> 1 aum thing, and ONLY artifact weights.
issue #2138 - Laser beams cut trees into stones. turns out IS_STONE is for nopass things just rocks, but everything else should be rock. exempted trees and gave them a separate entry. fuck i should have made dead trees stone staves. well. see u in a minute git rebase.
issue #2143 - Monsters can't recharge offhand or extra-hand weapons. holy copypaste chris lmao, anyway changed now to do that. ok, so this sounds bad - it was segfaulting occasionally when testing, but after recompiling with no changes and throwing it in and out of gdb a bunch it stopped doing that. i dont know why it was complaining if (otmp) { <do shit with otmp> } was doing shit with a zero otmp but man what the fuck. anyway it works fine i tested but hey. oh yeah this works for anything in their inventory but prefers wep -> swapwep -> anything else in no particular order, but ONLY works on the weapons they could previously charge - aka vibros, blasters, lightsabers.

Update README.md

A Detective Story – “The Last Job”

This is a story about a detective sent out to investigate an old crime scene in an old haunted 
house on the hill. He arrives and faces a series of spooky challenges in the different rooms 
of the house. Solving or not solving a puzzle could mean life or death for him. 
The whole experience of this investigation changes the detective forever. So will this be his 
‘last job’ because he has found lots of treasure or because he is not alive to do another job?

To run the game type py LASTJOBFinal.py 

Project Management Review 

Overall I felt the project went well and I learnt a lot about collaborative working as well as coding in Python. 
We worked together as a team of three and shared our ideas for the game quickly and effectively. We 
talked about the design and levels of the game and allocated individual games rooms to different members 
for coding. Then we tested our game modules and user tested the game, made improvements, and 
created a new version that was again tested and any bugs and glitches were fed back to the team and 
fixed.

Stand-up’s are very helpful, focussed and powerful. Of course, on zoom they are ‘sit-downs’ but the focus 
is still the same. They helped us summarise our individual and collective progress with the project, share 
ideas, allocate tasks, and invite feedback and questions. We also used Slack and Trello to communicate 
when not on a zoom call. 

Kanban Planning was great for managing the workflow of the project, task allocation and updates. It acts 
like a glorified to-do list for a project broken down into individual tasks. There were allocated to a team 
member. They then did the task and updated the Kanban board on Trello. This was easy to manage and 
feedback to the team. 

Efficiency of the Team as a whole

The team worked well as a whole, we all communicated well, and each member played to their strengths. We 
had very few issues with time management and any issues were resolved quickly by the team.

How management of the project could be improved
I watched a youtube video on ‘Kanban’ and thought it could be used for breaking down individual tasks before 
doing the tasks and charting the progress.

Some of the work was done out of hours by members of the team. There were no scheduled meetings out of 
hours. Instead we used Slack to share our code and comments. An out-of-hours zoom meeting on a couple of 
occasions would have been a good idea.

Frontend v. Backend

Frontend development with HTML and CSS would allow us to market and promote our game 
online to the world. It would also allow us to add graphics, music, and visual interaction to 
enrichen the game. The player would have a more immersive experience and it would be 
available to play 24/7 by a massive global audience. 

Dedicating more time to the front-end development means learning and applying HTML, 
CSS, Javascript and other tools. Each has a learning curve and the more technologies that 
are used the more complex development and testing becomes. There would be less time to 
develop the game in Python meaning less gameplay, less time for testing, and potentially 
more bugs.

My Review of ‘Last Job’

‘Last Job’ is the last case the detective will solve. There is an art and a science to creating a 
game using just the Python terminal, no graphics, and no sound. Instead we used ASCII art to 
visualise the scenes and good old-fashioned storytelling to illustrate the adventure with words 
and puzzles for the player to solve. 

I feel the project has gone well overall and we are ahead on testing. I managed the project, 
leading daily stand-up meetings, the Trello board, and I wrote the game code for the ghost 
room and I improved the code for the skeleton room. We communicated regularly via zoom, 
Slack and Trello. 

Most of the code was done and tested early. I also added extra features to the code for the 
skeleton and ghost rooms to make them more playable and challenging. I tested my code and 
the whole game code and found coding in Python enjoyable and immersive.

Game Testing - How Did It Go?

How our game was tested?

The game was tested when a version was ready and uploaded to Slack. Each option or 
outcome was tested for errors and the game was played from the users perspective. Testing 
was re-done each time there were code changes. 

Was testing effective?

Testing was effective. It highlighted issues with the game play and some team members 
found errors in the code that were not found by the person writing the code. Testing makes 
the game an enjoyable experience to play without bugs.

The Team

Tim Stokes
Project manager, coder, and tester

David Lynch
Senior coder, tester, and wireframe creator

Marian Krchlik
Coder, tester, and ASCII art designer

gpg-interface: set trust level of missing key to "undefined"

In check_signature(), we initialize the trust_level field to "-1", with
the idea that if gpg does not return a trust level at all (if there is
no signature, or if the signature is made by an unknown key), we'll
use that value. But this has two problems:

  1. Since the field is an enum, it's up to the compiler to decide what
     underlying storage to use, and it only has to fit the values we've
     declared. So we may not be able to store "-1" at all. And indeed,
     on my system (linux with gcc), the resulting enum is an unsigned
     32-bit value, and -1 becomes 4294967295.

     The difference may seem academic (and you even get "-1" if you pass
     it to printf("%d")), but it means that code like this:

       status |= sigc->trust_level < configured_min_trust_level;

     does not necessarily behave as expected. This turns out not to be a
     bug in practice, though, because we keep the "-1" only when gpg did
     not report a signature from a known key, in which case the line
     above:

       status |= sigc->result != 'G';

     would always set status to non-zero anyway. So only a 'G' signature
     with no parsed trust level would cause a problem, which doesn't
     seem likely to trigger (outside of unexpected gpg behavior).

  2. When using the "%GT" format placeholder, we pass the value to
     gpg_trust_level_to_str(), which complains that the value is out of
     range with a BUG(). This behavior was introduced by 803978da49
     (gpg-interface: add function for converting trust level to string,
     2022-07-11). Before that, we just did a switch() on the enum, and
     anything that wasn't matched would end up as the empty string.

     Curiously, solving this by naively doing:

       if (level < 0)
               return "";

     in that function isn't sufficient. Because of (1) above, the
     compiler can (and does in my case) actually remove that conditional
     as dead code!

We can solve both by representing this state as an enum value. We could
do this by adding a new "unknown" value. But this really seems to match
the existing "undefined" level well. GPG describes this as "Not enough
information for calculation".

We have tests in t7510 that trigger this case (verifying a signature
from a key that we don't have, and then checking various %G
placeholders), but they didn't notice the BUG() because we didn't look
at %GT for that case! Let's make sure we check all %G placeholders for
each case in the formatting tests.

The interesting ones here are "show unknown signature with custom
format" and "show lack of signature with custom format", both of which
would BUG() before, and now turn %GT into "undefined". Prior to
803978da49 they would have turned it into the empty string, but I think
saying "undefined" consistently is a reasonable outcome, and probably
makes life easier for anyone parsing the output (and any such parser had
to be ready to see "undefined" already).

The other modified tests produce the same output before and after this
patch, but now we're consistently checking both %G? and %GT in all of
them.

Update_Appearance Port (#2170)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
[(original pr)](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/55468)
After nine years in development we hope it was worth the wait

I ported this specifically for the signals I'll need for world icons.
However, it had a lot of other useful stuff, so I ended up just grabbing
(almost) the entire pr.
I tried to grab as few of the superfluous code rewrites as possible to
make reviewing a bit easier, but I couldn't help grab stuff like the APC
icon code rewrite(the original code was a war crime).

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

- ports the wrapper proc `update_appearance` for icons, descs, and
names, adds `update_desc` and `update_name` subprocs to handle those.
Things. without just stuffing them into update_icons like some kind of
psychopath

- ports a bunch of signal hooks useful for changing names, descriptions,
and icons. I needed these for world_icons which is where this wild ride
all started

- ports some `base_icon_state` implementation. Stuff like spear code
makes slightly less duplicates(and more sense) now which is nice.
We could definitely implement it more I think but that's a future me
problem

- 500 files of immersive vsc-mass-editing action to implement
`update_appearance()`(sorry in advance, but not as sorry as I was when
manually copy-pasting the custom ones for like 3 straight days)

-"consig" and "comisg" have been taken out behind the codebase and shot.
Not 'technically' a bug it just made my head hurt

-My first pr with 0 player facing changes (confetti)
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl: TemporalOroboros, Memed Hams
code: ports update_appearance, update_name, and update_desc from tg, as
well as associated signals
code: a bit of base_icon_state implementation. Can you believe it's been
sitting in our code almost unused for like 3 years
code: cleans up some code formatting, mainly around custom icons and
overlays
code: fixes the typos in COMSIG_STORAGE_EXITED and
COMSIG_STORAGE_ENTERED
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

NVIM 0.9.2

This is a maintenance release, focused on bug fixes and improvements.
However, There are included features related to TUI and :terminal.

BRAM

Nvim is a fork of the Vim editor, created and developed by Bram Moolenaar.
On August 3, 2023, he passed away at the age of 62. If Vim or Nvim have
been of use to you in your life, read `:help Bram` and `:help Uganda`
and consider honoring his memory in a way you see fit.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.1

BREAKING CHANGES

An adjustment was made to the `grid_line` event as part of the exernal
UI protocol the `cells` array might now end with a `[' ', attr, 0]` item
with a repeat count of zero. This is needed by the TUI to disambiguate
final spaces on a line from just clearing the line, which will make a
difference when copying text using the terminal emulators builtin
primary selection support.

External UI:s can safely ignore such an empty item and most UIs already
handle this fine. But it could break some UI:s which has an assert to
validate the cell count to be bigger than zero, or similar checks.

FEATURES

- tui: Support Super and Meta modifiers
- terminal: forward more special keys and modifier-mouse combinations

BUG FIXES

- lua: Always set arg0 to lua scripts
- api: Redundant error when using `nvim_cmd`
- api, lua: Make blank lines in a message work properly
- column: fix bugs related to signs in 'statuscol'
- completion: Don't add backslash in runtime completion
- diff: Filler lines for hunks bigger than linematch limit
- edit: Fix K_EVENT interfering with 'digraph'
- editorconfig: Better validation and error handling
- events: Don't expand non-file as file name
- events: Trigger VimResume on next UI request
- extmarks: Wrong display when changing text with virt_lines
- folds: Update folds in Insert mode with fdm=indent
- helptags: Make multibyte help tags work properly
- highlight: Make CurSearch work properly with 'winhl'
- inccommand: Fix saving of undo info
- keycodes: Recognize <t_xx> as a key
- lsp: Do not assume client capability exists in watchfiles check (#24558)
- mouse: Handle folded lines with virt_lines attached to line above
- remote: Make --remote-expr print to stdout
- remote: Restore previous --remote-expr output formatting

allow `--login` to be used with nu's `--commands` parameter (#10253)

# Description

This PR allows the `--login`/`-l` parameter to be used with nushell's
`--commands`/`-c` parameter. When you do this, since you're invoking it
with the `-l` flag, nushell will load your env.nu, config.nu, and
login.nu, in that order. Then it will proceed to run your commands. I
think this provides a better quality of life when you want to run
scripts with your personal config files as a login shell.

Indexing features for modules (#347)

* Indexing features for modules

This commit introduces indexing for module references. It currently
will only work for files to which we have the source code, turns them
into AST and then applies one or more "extractors" on it. An extractor
runs over AST and indetifies things it's looking for, and then emits
entries, which will be used to build a searchable index.

Currently, there is one extractor implemented: Module references. This
does a fairly exhaustive search for module references, wherever
they're hiding. It then uses the aliases module to find the original
source module.

Note that most of the higher level functions are just placeholders. An
indexing strategy needs to find things inside of .exs files as well as
.ex files, and we currently have no way to index core elixir (this
will be highly dependent on how elixir was installed and if we can get
the source code to the version we're running on).

* Performance fixes / code improvements

Turns out `Aliases.at()` was super slow --especially since we called
it so much when resolving aliases during indexing. This was due to it
having to re-parse the document multiple times for each alias
reference. Moving to sourceror and allowing the AST to be sent in cut
the indexing time for lexical and all its deps from 60 seconds to 10.


* ETS based storage / Fuzzy matching

This commit has ETS based file storage and a fuzzy matching system.
I was having a lot of trouble coming up with an efficient way to perform
fuzzy matching against a corpous of subjects efficiently using the data
stores. ETS is... ets, and it appears that it's impossible to use it for
any type of detailed string matching. SQLite had similar problems. While
it had a lot more complicated and helpful utilities, it just couldn't do
what I wanted when it comes to fuzziness.

Then I thought, hey, why not just store the subjects in memory with all
the places that they appear? Then you just keep that up to date, and you
remove a lot of duplication, which improves performance a lot.

Prior to this, ETS was taking around 300ms to do simple-ish matching,
and SQLite was taking around 180ms. Fuzzy can do it in 14ms. Better yet,
building a fuzzy from scratch only takes 40ms for lexical and all its
deps. This includes doing much more interesting matching.

I think we have a winner.

Mention how long each course day is (#1155)

Most classes run with 2.5 hours for the morning session and 2.5 hours
for the afternoon session.

I have tried running the course as 2 × 2.5 hours and 2 × 3 hours. My
experience was that people ended up getting really worn out after
spending 6 hours in total on Rust (7 hours including a lunch break).
However, the experience varies from group to group, so this is just a
recommendation.

Add friendlier syntax and remove parameter order

Currently parameters must be specified in a specific order and
the root command can be long to type.

This makes it troublesome of the users to remember the order of parameters
as well as the full word of the command.

We now allow for parameters to be specified in any order while still
having proper input validation for existence and typing of it.
Commands are also given shortened forms as shortcut (e.g. delete: rm).

This way we allow for greater flexibility and make the CLI more intuitive to
the user.

Improved PDA Direct Messenger (#75820)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #76708, Closes #76729 (sorry Zephyr)

This PR expands the Direct Messenger UI, adding a chat screen for each
available messenger that you can find, and moving message sending over
to TGUI.

This chat screen includes a message log that displays messages sent by
you as well as messages received from the recipient. This gets rid of
the previous chat log, which just had all messages thrown together that
you received or have sent, in one big list.

Furthermore, all messaging is now done inside the UI. This kills all
TGUI popups you would ever need to send messages forever (except for
quick replies). Use the input bar on the bottom, press Enter or the Send
button, and it sends your message. Spam mode is now done in the UI too,
via a text field you can find in the contacts list.

Additionally, because I have a habit of blowing things massively out of
scope, I've also completely refactored how messages and chat logs are
stored in the PDA messenger. I plan on using this in a PR that merges
the chat client with the messenger, sometime in the future. Sorry this
took so long.

Stuff left to do before I open this PR for review:
- [x] Add "recent messages"
- [x] Add "unread messages"
- [x] Add message drafts
- [x] Make photo sending not shit
- [x] Implement the edge cases for automated and rigged messages
- [x] Make sure shit isn't fucked
- [x] Profit

## Why It's Good For The Game

The UI has largely stayed the same since modular tablets were added a
year ago. Even better, direct messaging has been the same since PDAs
were first added *more than a decade ago*. Imagine that.

Now we finally actually (!) make use of those brand new features that we
got from the TGUI switch in this regard.
## Changelog
:cl: distributivgesetz
add: Updated Direct Messenger to v6.5.3. Now including brand new
individual chat rooms, proper image attachments and a revolutionary
message input field!
add: Added a "Reset Imprint" option to the PDA painter.
refactor: Refactored PDA imprinting code just a bit.
fix: PDAs should now properly respond to rigged messages.

Fixes runtime relating to hard TGS reboots (PROBABLY WON'T FIX REBOOT CRASHES) (#77309)

## About The Pull Request

Servers are crashing on every round restart and I have absolutely no
idea where to start, but I noticed this so I figure I'll throw up a PR
to fix it.

This is the runtime (only found in dd.log, sorry non-admin/maintainer
gamers
https://[tgstation13.org/raw-logs/sybil/data/logs/2023/08/01/round-211577/dd.log](https://tgstation13.org/raw-logs/sybil/data/logs/2023/08/01/round-211577/dd.log)
)

```txt
[00:07:07] Runtime in code/modules/logging/log_holder.dm,166: Attempted to call shutdown_logging twice!
  proc name: shutdown logging (/datum/log_holder/proc/shutdown_logging)
  src: /datum/log_holder (/datum/log_holder)
  call stack:
  /datum/log_holder (/datum/log_holder): shutdown logging()
  shutdown logging()
  world: Reboot(0, 0)
  Ticker (/datum/controller/subsystem/ticker): Reboot("Round ended.", "proper completion", 600)
```

This is the full log:


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/af938235-3076-41d5-98b2-02907dedb6d5)

This is the code:


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/371b11cb-3bc9-4a99-a17c-73968ded308d)

For some reason, even though we invoke `TGSEndProcess`, we still
continue on in this `if()` chain. I don't know why we keep executing DM
code after TGS is supposed to be shut down (which may be why no one has
ever included a `return` here, but let's be safe instead of sorry.

If you really want to investigate why TGS is running DM code after we
end the process, I am amenable to including a stack trace or crash of
this phenomenon instead.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Since we aren't invoking `LOG_CLOSE_ALL` to rust-g twice (which seems to
be really unwanted per the code I read), hopefully thing no crash?
Rust-g had two breaking changes (one with logs, and one with SQL), so
I'm presuming that this might be related to the log one (which is why we
didn't see this sorta thing happen pre-#77307)... Worst case scenario
less runtimes in the funny runtime log.

I hope this wasn't loadbearing either... Likely requires testmerging
since TGS and I don't get along on my machine.
## Changelog
:cl:
server: Added a preventative measure to prevent calling both
TGSHardRestart and TGSReboot, as well as potentially invoking sensitive
procs that are only meant to be called once.
/:cl:

TL;DR- I do not definitively know why servers are crashing but I noticed
this runtime so I'll put out this open flame while I have the time to do
so.

<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## Oh No More Robots
There is actually less paths for the hivebots. They are actually some of
the most primitive mobs on the codebase. So it was high time they were
given a facelift. As I said with my previous mob update robots are a
good alternative as mobs compared to humanoids, and with the hivebots we
can present a threat of hostile machine intelligence to round out the
existing threats of pirates, mercs, aliens beasts and the supernatural.
Once more these robots are also far mroe generalist then the existing
robot varieties and as most types of them are not very dangerous they
can be released on civilian crew without fear of them causing extreme
damage,

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,

:cl:
add: A couple new varieties of both melee and ranged hivebots
removed: redundant hivebot varieties
tweak: siegebots now have sniper range fitting their name, their attack
has been nerfed (holy fuck the one shoot explode on contact grenades
with a base attack of 10... that's 1 frag grenade a second!!!)

# Description
Hi. Basically, this is a continuation of the work that @fdncred started.
Given some nice discussions on #9463 , and [merged uutils
PR](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/pull/5152) from @tertsdiepraam
we have decided to give the `cp` command the `crawl` stage as it was
named.

> [!NOTE] 
Given that the `uutils` crate has not made the release for the merged
PR, just make sure you checkout latest and put it in the required place
to make this PR work.

The aim of this PR is for is to see how to move forward using `uutils`
crate. In order to getting this started, I have made the current
`nushell cp tests` pass along with some extra ones I copied over from
the `uutils` repo.

With all of that being said, things that would be nice to decide, and
keep working on:

Crawl:
- Handling of certain `named` flags, with their long and short
forms(e.g. --update, --reflink, --preserve, etc), and using default
values. Maybe `-u` can already have a `default_missing_value`.
- Should we maybe just support one single option `switch` flags (see
`--backup` in code) as a contrast to the other named args.
- Complete test coverage from `uutils`. They had > 100 tests, and I
could only port like 12 as they are a bit time consuming given they
cannot be straight up copy pasted. Maybe we do not need all >100, but
maybe the more relevant to what we want.
- Refactor this code

Walk:
- Non fatal errors on `copy` from `utils`. Currently it just sends it to
stdout but errors have no span
- Better integration 

An added possibility is the addition of `SyntaxShape::OneOf()` for
`Named` arguments which was briefly mentioned in the discord server, but
that is still to be decided. This could greatly improve some of the
integration. This would enable something like `cp --preserve [all
timestamp]` or `cp --preserve all` to both work.

I did not want to keep holding on this, and wait till I was happy with
the code because I think its nice if everyone can start up and suggest
refactors, but the main important part now was getting it out the door,
as if I take my sweet time this will take way longer :stuck_out_tongue:

I still hate my life.

still doesn't work properly but it doesn't also apply to non-player entities now, making it slightly less broken.

levels: more minor fixes. (#1040)

* levels: fix e1m2 tutti frutti around exit door.

Also took the liberty of fixing a longtime pet peeve I had about the really bright grey-white of the exit room steps clashing with the rest of the room for no apparent reason. (It looks less bad with Korp's new greys but we're not adding those yet...)

* levels: fix floating candle on map22.

It's fine until you actually use the secret, at which point it snaps to the top of the lowering platform.

* levels: more minor fixes.

Mostly for objects "floating" with a tiny bit of their hitbox rounded to be overlapping a higher adjacent floor.

E1M8
Inside the pillars containing the painlords there are two that spawn gore (and a dead player) in lieu of painlords only on easy. These have now been edited so that in each pillar the gore appears whenever the painlord does not. (The player has also been changed to a gore actor.)

Map03
Floaties by the first door switch.

Map23
Central room with the barrels and combat slugs has several gore decorations that do not appear on hard, but do not block movement nor represent any living monsters that might appear there in hard. Flagged to appear in all skill levels (and also not be flagged ambush).

Map25
1-pixel vertical misalignment on line 44.

Map28
Floaty medikit(s?) near (-955,-435), moved away from the double teleport pad.
Fixed the textures on that door now that the SLOPPY textures have been updated
Moved stuff around the starting skull switch so you start with a screen full of skull again.

Map29
Floaty shellbox 444.

* levels: more minor fixes.

Mostly to address #1043.

Map09
- Moved the crates in front of the eastern teleport door to keep the player from potentially falling into the gap between the big crate and the main crate rack and softlocking. The small step-crates are now also properly aligned with the flat they use.

Map14
- The entire lower floor of the big octagon room has been lowered to -56 from -48. This restores access to the alcove in front of the minigun secret, and also better aligns with the textures of several surrounding walls.
- Merged the sectors of the yellow key cage teleporter pad so the lights would sync.

Map15
- A room will lower two teleporters when you step in and two worms will warp in through those teleporters in hard, one in medium, none in easy. It looks bugged where the worms don't appear and absolutely nothing shows up, so pickups are revealed instead when they don't.

Map18
- Added one more step crate to let the player directly access the necromancer soul sphere (and the health bonus tucked away in the corner) without retracing their route back to the upper ledge.

Map25
- Got rid of that starting elevator once and for all. The only purpose in forcing that starting gunshot was to make that first room marginally more awful to pistol-start. Moved the shotgun and shells to the "outside" platforms to make up for it.
- Widened the side windows facing the yellow key so the trilobites have room to move.
- Shrunk down the exit line to make it completely impossible to trigger it while the painlord/necromancer standing there is alive.
- Added more monster blockers to the RL warp-in ambush closet, as the worms would still sometimes warp in both on the same side. I've also made the destination sectors larger as that simplifies the underlying geometry a bit.
- Flagged everything in the deathmatch arena multi-only.
- Thing 445 (last monster before SSG in hard mode) is now a pain lord instead of an octaminator.

* levels: more minor fixes.

Map13
Exit teleport pad lines now block monsters.

Map18
End soulsphere secret is now tagged as secret.

Map19
The straferun armour trench setup could not possibly work without having the worms below block your movement sometimes. The trench is now fenced off and the platform accessible by bridge; the pinkies are now spectres outside of easy and hard gives you two more of them; they can only harm you by teleporting.

* levels: readjust map28 skull.

The vertical offset would no longer be needed after #1047; however the tiling is a bit off if we need to offset this horizontally due to the additional trim, so a new linedef was added.

* levels: map26 minor fixes.

The secret blue lift switch error message would indicate it's a "door" which despite being correct from an engine point of view doesn't reflect its actual function.

The red armour secret is now player-shoot only, and the wall breach effect is instant.

* levels: fix high jump platform texture alignment.

More plants, new chems, new carpet generation techniques, plantcell buff, and the drills now have a GPS signal! (#5912)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

![image](https://github.com/Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13-RP/assets/58029438/4d3a51f1-7d2b-4d56-9971-7f33d76610f1)

New! Exciting! Things! YEEHAW!

Okay, hype aside, this adds two plants from Main -- the third, and most
powerful sister of the ambrosia family, and the better grass, carpet!

Ambrosia Gaia: A difficult plant to keep alive, being very vulnerable to
weeds, pests, and any amount of toxins in the tray, as well as voracious
when it comes to nutrients and water. In exchange, the plant produces a
very, very powerful healing agent: Earthsblood.

For the cost of your brain, your ability to gauge how injured you are,
and when it works again, the ability to see clearly, your body will be
repaired in miraculous ways! (4/4 Brute Burn, 4 tox, 10 oxy, 2 clone).
The current damage is set to 1 brain damage, which means you'd need to
use a fair amount to die -- but not treating it will debilitate you.
Overdoses at over 15u.
In the future, it will also be a usable plant chem -- but let's not
worry about that until after I scream at the entirety of botany.

Carpet: Grass mutation, pull it free, get free carpet tile. OR! Mix with
the items in the image to create New! and Exciting! colors. Mix 2 parts
liquefied carpet, with 1 part plasticide, and you too can redecorate
like the best of them*

*some colors still have to be bought from cargo.
*someone help me make it a sprayable so we don't need solidification
please....

This also buffs a certain aspect of xenobotany -- plant cells.
For reasons only known to god.. and I think he left baycode a long time
ago, plant cells could only ever reach a maximum rating of 2000. As a
large cell. So you can't stuff it in a gun. This is dogshit --
especially for the challenge of reaching 200 potency on a plant, a feat
that is nearly impossible. The math has been buffed, so if you even
manage to get to 100, you at least have a Rating 20000 cell, something
you can run a department off of if straits are dire.

The final, and more QoL thing than straight buff or new thing: GPS
Drills
Drills now have a GPS signal. Never lose a pesky drill again!*
*you did remember your GPS device, yeah?

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Give a xenobotanist something worth working to in normal gameplay, and
they'll endeavour to do so while waiting for the fun plants to come back
to station. Don't, and watch them just kinda wilt waist deep in glow
berries, gold apples, and ice chilis. Also, it's easier than you think
to lose a giant drill when you've stepped away from the planet for a
long while. only to come back later. Putting GPSes in them just means
you can continue the work again.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
add: Two new plants, Ambrosia Gaia, and Carpet
add: New chems! Earthsblood, trading the mind for the body, and Carpet
and it's many mixtures, capable of being solidified later!
qol: Mining Drills now have an integral GPS. It took strength of a
million men to not make the tag DRILLD0 as a terrible joke.
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
