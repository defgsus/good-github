[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Nanotrasen Budget Programme - Mothball Edition [BIRDSHOT STATION] (#5555)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/73502
-----
## About The Pull Request
--- 

The Space Tram is currently spaced. This is a known issue with not the
map, but Trams in general. The Space Tram is a Space Tram to encourage a
fix. Until then, the Space Tram is a maint tram that's an actual hazard
but cannot directly kill anyone, including lizards. Enjoy the commodity
as you zip from secmaint to medmaint.
-------------------------------------------------------

I... really don't know if I should be proud of myself here. This whole
process has been akin to a fever dream and it has only been little over
a month since I first created the .dmm for this. What started as a
simple yet humble reimagining of Birdboat has turned into an entirely
new station, and blown past Metastation sized proportions. This has been
my most expansive project yet, and somehow it's also been my quickest.
So without further ado, I unveil Birdshot - Successor to Birdoat.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Due to recent cost expenditures on Icemoon projects, and a growing
need for orbital research stations, Nanotrasen has decided to pull
Birdboat Station out of mothball after nearly 5 years of abandonment.**

Since then, the station has seen a variety of changes at the hands of
the various vagabond lawless scum and villains that have decided to make
the abandoned station their home. Do not fret though, a Nanotrasen
Operation has secured the companies rightful property for corporate use
once again, though you'll need to be the stewards of the remaining
cleanup operation.

------------------------------------------------------

Now, as you might have guessed by now, Birdshot is heavily based on
Birdboat station. Many of the decisions here follow the original layout,
and what had to be modified or moved still tries its best to replicate
and imitate what bird being said. At least, that was the idea initially.
This has very much grown into its own beast and as such, while the main
inspiration has been Birdboat, there are a lot of new ideas thrown into
the mix that really give this station its own unique and deserving
identity. Maybe it's not perfect, but I've been inspired by MMMiracles
own performance with Tramstation to keep working on Birdshot and
updating it with better and improved faculties. For now, though the
station is in a playable state, and that means I'm making a PR. If I had
to borrow the words of the good MMM, I would call this **Birdshot:
Season 0**


![BirdSHOTFULL2-26-S](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33048583/221432760-27af1889-d2d0-4861-9435-df4258525fae.png)



See the image in more detail here: https://imgur.com/iT5Vi8k



## Why It's Good For The Game

We've been with the same 5 maps for a while now. san7890 jokingly said
that I could sacrifice Metastation back in November if I remade Birdboat
but modern. Obviously that wasn't going to happen, yet I was spurred on
by the idea. When I began this in earnest early this January, EOBGames
said that a Birdboat sized map would replace Kilostation in the
rotation. Interestingly we're not a small map anymore so I honestly have
no clue where this goes. Maybe that ephemeral 6th map slot that's been
rumored.

What I can say, is that Birdshot is wholly unlike anything else that is
currently in rotation. It's got an engineering section that feels way
too small for a station of that size, almost evocative of Cere. Cargo is
blessed with a Boutique that makes use of Fikou's new mannequin dolls.
Command is outfitted with a Corporate Guest Suite, and Officials sent
from Nanotrasen can embark from their ferry into the safety of their own
Corporate Dock. Elements of Cerestation are present, yet not in a way
that makes traversal annoying. Furthermore we have **2 Trams** (that I
have yet to get functional but we'll get there) on Birdshot, that's
right 2. One Security Prison Tram, and then other, a Space Tram. Both
Novel in their own ways. Departments on Birdshot twist and turn, and
there's an abundance of Maintenance Tunnels to cut through everything,
for the brave and the bold that is. And there's plenty left to discover,
but I'd rather let Birdshot speak for itself. I'm proud of this one.

If you want something new, this is something that is almost the complete
opposite of Chilled Station - Explicitly Designed to send you back to
the metal death trap that is: **Space Station 13.**


## Changelog
:cl:
add: Birdshot station has been pulled out of Mothball.
add: New station areas and places to visit. A Mix of Kilo and Delta
maints with winding shortcutting paths.
add: A host of new shuttles to support this bold endeavor to reclaim
something that really shouldn't be reclaimed.
add: Two Trams, Two Trams.
add: For the last time Bob, the gaping hole is a **feature.** Use the
breach shutters or have the virologist make starlight.
add: A smiling salute to stations past...
add: Secrets.

[Needs TM] The Accelerataning (#1781)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Gone are the days of spam clicking buttons to move faster in a
direction, with this PR, ships now accelerate constantly (as long as you
have fuel and don't touch the throttle) in a direction you set, leading
to a much smoother flight experience. I imagine it's going to be a bit
tougher to thread gaps, but flying a spaceship *is* quite literally
rocket science. So.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29362068/220281305-12f6b796-9d8a-41ce-84a6-236bb03274da.gif)

Also actually makes the minimum and maximum speed work, and adjusts them
to a more tolerable level.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Eliminates the ability to cheese high speeds by spamming the accelerate
button, and also makes the flight experience much more pleasant as you
don't have to spam click to move a decent speed.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: A new system for ship flight, where you only point a direction and
set the throttle to change your speed, reducing the need for
spam-clicking.
fix: There's now a maximum and minimum speed, 600spm and 0.01spm,
respectively. The limits have been broken all this time.
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put

http: support CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR

The CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS (and matching CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS) flag was
deprecated in curl 7.85.0, and using it generate compiler warnings as of
curl 7.87.0. The path forward is to use CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR, but we
can't just do so unilaterally, as it was only introduced less than a
year ago in 7.85.0.

Until that version becomes ubiquitous, we have to either disable the
deprecation warning or conditionally use the "STR" variant on newer
versions of libcurl. This patch switches to the new variant, which is
nice for two reasons:

  - we don't have to worry that silencing curl's deprecation warnings
    might cause us to miss other more useful ones

  - we'd eventually want to move to the new variant anyway, so this gets
    us set up (albeit with some extra ugly boilerplate for the
    conditional)

There are a lot of ways to split up the two cases. One way would be to
abstract the storage type (strbuf versus a long), how to append
(strbuf_addstr vs bitwise OR), how to initialize, which CURLOPT to use,
and so on. But the resulting code looks pretty magical:

  GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE allowed = GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE_INIT;
  if (...http is allowed...)
	GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_APPEND(&allowed, "http", CURLOPT_HTTP);

and you end up with more "#define GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE" macros than
actual code.

On the other end of the spectrum, we could just implement two separate
functions, one that handles a string list and one that handles bits. But
then we end up repeating our list of protocols (http, https, ftp, ftp).

This patch takes the middle ground. The run-time code is always there to
handle both types, and we just choose which one to feed to curl.

Final Pull on this PR

There of course will need to be further balancing in the future, but I have handled this PR to the absolute best of my ability, and as I have little to no experience with BM within GTNH as a whole, I have no true ability to balance the passive LP cost by myself, as such I think we should let this out as it is, and balance as we get responses out in the wild.

Log Active Turfs To Mapping Log (#74267)

## About The Pull Request

Was reminded of doing this via
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/74245#issuecomment-1483943979

They're mapping issues, so let's log them to the mapping log. Quite
shrimple honestly.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/227805458-5e6bcf01-629d-4b81-ab6a-b26e63d41ca3.png)
## Why It's Good For The Game

As the comments expound, the reason why we probably haven't done this in
the past is because any number of things can cause active turfs (like
ruin placement (either in icebox or in space)), or other silly stuff
like that. Thus, finding stuff like this would only really be viable
with stuff like the View Active Turfs verb, where you could visually
jump to and see all of the active turfs in that dynamic configuration
(and this still remains the best way to find active turfs).

This PR just makes it easier to do a "post-mortem" analysis on potential
active turfs, so that if it's very blatant, it can be fixed a lot
easier. It's best to try and find them during an ongoing round, but this
is life. (same as the unit tests concession, not too enthused on that
but we would have spontaneous errors out the ass without _something_)
## Changelog
Nothing that concerns players.

Optimizes some gas_mixture procs, Optimizes pipeline processing significantly by 33% (#74233)

## About The Pull Request
It is faster to operate on a gas list, especially if cached, then it is
to operate on a datum.
Doing this cause I'm seeing cost in merge() post #74230

Hits on a few other important places too. self_breakdown and such. Worth
it IMO

Could in theory go further by caching the global list. I'm tempted I
admit but it needs profiling first and it's late

EDIT: I have not slept, and have gone tooo far

The ADD_GAS sidestep saves us 0.1 seconds of init (used to at least.
Ensuring we don't break archive is gonna have a cost. I don't want to
profile this so I'll estimate maybe 0.05 seconds). The faster version of
copy_from is just well, better, and helps to avoid stupid

I haven't slept in 36 hours. Have some atmos optimizations

Pipelines now keep track of components that require custom
reconciliation as a seperate list.
This avoids the overhead of filtering all connected atmos machinery.

Rather then relying on |= to avoid duplicate gas_mixtures, we instead
use a cycle var stored on the mix itself, which is compared with a
static unique id from reconcile_air()
This fully prevents double processing of gas, and should (hopefully)
prevent stupid dupe issues in future

Rather then summing volume on the gas mixture itself, we sum it in a
local var.
This avoids datum var accesses, and saves a slight bit of time

Instead of running THERMAL_ENERGY() (and thus heat_capacity(), which
iterates all gases in the mix AGAIN) when processing gas, we instead
just hook into the existing heat capacity calculation done inside the
giver gases loop
This saves a significant amount of time, somewhere around 30% of the
proc, I think?

This doesn't tackle the big headache here, which is the copy_from loop
at the base of the proc.

I think the solution is to convert pipelines to a sort of polling model.
Atmos components don't "own" their mix, they instead have to request a
copy of it from the pipeline datum.
This would work based off a mutually agreed upon volume amount for that
component in that process cycle.

We'd use an archived system to figure out what gases to give to
components, while removing from the real MOLES list.

We could then push gas consumption requests to the pipeline, which would
handle them, alongside volume changes, on the next process.

Not sure how I'd handle connected pipelines... Merging post reconcile
maybe?
This is a problem for tomorrow though, I need to go to bed.

Saves about 30% of pipeline costs.
Profiles taken on kilo, until each reconcile_air hits 5000 calls

Erismed4 patches

- Lowers overdose of Party Drops and Menace
- improves upon certain wound fixing methods
- Surgical "tape" is gone, why would we need that when we always had bone gel for doing the exact same procedure a year ago
- Hyperzine renamed to Chronos. No longer a drug, considered a stim now, effects largely remain the same with no emote spam, but it will consume the user's sanity the more it's on them, causing halucinations and sanity loss. Overdose causes mental breakdown, hallucinations, jitteriness, nerve damage and fatal brain damage.
- Various stim recipes tweaked
- Medical stack items costs shuffled around
- Bone grafting to bone fixing
- Detox given Purger chem quality for treatment on toxin accumulation wounds
- Fixes overdose of Baton and Claw energy drinks to damage their respective organs instead of just the heart
- Combat chem injector has basic combat chems now instead of just hyperzine and free food/meds
- Organ fabricator no longer spills biomatter on the floor when deconstructed, handled as a proper lathe with no bullshit since Biomatter is no longer a "church" material

Postfactor with comments explaining what I did + Set up stable coding environment
As mentioned in the email to the Professor and TA, on 4/28/2023 I coded about 35% of feature 2 on Brian's apre linux laptop on my branch thinking I was signed into my git account. This is because my Windows computer is currently broken with WSL (path variables are destroyed and deleting/re-installing is not working). So Brian let me used his spare linux laptop and later that night we realized after he went home that it pushed under his account.

Fast foward to today, this morning I tried getting my commits in properly by copy/pasting the commits done in his account on the Windows computer, but this proved rather difficult as again, the project can't run on there. I made those commits around 3pm. That's when I decided to go to Best Buy to buy a MacBook with intents to return it after.

This leads to this specific commit. After purchasing the MacBook, re-buying Brad's Umedy course videos to re-learn how to set up from scratch, and getting a lot of help from my team mates this time as all of them have Macs and knew how to troubleshoot compared to when I was using my Windows computer, I was finally able to re set up the project just now. In this commit, I made comments explaining the 35% of feature 2 I coded on 4/28/2023 just so the GitHub can show my name and a proper git commit with working code.

Thank you in particular for your understanding and for Brian helping me the most when it came to setting up the mac book.

EMPs on robotic limbs will now disable them for 4-8 seconds rather than causing a 10-20 second full stun (#74570)

## About The Pull Request

EMPs on robotic limbs will now disable them for 10-20 seconds rather
than causing a 10-20 second full stun on the user. Additionally, they
will damage the limb for a little brute and some burn.

Arm EMPs don't do anything special as the limb being disabled already
drops items.

Leg EMPs cause a 10-20 second knockdown, only really applicable if
there's only one robotic leg as two disabled legs KD you anyways.

Chest EMPs cause a 3-6 second standing-up paralyze, visible to the
player by a quite noticeable shaking of their body.

Head EMPs break the optical transponder circuits for 7.5-15 seconds,
effectively giving the user nightmare goggles vision with green instead
of red as the only remaining color.

Tacit approval for the PR at least existing.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Robotic limbs are not so strong that a glancing EMP that may not even
have been directed at you should stun you for ten, TEN seconds, or
worse, twenty. This is basically legacy stunning from the days of
super-stuns on soap, stunbatons, etc. The code for it was last touched
six years ago.

**_The stats as shown above are not even close to final. I really don't
know or care what the right stats should be in the end. and I'm fine
with making them a 10-20 second timer again. I just put some
reasonable-seeming numbers in as a placeholder. EMPs could also still
cause a short stun if that is deemed necessary. Hell, that could be the
chest effect!_**

balance: Head EMPs break the optical transponder circuits for 7.5-15
seconds, effectively giving the user nightmare goggles vision with green
instead of red as the only remaining color.

[MDB Ignore] Manifest Destiny - The Final Tile Flattening (#74169)

Alt Title: The End Of The 12 Month War
## About The Pull Request

### Hey! Listen! This PR _will_ cause a merge conflict with your PR!
Please ensure that you have the knowledge on how to handle merge
conflicts, found here:
https://hackmd.io/@tgstation/ry4-gbKH5#Assured-Merge-Conflict-Resolution

Supercedes #74023 entirely.

Port of the tooling introduced in
https://github.com/BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet/pull/7970 (we already
had everything else), modified to meet /tg/'s requisites and culling
anything that was not entirely relevant (that I could see). It's not the
end of the world if I missed something tbh. Some aspects were commented
out since they may be relevant to downstreams who port this PR or to
enable (what I see to be) un-necessary warnings.

This is a culmination of a year's efforts, starting with _Red Rover,
Four Corners_ (#65290) and later _Opposing Corners_ (#65455). If you
don't understand why this PR exists or why it's necessary, I recommend
reading both of those.

Since then, several mappers (both in their own mapping as well as
tailored PRs) have worked on "flattening" out these tile turfs, however
I've continually wanted a function that would mass automate it (outlined
here https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=31872 - This
functionality might still be useful if added to UpdatePaths or another
type of script thereof, but I no longer have reason to keep the bounty
up).

It's finally here! Yippie! A new python file, courtesy of itsmeow at
BeeStation. Very awesome. As previously mentioned, a lot of alterations
had to be made for our mapping desires, but the results are quite
agreeable. There's a few assertions that this file makes that I had to
address:

* We have "colorless" tile decals. These are transparent, so they don't
do anything. By default, bee would make these "white tiles", but we have
no such thing. I decided to just add a maplint and an UpdatePaths to
guard against this silliness (only Delta and Tram) had it.
* For some reason, it labels already-converted decals with the default
direction as an error state. I might touch this up in the coming hours,
but for now I surpressed the error due to how many false warnings it was
spitting out.

There's a few ways this tool can be improved, but I lack the knowledge
on how to do so:
* Make it so that we can run the map merger to fix the keys of the map
in the `update_map` function, rather than run the fixer-upper python
file. We can live without this to be honest. It's actually slightly good
because it forces you to look at all of the MapMerge Warnings, and you
can ascertain any potential errors without it silently passing you by
and hitting the repository (or at least those that we haven't linted for
yet).
* Be able to pass in any regex to "flatten" anything. That's way out of
scope for what I want to do here though.

## How do you use this tool?

I made a readme.
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/363852cb17fa46dad8fd20e261f8f665f3e008bb/tools/MapTileAggregator/readme.md
### Mapping March
oh hey it's pretty neat that this PR came out in mapping march, what a
nice qol for mappers as the month enters the home stretch. ckey is
san7890

## Why It's Good For The Game

slimmer DMM files, better mapping practices. cool new tool. so nice.
## Changelog
Nothing that really affects players, but a short summary for all those
reading this PR:

* All "corner" turf decals are flattened, and there's now a tool that we
store that you can re-run to keep stuff flat in case you like mapping
one way and want to fix it at the end.
* We (should) now lint against useless uncolored turf decals since that
was completely garbo as far as our codebase is concerned.
* UpdatePaths for fixing up uncolored turf decals, yippie!


If you want to review this PR, may I suggest the file filter. You don't
need to look at any of the DMM files I already did:

Fix a start now error and add the ability of queuing the start of the game (#3090)

This PR does two things.

Fixes this error when trying to start early

![dreamseeker_lIUnkd0lFZ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24533979/232609965-5cf94825-0671-420b-8625-16f505f26d63.png)


And adds queuing meaning that if an admin wants to start a game early
during loading; it will now tell them that the game will launch as soon
as it is available then waits for the game to be ready before starting.

Before this PR it just tells you that the game isn't ready then you have
to wait for it to load and launch the "start now" command again.

Does not bypass the "are you sure?" check because it has been moved to
the front.

Honestly made this PR because I hate waiting for the start I just want
to do it once when I see the game window then step away for like a
minute instead of having to wait for it.


:cl: Hopek
add: Adds the support for queuing the round start meaning that if an
admin pressed "start now" it will actually wait until the game is loaded
then immediately start the game as expected versus telling you to try
later.
fix: fixed the "start now" verb displaying that the game has already
started when it is loading because it didn't understand how to read the
game state properly.

This repository showcases my machine learning project on building a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity. The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of key features such as cast, title, overview, tagline, and more.

By leveraging both popularity and content-based filtering techniques, this recommendation system offers personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. Cosine similarity is employed to measure the similarity between movies, considering their feature vectors.

The popularity aspect takes into account the overall popularity of movies, while the content-based approach analyzes the textual information associated with each movie, including cast, title, overview, and tagline. This combination ensures that recommendations are not only based on general popularity but also tailored to the user's interests.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the step-by-step implementation of the recommendation system. The code samples provide clear explanations and demonstrate how to preprocess the dataset, calculate cosine similarity, and generate personalized movie recommendations.

Comprehensive documentation accompanies the project, outlining the methodology, dataset details, and evaluation metrics. The repository also provides instructions on how to replicate the project on your local machine.

Join me on this exciting journey into the world of movie recommendation systems, where we combine popularity and content to deliver personalized movie suggestions. Clone this repository, follow the notebooks, and start exploring the fascinating realm of movie recommendations.

Let's make movie-watching experiences even more enjoyable with intelligent recommendations. Happy coding and may your movie recommendations be a hit!

[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

Nanotrasen Budget Programme - Mothball Edition [BIRDSHOT STATION] (#73502)

## About The Pull Request
--- 

The Space Tram is currently spaced. This is a known issue with not the
map, but Trams in general. The Space Tram is a Space Tram to encourage a
fix. Until then, the Space Tram is a maint tram that's an actual hazard
but cannot directly kill anyone, including lizards. Enjoy the commodity
as you zip from secmaint to medmaint.
-------------------------------------------------------

I... really don't know if I should be proud of myself here. This whole
process has been akin to a fever dream and it has only been little over
a month since I first created the .dmm for this. What started as a
simple yet humble reimagining of Birdboat has turned into an entirely
new station, and blown past Metastation sized proportions. This has been
my most expansive project yet, and somehow it's also been my quickest.
So without further ado, I unveil Birdshot - Successor to Birdoat.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Due to recent cost expenditures on Icemoon projects, and a growing
need for orbital research stations, Nanotrasen has decided to pull
Birdboat Station out of mothball after nearly 5 years of abandonment.**

Since then, the station has seen a variety of changes at the hands of
the various vagabond lawless scum and villains that have decided to make
the abandoned station their home. Do not fret though, a Nanotrasen
Operation has secured the companies rightful property for corporate use
once again, though you'll need to be the stewards of the remaining
cleanup operation.

------------------------------------------------------

Now, as you might have guessed by now, Birdshot is heavily based on
Birdboat station. Many of the decisions here follow the original layout,
and what had to be modified or moved still tries its best to replicate
and imitate what bird being said. At least, that was the idea initially.
This has very much grown into its own beast and as such, while the main
inspiration has been Birdboat, there are a lot of new ideas thrown into
the mix that really give this station its own unique and deserving
identity. Maybe it's not perfect, but I've been inspired by @MMMiracles
own performance with Tramstation to keep working on Birdshot and
updating it with better and improved faculties. For now, though the
station is in a playable state, and that means I'm making a PR. If I had
to borrow the words of the good MMM, I would call this **Birdshot:
Season 0**


![BirdSHOTFULL2-26-S](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33048583/221432760-27af1889-d2d0-4861-9435-df4258525fae.png)



See the image in more detail here: https://imgur.com/iT5Vi8k



## Why It's Good For The Game

We've been with the same 5 maps for a while now. @san7890 jokingly said
that I could sacrifice Metastation back in November if I remade Birdboat
but modern. Obviously that wasn't going to happen, yet I was spurred on
by the idea. When I began this in earnest early this January, @EOBGames
said that a Birdboat sized map would replace Kilostation in the
rotation. Interestingly we're not a small map anymore so I honestly have
no clue where this goes. Maybe that ephemeral 6th map slot that's been
rumored.

What I can say, is that Birdshot is wholly unlike anything else that is
currently in rotation. It's got an engineering section that feels way
too small for a station of that size, almost evocative of Cere. Cargo is
blessed with a Boutique that makes use of @Fikou's new mannequin dolls.
Command is outfitted with a Corporate Guest Suite, and Officials sent
from Nanotrasen can embark from their ferry into the safety of their own
Corporate Dock. Elements of Cerestation are present, yet not in a way
that makes traversal annoying. Furthermore we have **2 Trams** (that I
have yet to get functional but we'll get there) on Birdshot, that's
right 2. One Security Prison Tram, and then other, a Space Tram. Both
Novel in their own ways. Departments on Birdshot twist and turn, and
there's an abundance of Maintenance Tunnels to cut through everything,
for the brave and the bold that is. And there's plenty left to discover,
but I'd rather let Birdshot speak for itself. I'm proud of this one.

If you want something new, this is something that is almost the complete
opposite of Chilled Station - Explicitly Designed to send you back to
the metal death trap that is: **Space Station 13.**


## Changelog
:cl:
add: Birdshot station has been pulled out of Mothball.
add: New station areas and places to visit. A Mix of Kilo and Delta
maints with winding shortcutting paths.
add: A host of new shuttles to support this bold endeavor to reclaim
something that really shouldn't be reclaimed.
add: Two Trams, Two Trams.
add: For the last time Bob, the gaping hole is a **feature.** Use the
breach shutters or have the virologist make starlight.
add: A smiling salute to stations past...
add: Secrets.

move copypastas from hotstringer to notes

The values that should be in the hotstringer are those that I type in
very often, to a point where it's useful to have a shortcuts to get that
text
I don't often use long ass texts and relying on the correct key
combination + remembering the key for it is unreasonable.
The whole reason why I have a choose function is because I forget
everything all the time, so the keys in my hotstringer should only be
those that I'll learn to use enough for them to be unforgettable
The next time I'll need to use the gnu linux copypasta is god knows
when, and at that point I'll forget that I called it "gnu linux", so
searching for it is a brilliant idea, will even save me time in a
(somewhat) important moment

optimization, documentation, code flexibility

the main change is how the Max_speed and co's variables work. A new one was added (Jump_height), and the hardcoded speed changes have been made into a routine. I sighted a tutorial as credit, but in truth I wrote most of this myself, mainly using it as a reference for the lea instruction because I forgot how pc relatives work (funny considering calcsine depends on it haha...), though it's the same idea and it's what I was thinking of when making it, so, I'd say it counts.
Jump_height was added to make different jumping heights easier to implement (I'm considering making Sonic_Jump more of a Player_Jump if you will), and because the new routine uses bit shift multiplication meaning it was limited to x8 per variant of speed, so it makes sense to use that extra space.
Thinking of merging extra variables like this into Object RAM, into objects like Tails' tails. That could overall save RAM, but seems a little hard to work with, especially for legacy labels
Also optimized some CalcSine uses, and added .angd1, which assumes angle is already in d1 with the high byte cleared. That saves like 4 cycles, only do it if you're being stupid in the middle of the night
It is completely possible I broke something somewhere. Tails in particular had some tragic things happen due to some find and replace errors

Fixes Active Turf Scenario on Tramstation (#74354)

## About The Pull Request

On the tin. Basically whenever `atmoscilower_2.dmm` would invoked
`atmoscilower_attachment_a_2.dmm`, it would trigger an active turf in
this location since it doesn't have a "ceiling". (as well as there being
an "aired" turf mingling with airless turfs)

This caused the following report:
```txt
 - All that follows is a turf with an active air difference at roundstart. To clear this, make sure that all of the turfs listed below are connected to a turf with the same air contents.
 - In an ideal world, this list should have enough information to help you locate the active turf(s) in question. Unfortunately, this might not be an ideal world.
 - If the round is still ongoing, you can use the "Mapping -> Show roundstart AT list" verb to see exactly what active turfs were detected. Otherwise, good luck.
 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (163,80,2) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Lesser Starboard Maintenance (163,81,2) (/area/station/maintenance/starboard/lesser). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.
 - Active turf: Station Asteroid (164,80,2) (/area/station/asteroid). Turf type: /turf/open/floor/plating/airless. Relevant Z-Trait(s): Station.

This is what it looked like when it was reproduced on my machine:

Surprisingly not that hard to debug, albeit tedious. At least I know
that this was the issue with 100% confidence.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Ate up 0.1 seconds of init on my machine. That's silly.

The great color rework (#711)

* The great color rework

This commit reworks (and fully migrates) the color system to an approach
more compatible with Blizzards' color structure.

A new Color prototype has been added which is *mostly* API-compatible
with the default ColorMixin provided by Blizzard, plus some extension
methods inherited from the Ellyb color system.

One difference is that we now treat colors as immutable globally - they
provide no methods that directly mutate fields on the structure. This
is to replace the old and broken concept of a "Frozen" color. Callees
cannot know whether or not a color is frozen, so if they were to mutate
it they'd need to always defensively make a copy anyway.

Some other Color methods have been removed; the individual "GetRed"
style methods are gone - you can just read the structure normally.

To reduce memory churn when processing colors we now also cache them
by a unique key formed from the hexadecimal representation of the
color. This also gives a slight performance boost as a cache hit for
an existing color ends up being faster than the trip to the allocator
to make a new one from scratch.

All constant colors have been moved - without changes - to a new
table ('TRP3_API.Colors'). Some additional tables are also present
to group colors by type - eg. item quality colors.

Finally the contrast adjustment system has been reworked to make use
of the APCA-W3 algorithm for lightness contrast and screen luminance.

In turn, the old setting for contrast adjustment is no longer a boolean
but instead a tiered system that allows selecting a level of contrast to
apply - the default being "Low" rather than the old default of "Off".

Healer Balance Changes (#2896)

# About the pull request
This pull request addresses the boring and low-risk gameplay of the
Healer drone, who spends half the round sitting next to recovery nodes
and recovering her health so she may use it again, rinse and repeat
until a rine notices said drone has purple on it and booms her.

First, by changing her health from 600 to 500, Healer can spend more
time healing her sisters than sitting through another 100 health to heal
herself. Though this makes her less tanky than before, healing classes
are not known to be tanks. To ensure Healer can still heal five times
without depleting too much of her health whilst still giving her sisters
a decent amount of heals, I made her ability cost 75 health instead of
100, and also made her ability cost 200 plasma. Since Healer replenishes
plasma much more quickly than her health, she can still put herself into
crit if she heals too frequently. Due to this buff, her heals had a
slight nerf, being 10 damage a second for ten seconds instead of 12
damage per second for ten seconds for a total of 20 less damage healed
per application overall.

In addition to these changes, I'm giving Healer a better plasma transfer
for when she has nobody else to heal/nowhere else to weed and she has an
opportunity to assist her sisters. While a normal drone transfers 50
plasma with a delay of 20, Healer transfers 100 with a delay of 15,
which is nowhere near Hivelord's gargantuan 200 plasma with a delay of
5, but it still is better than a normal drone.

Finally, to give the huggers and larva some love, Healer will
specifically heal little ones 1.5 health per second for 10 seconds for
15 of her own health and 30 plasma.

# Explain why it's good for the game
Healer drone isn't fun. You run around and heal a bunch of T3s, then sit
out for half the battle trying to heal that massive 600 heath while you
wonder why you take so long to heal even though you have Strong
pheromones. You cry to mom for help, but she doesn't have time to heal a
drone who can't build walls and has no need to weed at the moment. You
think, 'screw it, I'm going to make a recovery node and camp here until
I heal', but by the time you finish healing, several T3s and a silly
rouny just suicided into a wall of talls and destroyed your recovery
node, so you run off and make another one. But oh, someone noticed you
have purple on your carapace and decide your location is precisely where
a shell should land, right as you're building one.

No more. These changes allow Healer to move around at her leisure and
makes Healer more engaging by allowing her to be a more front-line
participant and actively run around and heal her sisters without having
to incur such a harsh penalty.

Let this be a testmerge, please.

Wintercoats can now be zipped and unzipped through alt-click and separates the hood sprites from the jacket sprites (#74886)

## About The Pull Request
The title says it all, really.

~~Initially, I was only going to do it for all wintercoats, but then I
figured I might as well bring it down to all of `/hooded`, just so other
suits could benefit from it, since that behavior came from there anyway.
Does that mean that it does nothing for some of them? Yes, it does. Does
that justify having another variable to tell whether or not that should
be possible? In my humble opinion, not really, but I'm not against it if
it's requested.~~

~~That functionality was intentionally removed from the Void Cloak, as
there would be balance implications (since bringing up the hood makes
the whole cloak invisible, which you could skirt by just "zipping" it,
which also makes it invisible.~~

~~The sprites were already there, so this change was very simple to do.
Simply unties the zipped up look from the fact that the hood is up.
However, toggling the hood forces the zipping/unzipping, just so there's
no balance implications involved. It's just simpler that way.~~

So, I ended up going back and changing the sprites so that the hoods
would no longer be baked into the jacket's sprites, so that they could
be done as overlays instead, which ended up solving my problem with
hoods not being there on zipped-up versions.

For now, it's been made on winter coats only, but it shouldn't be that
difficult to bring it back down to the `/hooded` level. I just didn't
want to bother touching up the sprites down there, as it already took me
like 2-3 hours touching up the sprites of the winter coats alone.

I also took the decision to make it so EVA winter coats used the regular
winter coat's sprites, because they had special ones that just looked
like worse versions of the original, without anything special going on
for them. It was just a straight downgrade compared to the base sprite,
in my opinion.

There's still issues with the custom winter coat, in that the hood isn't
made into an overlay for it yet (and that'll require an extra bit of
logic to make it work, too), but it was already an issue before, the
hood is always present on the current version of the custom winter coat.

There's still a handful (sadly, most) of the winter coats that don't
properly reflect on their obj sprites when they're opened versus when
they're closed, but that's due to an initial spriter oversight, and not
to my doing. The open versions were just left as closed on many of them,
and I simply don't have the patience nor the appropriate skills to edit
that many coats that way.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Now you can be stylish with or without the hoodie!

According to ChatGPT, with one small tweak (thanks Opera GX for the
suggestion):

> Zipped and unzipped through alt-click, winter coats can now be. Hmm,
stylishly warm, you shall be. Feel like a Spaceman, you will. Use the

Tcomms Soundloop Comes From One Source And Is Less Awful (#74908)

## About The Pull Request

The ``soundloop/server`` now only comes from the server hub, so it
doesn't have stacking audio sources. The sound has been made more
uniform when up close, but is overall quieter. Additionally, all the
files have been run through a low pass filter to remove the highest of
it's pitches.
## Why It's Good For The Game

I'm sick of not wanting to be around telecomms because of how bad every
single machine sounds. Now, things are significantly easier on the ear,
quieter, more uniform, and better for everyone's sanity. I asked the
maintainers in the coding channel if I could just remove it and they
said no.

I can't get a video recording, I've tried with win+G, OBS, and sharex
and it's just fucked.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: telecomms is quieter and less ear-damaging.
sound: modified tcomms sound to remove high-tones.
fix: the telecomms sound only comes from the server hub machine.

Turns Deer into Basic Mob - They Freeze At The Sight of Vehicles (#74784)

## About The Pull Request

deers only show up in the BEPIS but i decided that they would be easy
enough to turn into a basic mob (they were). it was so easy in fact that
i decided to dip my toes into coding AI behavior, and made them freeze
up whenever they see a vehicle. this required a lot of code in a bunch
of places that i was quite unfamiliar with before starting this project,
so do let me know if i glonked up anywhere and i can work on smoothing
it out.
## Why It's Good For The Game

one less simple animal on the list. deers staring at headlights is
pretty cool i think, neato interaction for when you do get them beyond
the joke the bepis makes

i'm also amenable to dropping the whole "deer in headlights" code if you
don't like that for w/e reason- just wanted to make them basic at the
very least
## Changelog
:cl:
add: If you ever happen upon a wild deer, try not to ride your fancy
vehicles too close to it as it'll freeze up like a... you know where I'm
going with this.

cql3: remove expr::token

Let's remove expr::token and replace all of its functionality with expr::function_call.

expr::token is a struct whose job is to represent a partition key token.
The idea is that when the user types in `token(p1, p2) < 1234`,
this will be internally represented as an expression which uses
expr::token to represent the `token(p1, p2)` part.

The situation with expr::token is a bit complicated.
On one hand side it's supposed to represent the partition token,
but sometimes it's also assumed that it can represent a generic
call to the token() function, for example `token(1, 2, 3)` could
be a function_call, but it could also be expr::token.

The query planning code assumes that each occurence of expr::token
represents the partition token without checking the arguments.
Because of this allowing `token(1, 2, 3)` to be represented
as expr::token is dangerous - the query planning
might think that it is `token(p1, p2, p3)` and plan the query
based on this, which would be wrong.

Currently expr::token is created only in one specific case.
When the parser detects that the user typed in a restriction
which has a call to `token` on the LHS it generates expr::token.
In all other cases it generates an `expr::function_call`.
Even when the `function_call` represents a valid partition token,
it stays a `function_call`. During preparation there is no check
to see if a `function_call` to `token` could be turned into `expr::token`.
This is a bit inconsistent - sometimes `token(p1, p2, p3)` is represented
as `expr::token` and the query planner handles that, but sometimes it might
be represented as `function_call`, which the query planner doesn't handle.

There is also a problem because there's a lot of duplication
between a `function_call` and `expr::token`. All of the evaluation
and preparation is the same for `expr::token` as it's for a `function_call`
to the token function. Currently it's impossible to evaluate `expr::token`
and preparation has some flaws, but implementing it would basically
consist of copy-pasting the corresponding code from token `function_call`.

One more aspect is multi-table queries. With `expr::token` we turn
a call to the `token()` function into a struct that is schema-specific.
What happens when a single expression is used to make queries to multiple
tables? The schema is different, so something that is representad
as `expr::token` for one schema would be represented as `function_call`
in the context of a different schema.
Translating expressions to different tables would require careful
manipulation to convert `expr::token` to `function_call` and vice versa.
This could cause trouble for index queries.

Overall I think it would be best to remove expr::token.

Although having a clear marker for the partition token
is sometimes nice for query planning, in my opinion
the pros are outweighted by the cons.
I'm a big fan of having a single way to represent things,
having two separate representations of the same thing
without clear boundaries between them causes trouble.

Instead of having expr::token and function_call we can
just have the function_call and check if it represents
a partition token when needed.

Converts Spiderlings from Structures to Basic Mobs (#75001)

If I could've made this more atomic, I would have in a heartbeat, trust
me.

## About The Pull Request

Hey there. People were mocking us for having spiderlings still be a
subtype of `/obj/structure`. I decided to take a lot of time to fix
that. A lot of behavior it was implementing was just pseudo-mob stuff,
so it was actually easier than it looked for the raw conversion. A lot
of the footwork on spider stuff in the basic framework was already done
previously by Jacquerel, so that was pretty nice.

However, there are two new things that weren't introduced in the code
that had to be put in.

A) A component to handle growth and differentiation into a mob. This may
have already existed, no clue. If it does (and it's NOT
evolutionary_leap), let me know.
B) AI Behavior to handle seeking out a vent, entering a vent, and then
exiting out of a different vent. I may have gone a bit wacky on the
code, but it certainly works as expected (spiderling goes in one vent,
exits the other). Let me know if you can think of a way it can be better
optimized, but it was deliberately written to be very failsafey in case
shit goes yonkers.

One fundamental difference between structure spiderlings and basic mob
spiderlings (beyond the AI and not just a random prob() check for
movement) is the fact that they had vent movement coded in... but we
_really_ don't need stuff like that for our intents and purposes. If the
range turns out to be too OP in the current framework, we can always
change it up a bit, but also there's a _lot_ of vents we can end up in
the station (my testing had one spiderling end up in the AI sat to get
obliterated).
## Why It's Good For The Game

Spiderlings aren't structures! They behave like a mob should! Players
can possess spiderlings! They work seamlessly with differentiating into
a giant spider! Better AI! More room for people to add into this very
under-utilized buggers!
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Spiderlings are now basic mobs, report any complete
weirdness/deviation from known behavior. They should be a lot more
intelligent now though.
add: AI Spiderlings are super fragile, but they're also super fast,
especially when they get into a vent. Once they're in circulation, they
could end up everywhere! Maybe in the armory, maybe in a locked closet
in maintenance. Be sure to be vigilant and splat them whenever you can
to save the station from a whole lotta heartache!

gpg-interface: set trust level of missing key to "undefined"

In check_signature(), we initialize the trust_level field to "-1", with
the idea that if gpg does not return a trust level at all (if there is
no signature, or if the signature is made by an unknown key), we'll
use that value. But this has two problems:

  1. Since the field is an enum, it's up to the compiler to decide what
     underlying storage to use, and it only has to fit the values we've
     declared. So we may not be able to store "-1" at all. And indeed,
     on my system (linux with gcc), the resulting enum is an unsigned
     32-bit value, and -1 becomes 4294967295.

     The difference may seem academic (and you even get "-1" if you pass
     it to printf("%d")), but it means that code like this:

       status |= sigc->trust_level < configured_min_trust_level;

     does not necessarily behave as expected. This turns out not to be a
     bug in practice, though, because we keep the "-1" only when gpg did
     not report a signature from a known key, in which case the line
     above:

       status |= sigc->result != 'G';

     would always set status to non-zero anyway. So only a 'G' signature
     with no parsed trust level would cause a problem, which doesn't
     seem likely to trigger (outside of unexpected gpg behavior).

  2. When using the "%GT" format placeholder, we pass the value to
     gpg_trust_level_to_str(), which complains that the value is out of
     range with a BUG(). This behavior was introduced by 803978da49
     (gpg-interface: add function for converting trust level to string,
     2022-07-11). Before that, we just did a switch() on the enum, and
     anything that wasn't matched would end up as the empty string.

     Curiously, solving this by naively doing:

       if (level < 0)
               return "";

     in that function isn't sufficient. Because of (1) above, the
     compiler can (and does in my case) actually remove that conditional
     as dead code!

We can solve both by representing this state as an enum value. We could
do this by adding a new "unknown" value. But this really seems to match
the existing "undefined" level well. GPG describes this as "Not enough
information for calculation".

We have tests in t7510 that trigger this case (verifying a signature
from a key that we don't have, and then checking various %G
placeholders), but they didn't notice the BUG() because we didn't look
at %GT for that case! Let's make sure we check all %G placeholders for
each case in the formatting tests.

The interesting ones here are "show unknown signature with custom
format" and "show lack of signature with custom format", both of which
would BUG() before, and now turn %GT into "undefined". Prior to
803978da49 they would have turned it into the empty string, but I think
saying "undefined" consistently is a reasonable outcome, and probably
makes life easier for anyone parsing the output (and any such parser had
to be ready to see "undefined" already).

The other modified tests produce the same output before and after this
patch, but now we're consistently checking both %G? and %GT in all of
them.

Distribute all back-ends with the emacsql package

There are two reasons for this.

- Going forward, packages that use `emacsql' and SQLite should use
  the best back-end that can be used with the Emacs instance in use,
  either `emacsql-sqlite-builtin`, `emacsql-sqlite-module`, or as a
  last resort `emacsql-sqlite'.

  That means that if we didn't bundle the back-end libraries with
  `emacsql' itself, these packages would have to depend on all three
  back-end packages in addition to `emacsql' itself.  (Alternatively
  they could not depend on any of the back-end packages, and instead
  make the user install the appropriate back-end, when they try to
  use the package.  That's a bad user experience and there likely
  would be bugs, making it even more painful.)

- EmacSQL is now distributed on NonGNU Elpa as well.  While we at
  Melpa encourages the creation of separate packages for optional
  extensions (which are not useful to all users, or which have
  additional dependencies) the Emacs maintainers prefer everything to
  be distribute as one package, even if that means that `defvar' and
  `declare-function' declarations are necessary to keep the compiler
  happy.

  I still think our way is usually better, but since three of the
  back-end libraries have to be distributed with the main package
  anyway, we might as well give in here and bundle the other three
  as well.

For the time being, we have to continue to *also* distribute the
back-end libraries as separate packages.

Several third-party packages depend on the existing `emacsql' and
`emacsql-sqlite' packages.  These packages should be updated to only
depend on `emacsql', but the latest released versions of these
packages will continue to depend on `emacsql-sqlite' as well.  If we
removed the recipe for that, that would remove the latest release of
that package from Melpa, not just the snapshot version.

This is the current roadmap:

0. Include all back-ends in `emacsql'.
1. Update dependant packages to only depend on `emacsql'.
2. Make changes to `emacsql', which are enabled by the former two
   steps, and which are blocking the creation of a new `emacsql'
   release.  (These changes are related to the addition of the
   additional SQLite back-ends.  So this is a bit of a chicken and
   egg problem, and this commit (0) is the first step to break out
   of that.)
3. Create an `emacsql' release.
4. Wait for new releases of all dependant packages.
5. Change the separate back-end packages to warn the user, asking
   them to remove all of these packages.
6. After waiting some more, remove the separate back-end packages.

While a back-end is installed as part of `emacsql' and as a separate
package, it is undefined which version is loaded, but until step (5)
the two versions should be the same, so it doesn't matter.

Hologram Touchup (Init savings edition) (#74793)

## About The Pull Request

### Polishes and Reworks Holograms

Hologram generation currently involves a bunch of icon operations, which
are slow.
Not to mention a series of get flats for the human models, which is even
worse.

We lose 0.05 seconds of init to em off just the 2 RCD holograms. it
hurts man.

So instead, let's use filters and render steps to achive the same
effect.

While I'm here I'll dim the holo light and make it blue, make the
hologram and its beam emissive (so they glow), and do some fenangling
with move_hologram() (it doesn't clear the hologram off failure anymore,
instead relying on callers to do that) to ensure holocalls can't be
accidentially ended by moving out of the area.

Ah and I added RESET_ALPHA to the emissive appearance flags, cause the
alpha does override and fuck with color rendering, which ends up looking
dumb. If we're gonna support this stuff it should be first class not
accidential.

### Makes Static Not Shit

While I'm here (since holograms see static) lets ensure the static plane
is always visible if you're seeing through an ai eye.

The old solution was limited to applying it to JUST ais, which isn't
satisfactory for this sort of thing and missed a LOT of cases (I didn't
really get how ai eyes worked before I'ma be honest)

I'm adding a signal off the hud for it detecting a change in its eye
here.
This is semi redundant, but avoids unneeded dupe work, so I'm ok with
it.

The pipeline here is less sane then I'd like, but it works and that's
enough

More pretty, better ux, **static works**

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Holograms glow now, pokes at the lighting for holocalls in general
a bit to make em nicer.
qol: You can no longer accidentally end a holocall (as a non ai) by
leaving the area. Felt like garbage
fix: Fixes static rendering improperly if viewed by a non ai

Adds the Pillbottle-Class Locust Carrier, a ship that hauls around 8
Pills. It is intended as an adminspawn ship mainly for stresstesting
subshuttles (and being asked for). It's fairly resource starved, and has
frankly terrible engines. The expectation is that it will utilize its 8
pods to gather resources and return to the mothership. Or fly off and
die horribly. It has slots for 10 prisoners (that's like 3 pills and one
third of a 4th).
This pr also edits the pill, blackpill, and superpill to be subshuttles
(compatible with the subshuttle system) by cutting out most of their
equipment, converting their maps to shuttle datums, and giving them
docking ports.

Blink is no longer a forbidden school spell?? (#74487)

## About The Pull Request

Turns blink's school from forbidden to translocation. This has some
incredibly minor changes nobody is going to notice:
- Changes the blink's invocations when mixed with a CERTAIN spell
- If you were very specifically a chaplain with the holy crusade sect
and you casted blink, before it would excommunicate you, now it will
just smite you, as translocation spells are seen as less bad than
forbidden magic
- probably some more niche interactions but that's all I can remember

## Why It's Good For The Game

Guys, I know blink is a very annoying spell but come on now it's not
forbidden magic, that's for heretics and super duper evil stuffs

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: blink is now a translocation spell

Icemoon Hermit Ruin Active Turf Fix - For Real This Time (#74476)

In #74306, I _thought_ I knew what the cause was, and I both attempted a
potential fix _and_ made tracking it easier. The fruits of my labor paid
off, I know exactly what caused it now.

Basically, the demonic portal will scrape away all turfs in a 5-tile
radius on its `Initialize()`, and if a spawner spawned right next to the
hermit ruin... it would count it as a mineral turf and scrape it away as
well. That's so fucking silly. At least we know now.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The fix is to just make those tiles unscrapeable, which is accomplished
via another turf_flag and filtering those out in the `Initialize()` of
the demonic portals.

I also cleaned up the calls to scrapeaway being `null`, which is really
weird because it just defaulted to the normal proc behavior. Naming the
arguments instead does the same thing (I checked)

Final Strictness (Bigly)

Alright! I think it's about time to jump into the npm stages now. This is as good as I want this version to get I think. It doesn't have to be completely perfect, because the original source itself wasn't even completely perfect. That's what the rework will ideally go towards (not that it can be perfect, but I'd rather put my brainpower towards that instead).

These are the final few changes that I'm making just to make a few more things explicit with types, docs, formatting, and such.

This component has been more of a roller coaster than Num Text has been, I think because it's internal state is much less straightforward to handle. There's a lot more interactivity than Num Text has, and it's also more based around user-interchangeable parts, because of the nature of what it's for.

After looking over this version of the codebase a few more times, I am so relieved to already have a rework in progress, and that the source tracking, TypeScript, and CDN-nature will finally be out of the way now. This has been hard to work on because it's like what I've mentioned before, trying to change the tires on a moving car, or building a bridge while you're driving across it. It's more the first case in this situation though, and STE used to be more of the bridge situation. Now I do essentially everything in VSCode now, so it's not as much in the forefront anymore (that's a good thing :) ).

I'm really glad that I've stepped up my tooling over time, I think the next biggest help to me will be for my other interests in the works, which are still brewing in my brain's understandings. By that I mean writing in compiled languages (I want to try that out some more, maybe Rust, definitely some C looks way more straightforward than it did when I first started programming), and definitely frameworks like React, and other big-brain tools you can build cool stuff with.

There was a few more APIs I realized I haven't documented anywhere yet either (other than the code here, itself), so I made a reference to those in the bonus docs I mentioned in the previous commit.

```
Second edit: Realized there are a few other features that I haven't mentioned anywhere in any documentation either, that being the Divider element (`<hr>`), and alternate menus for right-click and long-pressing on touch devices.
```

Got some more thinking time at work while doing potatoes yesterday, and I realized that I think that's what slows my creative side down, when I don't have time to think about things in my head (be it coding, or just plain ol' time to think in general). I started thinking about my work on jsmediatags some more, and that I think I want to contribute my current changes to the original project before I start implementing my own design choices into the codebase. Currently my changes only do things to modernize the codebase, so I think that will be more straightforward to merge, by doing it all in chunks to start with.

Then I was watching some coding videos this morning, and I rediscovered the Code Aesthetic channel again, and rewatched some of the videos about inheritance and abstraction. I understood a few more aspects that were out of reach for me the original time I watched it, and I found a few connections with things like that in how I can look at NBTify, and jsmediatags. I realized that it doesn't seem like classes are quite the problem for object-oriented code, it's more using them with inheritance, when it may not be a situation where inheritance is necessary. This was a lightbulb moment, because I realized that's what I like about using classes for, you can manage the state of a given 'thing' internally, and it can reference different hooks privately, meaning you don't have to pass a ton of things all around using functions and parameters. It's like a fancy way to scope your state. Functions are the most modular, and classes are good for linking small things together that may not be needed elsewhere outside of that one use-case. It also seems like those little things should be relying on other little pieces to work, otherwise it could just be a simple function by itself. With that whole last part, 'things' could be methods, variables, or async handling. When I have a given task that links those things together, and they are used to build one simple thing that can do one task, then a bundle of those could be a class that bundles those together and manages that behavior for you. You don't have to worry about connecting all the bits together yourself.

https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic

After seeing that idea, that seems to be why I like the way the NBTify classes handle the parsing implementation. At least as of now, I haven't seen or figured out a use case where parts of NBTify should be able to read a given NBT type, other than when it is reading the NBT data tree as a whole. So extracting those data type reading methods out of the class which iterates over the data seems to add an extra step of needing to pipe the state back into the function, so it can be used by the reading state again. The state of the reader isn't automatically available in those functions anymore, unlike when they are methods on the class, because they can just reference the internal state of the reader right there.

I guess it's this scope of whether the task your code is doing will be local to the thing itself, or if it is doing work on something not provided by the task itself.

The Code Aesthetic video also mentioned that this kind of thing is called Dependency Injection. This was a re-ignite lightbulb moment for me, as this also lines up with my realization above. The state of the NBT data reader itself is only for the sake of it being able to do it's job, it's not built as something to use or manipulate. It's only to make the reader itself work. And here's the other side of the mirror (*noted: will be a song name, I like that), the other way around is the other part of dependency injection. I don't want the NBT reader scope to require reading things from the disk, that's not what it's purpose is. It's to read the data from the NBT tree, and give that back to you. It doesn't need to know things about reading from the disk. So, to open a file from the disk, you simply open the file however you have the ability to (say from a Fetch request, or an FS call, you name it). You then have the file itself, which is what you minimally need to read it at all, which is then what you pass into the reader, because that's all it needs to be able to work. You don't have to know how the reader works, that's up for it and it's internal state to manage.

Ok, one more part of the realization. NBTify's data types are (attempting) to be in a sweet spot between these two methods. Basing all of the tags off of a tag class doesn't have a benefit for the tags themselves. The only thing they need to worry about is the data they hold/represent, and how they can be distinguished from each other. I think the reading and writing logic, you could say should probably be handled internally by the reader and writer classes themselves. The tags shouldn't worry about how they are read and written back and forth to the NBT tree.

I had more I could write about that last part, but I think I realized what I was essentially trying to say there. It's finding the distribution for what each part of the code should really have to manage. The distribution of powers/control. Sounds more official than it probably is, I'm not sure haha. MURICA CODE hehe. I actually like that connection, I'm going to try and think of more crossovers in things like that.

Ok, one more realization. I was at work and I realized that our order system is like a FIFO stack, and the tags are like pointers in C code, and when you can't find the order, it's a Reference Error, because you couldn't find it where you thought it should be. So it's important to add things to the stack in the right order, or else the program (kitchen) will throw a Promise that we couldn't find your order, and that will lead to customer complaints. Well, it's never a failed Promise, that would be ridiculous. It's more like it returns a Promise to a new Promise, which resolves later than expected, because we will always get the correct food to the customer no matter what. It's when the documentation (menu) explains one thing of the program (kitchen), and somehow the program provides a different return value (order) than what the documentation outlined. That would be ridiculous. Hence, why you want to ensure that your API (ordertakers) are correctly interfaced with the program (kitched), or else the return result (order) will be of an unexpected type. You wouldn't want the delayed Promise to bubble up as an Uncaught Error (complaint) to the containing scope (customer service), as this could go back down the DOM tree as an `error` event in our program. Then the APIs will get warned for making sure to follow the documentation to the program XDDD

That was a super goofy crossover, it's things like these that make my brain spin, and I really like finding connections like those to figure out how some things really are similar. Idk, it's a nice exercise. Now I really should be publishing this up to npm. I'm not sure how long I've been writing this commit for now, to be honest XD

This is another great example of why I want to have a Git Blog, this is super cool man.

New monster: Shadow dragon.

Latest addition to the list of monsters that want to kill you - the
Shadow dragon. I *think* this is the final bit to flesh out the
inclusion of the Drow race and everything that goes with it. I may add
more, we'll see.

Shadow dragons are nasty. They have more hit dice than the average
dragon, but less than a celestial dragon. They look identical to
black dragons, and they have the typical bite/claw/engulf/breath
attacks, but their breath attack is different from anything else -
level drain (ray appears as magenta). If hit by the level drain breath
attack, you lose one level. If you're level drain resistant, you just
take physical damage. If you're not resistant but reflecting, instead of
level drain, you take damage along with some max hit point drain. This
is the same behavior for monsters being hit by a shadow dragons breath
attack, and is the first instance of reflection not being 100% for
monsters.

Shadow dragons have ultravision, and are immune to sleep/poison/level
drain. Eating their corpse confers both sleep and poison resistance (50%
per corpse). Wearing their scales as a cloak imparts ultravision and
will give off an aura of darkness. Shadow-scaled armor adds sleep and
level drain resistance. Like the drow, they are light-haters, and can be
damaged the same way drow and gremlins can.

One thing on the to-do, and I tried in this commit but it currently
doesn't work: shadow dragons are supposed to give off an aura of
darkness, just as gold dragons give off light. This has proven a hard
nut to crack, so some help may be in order, so hopefully that's
addressed soon.

Enjoy :)

This patch updates our minimum Numpy version to 1.16, and restores compatibility with versions before 1.20, which were broken by a mistake in Hypothesis 6.72.4 (issue #3625).

6.73.0 - 2023-04-25

This release upgrades the explain phase (issue #3411).

    Following the first failure, Hypothesis will (usually) track which lines of code were executed by passing and failing examples, and report where they diverged - with some heuristics to drop unhelpful reports. This is an existing feature, now upgraded and newly enabled by default.

    After shrinking to a minimal failing example, Hypothesis will try to find parts of the example – e.g. separate args to @given() – which can vary freely without changing the result of that minimal failing example. If the automated experiments run without finding a passing variation, we leave a comment in the final report:

    test_x_divided_by_y(
        x=0,  # or any other generated value
        y=0,
    )

Just remember that the lack of an explanation sometimes just means that Hypothesis couldn’t efficiently find one, not that no explanation (or simpler failing example) exists.

6.72.4 - 2023-04-25

This patch fixes type annotations for the arrays() strategy. Thanks to Francesc Elies for pull request #3602.

6.72.3 - 2023-04-25

This patch fixes a bug with from_type() with dict[tuple[int, int], str] (issue #3527).

    Thanks to Nick Muoh at the PyCon Sprints!

6.72.2 - 2023-04-24

This patch refactors our internals to facilitate an upcoming feature.

6.72.1 - 2023-04-19

This patch fixes some documentation and prepares for future features.

6.72.0 - 2023-04-16

This release deprecates Healthcheck.all(), and adds a codemod to automatically replace it with list(Healthcheck) (issue #3596).

6.71.0 - 2023-04-07

This release adds GitHubArtifactDatabase, a new database backend that allows developers to access the examples found by a Github Actions CI job. This is particularly useful for workflows that involve continuous fuzzing, like HypoFuzz.

Thanks to Agustín Covarrubias for this feature!

6.70.2 - 2023-04-03

This patch clarifies the reporting of time spent generating data. A simple arithmetic mean of the percentage of time spent can be misleading; reporting the actual time spent avoids misunderstandings.

Thanks to Andrea Reina for reporting and fixing issue #3598!

The Componentization!

Alright! Unfortunately, this is my second time around to writing this changelog. I was about more than halfway through writing it when my dad turned off the power to fix one of the lights in our house. I had to take a little break, it really bugged that I lost about 15 minutes of writing out of nowhere. Aah, ok. Let's try it again XD

I've been working on this update for a while now, pretty much since the last one I released just a few days ago. I essentially rewrote Menu Drop's logic to better handle changes in it's element structure, and made it more user-accessible by removing the Shadow DOM (user in this case being whoever implements Menu Drop, not the site user). Here's some more about that, next!

Changes:
- Now that the Shadow DOM has been taken out, the entire component's structure is directly part of the Light DOM! This allows the user to style the different sub-components using global CSS, like you might for a standard `<select>` menu. You won't have to use `::part()` selectors anymore.
- *Part* of the last change (p-unintended (this intended though, lol)), now each of the sub-components within Menu Drop now use their own dedicated custom elements, rather than using existing built-in ones, like `ul` and `li`! This both helps prevent global style collisions with other page styles (one of my reasons for wanting to use Shadow DOM originally), and this makes things much easier for moving component behavior out of the main Menu Drop element, and on to the child elements instead. One example of this, is that rather than calling `MenuDropElement.getOptions(aListWithOptions)` to get a list's items, you now call the method (now a getter) on the list itself, `MenuListElement.items`.
- Also related to that last note, menu options are now called menu items, once again, like the classic Menu Drop days. I think I changed to calling them options around when I added the select menu behavior, and now I think I like the original implementation I had before, which equates to the standard `ul` and `li` elements, with the equivalents of `menu-list` and `menu-item` for Menu Drop.
- Thanks to the more modular nature of the component's structure, the element will now better handle customization by the user as they need. For example, say you wanted to add a new item to a new list in an existing sub menu. Now you can just use `document.createElement()` like you would for anything else in the DOM, and the Web Component classes for Menu Drop's sub-components will handle setting everything up for you! No need to add `tabindex` or `part` attributes to a new menu item anymore, now they show up there as soon as the element is initialized!
- There are still a few features I have to re-implement before this new setup is synonymous with the existing stable release of Menu Drop, like the select menu behavior, support for anchor tags inside of list items, and mobile support. The buttons and everything work on mobile, but I want to get everything working nicely for desktop first before I start to add specific changes to mobile.
- And another change/feature addition is that I want to make the default styles for Menu Drop more-default like, as if it was a standard built-in HTML element from the spec. It's more boring for sure, but I'd like it to have an un-opinionated look in terms of styles, like that it would make you want to add your own look to it. Especially now that it is part of the Light DOM, now it will be much easier to add your own look, however you want it to be!
- Also also also related to the last note, these new default styles are responsive to dark color schemes! I found out about these on web.dev, and in the W3C Working Draft pages. It's called System Colors, and they respond to whatever the currently set color scheme is. This is great because it means that Menu Drop will look light in light mode, and dark in dark mode, no need to add any `@media` queries or color scheme properties yourself! This was something I've been hoping to have without any extra style tricks, for a while now, and I love how simple the styles are to get it to work. For more info about System Colors, check out these two articles which helped me get exactly what I've wanted!
https://web.dev/color-scheme/#the-user-agent-stylesheet
https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#css-system-colors

Alright, alright. Sorry if that was insanely long (it was, probably). I like to try and write everything about my updates now, as it really helps to document the journey along the way, and to be able to look back and see if I missed anything (undoubtedly, yes). This is a much more modern setup for Menu Drop, and I think it is more semantically nice to work with, something that wasn't quite the case before.

Oh yeah! One more thing I will also do with time, is to add Aria roles and attributes to the custom sub-components, as right now they don't have them, and the previous `ul` `li` ones did. I haven't tried those out yet before, so I will read more about them before implementing them here.

Okay! That should be good now :)

See ya soon!
Brandon

Constructable Stylesheets!

Oh yeah! Nice to have this working now. Rather than loading the styles for the components with a stylesheet linked by the user, now it's included as part of the library's source!

I really like this, as it makes it s the only thing required to fully load the component is to run the script from, wherever essentially, and just by it's URL. You don't have to add any other tags to the head of the page, you don't have to add any polyfills yourself, it just runs.

The only thing that could be debated to be a bit of a drawback is the FOUC, Flash of Unstyled Content, but since everything is lazy-loaded *consistently*, and with the smart things that come in handy thanks to the Custom Elements API, you can rely on different ways to handle that yourself.

I think one way to do that would be with the `window.customElements.whenDefined()` function call, which returns a `Promise` when the given element tag you are checking is defined. This allows you to get a direct callback in your app once 'x' component has fully finished loading. If you do this with all of your components' `Promise`s, then you know exactly when it's safe to fully render the page!

Using this in conjunction with a main `<script type="module"></script>` for your app, then you can simply `await` all of these calls, in the top level, and once they have finished loading, continue the main module process! Of course, if you didn't need to wait for them to finish, you can simply do this for your rendering/display logic, and hide elements as they are loading, accordingly.

I really like this kind of loading idea, where you expect things to not be ready yet. If you do that, then you can prepare for more things on the fly, and it allows it to handle a range of circumstances.

I'm going to try using this design in my web apps from here onwards, I think it can really make your code go a long way :)

I want to go back and try and bring all of my modern code to STE, but I don't know where to start every time I go over there XD. Gonna look into it more, I think ideas like these could really help with how STE is structured.

I definitely want to combine STE with NBTify down the road, that's been one of my goals for a long time now! To get to that point though, I need to step up STE's codebase a bit, and also add SNBT support to NBTify, as I think that's how I want to go about editing NBT. I think the NBT tree view editors with buttons and such look really cool, and they are fairly easy to use, but I think there's something neat about just opening it up as a text file, typing a few things, then saving that with just a keypress. If I made that into it's own mini PWA, I think the Minecraft community would flip their lids! It's definitely something I'd love to have, especially with it working offline, on mobile, and all of the other cool things you get with PWAs. I may have to start a little separate repo for that soon! Maybe it should be it's own thing, rather than being part of STE? I'd probably have both eventually, as I think a lightweight editor specifically for NBT would be nice, and just having it in STE alongside everything else seems really cool. We'll have to see! Lots of cool things ahead :)

Been looking into React and Lit recently too! With all of this fancy TypeScript and module work I've been doing for the last few months now, I feel more equipped to tackle things like that! Next I want to look into how you can get a minimal React/TypeScript setup going, and still be able to publish to GitHub Pages.

So many cool things!!! Gotta go to bed, cya ta' mornin

#### Sunday 2023-04-30 20:50:36 by aeiea

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

[MIRROR] Mimes can no longer write without breaking their vow. [MDB IGNORE] (#20841)

* Mimes can no longer write without breaking their vow. (#74674)

## About The Pull Request

I feel this is gonna be unpopular with the lazy mime players.

Also, this is an idea I had in my backlog for a while now

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53777086/231355622-2c5d5d5a-813d-420c-ae42-c1bdc657f3ba.png)

This removes the Mime's ability to write on paper while they're on their
vow of silence.
This can be compared to hand language, which doesn't let you speak
despite not being considered "talking", and PDA messaging, which does
the same.

Mimes can still write with their pen, which is a nice invisible white
color. I thought I would keep it in as I find that interaction funny to
have a Mime give someone just a blank paper, unknowing that there's text
on it.
Spraycans/Telekinesis/Circuits are also left unaffected because they
require actual effort to obtain (doing genetics, doing circuits, or
printing spraycans which take a lot of inventory space and is limited),
compared to paper which you can carry hundreds of papers around and is
bountiful across the station.

I thought this was attempted at least once, but I can't find any PR that
mentions it, so I'm shooting my shot to see if this is something we'd
want.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Mimes using paper is a lazy way to bypass their one job gimmick: Emoting
over talking.

If they get a job change, they can simply break their vow to access
paper writing abilities, so this doesn't affect that really. It more-so
hits the Mimes who uses the job for the free spells/healing
abilities/etc, and bypasses the downsides (im aware its harder to get
people to read paper than it is to talk to them, but you can literally
get the mute quirk and itll have the same effect without being the whole
job).

The point is, you don't get invisible walls for free; it comes at a cost
of not being able to talk to people. If you want to talk, then break
your vow, lose access to your Mime abilities, and remake it later when
the cooldown is over. You're not meant to do both.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Mimes can no longer write on paper without breaking their vow.
/:cl:

* Mimes can no longer write without breaking their vow.

Effective dose works for alcohol subtypes' effects, + alcohol intolerance (#5446)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Whoops I accidentally did a balance change with my
please-don't-trigger-me PR.

Adds alcohol intolerance, a trait that prevents proper metabolization of
most alcohol ingredients; instead of effects simulating drunkenness, you
get _immediate_ liver failure, toxin damage, pain and vomiting. Yes, I
actually do prefer that personally.

Certain drinks now have their effects modified by the *effective dose*
calculated in the main ethanol affect_ingest and affect_blood procs,
rather than just sort of guessing at it or doing completely wrong things
(deathbell was doing `if(dose * strength > strength)`, which is to say,
`if(dose > 1)`, for example).

## Why It's Good For The Game

honestly it's mostly just a personal thing, don't want my character to
get drunk. The doses thing should be good, though, since it actually
makes effects of various drinks, like, sane.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Alcohol intolerance (no drunkenness, just horrific amounts of
damage)
tweak: Various alcoholic drinks now actually take strength mod of
species into account for secondary/additional effects
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the

changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

Improve auto-update mode by avoiding redundant updates to some controls

Auto-update mode can be annoying because it keeps resetting
the content of the various controls even if nothing changed.
This i=makes a clunky experience if you are trying to interact
with one of those controls at the same time that the refresh
fires and updates it.  For example:

- You are trying to select the text from one of the labels
  (say, with the intent to copy it to the clipboard), the
  refresh will clear the text selection.

- You have a window with more than 8 styles set and you are
  trying to scroll the listbox down to see the bottom of the
  list.  The listbox scroll position will constantly be
  reset to the top.

 This change improves the situation for some of the controls:

 - All the simple labels/edit controls have been changed to skip
   the SetWindowText if the string is exactly the same as what
   is already in the control.  This is done via the new
   SetDlgItemTextEx helper.

 - The Styles tab explicitly tracks what values are being currently
   shown, and doesn't reset the lists unless the styles or the
   selected window have changed.

There are still some controls that this is a problem for, notably
the properties list and the lists on the Windows tab.  Those are
harder to solve, and problems for another day.

wip: add TextLogStream, not yet functional

Add a reader for streams which can also read from stdin, hopefully.
For now it is stuck because we can't return &[u8] to our internal buffer
because it's wrapped in a Box<> for interior mutability pattern.  So we
need to return String from our read() instead.  When I tried that earlier
it got deep into the weeds propagating the trait change to TextLogFile
and friends.  So, that's a TBD.

Meanwhile, I think this has become over-complicated.  Why not implement
Seek for Stdin instead?  All we need is a ReadBuf which never discards old
data, or something like that. Meanwhile, I've also discovered std::Cursor<>
which does most of the work.  Holy shit.  I'm rethinking all my life choices,
now. Like, the mmap has to go. Premature optimization and whatnot.

Add Utilities.slide/3

Because the implementation for `slide/3` in the Enum module behaves the
way it does, we should just let it. In fact, I'm considering if I
shouldn't just use it as a basis for creating an internal module?

That is, I'm not going to re-implement the Enum module and Enumerable
protocol. Instead, I would just have `Bio.Enum` and expose all the same
functions but with the explicit guarantee that they preserve the struct
type that you're using.

This would alleviate any irritation from the perspective of the behavior
of e.g. `Enum.map` returning a struct instead of a list. You would have
to explicitly opt in to one behavior or the other...

Yeah, I kinda really like that.

Buff Orcus's spellcasting

As with other demon lord buffs, reflecting two things: he is no longer
covetous, and he is no longer a required boss fight. (A third thing:
under new monster behavior inherited from vanilla, he will expend at
most one wand of death charge on you if he sees you are reflecting or
magic resistant, so you will get the wand mostly full if you defeat
him.)

One option for buffing him was to give him an artifact Wand of Orcus,
which would have been either an artifact wand of death or an artifact
mace or staff like in EvilHack. I didn't really want to take that path,
especially because EvilHack has to go out of its way to make the
artifact unusable by most heroes because it'd be too good otherwise.
Instead, I focused on giving him stronger spellcasting.

Notably, a number of his spells behave like other ones except they
uniquely ignore magic resistance on the hero. This is the sort of
change that might go over poorly, because players may assume that
they're more protected than they actually are, and then get beaten up.
Still, I want to break out of the pattern where Antimagic makes monster
spellcasting more of an annoyance than anything in the late game, and in
order to achieve that something like this has to happen. (I wouldn't
have done this if the touch of death spell were still an instadeath.)

The other big new thing is the "disenchant" spell - this allows him to
hit players where it hurts in their gear, but not as badly as it would
if he could cast destroy armor ignoring magic resistance. (That's still
a possibility later on, if changes are made to that spell so that it
degrades armor before destroying it outright.)
