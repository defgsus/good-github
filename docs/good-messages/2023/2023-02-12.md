[Profiler] Defer recording startup python events (take 2) (#91684)

This is my commandeer of https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/82154 with a couple extra fixes.

The high level idea is that when we start profiling we see python frames which are currently executing, but we don't know what system TID created them. So instead we defer the TID assignment, and then during post processing we peer into the future and use the system TID *of the next* call on that Python TID.

As an aside, it turns out that CPython does some bookkeeping (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/ee821dcd3961efc47262322848267fe398faa4e4/Include/cpython/pystate.h#L159-L165, thanks @dzhulgakov for the pointer), but you'd have to do some extra work at runtime to know how to map their TID to ours so for now I'm going to stick to what I can glean from post processing alone.

As we start observing more threads it becomes more important to be principled about how we start up and shut down. (Since threads may die while the profiler is running.) #82154 had various troubles with segfaults that wound up being related to accessing Python thread pointers which were no longer alive. I've tweaked the startup and shutdown interaction with the CPython interpreter and it should be safer now.

This creates a five day menu of recipes, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack, you can customize them based on your diet restrictions or preferences. Improve it as much as you want. This only took me a day because I am a master coder, so do not attempt to recreate something like this without proper safety equipment.

[v51664/4.14.303] update unbound, busybox, transmission, openvpn

- ol' assfuck decided to deliberately wreck DD-WRT in the past week
        -for some reason ol' assfuck thinks statically-linking services
        and creating a busybox 'service' applet (with symlink) is
        somehow going to save space.
                -spoiler: it doesn't. it's shit. he's resorting to
                wrecking his own shit out of spite. it's sad.

- i've updated transmission, openvpn, unbound and busybox (if busybox
  wasn't updated in the previous build already). transmission should
  work but i'm not sure if there will be webgui bugs/glitches.

- unfortunately because the new transmission requires a newer libstdc++,
  the 867/878/882 builds are ~175KiB bigger because libstdc++ is now at
  6.0.30 (from 6.0.24).
        -anyways if you grab transmission from the lootbag and throw it
        on a usb key, it should run great.

- openvpn has been updated as well, with a similar cautionary note:
  there may be bugs in the webgui. there also may not be. assfuck is
  busy ruining his shit these days.

- i have updated unbound too, along with the dnscrypt resolver.

i haven't "tested" this build because really i don't use any of these
programs very much, but i'm sure some of you do.

there shouldn't be any problems with the build, but if there are please
open a ticket.

enjoy. and fuck you, assfuck. stop ruining your shit you fucking idiot.
who the fuck thinks linking libservices statically is a fucking good
idea? you know how long it takes for busybox to build because of how
long it tries to eliminate all the libraries. where in the world did you
think it would be a good idea to make libservices static and increase
the time to build busybox? especially when you would have to do this for
every small change in services?

stupid fuck. get your head together, stop being that filthy meat-eater
sgobiraj's bitch, you stupid atheist fuck.

experimental_use(promise) (#25084)

* Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises

This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when 
something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
can run, then continue in a new task.

I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
separate commit.

* Move throwException to after work loop resumes

throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right 
before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
render the fiber again.

This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
(RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the 
RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
from appearing.

* Use expando to check whether promise has resolved

Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
resolved.

In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
the resolved value.

This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
by `Promise.allSettled`.

The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
without waiting a microtask.

* Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook

Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
implement it yet.

* use(promise)

Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components, 
but that is planned.

If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
"immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in 
previous commits.

Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing 
whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.

When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
principles largely apply.

The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
be deprecated.

[FIX] stock,purchase,mrp: accumulative security days

Usecase to reproduce:
- Set the warehouse as 3 steps receipt
- Put a security delay of 3 days for purchase
- Set a product with a vendor and 1 days as LT
- Replenish with the orderpoint

You expect to have a schedule date for tomorrow that contains all the
product needed in the incoming 4 days.

Currenly the internal transfer from QC -> Stock is for tomorrow (ok).
The transfer from Inpur -> QC is plan for 2 days in the past. (not ok)
The PO date is plan for 5 days in the past. (not ok)

It happens because the system check at each `stock.rule` application if
purchase is part of the route. If it's then it applies the security lead
time. It's a mistake because we should apply it only the first time.

To fix it we directly set it when the orderpoint run and not during
`stock.move` creation.
However for MTO it's not that easy. We don't want to deliver too
early the customer. So we keep applying the delay during the
`stock.move` creation but only when it goes under the warehouse stock
location.

[MIRROR] Starlight Polish (Space is blue!) [MDB IGNORE] (#19059)

* Starlight Polish (Space is blue!) (#72886)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Adds support to underlays to realize_overlays
Ensures decals properly handle plane offsets
Fixes space lighting double applying if it's changeturf'd into. this
will be important later
Makes solar vis_contents block emissives as expected
Moves transit tube overlays to update_overlays, adds emissive blockers
to them

#### Adds render steps

An expansion on render_target based emissive blockers. 
They allow us to hijack an object's appearance and draw it somewhere
else, or even modify it, THEN draw it somewhere else.
They chain quite nicely

Fixes shuttles deleting z holder objects

#### Makes space emissive, makes walls and floors block emissives
The core idea here goes like this:
We make space glow, and give its overlays some color

This way, the tile and space parallax remain fullbright, along with
anything that doesn't block emissives, but anything that does block
emissives will instead get shaded the color of starlight

This requires a bit of extra work, see later

This is done automatically with render relays, which now support
specifiying layer and color (Need to make an editor for these one of
these days)

The emissive blocking floor stuff requires making a second render plate
to prevent double scaling

Also adds some new layering defines for lighting, and ensures all turf
lights have a layer. We'll get to this soon

#### Makes things in space blue

We color them the same as starlight, by taking advantage of space being
emissive
This means that things in space that block emissive will block it
correctly and be colored blue by the light overlay, but space itself
will remain fullbright

This does require redefining what always_lit means, but nothing but
cordons use that so it's fineee


#### Makes glass above space glow, and some other stuff

Glass tiles that sit above space will now shine light with matching
color to the glasses color. This includes mat tiles.

Glass tiles (not mat because they have no alpha) also only partially
block emissives.
Adds a new proc that uses render steps to acomplish this, essentially
we're cutting out bits below X alpha and drawing what remains as an
emissive.

#### Modifies partial space showing to support glow

Essentially, alongside displaying space as an underlay, we also display
a light overlay colored like starlight.
That starlight overlay gets masked to only be visible in bits that do
not contain any alpha.

We also mask the turf lighting to not go into bits that have no alpha,
to ensure we get the effect we want.
This is done with that lighting layer thing I mentioned earlier.

#### Makes appearance realization's list output ordered

I want it output in order of overlay, sub overlay suboverlay, next
overlay
Need to use insert for that

## Why It's Good For The Game

Pretty!
Also having space be emissive is a very very good way to test for fucked
emissive blockers (If it's broken why are we even drawing the overlay)
I know for a fact mob blockers on lizards and socks are kinda yorked, I
think there's more

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

stop shitting in my console

The camera rigs don't get destroyed during normal play, so now my console is safe from being shit in while changing avatar.

This likely will fuck with how the distance scaling works, but it *should* be a good change. The camera rigs are more likely to be closer to the nameplates than the root of the avatar to the nameplate anyways, so it makes more sense to scale by.

This does mean though that crouching or being small next to a tall player will likely show the nameplate. It would be nice if the distance took into account height of the remote player, but that would be a funni fix.

Update main.css

Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect, shiny family
Holiday, peppermint candy
But for him it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight
Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this (midnights like this)

SMART原则
Specific—— 具体的
Measurable—— 可测量的
Attainable ——可达到的
Relevant—— 相关的
Time based——时间的
——S代表具体(Specific)，指绩效考核要切中特定的工作指标，不能笼统；
——M代表可度量(Measurable)，指绩效指标是数量化或者行为化的，验证这些绩效指标的数据或者信息是可以获得的；
——A代表可实现(Attainable)，指绩效指标在付出努力的情况下可以实现，避免设立过高或过低的目标；
——R代表现实性(realistic)，指绩效指标是实实在在的，可以证明和观察；
——T代表有时限(time bound)，注重完成绩效指标的特定期限。

任务分解法（WBS）
即Work Breakdown Structure，如何进行WBS分解：目标→任务→工作→活动。

WBS分解的原则
将主体目标逐步细化分解，最底层的任务活动可直接分派到个人去完成；每个任务原则上要求分解到不能再细分为止。

WBS分解的方法
至上而下与至下而上的充分沟通；一对一个分别交流；小组讨论。

WBS分解的标准
分解后的活动结构清晰；逻辑上形成一个大的活动；集成了所有的关键因素包含临时的里程碑和监控点；所有活动全部定义清楚。

意义：学会分解任务，只有将任务分解得足够细，你才能心里有数，你才能有条不紊地工作，你才能统筹安排你 的时间表。

PDCA是英语单词Plan(计划)、Do(执行)、Check(检查)和Action(调整)的第一个字母，PDCA循环就是按照这样的顺序进行质量管理，并且循环不止地进行下去的科学程序。
1、P (plan) 计划，包括方针和目标的确定，以及活动规划的制定。

PDCA环(2张)
2、D (Do) 执行，根据已知的信息，设计具体的方法、方案和计划布局；再根据设计和布局，进行具体运作，实现计划中的内容。
3、C (check) 检查，总结执行计划的结果，分清哪些对了，哪些错了，明确效果，找出问题。
4、A (Action)调整，对总结检查的结果进行处理，对成功的经验加以肯定，并予以标准化；对于失败的教训也要总结，引起重视。对于没有解决的问题，应提交给下一个PDCA循环中去解决。
以上四个过程不是运行一次就结束，而是周而复始的进行，一个循环完了，解决一些问题，未解决的问题进入下一个循环，这样阶梯式上升的。
PDCA循环是全面质量管理所应遵循的科学程序。全面质量管理活动的全部过程，就是质量计划的制订和组织实现的过程，这个过程就是按照PDCA循环，不停顿地周而复始地运转的。

来自 <https://baike.baidu.com/item/PDCA%E5%BE%AA%E7%8E%AF/5091521?fromtitle=PDCA&fromid=3716836>

PDCA原则
PDCA原则最初的概念来自于现代质量管理的奠基者：Walter A. Shewhtar，后来被美国的质量管理专家戴明博士在1950年再度挖掘了出来，广泛运用于宣传和产品质量改善方面，使用这套管理方法进行个人的自我管理，也是相当的有用的。
介绍
如上图所示：PDCA原则的内容说起来很简单，就是以上的四点(plan、do、check、action)，基本原则就是，凡事都需得规划，然后执行，执行完了以后需要思考和改进。事实上，我上文中说的我那位打dota的同学，就在不知不觉中就使用了PDCA的原则打游戏，我就按照他玩游戏的过程来梳理下：
1、(plan)首先需要了解的是，我们这件事情最终的目标究竟是什么?我同学的目标很简单，赢得游戏，提高竞技水平。
2、(Do)其次就是，我们如何去拆解和去执行我们的目标?他一般来说，他会说大概6分钟出xx装备，十分钟出xxx装备，二十分钟出xxx装备(拆分计划)，把计划进行拆分
3、如何去检查我们目标的完成?这也是很好检验的，根据目标检查自己的视频，看自己是否达到了目标，然后客观的记录。
4、如何去修正我们执行过程出现的问题?思考自己达到目标时候是因为哪些客观的原因导致的?怎样对自己的过程进行修改，才能更快的完成目标?没有达到自己目标的时候，如何对自己的过程进行相对性的训练，让自己达到目标。
这是最基础的一套进步的模式，事实上在执行过程中，不同的阶段也需要不同的方法来配合，一个方法就可以完成所有的事情，比如说Smart原则、5W1H原则，等等，而且方法也得因人而异，有人就不太喜欢把生活的目标定的太明确……anyway,能达到自己的目的即可，方法只是一种参考。
使用PDCA原则来写文章
以下是我写公众号的一个自我记录的模板，大家可以了解下我是如何完成这个循环的：
PDCA循环：
plan，即我写的写作五问,分别是
1、文章的主题是什么?
2、别人有哪些和我类似的文章，我如何才能何别人不一样(比别人好?视角比别人特殊?)
3、文章的标题该怎么起?(我文章的受众是谁?我如何吸引我文章的受众?)
4、内容如何组织?(结构是什么样的?排版又如何?)
5、传播和推广的方式是什么?(如何让更多的人看到我的文章，达到宣传的效果?)
do,执行，并记录执行的日志，即记录我开始写作到完成的时候，所耗费的时间，工作的内容，目的是准确记录自己完成工作的时间，以便以后回复的时候，查看自己工作耗费时间的主要点在哪，并针对那个点进行提升和改进。
check，对自己的文章组织计划进行判断，自己是否已经完成，并记录下来，同时记录自己文章发送后的效果，
Action，根据上文的结果和过程记录，对自己写作方式进行修改，使得自己写作速度得到提升的同时，也摸索出相应的判断：什么样的文章才是大家最喜欢的?

人类历史原本就是一部追求自身平衡的奋斗史，本文介绍七个人生工具：SWOT、PDCA、6W2H、SMART、WBS、时间管理、二八原则 。

001
SWOT分析法
• Strengths：优势Weaknesses：劣势Opportunities：机会Threats：威胁

意义：帮您清晰地把握全局，分析自己在资源方面的优势与劣势，把握环境提供的机会，防范可能存在的风险与威胁，对我们的成功有非常重要的意义。

002
PDCA循环规则
Plan：制定目标与计划
Do：任务展开，组织实施
Check：对过程中的关键点和最终结果进行检查
Action：纠正偏差，对成果进行标准化，并确定新的目标，制定下一轮计划
意义：每一项工作，都是一个PDCA循环，都需要计划、实施、检查结果，并进一步进行改进，同时进入下一个循环，只有在日积月累的渐进改善中，才可能会有质的飞跃，才可能完善每一项工作，完善自己的人生。

003
6W2H法
What：工作的内容和达成的目标
Why：做这项工作的原因
Who：参加这项工作的具体人员，以及负责人
When：在什么时间、什么时间段进行工作
Where：工作发生的地点
Which：哪一种方法或途径
How：用什么方法进行
How much：需要多少成本

意义：做任何工作都应该从6W2H来思考，这有助于我们的思路的条理化，杜绝盲目性。我们的汇报也应该用6W2H，能节约写报告及看报告的时间。

004
SMART原则
Specific—— 具体的
Measurable—— 可测量的
Attainable ——可达到的
Relevant—— 相关的
Time based——时间的

意义：人们在制定工作目标或者任务目标时，考虑一下目标与计划是不是SMART化的。只有具备SMART化的计划才是具有良好可实施性的，也才能指导保证计划得以实现。
特别注明：
有的又如此解释此原则：
——S代表具体(Specific)，指绩效考核要切中特定的工作指标，不能笼统；
——M代表可度量(Measurable)，指绩效指标是数量化或者行为化的，验证这些绩效指标的数据或者信息是可以获得的；
——A代表可实现(Attainable)，指绩效指标在付出努力的情况下可以实现，避免设立过高或过低的目标；
——R代表现实性(realistic)，指绩效指标是实实在在的，可以证明和观察；
——T代表有时限(time bound)，注重完成绩效指标的特定期限。

005
任务分解法（WBS）
即Work Breakdown Structure，如何进行WBS分解：目标→任务→工作→活动。

WBS分解的原则
将主体目标逐步细化分解，最底层的任务活动可直接分派到个人去完成；每个任务原则上要求分解到不能再细分为止。

WBS分解的方法
至上而下与至下而上的充分沟通；一对一个分别交流；小组讨论。

WBS分解的标准
分解后的活动结构清晰；逻辑上形成一个大的活动；集成了所有的关键因素包含临时的里程碑和监控点；所有活动全部定义清楚。

意义：学会分解任务，只有将任务分解得足够细，你才能心里有数，你才能有条不紊地工作，你才能统筹安排你 的时间表。

006
时间管理-重要与紧急

A、重要且紧急
紧急状况
迫切的问题
限期完成的工作
你不做其他人也不能做

B、重要不紧急
准备工作
预防措施
价值观的澄清
计划
人际关系的建立
真正的再创造
增进自己的能力

C、紧急不重要
造成干扰的事、电话、
信件、报告、会议
许多迫在眉捷的急事
符合别人期望的事

D、不重要不紧急
忙碌琐碎的事
广告函件、电话、逃避性活动
等待时间

意义：优先顺序=重要性*紧迫性，在进行时间安排时，应权衡各种事情的优先顺序，要学会“弹钢琴”。

对工作要有前瞻能力，防患于未然，如果总是在忙于救火，那将使我们的工作永远处于被动之中。

007

Do not allow focus to drift from fullscreen client via focusstack()

It generally doesn't make much sense to allow focusstack() to navigate
away from the selected fullscreen client, as you can't even see which
client you're selecting behind it.

I have had this up for a while on the wiki as a separate patch[0], but
it seems reasonable to avoid this behaviour in dwm mainline, since I'm
struggling to think of any reason to navigate away from a fullscreen
client other than a mistake.

gazelle: add CPU profiling to aid troubleshooting

As Gazelle becomes the defacto tool to generate BUILD files for several
languages in Bazel ecosystem, we gain more contributors and extension
authors from a diverse set of background and experience.

However, Gazelle itself is complicated and not all the contributors are
familiar with the Go ecosystem. This led to difficulty in developing
language extensions and troubleshooting edge cases.

Provides a way to turn on Go profiling(1) is a great way to help with
that. Go's pprof tool is well-documented and CLI friendly. Rules author
could simply turn on the CPU profile capture to analyze it and figure
out where is the bottleneck, how does the call stack look like.

Add environment variables `GAZELLE_CPU_PROFILE` to collect Go CPU
profile for later analysis.

[MIRROR] Completely Culls req_access_txt/req_one_access_txt [MDB IGNORE] (#18458)

* Completely Culls req_access_txt/req_one_access_txt (#72281)

Hey there,

Now that every instance of `req_access` and `req_one_access` is a list
of strings, there is absolutely no reason for
req_access_txt/req_access_one_txt to exist. In fact, any instance where
they were still used in the codebase was very convoluted and was very
broken! Don't worry, I fixed it all out, and life is good.

I also dmdoc the surviving access variables, because those were missing.
I went on the side of caution and made a more verbose documentation with
an example just to have people really grasp this (it took me a while to
actually get it)

I believe that we changed _everything_ over to the
req_access/req_one_access system earlier this year in VV, but the
problem is that _new mappers don't understand the difference between the
two systems_. In fact, the "txt" system is completely redundant since
all it does is transition stuff to the "base" system. So, let's just
completely cull the one that's all but deprecated and ensure this
confusion no longer arises. The whole purpose of "txt" seemed to be to
convert the access, but it's all pointless now that we can just read the
list directly.

I'm also 99% certain that the "access check" on vending machines broke
(and didn't seem to have correct logic in the first place? I
legitimately couldn't find a case where it could fail in testing, so I
changed that up), and that's fixed up now. Let me know if I was clueless
there. I know it's short-circuiting now as opposed to "all must be
true", but it just didn't work.

* Completely Culls req_access_txt/req_one_access_txt

* oh the misery

* makes them use the thing that actually works

* test to see if engineering access is breaking it

* Revert "test to see if engineering access is breaking it"

This reverts commit 3cc2c554ff18f435a51601782e64c76193298db7.

* Fix access checks when req_access is null (#72458)

## About The Pull Request
Fixes #72450 - This seems to be an oversight in some of the access
refactors we've been through recently. When there was an assumption in
`check_access_list()` that `req_access` would always be a list, and that
if it was not something terrible had gone wrong and the door should
default to public access.

With the cleanup of the _txt access vars and the introduction of mapping
access helpers, this assumption is no longer true. `req_access` will be
null when multiple helpers are painted onto the same door, so we need to
handle that properly. Thanks to @MrMelbert for spitting out the attached
fix in mapping general and letting me PR it after testing.

This really needs a suite of unit tests around it. San has helpfully
volunteered to work on that for three hours before getting frustrated.

## Why It's Good For The Game
No more public access to engineering lobby, lathe, etc.


## Changelog
:cl: Vire, MrMelbert
fix: The engineering lobby and lathe are no longer public access
fix: Doors will no longer be treated as public access when they have
multiple accesses set on them

Mirror 72339 & 71284 (#18645)

* Renews a bunch of old roundend new reports that got lost. Plus, some roundend report QoL for cult and revs. (#71284)

A few roundend reports got lost from moving to dynamic and other prs.
This PRs re-allows them to occur. Namely: "Wizard Killed" (lost in
dynamic), "Blob nuked" (lost in dynamic), "Cult escaped" (lost in cult
rework), and "Nuke Ops Victory" (station destroyed via nuke) (lost from,
what I can see, an oversight / accidental swap of report values).

Additionally, small roundend report QOL for cult: Removes antag datums
from spirit realm ghosts after being dusted, so they do not show up on
the report. And in reverse, heads of staff who were dusted / destroyed
in revolution rounds are now also shown in roundend reports.

Some of these reports are dead, which is is a shame because I think
they're cool and fun.

:cl: Melbert
qol: Successfully fending off a blob now has a cross station news report
again. More pressing reports will take priority over it, though.
qol: Successfully killing a wizard (and all of their apprentices) now
has a cross station news report again.
qol: If more than half of a cultist team manages to escape on the
shuttle (rather than summoning Nar'sie), they will send a unique cross
station news report. This is still a loss, by the way. Summon Nar'sie!
qol: Nuclear Operatives successfully nuking the station now has its
unique cross station news report again, and no longer uses the generic
"The station was nuked" report.
qol: Nuking the station to stop a blob infection now has a unique cross
station news report again. Good luck convincing admins to allow this.
qol: Cult ghosts from "Spirit Realm" no longer persist on the cult's
team after being desummoned, meaning they will not show up on roundend
report.
qol: Heads of staff will now always show up on revolution roundend
report - even if their body was fully destroyed.

* Adds support for Rulesets having intrinsic template requirements (#72339)

Title

Ensures that we load templates for a ruleset before we attempt to place
or cache characters for that ruleset
Also makes wizard and abductor async load their template to improve
(apparent) loading times for them

This is the only thing left that I can think of that would cause antags
like nukies and abductors to spawn in wrong

This should not be player facing

[MIRROR] Avoid creating string list of turf platings, rename some of the APIs, and improve focused test support - 160ms+ (more on prod) of init savings [MDB IGNORE] (#18357)

* Avoid creating string list of turf platings, rename some of the APIs, and improve focused test support - 160ms+ (more on prod) of init savings (#72056)

Looking at some stuff that uses `Join` right now as targets, this one's
pretty straight forward.

`/turf/open/floor/Initialize`, called 20,000 times without ruins,
creates a string list of the broken and burnt states. This carries the
fixed cost of `Join`, which is very expensive, as well as some (not
crazy, but not negligible) proc overhead.

These vars were used for effectively nothing, and have been replaced
with just using the list when necessary, which only adds an extra
millisecond of cost to update_overlays.

This was also used to automatically set `broken` and `burnt` at runtime.
However, this looks like it has gone completely unused. Adds a unit test
which adds it as a static field to the only type that cared about it,
which was abductor tiles, which is wrong anyway, but Whatever. I want to
support people making a subtype of floor tiles that are pre-broken
without it messing up stuff silently, so the test is there.

While I'm at it, renames `setup_broken_states` and `setup_burnt_states`
to remove `setup_`, since they don't really do that anymore (and never
did).

Also also, adds support for `PERFORM_ALL_TESTS` to work with multiple
focuses.

For reviewing, basically all of the changes are in floor.dm, aside from
test stuff, which is unit_test.dm.

* Avoid creating string list of turf platings, rename some of the APIs, and improve focused test support - 160ms+ (more on prod) of init savings

* a

* FUCK

* nope

Add vampire ability permission check

Adds a new mob proc that allows checking if vampiric abilities should function. Allows easily checking anti-magic, trait holy, garlic necklace, garlic blood, and staked status.

Bloodfledge actions and coffin healing will now use this check. Flight potions will warn bloodfledge quirk users before allowing consumption.

Registration once again

YEEHAW FELLAS!!!!

IT WORKS!!!

IT'S ALIVE!!!

IT *BREATHES*

*clears throat*

So yes, registration is once again completely functional.
Also up until now I had the wrong sql file here on github, it's the correct one now and I moved it out of the assets folder for... reasons.
And I also got rid of (I think) every bit of unused code and simplified stuff where I could as it was overcomplicated for no fucking reason, so it may a bit more comprehensive now.
Right and the login wasn't checking for the username correctly.
Doesn't work on phone currently... and it'll stay like that for a while too as it's not my priority. I had enough for today as it was incredibly frustrating.

But right now I'm in bliss.
And at last there is Holy Silence.

...

It's a good song, go listen to it.

First draft at porting the spirit of the WorkerConf talk to written medium

I've been offline and writing stream-of-consciousness. I haven't re-read
through to check for narrative structure, consistency or even correctness, so
I've marked as draft until I can come back to it. I know for a fact that I
haven't provided enough information for twoslash to work it's magic, for example!

I have stubbed out plans for future expansion and have no ego if anyone wants
to step in and continue before I get a chance to pick up again! It's almost
certainly worth splitting this into multiple pages before going much further.

I've changed the sequencing slightly compared to the WorkerConf talk, because I
think we can do a better job of introducing concepts one-by-one, but I'm not wedded to this sequence
by any means.

Also, a question (which I might move to Discord once I'm back online): what's
the "official" name for this library? In my writing I'd like to use
capitalisation consistently to help with understanding, i.e.:

- `effect` is a common noun, as in "This function has the effect of reading from an API"
- `Effect` is the name of the type, as in "This function returns an `Effect`."

And I'm not sure how to capitalise the name of the library in order to
distinguish from both of these uses. I'd love to call it Effect-TS or something
for clarity, but that's not what it's called! An example sentence might be "Our
function reads from an API, so we represent that effect with Effect's `Effect`"

stdenv: external gcc bootstrap

 #### Summary

By default, when you type `make`, GCC will compile itself three
times.  This PR inhibits that behavior by activating GCC's
`--disable-internal-bootstrap` flag and implements the
triple-rebuild using Nix rather than the usual `bash` madness.

 #### Immediate Benefits

- Allow `gcc11` on `aarch64`
- No more copying `libgcc_s` out of the bootstrap-files or other
  derivations
- No more [static lib{mpfr,mpc,gmp,isl}.a hack]
- *Zero* additional `gcc` builds (stage1+stage2+stageCompare)
  - The `gcc` derivation builds `gcc` once instead of three times.
  - The libraries that are linked into the final `pkgs.gcc` (`mpfr`,
    `mpc`, `gmp`, `isl`, `glibc`) are built by
    `stdenv.__bootPkgs.gcc` rather than by the `bootstrapFiles`.  No
    more Frankenstein compiler!
  - stageCompare runs **concurrently** with (not in series with) with `stdenv`'s dependees.
- Many other `stdenv` hacks eliminated.
  - `gcc` and `clang` share the same codepath for more of
    `cc-wrapper`.
  - Makes the cross and native codepaths much more similar --
    another step towards "cross by default".

Note that *all* the changes in this PR are controlled by flags; no
old codepaths need to be removed until/if we're completely certain
that this is the right way to go.

 #### Future Benefits

- This should allow using a [foreign] `bootstrap-files` so long as
  `hostPlatform.canExecute bootstrapFiles`.
- There will be an "avalanche of simplification" when we set
  `enableGccExternalBootstrap=true` and run dead code elimination.
  It's really quite a huge amount of code that goes away.
  Native-gcc has its own special codepath in so many places, while
  cross-gcc and clang work the same way (and are much simpler).
- This should allow each of the libraries that ship with `gcc`
  (`lib{backtrace, atomic, cc1, decnumber, ffi, gomp, iberty,
  offloadatomic, quadmath, sanitizer, ssp, stdc++-v3, vtv}`) to be
  built in separate (one-liner) derivations which `inherit src;`
  from `gcc`.
  - Building `libstdc++-v3` in a separate derivation will eliminate
    a lot of accidental-reference-to-the-`bootstrapFiles` landmines.

 #### Credits

This project was made possible by three important insights, none of
which were mine:

1. @ericson2314 was the first to advocate for this change, and
   probably the first to appreciate its advantages.  External bootstrap
   is "cross by default".

2. @trofi has figured out a lot about how to get gcc to not mix up
   the copy of `libstdc++` that it depends on with the copy that it
   builds.  Now that gcc is written in C++, it depends on
   `libstdc++`, builds a copy of `libstdc++`, and builds auxiliary
   products (like `libplugin`) which depend on `libstdc++`.  @trofi
   developed an technique for keeping this straight: moving the
   `bootstrapFiles`' `libstdc++` into a [versioned directory].
   Without this discovery, external bootstrap would be impossible,
   because the final gcc would still have references to the
   `bootstrapFiles`.

3. Using the undocumented variable [`user-defined-trusted-dirs`]
   when building glibc.  When glibc `dlopen()`s `libgcc_s.so`, it
   uses a completely different and totally special set of rules for
   finding `libgcc_s.so`.  This trick is the only way we can put
   `libgcc_s.so` in its own separate outpath without creating
   circular dependencies or dependencies on the bootstrapFiles.  I
   would never have guessed to use this (or that it existed!) if it
   were not for a [comment in guix] which @Mic92 [mentioned].

My own role in this PR was basically: being available to go on a
coding binge at an opportune moment, so we wouldn't waste a
[crisis].

"9:05pm. I've decided. I am going to see how the next week turns out, and after that I'll start applying to Croatian companies. Forget about pay. Think of those jobs as paid internship. I really should just start on the bottom.

There are some things I will only be able to learn by working at companies. Even if I studied ASP.NET on my own, a proper job would give me a goal to strive for, so the learning would be more effective.

9:55pm. Now I am checking out LinkedIn, and I've applied to some F# jobs, an Elixir one, and a Haskell one. It seems there are Haskell jobs out there, way more than F#.

10:25pm.

https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3477091571/?alternateChannel=search&refId=xPR2Yv5ph0Fxz%2Brm8Ga%2Fww%3D%3D&trackingId=LPIWYzxFzl1qIhWiVLHJCg%3D%3D
Haskell Developer (With Typescript experience) - MLabs

///

We are one of the leading Haskell consultancies in the fintech, blockchain and AI space, with a passion for Haskell and open source software. We are looking for a remote Haskeller to join our team.

As a Haskell Developer (With Typescript experience) your role may include:

Building and testing smart contracts, traditional applications
Helping to define best practices with new application architectures
Building tools and libraries to support application development
Working in emerging technologies
For intermediate and senior roles, systems design, formal verification, security and performance analysis

We also have roles available for project management, tech leadership and delivery management.

Requirements

Strong Haskell skills
Strong Typescript experience
Basic database knowledge
Strong software engineering and architecture skills
Strong problem solving and analytical skills
Basic knowledge of security, concurrency, backend systems, system scaling and databases
Version control (git)
Strong verbal skills in English
Experience with blockchain, smart contracts, compilers and/or purescript is a bonus

We have a variety of projects to work on at any time, ranging from payment stacks to smart contracts and blockchain to open source libraries, DSLs and compilers.

If you like Haskell and challenging projects, MLabs is the place for you, so please apply now!

///

This particular job is a very good fit for me. I applied, and forgot to emphasize my concurrency skills. But I have those on my resume. They seems to be specifically looking for FPL skills, compilers and concurrency.

10:45pm. No, that particular job was really special. There aren't Haskell opportunities just swimming around.

///

Cover letter

I actually have a lot more experience in theorem provers like Coq and Lean, and dependently typed languages like Idris and Agda than Haskell. I have Typescript experience from implementing the editor plugin for my own language. A lot of Haskell's features I've only come to understand retroactively, from studying formal proofs as well as higher kinded types and typeclasses in my own language Spiral. I do not have any experience with blockchains and smart contracts, but I do have just a bit of experience with Purescript when I studied how its VS Code extension worked. I do have years of compiler experience from working on my own language in F#.

I haven't actually considered applying to Haskell jobs until now as I prefer impure functional langs like F# in my day to day programming, but I'd very much love to work at a place where I could put my compiler skills to good use. If high level functional programming skills are what you desire, then I would be a good fit for this position.

Answers
Do you have experience with Haskell?
Yes
Do you have experience with Typescript?
Yes
Strong software engineering and architecture skills
Yes
Strong verbal skills in English
Yes
Experience with blockchain, smart contracts, compilers and/or purescript is a bonus

Check out what it is asking me. This is for an entry position, it wasn't asking for pro experience at all.

10:45pm. Forget it, I am satisfied. I'll forget about this job. Even if I do get it, I'll continue to develop my webdev skills on the side. Right now, I do not fear Haskell at all.

I need to leave it out of mind.

11pm. Forget it. Forget the hope. If I desire this job, then I won't get it. The only thing I can control is my own development.

Webdev all the way.

https://mangadex.org/chapter/ab9191d9-2981-4a58-8b37-a84818f0c615/4

Let me get back to this.

2/12/2023

10:05am. I am. I've been thinking about that Haskell job application.

But I need to leave it out of mind. It is not like it is a perfect fit. Unless I get an offer, it makes a lot more sense to study .NET web dev. You certainly wouldn't study a language like Haskell for the purpose of getting a job.

I'll admit, LinkedIn's job search is not bad at all. The only problem is that nobody is posting salaries.

https://mangadex.org/title/3eaabe03-d2bd-43f3-af71-bd1db4ab564a/serial-killer-isekai-ni-oritatsu

It seems another GB series is out. It has great art.

10:10am. Let me chill a bit. It is Sunday.

I got in on A team. I'll check it out if I do not get anything next week. I do like how LinkedIn shows the applicant number, so I know that Haskell job I applied to had zero. I should be checking out that page for F# jobs occasionally. I'd rather work at a company than be a freelancer.

10:15am. My god, how many useless job offer emails am I going to get from Adzuna? I finally figured out how to turn it off.

10:55am. Let me start. First off, let me try out the new Femto with .NET 7.

11:05am. Yeah, it works. Now I can use .NET 7 without worries about JS packages.

11:10am. Let me start studying the SAFE stack.

https://www.compositional-it.com/careers/

Let me try applying here as well.

> Note: We are currently only hiring for permanent UK-based full time staff.

Nevermind.

I wonder what is going on with LambdaFactory, as the site seems to have been broken for a while. I am yet to get a reply from Kristof in that issue I opened either. I hope everything is all right.

https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/intro/

Now I am back where I started, a lot more experienced.

11:15am. Got this on Reddit:

Edit: ...Actually let me not post the message. I do not want to be blurting out bussiness correspondence in a public place.

11:25am. I replied. Yeah, this would be best. Switzerland is a rich country so the pay here would be good. And I'd get to work with F#.

This is the third time an interested party contacted me directly. Unlike Branimir who is a middleman, and another guy who wasn't offering remote, this is for a concrete remote position. So maybe something really will happen on the job front! Maybe I am not cursed after all. Forget that Haskell position. This gives me a real reason to go forward with my SAFE Stack studies.

https://valora.digital/en/#jobs

There is nothing here.

11:40am. Nearly forgot to give him my work email. This is great. This makes posting that thing on Reddit worth it.

In terms of positions, obviously I'd most want to get an F# one. Plus unlike the Haskell one, this one is pretty vanilla, and those are well paid. If I got the Haskell position, once the crypto bubble pops, I'd just get stuck with some useless smart contract knowledge, while the web dev stuff I am learning here will be useful indefinitely.

https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/overview/

Now focus me. I've been distracted this morning, so let me take a look at the docs for a bit.

https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#tasks---giraffe-6-and-later
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/whats-new/fsharp-6#task-

> task {…} does not support asynchronous tailcalls. This means using return! .. recursively may result in stack overflows if there are no intervening asynchronous waits.

What does it mean by 'intervening'?

Anyway, it says that tasks have a lot better performance than async so that is good. But since they execute immediatelly, they are not good as Hopac promises.

https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#basics

I'll read this later, there is so much to go through in this area. It is why webdev gets paid so well.

https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-safe-commands/

> This target will deploy your application to Azure with a fully configured Application Insights instance. You do not need to pre-create any resources in Azure - the template will create everything needed, using free SKUs so you can test without any costs.

I should create an Azure account.

https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/

This is modern F#. I never knew how computation expressions could transform the language. Right now it looks quite beautiful.

The language did something good here. It went beyond my expectation. When I am adding monadic syntax to Spiral, I'll consider immitating this design of F#.

https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/feature-clientserver/

> One of the most powerful features of SAFE is the ability to seamlessly share code across client and server.

This is something I am interested in, especially for the Spiral language plugin.

12:20pm. > Lastly, Elmish.Bridge provides an alternative way of modelling client/server communication. Unlike the other two mechanisms, Elmish Bridge provides the same Elmish model on the server as well as the client, as well as the ability to send notifications from the server back to connected clients via websockets. However, the Bridge model is inherently stateful, which means that a server restart could impact all connected clients.

This might be a good fit for a language server.

1:25pm. Done with chores. Currently having breakfast.

Forget hope. Attain ambivalence. I had the right mindset last week. Next week I might see some action, but it is best to expect nothing.

I'll leave this for later. Let me just catch up with Blood Princess and then I will resume.

2:40pm. https://mangadex.org/title/62ea0d5e-b6d8-4391-a919-02d217410f18/amateur-e-girl-streaming-a-space-war
https://mangadex.org/chapter/afc6cfbd-80b2-4dee-9d94-3ac2fba4e4a8/18

This is intense. Let me finish chapter one and I will start. I have no idea where the last hour went.

2:45pm. Let me start. I need to resume improving my webdev skills. First let me finish going through the docs.

https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/feature-clientserver-remoting/

https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Fable.Remoting/#/advanced/raw-http-communication

2:55pm. The docs here are pretty thorough. As somebody studying this for the first time, it gives me confidence to dive in properly.

3pm.

///

When to use Elmish.Bridge
There are many scenarios where it makes sense to use Elmish.Bridge:

Chat-like applications with many connected users through many channels
Syncing price data in real-time while viewing ticket prices
Multiplayer games that need real-time update of game states
Other applications of web sockets through an Elmish model

///

3:15pm. https://github.com/Nhowka/Elmish.Bridge

Damn there is a lot of stuff here.

https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/feature-ssr/

Oh this is a thing too.

3:25pm. When I am done with the docs here, before I dive into the examples, I will take the time to learn how to debug F# in VS Code. Both Fable and CLR.

https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/learning/

Here are the samples.

3:40pm. Focus me. Let me finally do some programming. I'll leave the samples for later.

For off, let me figure out how to debug a console app.

3:45pm. .NET Extension Pack. I am looking at this plugin.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode

This is interesting. So it is like Jupiter Notebooks for .NET.

I've gotten distracted.

https://ionide.io/Editors/Code/getting_started.html

Here it talks about debugging.

https://ionide.io/sponsors.html

One of the sponsors for this is Binary Defense. I found that on LinkedIn and applied to it yesterday.

3:55pm. I hadn't realized that the paket plugin I had installed is in fact one for Ionide.

4pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgtye7ciueE
F# Basics 003 - Debugging F# Applications in VS Code

Let me just watch this video.

https://youtu.be/cgtye7ciueE?t=249

F5?

https://youtu.be/cgtye7ciueE?t=290

This is cool. This reminds me a bit of how I debugged Typescript plugins for VS Code. I've forgotten how to do that by now.

https://youtu.be/cgtye7ciueE?t=343

Ok, it makes sense to me now. I admit, I didn't understand conceptually how debugging should work, but now it is super obvious that it should just build the executable and then run it separately.

Let me try getting this to work.

> VSCode C# plugin (optional) - Ionide's debugging capabilities relies on the debugger provided by Omnisharp team. To get it install

Now focus me. Oh, it is already installed.

4:15pm. https://youtu.be/cgtye7ciueE?t=247

Hrmmmm...I am confused.

When I press F5 this does not show up for me. The C# plugin is already installed. So what am I supposed to do?

Let me try a C# project.

4:40pm. Ok, I figured it out. The editor is acting a bit weird. The shortcut for running without debugging does not work for some reason, and run without debugging does not have a shortcut.

I think that once I press F# and select the Ionide launch settings, it should add to the launch settings automatically, but for some reason that is not happening now.

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": ".NET Core Launch (console)",
            "type": "coreclr",
            "request": "launch",
            "preLaunchTask": "Build: qwe.fsproj",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/net7.0/qwe.dll",
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "console": "internalConsole"
        }
    ]
}
```

Anyway, I just have to add something like this, which can be easily done automatically from the `Run and Debug` tab. Selecting the Ionide launch settings from there makes it work.

```json
{
	"version": "2.0.0",
	"tasks": [
		{
			"type": "msbuild",
			"problemMatcher": [
				"$msCompile"
			],
			"group": "build",
			"label": "Build: qwe.fsproj",
			"detail": "Build the qwe.fsproj project using dotnet build"
		}
	]
}
```

Then in tasks, I have to add this. I had to change the label from `build` to `Build: qwe.fsproj`.

But now I can debug easily.

4:45pm. Figuring that out took a bit longer than it should have.

https://youtu.be/cgtye7ciueE?t=447

Let me just watch this for a bit, as I think what comes next. Next I should figure out how to debug the Elmish and SAFE Stack apps.

https://github.com/CompositionalIT/fable-debugging

Forget the video, let me just try this.

https://github.com/CompositionalIT/fable-debugging/blob/master/.vscode/launch.json

https://github.com/CompositionalIT/fable-debugging/blob/master/.vscode/tasks.json

This is not straightforward at all.

5:05pm. https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/recipes/developing-and-testing/debug-safe-app/

Here it has instructions.

5:10pm. Let me take a short break here. This bogglign my mind. I'll start a Safe Stack template and go from there.

5:20pm. Focus me.

```
Fake.Core.BuildFailedException: Target 'InstallClient' failed.
 ---> System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. (Process exit code '1' <> 0. Command Line: C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs\npm.CMD install)
 ---> System.Exception: Process exit code '1' <> 0. Command Line: C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs\npm.CMD install
```

I remember having this error before. What was it? I remember the SAFE stack installation failing. I even opened some issue somewhere.

5:30pm. That was for the Ionide repo.

https://youtu.be/UxtHE9dfd-Q
SAFE Stack Debugging in VS Code

Let me watch this. At this level of complexity, it is too much of a pain in the ass to understand what is going on anymore. The instructions on the main site are somewhat unclear. Youtube videos are better for situations like these as I can exactly observe what is going on.

https://youtu.be/UxtHE9dfd-Q?t=47

Here, he is debugging the client directly.

There are no instructions as to how to do this.

5:45pm. Let me start off more simply.

https://github.com/CompositionalIT/fable-debugging

Let me clone this and follow the instructions. The safe stack is too much.

5:50pm. https://github.com/CompositionalIT/fable-debugging

This is really out of date. I'll ask the F# sub.

6:25pm. Done with lunch.

///

I've trued running [this](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/fable-debugging) and it seems like it is out of date. There was a great demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgtye7ciueE) how to debug SAFE Stack apps from VS Code, but I can't find anything more on that. There are [instructions](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/recipes/developing-and-testing/debug-safe-app/) on the SAFE Stack site, but I find it weird how in the client section it says to place the breakpoints in the generated JS when both the video and the repo I linked to put it in the F# code.

Also, given the passage of time, I am not sure that the instructions in the SAFE docs are valid anymore. In step two, it just say to update the program, but adding a configuration offers me a dozen different options first.

///

Let me back this up here. Let me redo it.

///

I've trued running [this](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/fable-debugging) and it seems like it is out of date. Years ago, there was a [great demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgtye7ciueE) how to debug SAFE Stack apps from VS Code, but I can't find anything more on that. There are [instructions](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/recipes/developing-and-testing/debug-safe-app/) on the SAFE Stack site, but I've tried them and can't get them to work. They seem to be out of date.

At any rate, I find VS Code tasks and lunch configurations very unintuitive, and I do not understand exactly how the debugger is attached to the process. VS Code seems to be buggy at the moment, but I got regular CLR program debugging with Ionide to work. I am yet to succeed at making it work for Fable programs, let alone SAFE Stack applications. A SAFE Stack applications runs the client and the server on two separate processes and I am not sure where to even begin in getting that to work.

Any advice?

I am just going through the list here, I do not actually use debuggers all that much in my programming practice. Still, this does feel like something I should know how to do if I am to be a web dev.

///

6:40pm. https://www.reddit.com/r/fsharp/comments/110la01/how_to_debug_fable_and_safe_stack_applications/

I am tired at this point in the day. I'll just toss the ball in Reddit's court and see what the replies are tomorrow. Those guys are knowledgeable.

Either way, tomorrow I am going to study the SAFE Stack examples. After that I'll start making my own web applications. Just studying things is tedious, practical experience is always the best.

It feels like the upcoming interviews are rushing me. I need to cultivate a calm mind and demeanor. Tomorrow morning, it is bath time. Then I will study the example. Any interviews will have to wait for the rest of the week.

https://youtu.be/cgtye7ciueE?t=626

Oh wait, here he is talking about debugging a web application.

https://youtu.be/cgtye7ciueE?t=859

This is just debugging a .NET Core web app. The server part is that, but how would I attach the debugger to the output of a FAKE script?

6:55pm. Let me close here for the day. Tomorrow, I'll put the debugging adventure and get closer to being able to work on my own projects.

That Haskell job post and today's Reddit PM by the Valora got my hopes up. That is not good. Having my hopes up about getting a good job is like having hopes about the stock you are owning going up. It is a huge drain to even think about it. When you can accept whatever comes without cheering it on in your mind, that is when you can be considered mature. I have ways to go.

Whether I get any calls next week, whether I get ghosted, or whether I get an offer, or whether I get contract work...

That is in the hands of fate. It is my duty to accept things as they come.

My duty is to sleep soundly at night and work hard during the day."

Syndicate Bomb Core Payloads Can Only Be Triggered via the Bomb (#72986)

## About The Pull Request

Basically, you can't extract the bomb core, slap a 10-second c4 on it/on
the shell/and run off having triggered an incredibly powerful explosion.
This is accomplished by having the syndicate bomb override ex_act (it
will be deleted if the explosion goes off), as well as the payload
itself being subtyped into something resistant to bombs and burning.

In-universe, this is described as the shell being quite resistant to
forms of external explosive force- but if any explosive force comes from
within the bomb's shell: kabloom. The bombcore itself has been
redesigned (in a rare moment of non-ineptude) by Donk Co., who has
redesigned the bomb core payload from the ground up- meaning that it can
only be detonated electronically by an impulse from the bomb machinery.
Cutting the wrong wire and attempting to get rid of the bomb by hitting
it with an axe or something will still cause it to blow up, but you know
how those things can be.
## Why It's Good For The Game

I feel like the point of the syndicate bomb is to be a threat for the
crew to match up against. I want a clown in bomb squad gear to head out
to the site and sweat trying to figure out which wire it is, until....
KA-BLHONK: red mist. Or, I want some "helpful" assistant to interrupt
someone's session by going "I KNOW WHAT WIRE IT IS", and having those
odds of either blowing everyone around them up or actually saving the
day.

Being able to detonate something that was balanced and designed to have
_at least_ one minute and a half in **10 SECONDS** is just so injurious
to the game. You can buy a shitload of these bombs, extract the cores,
slap c4 on it and go around the station doling out some serious
explosions. You can run into medbay, wrench it down, slap a c4 on it AND
NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! They can't cut wires, they can't figure
it out to save the day, all they can do is run. Running from danger is
fine and acceptable, but it's just completely stacked against the crew
in a way that I feel needs to be rectified somehow.

I like the idea of purposefully fucking with the wires on the spot so
you sacrificially kill everyone, that feels quite fair to me. I just
simply don't like the fact that you can waltz around the station
punching huge gaps in the hull (remember, putting c4 on the bomb core
itself would cause it to go kabloom) with nearly nothing as far as risk.
It's way too rewarding for something very easy to accomplish (there's a
reason why it's 90 seconds- it's not meant to be easy to accomplish).

This doesn't affect base bombcore behavior, just the explodey ones that
come standard in syndicate bombs.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: After an unfortunate event occuring when some nuclear
operatives took the ship to a Fireworks Store, the Syndicate have
re-engineered their bomb cores to only explode when electronically
triggered by the bomb shell itself. The payload inside a standard
syndicate bomb can not be exploded with another explosion, you must keep
it in the bomb machinery for it to actually do some explodey stuff.

## [amjoseph-nixpkgs/nixpkgs](https://github.com/amjoseph-nixpkgs/nixpkgs)@[f2b4b06d21...](https://github.com/amjoseph-nixpkgs/nixpkgs/commit/f2b4b06d2176aa9620cfede6e049a1bd110ca8a2)
#### Sunday 2023-02-12 18:44:24 by Adam Joseph

By default, when you type `make`, GCC will compile itself three
times.  This PR inhibits that behavior by activating GCC's
`--disable-internal-bootstrap` flag and implements the
triple-rebuild using Nix rather than `make`/`sh`.

This project was made possible by three important insights, none of
which were mine:

1. @ericson2314 was the first to advocate for this change, and
   probably the first to appreciate its advantages.  External bootstrap
   is "cross by default".

2. @trofi has figured out a lot about how to get gcc to not mix up
   the copy of `libstdc++` that it depends on with the copy that it
   builds.  Now that gcc is written in C++, it depends on
   `libstdc++`, builds a copy of `libstdc++`, and builds auxiliary
   products (like `libplugin`) which depend on `libstdc++`.  @trofi
   developed an technique for keeping this straight: moving the
   `bootstrapFiles`' `libstdc++` into a [versioned directory].
   Without this discovery, external bootstrap would be impossible,
   because the final gcc would still have references to the
   `bootstrapFiles`.

3. Using the undocumented variable [`user-defined-trusted-dirs`]
   when building glibc.  When glibc `dlopen()`s `libgcc_s.so`, it
   uses a completely different and totally special set of rules for
   finding `libgcc_s.so`.  This trick is the only way we can put
   `libgcc_s.so` in its own separate outpath without creating
   circular dependencies or dependencies on the bootstrapFiles.  I
   would never have guessed to use this (or that it existed!) if it
   were not for a [comment in guix] which @Mic92 [mentioned].

My own role in this PR was basically: being available to go on a
coding binge at an opportune moment, so we wouldn't waste a
[crisis].

Other than formatting, the commit message is identical to this
github comment, except that this sentence is ommitted from the
commit and its enclosing section appears at the end, rather than the
beginning.

- Allow `gcc11` on `aarch64`
- No more copying `libgcc_s` out of the bootstrap-files or other
  derivations
- No more [static lib{mpfr,mpc,gmp,isl}.a hack]
- *Zero* additional `gcc` builds (stage1+stage2+stageCompare)
  - The `gcc` derivation builds `gcc` once instead of three times.
  - The libraries that are linked into the final `pkgs.gcc` (`mpfr`,
    `mpc`, `gmp`, `isl`, `glibc`) are built by
    `stdenv.__bootPkgs.gcc` rather than by the `bootstrapFiles`.  No
    more Frankenstein compiler!
  - stageCompare runs **concurrently** with (not in series with)
    with `stdenv`'s dependees.
- Many other `stdenv` hacks eliminated.
  - `gcc` and `clang` share the same codepath for more of
    `cc-wrapper`.
  - Makes the cross and native codepaths much more similar --
    another step towards "cross by default".

Note that *all* the changes in this PR are controlled by flags; no
old codepaths need to be removed until/if we're completely certain
that this is the right way to go.

- This should allow using a [foreign] `bootstrap-files` so long as
  `hostPlatform.canExecute bootstrapFiles`.
- There will be an "avalanche of simplification" when we set
  `enableGccExternalBootstrap=true` and run dead code elimination.
  It's really quite a huge amount of code that goes away.
  Native-gcc has its own special codepath in so many places, while
  cross-gcc and clang work the same way (and are much simpler).
- This should allow each of the libraries that ship with `gcc`
  (`lib{backtrace, atomic, cc1, decnumber, ffi, gomp, iberty,
  offloadatomic, quadmath, sanitizer, ssp, stdc++-v3, vtv}`) to be
  built in separate (one-liner) derivations which `inherit src;`
  from `gcc`.
  - Building `libstdc++-v3` in a separate derivation will eliminate
    a lot of accidental-reference-to-the-`bootstrapFiles` landmines.

Simplify with-google-analytics example (#43894)

<!--
Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.
To make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that
you follow the checklist sections below.
Choose the right checklist for the change that you're making:
-->
## Documentation / Examples

- [x] Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`
- [x] The "examples guidelines" are followed from [our contributing
doc](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md)

First of all thanks for this amazing project and all the help you
provide with these examples.

It seems there is code duplication in this example. After some tests
locally seem to _document.js is not necessary for `gtag` to work
properly.


https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/9d97a1e34a8a6e09eb127292c730d1a8df63ebb6/examples/with-google-analytics/pages/_app.js#L30-L34


https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/9d97a1e34a8a6e09eb127292c730d1a8df63ebb6/examples/with-google-analytics/pages/_document.js#L13-L17

I am aware of https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/40645 and I would
like to ask @dave-hay, @SukkaW and @ijjk to consider this is still
necessary. If so why then not move all content of the scripts from _app
to _document?

In any case, I am open to adding here some comments explaining what is
the reason for this code duplication if necessary.

<hr/>

Changes that come from  https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/43897

1. The `event` hashChangeComplete should be removed since `/home` and
`/home/#section` is not new pageview, but just reference to the same
page.

If we go from /home to /home/#section (with a button click or a link for
example) this shouldn't trigger a new page visit on `gtag`.

For this reason, I think we should revert the changes from
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/36079. If there is a better
argument of why this should stay I am also open to creating comments to
clarify this on the example since I don't think should be the default
behavior and not useful in most cases.

2. The `id="gtag-init"` was added with no context to the example from
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/29530

If there is a reason for this id in the script to existing I am open to
adding a comment that clarifies this since in my experience is not
necessary at all.


Edit: Batching with https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/43897 as
recommended by
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/43897#issuecomment-1344635000

Refactors crew records (#72725)

I have attempted or otherwise started this project at least 4 times. I
am sick of it being on my calendar. The code needs it. I need it.

- This makes crew records a proper datum rather than assigning
properties record.fields.
- General, medical, and security records are merged.
- Did some slight refactoring here and there for things that looked
obvious.
- Wanted states are now defined (and you can suspect someone through
sechud)
- pAI (unrelated but annoying) had some poorly named exported types that
i made more specific
- Job icons are moved back to the JS side (I wanted to get icons for
initial rank without passing trim)

NPX TSC

Super awesome!!! This is what I've been hoping to be able to do for a while now. Rather than using a 'devDependencies' install of a library you may need, turns out it's what npx is for, you can run any given library from npm with one command, and it will first look to see if you have it globally installed. And if not, it will cache a copy of it on your machine, and use that to run the command directly. I really like this, since I don't have to install TypeScript multiple times around. On my 16 GB Linuxbook, there's not as much extra room to have TypeScript installed 5 times, for all of my projects. This makes it so your commonly-used dependency toolchains only have to be saved in one place, and npm will scout those out for you and use them wherever they are! :D

Started looking into this when adding the `npm run dev` script for `tsc -w`, and I wasn't sure whether you had to use `npx` or anything special like that. So glad I stumbled across what npx is for! Ooooh!!!

This is going to make things like working on Electron apps much more performant, for the dev setup at least (maybe, just and idea :) ).

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50605219/difference-between-npx-and-npm
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68719700/does-running-an-npm-package-with-npx-cause-devdependencies-to-get-installed

I'm also going to start using end-of-file new lines more often, as that seems to be the standard in most cases. npm adds it automatically to the `package-lock.json` after every `npm install` and I was manually removing it myself so it didn't mess up and Git changes. That's been super annoying, so I'm going to get myself to like end-of-file new lines so I don't have to worry about it anymore, haha. It seems to be the standard over in Linux/Unix land too, so I think it's smart to start getting used to it being the normal thing to expect.

Refactors crew records (#72725)

## About The Pull Request
I have attempted or otherwise started this project at least 4 times. I
am sick of it being on my calendar. The code needs it. I need it.

- This makes crew records a proper datum rather than assigning
properties record.fields.
- General, medical, and security records are merged.
- Did some slight refactoring here and there for things that looked
obvious.
- Wanted states are now defined (and you can suspect someone through
sechud)
- pAI (unrelated but annoying) had some poorly named exported types that
i made more specific
- Job icons are moved back to the JS side (I wanted to get icons for
initial rank without passing trim)

[jak2] improve loader for jak 2 levels (#2206)

Add a debug window for the loader to show levels and fix an issue with
jak 2 level unloading. I never really thought about how this works for >
2 levels, and there is a chance that you could unload the wrong level in
some cases.

The problem is some combination of merc-only levels not counting toward
the "in use" detection, and the unloader ignoring what the game wants to
load.

I don't remember why using merc models doesn't contribute to "in use"
but I'm afraid to change this for jak 1. Instead, we can have the
unloader avoid unloading levels that the game is telling us are loaded.
This is what we should have done originally, but there was a time when
Jak 1 didn't tell the loader anything, and we had this stupid detection
thing.

I think this is the first step toward just getting rid of the "in use"
detection and trusting the game for everything.

feat: Pipelines are now versioned

In order to eventually have canary-able deployments in Gofer we must
first support versioned pipelines.

This allows us to:
* Have a good target in which to roll back and forward.
* Understand what we are gaining and losing on each change.
* Track each update as it happens.

This is not easy though as pipelines have parts which are easy to version
(namely the config) and parts which are much harder to version (how do
we handle the cutting over of triggers?).

Because of this nuance, we've had to redesign a lot of earlier
assumptions for how Gofer models worked. This was a major refactor and
since I was here I made a few other large sweeping changes.

* Full storage package refactor: The storage layer was hard to use,
brittle, and inflexible. I've refactored it, leaning a bit more on
sqlx and going back to basics. I tried to make the storage package
work in the past by keeping the domain models to a minimum. I've since
learned this does not work once things become reasonably complicated. One
of the main refactors to the storage package is the introduction of
dedicated storage models. This means that I have to write a bunch of
boilerplate code to switch from in-memory models to the storage ones,
but the looser coupling is worth it. More storage refactors coming
as I learn what works at large scale and what doesn't.
https://github.com/go-jet/jet looks interesting.

* Removal of Triggers as Pipeline configuration: I desparately wanted
to have pipeline configurations encompass everything a pipeline would
have to offer, so that it was easy to look at a config and know exactly
what was going on in a particular pipeline. Triggers were a pain in the
ass though. Triggers unfortunately occupy a very special place in Gofer's
archetecture. Without triggers nothing really gets done. And so allowing
the user to apply all the same functionality to triggers as they would
with any other deployment was short-sighted. Triggers don't make a lot
of sense as a canary deployment. Triggers aren't ephemeral, they are
either on or their off. No in-between.

Instead Triggers can now be added to your pipeline via the command line.
This way trigger subscriptions aren't held down by the paradigms of
configuration change.

* Pipelines are now versioned: Not only have we added versions to pipelines,
but they now have deployments and configurations and metadata and a lot
of smaller loosely coupled parts so that they aren't a huge data monolith.
This means a lot of breaking changes for outward (and inward for that matter)
apis.

* Just lots of general breakages everywhere: Pretty much a large percentage
of things just aren't the same anymore.
