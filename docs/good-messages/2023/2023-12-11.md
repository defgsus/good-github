Removes an exploit that can farm Russian revolver moodlets, adds Russian revolvers to the contraband section of games vendors (#80159)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/80158 by making
curses block you from playing Russian roulette regardless of whether or
not there's a live bullet in your Russian revolver's chamber.

A Russian revolver has been added to the contraband section of each Good
Clean Fun vendor.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The bug is incredibly funny, but ~~I want GBP~~ probably should be
fixed.

There's no actual way to get (more) Russian revolvers outside of the
mapstart ones, and that can be a bit stifling to gimmicks that involve
them. And Russian roulette IS a game.

Like the roundstart ones, you could unload these vendor revolvers for
.357 bullets, but you can already just print .357 bullets from a hacked
autolathe directly, so I don't think that's an issue.

## Changelog

:cl: ATHATH
fix: Spacemen can no longer use curses to cheat at Russian roulette by
selectively blocking attempts to shoot themselves.
add: A Russian revolver has been added to the contraband section of each
Good Clean Fun vendor.

Ports feral cats and feral cat grenades from Hippie (#80031)

## About The Pull Request
Feral Cats are just a hostile variant of cats that will fuck you up if
they see you. They are added solely for the sake of feral cat grenades -
a new, interesting, and fuzzy way to get out of a jam or just wreak
havoc around you. Each one costs 5 TC and spawns 5 really pissed off
cats to chase down assistants in the hallway.

They don't currently ignore traitors or the person who threw them - I
haven't worked out how to do that with our faction system (Hippie gave
them the syndicate faction but traitors don't get that on our codebase).
If anyone wants to contribute or help me suss that out it'll be cool,
otherwise just don't be around if there's nobody else for them to maul.

## Why It's Good For The Game
They're funny.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
add: Added a new hostile variant of cats, "feral cats".
add: Added a new traitor item, "feral cat grenades". For 5 TC, you too
can throw a grenade at someone and make five cats maul them to death.

[MIRROR] Balance changes to swords, energy shields and modsuit shields. [MDB IGNORE] (#25531)

* Balance changes to swords, energy shields and modsuit shields. (#80072)

## About The Pull Request

### Sword Weaponry

Mundane sword weapons of all sorts do not block ``LEAP_ATTACK`` attacks
whatsoever. These attacks include tackles, xeno tackles and bodythrows.

Energy swords and double energy swords only gain 25% block probability
against such attacks.

### Double Energy Sword

No longer grants outright energy projectile immunity while employed.
Instead, it just has a high probability of reflecting (the typical 75%
to block any other attack). So, very solid defense against energy
projectiles, but not immunity.

Against non-reflectable projectiles, like ballistics or nanite bullets,
the desword only has 50% block, similar to an energy sword.

To compensate for the loss of defensive power, we'll make it all the
more rewarding for getting on top of someone with the sword by giving it
40 force while active. And also it costs 13 TC.

### Combat Energy Shield

This also lost outright energy projectile immunity, but gained the
standard blocking power of shields on top of the ability to reflect
energy projectiles when they block them. This significantly increases
the shields potential effectiveness while no longer pigeonholing the
shield to only energy weapons. (This makes them exceptionally good
against tackles and body throws, by the by).

Deathsquads still have the perfect deflection energy shield so that they
can continue to spam pulse shots with impunity.

### MODsuit Shield Module

Only has one charge instead of three, but it recharges in half the time.
This is no longer such a perfect defense, and does somewhat need you to
be thinking about how you're utilizing the shield rather than not
thinking about defense at all by barreling forward under three potential
hits worth of protection.

Also much cheaper, at almost half price of 8 TC. Because of how cheap it
is (and how much it still is necessary to keep you alive), I've put it
into the core equipment box (which brings the price up to 22 TC. As a
reminder, this is not meant to be at any discount, and is more aimed
towards teaching newer players which items contribute towards success.
If you don't want all the times within, don't buy this box, just buy
what you want separately.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

This is a doozy of an explanation, I hope you're ready for it under the
spoiler.
<details>
With my tackling and bodythrow prs, numerous people expressed
exasperation at the fact that these two tools may have been keeping some
outlier antagonist gear from becoming too easy to steamroll with if you
already knew what you were doing. My intent was to create consistent
rules and behaviours that both A) did not rely on bugs to keep the
balance of power from tipping one way or the other, and B) was at least
consistent or had consistent rules established.

This PR is tackling overperforming gear combinations for already
competent nukies that may have, over time, crept out of control, and
applying some consistency to the rules around similar equipment.

AND also deals with quite possibly the most braindead element of game
design we've tolerated for about a decade, and half a decade after it
was necessary to maintain that decision.

Part of the culprit of this issue is that, specifically in regards to
nukies, crew can't use the vast majority of their weapons effectively
against them. This largely is because this antagonist can gain
immunities to those types of equipment. And that is rapidly increasing
as we move closer towards outright ballistic removal. I don't think the
game is made healthier by everyone on the station having to fight armed
mercenaries with spears, and doesn't make much thematic sense either.
More so, most greener players probably just don't know this is how it
works, and so surprise Pikachu when their lasers bounce off nukies
harmlessly. (This bit reminds me of the problem of new players using
disablers against simple mobs)

But of course, that isn't the only part of the problem. The other half
is due to being able to be layered on a much more broad defensive tool
in the form of the MODsuit Shield Module, whose three charges could
render the mindful nukie near untouchable if they're pairing it with
some other layered defense, such as a desword. Notice that this doesn't
really address armor. The culprit is negation, and not mitigation, and
we should be sparing in how easily we hand out outright effect negation
simply because it isn't super obvious to a new player why it happened,
and how to resolve it. At the very least, we should look to find ways to
add options for players to overcome these problems. Especially with
teamwork.

Energy projectile immunity made sense while there floated around an
energy projectile that ostensibly would down you in a single shot.
Nukies ALSO had projectile weapons that worked much the same (c-20r stun
bullets, taser shot bulldogs, etc.), so it was predominantly
tit-for-tat. These immunity granting equipment pieces forced crew
members to get shotguns and ballistic guns to fight these dangers;
something more available at the time.

We've exercised large bits and pieces of this from the game a long time
ago, but we still have some remnants convinced we're still in a
taser-rich, ballistic available environment. We need to move the games
languishing tools into the modern era and re-established their place in
the game. Namely, the double-energy sword and the combat energy shield
are almost entirely unchanged besides refactors for the last decade or
so, even while the game around them have changed. They've been a
continuous sore point for me in all my time developing and a constant
nagging issue. I want to deal with it now.

MODsuit Shield Module is just kind of really good and only made stronger
the more defenses you have. It's good to have a defense like this, but I
think it is too brain dead. With only one charge, it will save you from
a lost joust here and there, but it won't make it as simple as running
right at every problem you encounter and eating a volley of attacks
while you kill someone with impunity.

**With regards to traitors**, since they also get double-energy swords;
I'm open to suggestions if this is hitting them far too hard, but I'm
not terribly concerned using this weapon for a few reasons. **Firstly**,
I think their presence amongst the crew make it a much better weapon for
tots than nukies (in isolation) simply because they can find ways to
exploit it via tools they gather from the station. It is a force
multiplier. Traitors also have a much bigger element of surprise
usually. **Secondly**, round-start traitors typically grow to be a bit
stronger over time, but I don't foresee many waiting to pay for the
double-energy sword unless they're already flush with TC. So if a
traitor is in a position after they've unlocked access to it to buy one
of these, they are probably doing pretty okay for themselves.
</details>

### TL;DR

Defense stacking and attack immunities are not particularly healthy
things to both design around, or experience in-game. They are kind of
just relics of the past made only sorer once I ripped off a few
bandaids. This is a source of a number of symptomatic issues in the
game, so let's fix that and make it easier on all of us going forward.

Much of the way these things worked operated on extremely outdated
design considerations. It doesn't make sense for them to work like this
today, and only makes things harder by keeping the status quo.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Mundane sword-like and medieval weapons are not able to block
tackles, xenomorph tackles and body throws.
balance: The double-energy sword and energy sword have trouble blocking
physical projectiles, body throws and tackles.
balance: The double-energy sword also no longer has guaranteed energy
projectile deflection; only doing so on a successful block (75% chance
to block).
balance: But it does have 40 force now, so it is more lethal a weapon.
Traitors can purchase the sword for only 13 TC (down from 16 TC).
balance: The combat energy shield (The one you hold) now functions as a
normal shield (it used to only protect you against energy projectiles
and nothing else). It loses guaranteed energy projectile deflection, but
still reflects the projectile so on a block.
feature: Death commandos continue to have their energy shields deflect
all incoming energy projectiles. Because who cares about deathsquads
being balanced?
balance: The MODsuit shield module only has one charge, but recharges
every 10 seconds. It also costs 8 TC (down from 15). It is also now in
the Core Gear beginner box (bringing the total price up to 22 TC).

Active/Passive Setup Error

Not working, and it appears to be because of the implementation itself, not my new version of the code. The old demo no longer works either, looking into it! I should have tried that out before starting this one, to ensure that it would work still hehe. Of course that was the issue. Well, hey, got the React parts of this all sorted out, heck yeah!

Asked ChatGPT for help, it was sort of helpful, but it's response to my question was a little hallucinated.

Been having trouble implementing WebRTC in the browser with my TypeScript React code
How can I resolve this issue?
```
Failed to set remote answer sdp: Failed to apply the description for m= section with mid='3': Answerer must use either active or passive value for setup attribute.
```

Listening to Scopes, lossless. It's much better than the YouTube upload. Even the ugly part!!

Officially added Devin Townsend Infinity to my collection! Might go next to Mike Keneally Hat., and possible Empath. Don't want to go crazy with so much at once though. But, then again, that seems to have worked out really nice for me too. New music really does help with inspiration and keeping a clear head.

I installed `@types/node` for Vite's type checking. Should one enable `skipLibCheck: true` for any Vite project? I kind of don't like that it means you don't get checking on your own `.d.ts` files though, seems like a meh trade-off.

Replaces prettierx with the normal prettier (#80189) (#25538) (#1065)

* Replaces prettierx with the normal prettier (#80189)

Oh god the file diff... I'm so, so sorry.

No need to worry though. This just replaces the prettierx version that
we were using and replaces it with normal prettier. Most of the settings
were default or no longer valid with this version.
You no longer get this warning #70484

It actually drives me up the wall and I have to click it each time I
open my editor.

[MIRROR] Changes to the lore of Knock [MDB IGNORE] (#24891)

* Changes to the lore of Knock (#79542)

## About The Pull Request

This PR renames Knock to Lock, and changes most of the knowledge gain
lore.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The Knock Lore, is based on the Knock Principle from Cultist Simulator,
with the path description being copied from the wiki. Many other
keywords and concepts are fully lifted from that game (Locksmith's
Secret, Mother Of Ants, etc). In my vision, if a heretic path has to be
based on a principle from cultist simulator, it should have its own
spin, and also, the knowledge gain texts should tell a story. For
example, Ash tells the story of a watchman burning down their city after
being betrayed, and Cosmic is a love story between a knowledge seeker
and a monster from the beyond.

So I have decided to reflavour Knock. I have changed the name to Lock,
so at least it would feel similar, just like how Blade is akin to Edge.
Many powers also block people or confuse their paths instead of opening
new ways, and thus, I feel a path whose name implies that it *both*
opens and closes would be more self describing.

I have changed most of its lore to be about the Locked Labyrinth, where
knowledge seekers willingly trap themselves and submit themselves to
servitude to find ultimate freedom by progressing through its trials.
These are the Stewards, who are basically workers in an infinite and
malicious hotel in their dreams. Consider them assistants if you will
(this wasn't my intention when I wrote the lore, but thinking about it
in retrospect, it honestly fits). In the implied story, the heretic
joins their ranks, but keeps getting closer to the more corrupt members,
along with parasitic spirits. Ultimately, they manage to open the
Labyrinth's core, letting out the Stewards, allowing them to manifest in
the forms of heretic summon creatures.

The side path spells and the lock knowledge ritual I have not touched,
they were fine. Some items have been renamed and repathed.

I have kept the distinctive sound effect for using the Grasp, as its
unique enough. Though if someone did have a nice sound effect for
turning a lock and added some filters, I would add it.

**DB Issue**

I have renamed the achievement's define to MEDAL_LOCK_ASCENSION but kept
the value as "Knock", as I don't know how trigger a change in the DB. If
this is a blocking change, I'll try to figure out how to make a
migration file.

**Future improvements**

I would also come back later with another PR, that hands out names to
the eldritch beings spawned by the portal, based on the Stewards in the
knowledge gain lore that I added, along with some new ones that fit the
theme, and some jokey ones like Minotaur.

## Changelog

:cl:
spellcheck: Renamed Knock to Locks, and changed most of the flavor text
of knowledge gain, and renamed some items and knowledges from the path.

[MIRROR] Changes Virology Rather Than Killing It [MDB IGNORE] (#25483)

* Changes Virology Rather Than Killing It (#79854)

## About The Pull Request
God, alright, here we go. See HackMD here:
https://hackmd.io/@ Higgin/HJljdBuNp

Alternative proposal to #79849 addressing the big problems with
virology. ~~If you need a HackMD for it, I'll put one together, but I
made a comment on that PR and can make it pretty simple here.~~ its done

1. Makes viruses eventually self-cure as long as you're alive. If you
can keep somebody from dying, they can develop immunity.
2. Makes it so you can sleep comfortably and be well-fed to slow and
even potentially defeat viruses without a cure.
3. Makes it so more dangerous viruses can start self-curing faster. This
means Space Ebola is going to burn itself out quicker if a person stays
alive from the other effects.
4. Makes spaceacillin helpful in naturally curing viruses, period, but
with declining effectiveness over 100 cycles.
5. Makes it so curing a virus naturally without being well-fed or having
rode it out from the peak may allow you to be reinfected/not have
natural immunity.
6. Makes it so being well-fed is a much stronger protection against
random virus spread.
7. Makes it so bypasses_immunity stuff like fungal TB and heart failure
isn't subject to any of this.
8. Makes it so using ~~antibiotics~~ spaceacillin jesus christ or being
malnourished can make you lose your healing viruses too. Pay attention
to what you put in your body.
9. ** Makes it so blood can ~~transmit resistances again, not just
vaccines. It's been a hot minute, but it used to work like this.~~ blood
now can cure a virus if the donor has a resistance, but it doesn't
confer lasting immunity. You need to overcome the virus yourself, carry
a constant supply of pure blood, or get a vaccine to get a lasting fix.
10. ** makes severity a function of disease stats and all active
symptoms - not just the highest severity of the active symptoms.
11. ** makes it so you can nosell symptoms firing with spaceacillin or
resting down to a minimum chance of cure_chance to avoid symptoms each
cycle, declining over time, over 100 cycles for a given disease.
12. ** makes it so wearing protective equipment prevents you from
spreading respiratory-spread diseases normally - not just on the
cough/sneezing symptoms.
13. ** gives MDs virology access standard, paramedics and coroners
virology access on skeleton crew. virologists also get pharmacy access.
14. ** makes bypasses_immunity advanced diseases always override
non-bypasses_immunity advanced diseases and resist being overridden by
other advanced diseases. Sentient Disease now has bypasses_immunity.
Sentient Disease fans rejoice!
15. ** also gives SD a buffer of extra stealth points so it has a bit
longer to build up instead of almost uniformly getting spotted and dying
early.
16. ** viruses now scale their severity as a function of their max
symptoms. There's a lot more room to get viruses of varying duration and
severity by adding fewer symptoms now - so creating a tradeoff between
stats (and good thresholds) and the duration of your virus.
17. ** a whole bunch of defines to control all of this stuff - most
recently added a multiplier for symptom appearance frequency.

MAJOR UPDATES: REBALANCING TOWARDS 50% LETHALITY

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ8rqMYFsR1mYj_FGzVjTfcnAF7un-VofOByPxcCCQr6lOOF5fhUgZga0oA4Q5-7K4hr7fCV0jFdmd9/pubhtml#
[Viro Rework Rebalance
Tests.pdf](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/files/13447208/Viro.Rework.Rebalance.Tests.pdf)

After a shitload of testing, makes some of the most reliable,
transmissible killers into less-reliable threats. See the above graphs
and pictures for demonstrations of exactly how this was tested and done.

## Why It's Good For The Game

It sucks to be hard-stuck to needing chemistry and medical to deal with
viruses that somebody can randomly blast out without a care in the
world, then be left to sit around waiting to die or otherwise be unable
to do anything as the max-level symptoms fire off on repeat.

This should put curing and surviving viruses much more back in the hands
of normal crew without always ending up at the chemistry front window,
although that is still the fastest and most reliable way to get better.

This also nerfs healing viruses a bit, or makes them a bit less
fire-and-forget if you fail to attend to your body. There's more I'd
like to do in the future and potentially some of the other classic
viruses that could use bypasses_immunity added, values tweaked, but for
now - this seems like the best way to preserve virology as a level of
depth and complexity in the game in a way that rewards people doing
intuitive things to counterplay it when used harmfully.

This also puts more of the mid-range bad symptoms into a better place
balance-wise because the worst ones pretty much only fire at max stages.
With the way this works out, you bounce back and forth between the max
stage and lower stages before, over time, trending towards a cure.
Symptoms that provide more significant effects at lower stages now have
a place that isn't totally overshadowed by the killdeath stage 5 ARDS +
junk symptoms virus Dr. Ambatu Popov shat out in five minutes (as long
as you survive the initial run-in with it.)

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: most diseases can now be slowed, mitigated, and eventually
cured through being well-fed, resting, and using spaceacillin. Curing
diseases through this way will give you immunity if you experience them
at their peak/maximum and aren't starving/malnourished when they cure.
balance: disease symptoms can be forestalled for up to 100 cycles with a
declining chance of avoiding them over time using rest or spaceacillin.
balance: This does not apply to things like fungal TB; it does apply to
healing viruses if you don't take care of yourself by staying fed and
avoiding spaceacillin.
balance: disease can be cured through direct injection or ingestion of
cured blood. However, curing disease in this way does not provide
lasting immunity. You need to naturally beat the virus or get a vaccine
for that.
balance: Wearing internals or using protective equipment while infected
can limit the spread of respiratory illnesses from yourself to others.
Contact transmission is still possible however.
balance: Medical Doctors now have roundstart virology access. Paramedics
and coroners now get virology access on skeleton shift access.
Virologists now have roundstart pharmacy access.
balance: Sentient Diseases now resist being overridden by other advanced
diseases and can always override other advanced diseases; they also have
an extra bonus on their stealth stat to help make up for early outing
without a bit more testing.
balance: biohazard lockers now also contain a syringe of spaceacillin
(in line with the orderable kit from cargo.)
balance: Virus severity is now also a function of the number of symptoms
out of max your virus has. Experiment with different combinations using
less than six symptoms to make viruses that are deceptively less-obvious
and less quick to self-cure at the tradeoff of stats.

distro/el9: refactor package sets to again use `@core` pkg group

Previously, we used a fixed package list from RHEL-9.0 times, instead of
the `@core` pkg group, for all images which used it on el8. The
motivation was that some packages got removed from the group in 9.0
(specifically tuned), which went almost unnoticed. The reasoning was that
a fixed list would give us more control over the package set and prevent
unexpected package removals.

However, with COMPOSER-2074 [1], it turned out that this also meant that
any new packages added to the `@core` group won't be automatically added
to any image which previously used the `@core` group. People still have
(anyhow incorrect) expectation that `@core` pkg group is always
installed on RHEL images and thus that adding a package to the group
will also add it to vanilla RHEL images.

We discussed this shortly within the team and reverting back to using
`@core` package group, instead of a fixed package list, seems like the
lesser evil.

Modify package set definitions, which used `coreOsCommonPackageSet()` to
use `@core` package group instead. Modify the exclude lists accordingly
to achieve almost the same image content as before. There are a few
exceptions:

 - `rhc` package is now installed, which is desired.
 - `insights-client` is now installed on some images where it was
   previously not. This is OK, since RHEL is aiming for a "connected
   experience" by default. This also results in a few additional
   packages to be pulled in as dependencies, specifically:
   - `python3-file-magic`
   - `policycoreutils-python-utils`
   - `tar`
   - `pciutils`
 - `initscripts-rename-device` is now installed. This sub-package has
   been split out of the `initscripts` package on el9, but it was not
   included in the `@core` group definition, when we created the fixed
   pkg list. However, it is now the default member of the group. The
   functionality was previously installed by default on el8 images via
   the `initscripts` package. After talking to the maintainer, I kept it
   in the images as a new package.

Affected images by this change:
 - ami
 - gce
 - gce_rhui
 - image_installer
 - oci
 - openstack
 - ova
 - qcow2
 - vmdk

Some of the listed images already contained `rhc` or `insights-client`,
but now, these are consistently installed on all of them. This is the
case since 9.2, when `rhc` was added to the `@core` group.

`initscripts-rename-device` has been added to all of these image types,
inlcuding on CentOS Stream 9 images.

Add a chat reliability layer (#14619)

Everyone knows that chat will just eat your messages now and then, isn't

notice when you didn't get one?
Well, now it can!

Chat messages poofing into the aether is bad, really bad.

## About The Pull Request

This functionality was removed in #79479
(e1c6cfdce89c7dbcd507d0c44803f5407a042a96), and we should still be
supporting the old chat anyways because it contains a plethora of useful
BYOND information that we still can really leverage (such as the
built-in profiler and stuff like that) and it's going to be painful to
do that if you have to keep spamming `fix-chat` to see OOC/ASAY while
alternating every damn time.
## Why It's Good For The Game

It's ugly but we still need it. There's a reason why we still have it.
## Changelog

Makefile.lib: Lower kernel gzip compression to fastest

You're reading this - so you're trying to understand "JUST WHY OMG".
That's already a good step.

First of all, this is a downstream kernel - always keep that in mind!
Now, this kernel is targeting new *very powerful* Qualcomm platforms
like SM8250 and the Sony Edo platform - which has a very fast UFS card.

Keep in mind that the bootloader sets the CPU at a frequency that is
slightly faster than the "in the middle" ones, which is anyway not
veeeery fast - but that's good, really. I agree.

So.. check this out:   for Image.gz-dtb.....
COMP_LEVEL    SIZE
9             20116171
5      	      20220479
2      	      20940223
1      	      21231290

Remember again that we're loading from a UFS card and that
we are loading ~1.1MB more out of a 20MB file.
If you're smart enough you surely know already about RAM and CPU
overhead of very high compression levels.

If you still disagree with what I just did, read this commit description
another 20 times, or more, until you understand it. :)))

stuff!

more minor fixes!

Relocates Ians dinner so it's not hiding away inside a closet where he can't enjoy it assumed unintended. Also returns Runtimes food to her from the old map.

Corrects the micromeds in dorms to using offsets rather then being lodged insdie a wall.

Relocates the Turbine cooling chamber blast door button to the GMs storage room and gives it a atmos ID lock for good mesure. Should keep those trainees away from the funny room.

Adds a sec cam I forgot to the new atmos hard storage room.

Moves poly into the GMs breakroom and gives him a few crackers to eat/grab. The stamp is finally free!

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Update README.md

ExploreAI Academy Classification Hackathon
Overview
South Africa is a multicultural society that is characterised by its rich linguistic diversity. Language is an indispensable tool that can be used to deepen democracy and also contribute to the social, cultural, intellectual, economic and political life of the South African society.

The country is multilingual with 11 official languages, each of which is guaranteed equal status. Most South Africans are multilingual and able to speak at least two or more of the official languages.
From South African Government



With such a multilingual population, it is only obvious that our systems and devices also communicate in multi-languages.

In this challenge, you will take text which is in any of South Africa's 11 Official languages and identify which language the text is in. This is an example of NLP's Language Identification, the task of determining the natural language that a piece of text is written in.

stepsequencer: Rework the listening logic somewhat

We no longer have an explicit listening state, but instead use what we
have in other places to perform that magic. It also results in much
faster and more stable feeling playing using the note pads, both during
and out of playback, which is lovely.

We also no longer have the press-to-show thing. It was frankly always
kind of awkward (as it would accidentally trigger if you were just
trying to play a thing for a while), and it is also just more
straightforward to show that same dialog with two taps (tap the note,
then tap the x in bar button)  than by tap-and-hold anyway.

Correct copy/move for `union`

By writing separate construction and assignment, plus the new feature of suppressing assignment to a member by writing `member = _ ;` (now allowed only in assignment operators).

I do realize that's an "opt-out" which I normally prefer to avoid, but:

- I considered and decided against (for now) the alternative of not having assignment be memberwise by default. I want to keep the (new to Cpp2) default of memberwise semantics for assignment as with construction. I think that's a useful feature, and normally if you do assign to a member it doesn't arise, and so I think it makes sense to explicitly call out when we're choosing not to do any assignment at all to a member before doing other assignment processing. We'll get experience with how it goes.

- `_` is arguably natural here, since it's pronounced "don't care." There too, we'll see if that is natural generalized, or feels strained. For now it feels natural to me.

Day 10, part 2

Damn, that was hard.
Long story short: I wanted to enter the loop and do a flood fill,
disregarding for a minute that I had to check/lookup that algorithm,
both entering and the touching loop edges were throwing me off.

But drawing out a lot of row/col loops and checking the path to enter
the loop, it seemed the you could count the numbers of times you'd cross
the loop by going to the right edge of the grid.

When coding, I went down a few rabbit holes, but to summarize:

  - I forgot to find the pipe on the starting position, this required me
    to expand my little collections.Set
  - Finding the chars to check so you do not count U and ∩ shapes took
    some trial and error.
  - And, most importantly; I forgot to clean up the grid after I had
    found the loop!!! (this was a serious :facepalm:) I kept hitting way
    to large numbers!
  - `c` for 'column' and `c` for 'char' did not help either.

Halloween Treat: 100 New Palettes! (#253)

* Super Saiyan Palette Update! + Context

Super Saiyan God, Super Saiyan Blue, Legendary Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan Rose, Super Saiyan, and Super Saiyan Blue Evolved have all received updates! I'll explain why so you can get the context on this update. On the Japanese website for Super Dragon Ball Heroes, I wanted to find the exact correct color shades of all the Super Saiyan transformations represented. Plus, Mastered Ultra Instinct is now called Perfected Ultra Instinct. Thank the Dragon Ball Wiki for that.

* TWB64 085 Name Update!

Goodbye, Mastered Ultra Instinct, hello, Perfected Ultra Instinct!

* Update gbcpalettes.h

* TWB64 140 - Dragon Ball Orange Updated!

No need for Shenron granting this update! Dragon Ball Orange has been updated!

* Super Saiyan Blue Evolved Updated Again!?

I had to look for the correct Super Saiyan

* All treats, no tricks; 100 new palettes! + Updated palettes!

Yes, I'm alive! I've still been working on Game Boy palettes all this time, even after I retired from Twitter thanks to the Muskrat. 100 new Game Boy palettes have been added to the Gambatte emulator. Plus, some have been updated/overhauled!

* 100 new palette names! + Changed palettes names in packs 1 and 2!

* TWB64 - Pack 3 Added! + Changed Names

Hey everyone! Sorry that it's been a while since I contributed to github, but I'm here with one big Halloween treat for the Gambatte emulator: a new pack with 100 new palettes! Plus, sme palette names in packs 1 and 2 have been changed.

Removes "fat" status and everything related. (#2516)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

As the title says, eating too much no longer makes you "fat". You suffer
no slowdown or mood debuff from eating too much, and in general, the
game will not take every opportunity to make fun of you.

Notable removals/changes:
- The "fat sucker" machine is totally gone.
- Shady Slim's cigarettes have been removed (since they only existed to
interact with this mechanic).
- Lipoplasty surgery is gone.
- The nutrition setting of scanner gates is gone.

There are a couple of other removals too, like Gluttony's Wall, that I
think were already not in use on this codebase.

One thing I'm not completely satisfied with was the change to mint
toxin, which now does quite literally nothing. I don't think this is
especially a problem, it just makes its existence a bit vestigial.

Also includes an UpdatePaths script to delete all removed objects, just
in case.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from

Basically, removes some shitty "jokes" about fat people. It's an
extremely mean-spirited feature that serves no actual purpose, and
punishes you for clicking on a burger one time too many. It could
potentially be replaced later with a less mean-spirited "overeating"
mechanic, but I'm dubious as to whether that would be any fun either.

"Just closing the barn door a bit..."

(This first section is the TL;DR. with regards to the Sharp/WEBP vulns etc.) Closing the wide-open barn door here... Common sense applied etc. PNG is once again the default storage and export format for cards. While currently the 'Tavern_Card_V2' spec is not yet fully implemented (Or even nailed down, let be honest here.) but that is a thing in the works... At least we're back to the 'Tavern_Card_V1' spec again, now.

Nudging Sharp min required version up to 0.32.6, as 0.31.3 is a confirmed vulnerable version, and installs by default unless the user manually forces an audit, at which point (now, in the last few days.) some people will be unable to run tavern, due to major breaking changes in 0.33...
I chose specifically not to bump to 0.33.0 (which came out the other day) due to said major breaking changes, what with a sizable majority of our users (Or at least based on the reported user-agents that land on our GitHub page!) are running older systems. (I include myself in this group, although there are allegedly some using frighteningly deprecated systems than I am!)

0.32.6 is... For the moment at least, secure and compatible with the widest possible cross-section of our current and potential users.

While I sort of already had my sleeves rolled up and the long gloves on... I also noticed our own internal versioning was desynchronized at some point, and nudged the values in package/package-lock .jsons to match 1.5.2 which is our present official version.
((Honestly Humi, I'm almost tempted to say this push/commit should effectively be a '1.5.3' roll-up at this point, or similar update-alert triggering release should be planned for a 2023 End-of-the-Year roll-up in ~4 weeks time. To land us at 1.5.3, if not start us at straight up 1.6.0 at the changeover from 2023 to 2024.  Something to think about.))

Adjusted the "default defaults" (settings) to better reflect the contemporary median capabilities of the models in popular use. (context max etc.) To give a better first-impression on newer users. Also trying to get the string literal 'Pygmalion' out of as much as possible to prevent our colab from being flagged. As I find such minor references I either redact them, deprecate them,  or modify them. (Delete whole-cloth, make the Pygmalion one into the non-default option, and change to 'Pyg' or 'Classic-6B' etc, respectively. In this push I redacted both a single code comment with the string in it, and have set the name of the default preset used back to the Default-TavernAI settings from Classic-Pygmalion-6b which the settings.json file had set, and updated the actual settings values inside of both so that even people who switch back to the pyg-classic 'preset' out of force of habit will benefit from modern models and inference APIs, while officially 'deprecating' the named Pygmalion settings.)

In that same vein, or similar at least I have slightly changed the message printed to console by default during auto-launching, such that it no longer inadvertently confuses people by creating a clickable link to an inaccessible location when used as part of the colab notebook(s). It only appears when auto-run is enabled, so if you're running locally you're not clicking the 127.0.0.1 link in the first place... But it confuses so many people when colab prints it as a clickable URL in the output console. One less thing to confuse users.

This is both a QoL and newbie-onboarding change-decision, and will be slightly more relevant in a followup commit that further enhances, refines, and streamlines the TavernAI colab user experience that's in the oven at the moment. (Slightly over half-baked as I type this up, and it is starting to smell good.)  Look for that possibly as soon as Monday.

Still trying my best to end 2023 on a high note here for us all, folks. :)
--FunkEngine

(Also) Just about made a fool of myself this morning...
https://github.com/FunkEngine2023/FunkEngine2023.github.io/assets/123712145/5324b650-9e0e-42ee-b6ba-635a3ecfd37c

And hey look I've been baking this commit for over 36 hours now, that was yesterday morning!

Fixed issues with start.bat. Added proper *#%(*% shortcut to open a PowerShell window already set and in the relevant CWD so that there's literally no excuse anymore to not put their hands on the wheel for once...

Then I fixed the bat even more better-er... Fully deprecated the string literal 'Pygmalion" from the code... I don't live in fear of Google... I just don't want to give them any plausible justification to throw us under the bus... (I mean they continue adding "Verboten!" code to the signatures dictionary... SDWUI and ComfyUI being the more notable ones since Pyg took one for the team, and became the lesson for us all in the process.

Round about that time I had also finished fixing up the readme.md with a bit more detail about the process, and adding icons for the downloads...

Then I went down a brief rabbit-hole and literally got a one touch solution as far as "making the TavernAI go *brrrrrrrrrr*" goes...  Plus I left all the prior solutions there in place, and in better condition than they possibly have ever been.  Not sure if I want to go back and mangle markdown to update the readme before I finally push this long overdue boat of a commit down the slipway...

The short answer is: To run TavernAI there's a shortcut right there in the directory, called "TAVERN_CONSOLE" and you just double click it and it takes care of the whole bpm install and standing node up with server.js...  In actual proper PowerShell!

Finishing up testing on several various test environments to make sure that the .bat, the TAVERN_CONSOLE shortcut, and the "CONSOLE" shortcut all function port-ably as  I intend them to. (The "CONSOLE" just opens a PowerShell window in the CWD of wherever the shortcut is to launch it. This will enable things like manually `npm audit fix --force` for those who wouldn't have the slightest idea how to open a PowerShell otherwise.

Big QoL roll-up here. I'll leave merging the colab changes in for Monday or Tuesday.

And now here I am just after midnight pushing this on MONDAY MORNING. :3

-- 0200 approaches and I'm still not satisfied with the colab... It is still less broken than it previously was. I'll leave that for another day.  Happy Monday Morning to you all!

v2.48.0

Added support for unity's new Material Variants.
And let me just rant. OH MY FUCKING GOD. Nothing, nothing is exposed in unity. I tried using reflection to generate the context menu with the same function unity does, but somehow i couldt do it. I could get the method, but any method in the neseted struct just didnt run or didnt run correct, because it didnt attach anything.
So not only couldnt i call their top function, i couldnt call any of their lower functions.
INSTEAD I HAD TO COPY THEIR CODE. 200 Lines of UI and Material change function that i had to edit to work outside the MaterialProperty.PropertyData. And so much other information isnt exposed. Variant count? Nope. Parent Count? Nope, it was a fucking pain, i am in PAIN. Go Fuck yourself unity, I hope godot fucks you over real hard the next few years. YOU DESERVE NOTHING. I hope your company goes under. You are the worst. Worse buiness decisions and worst programming decisions. Suck a fat one! Except if you like dick. Then eat shit!

Icon Autoslicing (#79659)

## About The Pull Request

Ok so you know all the dmis we have that are made to work with the
smoothing system? carpets, walls, etc.

The proper way to edit those is to convert them into a png with 5
"states' it in (one for 0 connections, one for horizontal, one for
vertical, one for all cardinals and one for all directions) and then
modify THAT, then run it through [the cutter
tool.](https://github.com/tgstation/icon-cutter)

But none ever does that, because we explain it fucking nowhere. So
instead, let's keep all those "base" files in the repo, alongside the
configs they work with, and "cut" the pngs into dmis as a part of the
build process.

I wrote a guide for how to interact with this system as a spriter, you
can find it
[HERE](https://github.com/LemonInTheDark/tgstation/blob/slice-the-sky/icons/Cutter.md).

[Adds a icon cutter build
task](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/52143d2e96498de92421d516e0dd3f23936f88d8)

This relies on action ninja's hypnagogic (find more
[here](https://github.com/actioninja/hypnagogic)), a rust based icon
cutter.
It operates inline with the file structure, searching the codebase for
templates and resource files and compiling them down to dmis.

It can do way more then just bitmask stuff, but that is what we are
using it for rn.

Hope is to prevent for eternity the "I'm just gonna edit each of these
255 icon states that's how this carpet was made right?" meme, and allow
more expansive use of smoothing in future

[Adds a lint that ensures config files work
right](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/21eeab9cf831c5fdac5a9b366478a9dab285c20c)

Checks to ensure they have a paired png and dmi, and also avoids issues
with uncompiled changes by double checking that nothing happens
before/after a cutter run

[Pulls all non smoothed states out of structures into bespoke
dmis](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/a730e0cb47fc0a622fe265bccc296cec8d3a8fea)

This is required because the cutter cannot output named icon states,
only the actual cut icon

[Does something similar to
walls](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/40780e9481103c8ee9e16538d1c2d0cdc124eeb9)

Moves reinforced walls decon stuff from their icon to a var on the type
and a set of states in the reinforced_states dmi

Moves falsewalls into their own dmi, this involved some changes to
gamecode to ensure falsewalls knew which dmi to use and what key.
Makes falsewalls display as such in editor rather then just walls

Moves smoothrock's gibonite overlays into their own file for similar
reasons

[Same thing different day
(Floors)](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/9a3da3b69705278f39af109ac5ce86d27c2479a1)

Pulls bespoke floor icon states into their own file, splits up neon
carpets into multiple files to make cutting possible

[Actually adds the cut templates and their matching png
files](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/1bd8920dc90d1ee1b934b6dadc39f2331854f5fa)

Not much to report here, outside of I changed the prefix for bamboo
walls to bamboo_wall so it works with false_walls

## Why It's Good For The Game

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/58055496/7c3ac7fb-873c-481b-8667-082e39432876)

None should have to manually edit cut dmis. Ever.
Also this makes adding a new smoothed thing trivial, don't even need to
know what tool you're using to do it. V good v good.
Sets us up nicely for wallening's well, wall of sprites.

Some structural decisions, we are essentially committing build artifacts
here. That's the best way of handling it because otherwise mappers could
need to run build.bat before opening a map, and that is stupid!

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: (Almost) all smoothed icons can now be edited in their pre cut
forms

Fix plot story flakiness (#7112)

**User-Facing Changes**
None; this is just an improvement to developer experience.

**Description**
Our plot stories have been flaky for a while, even predating the changes
I made to move data processing into a worker. This PR attempts to fix
these issues.

There were two main causes for flaky stories:
1. The mechanism we were using to indicate that a story was ready was
error-prone, particularly after moving plot data processing to a worker,
which meant that differences in timing could cause us to render an
inconsistent number of times. This broke the traditional
`useReadySignal({ count: N })` strategy.
2. There were (and are) significant problems with timing in the `Chart`
component, which sends rendering jobs to a Web Worker that uses ChartJS.

I fixed #1 by switching to a strategy where, instead of counting the
number of rerenders, we wait a certain amount of time after the last
time the Chart component renders before declaring the story "ready".
This may not actually fix this problem definitively because Chromatic's
workers are extremely weak, but it's less error-prone than hoping we get
the same number of renders every time.

For #2 I added what can only be described as a hack because that
component is woefully, woefully tangled. (I'm getting flashbacks to our
layout bug.) We have several interacting layers of React state (mostly
refs), `async` code that can complete at any time, and then, if that
weren't enough, the whole `Rpc` layer that also seems to respond to
requests whenever it feels like.

The core problem is that we were [waiting for a bunch of calls to
finish](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/7112/files#diff-c83b85fde0ce9eb98a2d3d36cc869873cad467fc1fb3aa3f4cc48a8fe73e6b8fR286)
asynchronously and then setting some state on the component, which in a
compute-constrained environment could mean that several seconds have
already passed. In other words, the requests in flight elsewhere were
being randomly overwritten.

In my opinion, we really just need to rewrite this whole section with
`getNewUpdateMessage`, the queued updates stuff, and initialization. I
swear, at least half of the problems we've had with rendering and timing
have been because of this code block.

FEAT: Update ScummVM Standalone to 2.9.0git (#1307)

## Overview
Update to scummvm 2.9.0 to include all updates & fixes to the scrollbars
in: https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/pull/5472

width="400" alt="Run ScummVM_001">

## To test

Testing GUI -> 640 x 480: 

- [x]  GUI can be freely scaled to its smallest size

Testing scrollbars:

- [x] Open global options -> Keymaps & observe a scrollbar is still
present

Downscaler can be tested by running BSword2.5. 
Audio has been handled differently so in this PR will also change the
launch scripts to preload libpadsp.so

refactor(map): enhanced implementation, Clean Code™, etc etc

This involves two redesigns of the map.c implementations:

1. Change of macro style and code organization

The old khash.h and map.c implementation used huge #define blocks with a
lot of backslash line continuations.

This instead uses the "implementation file" .c.h pattern. Such a file is
meant to be included multiple times, with different macros set prior to
inclusion as parameters. we already use this pattern e.g. for
eval/typval_encode.c.h to implement different typval encoders reusing a
similar structure.

We can structure this code into two parts. one that only depends on key
type and is enough to implement sets, and one which depends on both key
and value to implement maps (as a wrapper around sets, with an added
value[] array)

2. Separate the main hash buckets from the key / value arrays

Change the hack buckets to only contain an index into separate key /
value arrays
This is a common pattern in modern, state of the art hashmap
implementations. Even though this leads to one more allocated array, it
is this often is a net reduction of memory consumption. Consider
key+value consuming at least 12 bytes per pair. On average, we will have
twice as many buckets per item.
Thus old implementation:

  2*12 = 24 bytes per item

New implementation

  1*12 + 2*4 = 20 bytes per item

And the difference gets bigger with larger items.
One might think we have pulled a fast one here, as wouldn't the average size of
the new key/value arrays be 1.5 slots per items due to amortized grows?
But remember, these arrays are fully dense, and thus the accessed memory,
measured in _cache lines_, the unit which actually matters, will be the
fully used memory but just rounded up to the nearest cache line
boundary.

This has some other interesting properties, such as an insert-only
set/map will be fully ordered by insert only. Preserving this ordering
in face of deletions is more tricky tho. As we currently don't use
ordered maps, the "delete" operation maintains compactness of the item
arrays in the simplest way by breaking the ordering. It would be
possible to implement an order-preserving delete although at some cost,
like allowing the items array to become non-dense until the next rehash.

Finally, in face of these two major changes, all code used in khash.h
has been integrated into map.c and friends. Given the heavy edits it
makes no sense to "layer" the code into a vendored and a wrapper part.
Rather, the layered cake follows the specialization depth: code shared
for all maps, code specialized to a key type (and its equivalence
relation), and finally code specialized to value+key type.

Check for boolean values as argument on pow function.  (#114133)

Hello everyone! 😄
Also @lezcano , nice to meet you! :)

Sorry if I miss anything, this is my first time around here. 🙃

This PR basically makes the same behaviour for cuda when using `torch.pow`. Basically Python considers True as 1 and False as 0. I just added this check into `pow` function. From what I understood, when I do `.equal` for `Scalar` that is boolean, I'm sure that types match so that won't cause more trouble.

I know that the issue suggest to disable this case but that could be a little more complicated, in my humble opinion. And that can create some compability problems too, I guess.

My argument is that code below is correct for native language, so I guess it does makes sense sending booleans as Scalar.

```
$ x = True
$ x + x
2
```

This was my first test:
```
Python 3.12.0 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Oct  2 2023, 17:29:18) [GCC 11.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import torch
>>> torch.pow(torch.tensor([1, 2], device='cuda'), True)
tensor([1, 2], device='cuda:0')
>>> torch.pow(torch.tensor([1, 2]), True)
tensor([1, 2])
>>> torch.pow(torch.tensor([1, 2]), False)
tensor([1, 1])
>>> torch.pow(torch.tensor([1, 2], device='cuda'), False)
tensor([1, 1], device='cuda:0')
```

I've run `test_torch.py` and got following results, so my guess is that I didn't break anything. I was just looking for a test that uses linear regression, as suggested.

```
Ran 1619 tests in 52.363s

OK (skipped=111)
[TORCH_VITAL] Dataloader.enabled		 True
[TORCH_VITAL] Dataloader.basic_unit_test		 TEST_VALUE_STRING
[TORCH_VITAL] CUDA.used		 true

```
(I can paste whole log, if necessary)

If this is a bad idea overall, dont worry about it. It's not a big deal, it's actually a two line change 😅  so can we talk of how do things in a different strategy.

For the record I've signed the agreement already. And I didn't run linter because it's not working 😞 . Looks like PyYaml 6.0 is broken and there's a 6.0.1 fix already but I have no idea how to update that 😅

Fixes #113198
