MAINT: SCIPY_USE_PROPACK

* this is effectively a forward port and modernization
of the release branch `PROPACK` shims that were added in
gh-15432; in short, `PROPACK` + Windows + some linalg backends
was causing all sorts of trouble, and this has never been resolved

* I've switched to `SCIPY_USE_PROPACK` instead of `USE_PROPACK`
for the opt-in, since this was requested, though the change
between release branches may cause a little confusion (another
release note adjustment to add maybe)

* I think the issues are painful to reproduce; for my part,
I did the following just to check the proper skipping/accounting
of tests:

- `SCIPY_USE_PROPACK=1 python dev.py -j 20 -t scipy/sparse/linalg`
  - `932 passed, 172 skipped, 8 xfailed in 115.57s (0:01:55)`
- `python dev.py -j 20 -t scipy/sparse/linalg`
  - `787 passed, 317 skipped, 8 xfailed in 114.80s (0:01:54)`

* why am I doing this now? well, to be frank the process of manually
backporting this for each release is error-prone, and may cause
additional confusion/debate, which I'd like to avoid. Besides, if it
is broken in `main` we may as well have the shims there as well. I would
point out that you may want to add `SCIPY_USE_PROPACK` to 1 or 2 jobs
in CI? The other reason is that if usage of `PROPACK` spreads, I don't
want to be manually applying more skips/shims on each release (which
I already had to do here with two new tests it seems)

[MIRROR] Add Croissants & Traitorous Baking Techniques [MDB IGNORE] (#18463)

* Add Croissants & Traitorous Baking Techniques (#72232)

## About The Pull Request

This is my Christmas present to mimes everywhere.

First of all this adds Croissants, because I thought they already
existed and was shocked to learn that they did not.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/209454610-4e69563f-b83d-465b-b28e-7e0b482ff01b.png)
Here's a croissant and an unbaked croissant.
In terms of food they are GRAIN, DAIRY, and BREAKFAST and made fairly
simply from sugar, dough, and butter.

Secondly it adds this pack of traitor gear, exclusively for Mimes and
Chefs.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/209454613-059759b2-774c-45e2-9e1e-97adb43f75f1.png)
The contents of this pack are:
- One combat baguette, indistinguishable from a regular baguette. If
wielded as a sword it gains a 50% block chance (equal to the Captain's
sabre) and does 20 damage.
- Two throwing croissants, which do 20 throwing damage and return to
your hand like boomerangs.
- A cookbook which teaches you the secret to turning croissaints into
deadly boomerang weapons.

You make a croissant into a throwing croissant simply by inserting an
expertly bent iron rod into it.
The chef can't make any use of the baguette unless they also gain the
ability to mime, but they can use it to make food.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/209454703-feafcf4c-6d0a-4e9a-ac4a-d3e2fc7c0ffb.mp4

Watch me here struggle to use them to kill an ape (they don't return to
your hands if thrown at an adjacent tile).

## Why It's Good For The Game

It's insane that croissants aren't already in the game.
This gives mimes an "invisible" sword to go with their invisible gun (it
announces to everyone nearby when you're about to use it, but they can't
know if it's just a _regular_ baguette).
It's funny to throw bread at people.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: You can now bake croissants to add to your breakfast.
add: Traitorous chefs can bake dangerous throwing croissants, Mimes can
do this and gain the additional benefit of a deadly combat baguette.
/:cl:

* Add Croissants & Traitorous Baking Techniques

Do not allow focus to drift from fullscreen client via focusstack()

It generally doesn't make much sense to allow focusstack() to navigate
away from the selected fullscreen client, as you can't even see which
client you're selecting behind it.

I have had this up for a while on the wiki as a separate patch[0], but
it seems reasonable to avoid this behaviour in dwm mainline, since I'm
struggling to think of any reason to navigate away from a fullscreen
client other than a mistake.

Adds Some Supermatter Effects  (#67866)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

This pull request adds a variety of Supermatter delamination effects to
make the crystal a bit more fun to watch and stare at. The initial
filter effects and animations are from Baystation12, but I have adapted
it to make it fun to watch!

It'll be a bit hard to explain in text, so this is the text explanation.

For normal running conditions, the Supermatter will emit pretty golden
rays, and a large campfire like that glow that grows and shrinks based
on it's power level.

![dreamseeker_vnw1BL7DNy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/174471609-7be70234-5eae-4839-b551-1c28145d6b60.gif)


For high power conditions, such as high O2 or CO2 amounts, the
Supermatter's rays will glow red and it will emit red light, aswell as
turn red (like before, unchanged).

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/174471693-e191ee47-1a01-4b76-8570-9d12b994c2d4.mp4

When the conditions for a cascade, singularity, or a tesla are met, the
colours and rays emitting from the crystal will change to match!


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/174471747-dffb3beb-dd38-42a1-a97b-7262dabd60af.mp4


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/174471765-af1927e8-a48e-4fd5-a35c-6b3aa53c5add.mp4

Also, I've added more sucking power to the crystal during its final
countdown for DRAMATIC EFFECT. If the singularity conditions are met,
the supermatter will SUCK THINGS INTO IT, even if they are bolted to the
GROUND. Just like a singularity! It's REALLY COOL.
https://streamasaurus.com/sharing/singularity_full.mp4 <--17MB video.
UPDATE 1: New rays for the singulo


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/174933219-0118748a-02da-40f8-9b99-06009e197cc8.mp4
UPDATE 2:
Singularity delamination final countdown effect??: 


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77420409/175421220-66bae109-204d-44ee-8a67-c18ce8eff3ba.mp4





When the supermatter has reached the FINAL COUNTDOWN but does NOT meet
the criteria for a singularity, it will simply YOINK everything
unwrenched towards, like a gravitational anomaly, range based on power
at the time. Not as crazy as the singularity. Most things will get
slapped against walls.

Here, have another cool delamination demo showing the criteria's
swapping mid countdown!
https://streamasaurus.com/sharing/modeswapping.mp4 <-- 17.5MB

I am likely missing something important from this body as I am drowsy
making this! I will update this body with anything I forgot to note that
I did.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The supermatter is a a very cool thing, but it could be cooler. I think
the visual experience could do with a bit of an upgrade, as visual
feedback is really cool and impressive to watch! You could tell more
about the crystal without looking at the console, but not everything or
precise numbers.

## Changelog

Adds a preference that disables intensive rendering on different multiz layers (#71218)

## About The Pull Request

It's kinda hacky, but it is nearly the same as just rendering one z
layer.
We allow people to ENTIRELY REMOVE most plane masters from their screen.
This has the side effect of disabling most visual effects (AO is a big
one) which saves a LOT of gpu.

We rely on planes being essentially layers to ensure things render in
the proper order. (outside of some hackyness required to make parallax
work)

I've kept parallax and lighting enabled, so visuals will still look
better then multiz pre plane cube.
It does also mean that things like FOV don't work, but honestly they
didn't work PRE plane cube, and FOV's implementation makes me mad so I
have a hard time caring.

Reduces gpu usage on my machine on tram from 47% to 32%, just above the
27% I get on meta.

I'm happy with this.

Oh also turns out the parallaxing had almost no cost. Need to remove it
as a side effect of what I'm doing but if I could keep it I would.

There's still room for in between performance options, like disabling
things like AO on lower z layers, but I didn't expect it to make a huge
impact, so I left things as is

Also fixes a bug with paper bins not respecting z layer. It came up in
testing and annoyed me

## Why It's Good For The Game

Ensures we can make multiz maps without running into client performance
issues, allows users to customize performance and visual quality.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Adds a new rendering option to the gameplay preferences. You can
now limit the rendering intensity of multiz levels. This will make
things look a bit worse, but run a LOT better. Try it out if your
machine chokes on icebox or somethin.

Chaplain armor beacon now uses radial + previews possible armor sets, plus some choice beacon code cleanup. (#71674)

## About The Pull Request

- The chaplain choice beacon now uses a radial to select the armor set,
instead of a list, giving the user a preview of what each looks like.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51863163/205417930-f5ceab11-6974-48a9-a871-abcb8228bcf2.png)

- Lots of additional cleanup to choice beacon code in general. Less copy
pasted code.
- All beacons now speak from the beacon with their message, instead of
some going by "headset message". Soul removed

## Why It's Good For The Game

I always forgot when selecting my armor which looks like what, and
choosing an ugly one is a pain since you only get one choice. This
should help chaplains get the armor they actually want without needing
to check the wiki.

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
qol: The chaplain's armament beacon now displays a radial instead of a
text list, showing previews of what all the armor sets look like
qol: (Almost) all choice beacons now use a pod to send their item,
instead of just magicking it under your feet
code: Cleaned up some choice beacon code.

Unfuckies pod blood (#72323)

I broke it in #72220
Thanks to @Fikou for catching this
list(variable = 0.1) doesnt work on byond, so I last-minute improvised
and changed it to
list("[variable]" = 0.1), using a string instead of a typepath. I
already tested it thoroughly so decided it was probably good without
thinking of it anymore

Dogs use the Pet Command system (#72045)


About The Pull Request

Chiefly this refactors dogs to use the newer component/datum system for "pet which follows instructions". It also refactors it a little bit because I had better ideas while working on this than I had last week. Specifically, instead of passing around keys we just stick a weakref to our currently active behaviour in the blackboard. Basically the same but skipping an unecessary step.

Additionally it adds a component for the previous "befriending a mob by clicking it repeatedly" behaviour which hopefully we won't use too much because it's not very exciting (I am planning on replacing it for dogs some time after Christmas).
The biggest effort in here was making the Fetch command more generic, which includes multiple behaviours (which might be used on their own?) and another component (for holding an item without hands).

Additionally I noticed that dogs would keep following my instructions after they died.
This seems unideal, and would be unideal for virtually any AI controller, so I added it as an AI_flag just in case there's some circumstance where you do want to process AI on a dead mob.

Finally this should replicate all behaviour Ian already had plus "follow" (from rats) and a new bonus easter egg reaction, however I noticed that the fetch command is supposed to have Ian eat any food that you try to get him to fetch.
This has been broken for some time and I will be away from my desk for a couple weeks pretty soon, so I wrote the behaviour for this but left it unused. I will come back to this in the future, once I figure out a way to implement it which does not require adding the "you can hit this" flag to every edible item.

Also I had to refit the recent addition of dogs barking at felinids to fit into this, with a side effect that now dogs won't get mad at a Felinid they are friends with. This... feels like intended behaviour anyway?
Why It's Good For The Game

It's good for these to work the same way instead of reimplementing the same behaviour in multiple files.
Being able to have Ian (or other dogs) follow you around the station is both fun and cute, and also makes him significantly more vulnerable to being murdered.
Changelog

cl
add: Ian has learned some new tricks, tell him what a good boy he is!
add: Ian will come on a walk with you, if you are his friend.
refactor: Ian's tricks work the same way as some other mobs' tricks and should be extendable to future mobs.
fix: Dogs no longer run at the maximum possible speed for a mob at all times.
add: When Ian gets old, he also slows down. Poor little guy.
add: Dogs will no longer dislike the presence of Felinids who have taken the time to befriend them.

Guards against uplink failsafe code being the same as unlock code (#72113)

## About The Pull Request

There's probably a better way to do this to be honest, but I think it's
silly for both to potentially be the same and this should work alright.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes #71446.

I don't think the Syndicate is that stupid.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: After a recent mishap with a high-ranking Syndicate operative, the
uplink's unlock code and failsafe code (the one that makes it blow up if
you say it) should never turn out to be the same.

Carrier buffs and xeno ability toggles (#1996)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

After playing a few rounds as various Carriers, it really felt they
could use a small buff to work way better with how basically they are
expected to build Hive Clusters now.

So the changes are:
- Vanilla and Shaman Carriers now have 500 plasma instead of 400
(would've given them 450 but the defines are in increments of 100).
Eggsac still sits at 600.
- Base carrier can carry 8 eggs (up from 7), and Eggsac can carry 12 (up
from 7). The latter especially suffered from not being able to carry
more than its base variant.
- Shaman can now plat weeds (since we do have support for 5 xeno actions
everything still fits). It was strange they could make special
structures but not base weeds as a Drone evo strain...
- Eggsac's egg generation is now a toggle instead of an active ability.
It uses plasma per tick and generates an egg every 30 seconds. This
makes it less fiddly and lets you plant eggs more actively. Still the
same cost overall.
- To support that, I added a new xeno ability type - active toggle. For
now it's used by Hivelord for Resin Walker and Eggsac for generating the
egg

Hopefully the active egg generation will actually make Eggsac a strong
frontline xeno, since currently it's not that popular, not to mention
it's still a liability for the Hive if they die...

# Explain why it's good for the game

Carriers are usually very plasma starved, especially when they are
expected to build Hive Clusters for their Eggs, so mitigated that a bit.
Eggsac carrying more eggs means it is compensated for losing huggers,
and being able to generate eggs on an ongoing basis makes that ability
less fiddly. The ability toggle makes it so the Resin Walker actually
deactivates properly when you run out of plasma and cleans up the code a
bit. Shaman being able to plant weeds means they can properly support
the frontline without needing other Drones for the base weeds.

balance: Base and Shaman Carriers now have 500 base plasma, up from 400.
Eggsac remains at 600 plasma.
balance: Base and Shaman Carriers can now store up to 8 eggs, up from 7.
Eggsac now can store a whopping 12 eggs, up from 7. Be careful not to
die while carrying those and give Marines greeno material!
balance: Shaman can now plant weeds. This bumped all their other
abilities one slot over shortcut-wise.
qol: Eggsac's egg generation ability is now a toggle that uses plasma
per tick to generate eggs at an ongoing rate until full or out of
plasma.
code: Hivelord's Resin Walker now uses the same toggle structure.
fix: Hivelord's Resin Walker now deactivates properly when you run out
of plasma.
fix: Fixed a runtime around Shaman's ability initialisation.

Fixes parallax on >2 level maps going fucky with optimized multiz (#72169)

## About The Pull Request

We no longer always render parallax.
This was causing issues because we can't isolate the white of space from
the vaugely white of everything else.

So instead, if your parallax plane is out of view, we'll not only
disable it, but we'll disable the strand we send from the main plane TO
it.

Instead only blending against the bottom stack.

This does mean there's a possibility for fullwhite on z transition
borders (potentially fixable), or when hijacking the plane (also
fixable, but significantly more annoying).

This is enough to make large maps functional though, so I'm happy with
it

## Why It's Good For The Game

Allows for #71731 and other maps like it. Makes my code actually work

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Using optimized multiz on > 2 z layer maps will no longer cause
fucko bungo

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes another portion of #70258, a player will no longer have a hidden

Preperation for Version 0.1.0 - major makeover

*new file structure

The plugin has become bigger as expected during the first year. To stay organized, the previous idea of a singlefile is dropped and the code is separated by topics.

*performance

The previous versions have some issues with complex structures. Instead of single curves, one connected mesh is created for visualization. This is way faster and also memory efficient.

Scipy is used if available. This feature is available for experienced users that are able to install Scipy into Blender. A checkbox use_scipy is integrated, if the user wants to disable Scipy in case of errors.
saving data

Previous approach was to store all data into python classes. This data has been lost, if the file was closed. The new version is going to use a new variable system within bpy.context.scene[“<Phaenotyp>”]. All data is stored within the blend-file and is used when reopening a saved file.

The way how data is stored in variables has improved in a lot of parts.

Color and Radius of the visualization-mesh is stored in vertex-groups and vertex-color-attributes. This is going to be quicker and also more organized.

*processing data

Phaenotyp is switching to the amazing geometry-nodes in a lot of tasks. A lot of stuff is way more organized and quicker.

*genetic algorithm

The genetic algorithm has been reworked in a lot of parts to work more efficiently.
The genetic algorithm can perform a sectional optimization before running the fitness-function for each individual. In this way the overall exploitation of the structure can be increased.
visualizing data
After using the genetic algorithm the result can be ranked by best fitness.

Due the new approach of processing data, the visualization ist way quicker and more memory efficient.

*usability

Some parts are more user friendly hopefully. All experimental functions that were somehow confusing have been removed.

Defined parameters are grayed out after a successful calculation of the structure. In this way, the user can not change parameters, that would not affect the finished result. Otherwise this could lead to some confusion, if the structure is saved with wrong parameters.

*variables

Because of the improved way of storing data, the variables have been reworked in a lot of parts. The overall management of variables is redone.

*hints

In order to install this new version, any older one needs to be uninstalled. A description for users is going to be added.

There is a division by zero error in sectional optimization sometimes that needs to be fixed or excluded with try/except.

lxd/instance/drivers/driver/qemu: Fix macvlan NICs losing connectivity on LXD restart

Switch to using monitor.SendFile() rather than monitor.SendFileWithFDSet(), as there
appears to be some rather strange behaviour going on with QEMU when used with macvtap
NICs.

If you pass the macvtap file handles using monitor.SendFileWithFDSet() it will use a
separate FD set for each file handle. This works fine, and I can see the correct file
handles opened by the QEMU process. But when LXD is restarted (the monitor connection
is closed), the file handles are closed by QEMU, causing the connectivity to break.

I have experimented with using the same FD set for all file handles associated to a
particular macvtap NIC. This didn't fix the issue.

I also tried hard coding the FD set ID to 0. This meant that the macvtap NIC would
share an FD set with the root disk device. Interestingly this solved the issue.
However it made me uncomfortable as the root disk is only configured by referencing
the FD set ID itself, rather than a particular FD inside the set. So I don't think
that sharing an FD set with multiple devices is a good idea.

However it got me thinking that perhaps the fact that the root disk is referencing
the FD set by ID (i.e using file=/dev/fdset/0 in its config) meant that QEMU somehow
realised that the FD set should be persisted even after the monitor has disconnected.

I confirmed that using the same FD set (even if a different ID than 0) for macvtap NICS
as the root disk device fixed the issue.

But because of my discomfort at that scenario (explained above) I instead looked for
a different solution. Before introducing multi-queue macvlan support for VMs we were
using monitor.SendFile() which worked fine. However I had switched to using the
monitor.SendFileWithFDSet() function as the former didn't support accessing the specific
FD number that was created inside QEMU. I thought we needed this because all the
documentation around using multi-queue macvtap devices showed the use of numeric FDs.

However on further exploration it turns out that we can infact use monitor.SendFile,
and by sending each file handle with a unique name we can then refer to those file
handles using the same names in `fds` setting for the macvtap devices.

Note: Because the `fds` list is colon separated one cannot use colons in the file
handle names. And I also experienced issues with connectivity when using dashes in
the file handle names. So I opted for using full-stops instead.

Fixes #11201

Hi Louis,

It's been a long time.  If you remember I used your Fast Intrinsic Mode Decomposition to pull noise out of a video of blood flow in the retina.

But I have never gotten your second paper's method working well.  I found the github

https://github.com/louisyulu/eef-utilities

And I downloaded the folder, and brought it up with Visual Code so that I can see how you have put things together.

Well again, for the life of me when I put what I think is the important stuff in the language I use (IDL).  It still does not work. I never get to the place where I only have a few control points.  Have you or anyone ever rewritten it some other language? I don't know dart  and I don't want to take the time to figure out how to run it in debugger.

Cargo ammo and ammo box mapping (re-up) (#1759)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

## About The Pull Request

Previous version of this PR ( #1650 ) claimed to have changed 384 files,
which would be impossible to review. So re-uploading this PR with
hopefully a sane amount of files changed...

---

When I was playing cargo I spent a good half an hour in a round just
mindlessly packing ammo magazines into boxes in squad prep. It didn't
put a dent in the squad prep supply, and I barely got a handful of
boxes. So I thought to myself that this is pretty much a waste of time
for cargo and decided to code a better solution:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnXcEYAV8P4

So now select vendors (opt-in via `VEND_LOAD_AMMO_BOXES`) support ammo
consolidation. They count the number of ammo magazines you have and from
that they derive the number of magazine boxes you can vend. If you vend
a magazine, it updates the number of boxes available, and if you vend a
box, it updates the number of magazines available (as well as all
derived boxes - see the 3 pack of grenades and 25 pack box).

The `item_to_box_mapping` tracks ammo boxes (minus loose ammo), grenade
boxes, grenade packets and mine boxes.

Most notable affected vendors - Requisition ammo vendor, Requisition
vendor that features grenades, Squad vendors that have ammo in them.

So now Requisition will be able to easily raid Squad Vendors to stock up
their ammo drops and save countless hours of mind-numbing cargo work.

This code ALSO correctly works when you're re-stocking a vendor with
either individual magazines or magazine boxes. Correct amounts are
updated everywhere. So you *could* take a magazine box, put it in a
vendor and thus let people vend 16 magazines out of it seemlessly.
Really useful just incase you need to restock Requisitions with
individual ammo or something...

Other notes:
- Boxes of magazines are put directly under the corresponding ammo so
you can vend them in larger amounts easier. Useful for 3-packs of
grenades
- We should add a Shotgun Shell Box Box so we can also handle those
easily...
- Nailgun ammo box had to be converted from being /smg/ since that
created an invalid ammo box that nobody used.
- Nulled out a magazine type for an intermediary box that later gets
used for MREs and all that

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is

## Why It's Good For The Game

Gameplay around loading magazines into ammo boxes is not interesting, so
cutting it down to minimum is for the best.

:cl:
add: Added an automated ammo box management system to various vendors
stocking bulk ammo and grenades. It will automatically combine ammo
magazine into boxes, and divide boxes into individual magazines (or
grenades, MRE packets, etc.). The boxes will appear at the bottom of the
vendor (yes, this also includes the regular grenade boxes that used to
be higher).
qol: Cargo will no longer need to pack individual vended ammo magazines
into boxes thanks to the ammo box management system. Your chains have
been broken!
qol: Requisitions vendor now stocks 3-packs of grenades as well as
individual HEDP grenades.
qol: Requisitions ammo vendor now can vend a lot more individual
magazines (actual number of magazines remains unchanged, just the ammo
boxes have been consolidated into magazines).
qol: Requisition vendors now vend to floor when they are not vending to
the front desks. This will make filling crates of ammo boxes or rappels
easier.
code: Minor changes to code around some ammo boxes to remove one phantom
box and prevent intermediate box types from being indexed when they
shouldn't be.
code: Refactored the code that checks whether items are in mint enough
condition to re-stock.

[MIRROR] Adds the Sandstorm random event, directional meteor functionality, space sand. [MDB IGNORE] (#18338)

* Adds the Sandstorm random event, directional meteor functionality, space sand. (#71802)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

![sandstorm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28870487/206070641-80d37afc-a365-4f5e-ad48-e8cdf0153ac9.png)

Hey guys, it's your boy. Back at it again with another meteor-adjacent
event PR.

Adds the Sandstorm random event, inspired by the long-unused admin only
one. It picks a direction to approach from, alerts the crew of its
imminent arrival, and after a little over a minute of preparatory time,
sends waves of sand and dust to grind down everything in that direction.

To accomplish this, some minor adjustments had to be made to meteor
generation code. They can now be passed an optional arg for a direction
to be thrown from, and will pick a random one if no direction is given.

Also introduces the newest addition to our cast of meteors -- space
sand! It's even weaker than space dust, and shows up exclusively in this
event. Space sand is **ineffective against rwalls**, and will not damage
the arrivals area's high-tech sand-resistant glass. This is to prevent
this event from venting one of the most dust-vulnerable areas on the
station, and to make sure new players aren't shafted into firelock hell
when the right angle is picked.

I did a lot of testing and tweaking of numbers to get the damage to
average at about the level I'm comfortable with. This is meant to be a
high-impact event that isn't as destructive (or unavoidable) as a meteor
wave. Speaking of avoidance, let's talk about mitigation:

You get an early warning and a direction the sand will come from. You
have time to grab repair supplies, move to safety, get a MODsuit. You
can make worthwhile repairs as the sand comes in from inside (or
outside, if you're brave enough) with nothing more than a welder and
iron sheets. If you're feeling particularly spicy, you can leverage your
prep time setting up shield generators, which spawn in engineering and
have been added to the maintenance machines loot pool. Anyone can
contribute, so do your part as a good crewmate and help out!

All that being said, the event can't be prevented entirely. Shit's going
to get shredded, especially on the outside of the station. Damage will
vary heavily based on the station and direction, ranging from
inconsequential to threatening. It should happen late enough into the
round that, at the bare minimum, the crew shouldn't be caught
unprepared.

For those of you who are worried, the ORIGINAL sandstorm admin event is
still with us too. It's been moved from the space dust file into the
Sandstorm event file. This PR also makes a very minor change to the
naming of the space _dust_ events, for better menuing.

So, to sum it all up: Sand hits grinds down one side of the station, you
get a minute of warning, shield generators now spawn in maintenance. Be
a good crewmate and help where you can.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from

## Why It's Good For The Game

More event variety is good, and events that give the players agency on
how bad the impact will be is even better.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly

add: Sandstorm random event! A random side of the station is pummeled by
an onslaught of sand and dust. If you hear that one is approaching, grab
a welder and some iron to help with repairs!
add: Space sand! It's weak and doesn't hurt reinforced walls, but
shouldn't be underestimated in high quantities.
code: You can now pass a start direction to the

Sometimes bugs and oversights are elevated into features, this is
effectively one but in practice it means that marines have way too much
freedom of movement and versatility entering it, it's less like a
clunky, bulky, cassettepunk APC and more like a Ferrari convertile. It
also allows them to instantly enter the APC while being killed by a
Xeno, which is stupid and lame.

dear tim, you're still a goof. dear oprah, you're still a fat bitch. nice job @ITzTravelInTime

for some fucking reason or another, you cannot use the one and two-parameter arguments for ioRead and ioWrite.

in this case, you have to use the deviceMap as the address, PLUS the actual device. you'd think the device is enough, but i guess not.

very nice job @ITzTravelInTime. it makes no sense i have to do this though, and why in/out{b,w,l} didn't work.

v nice. i heard the driver 'click'. meaning it turned on. nice. nice nice.

this is for you, tim:

Adds craftable showers and IV drips hopefully for the last time
<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Showers can be built in the direction you are facing with three metal sheets.
IV Drips can be built with five plastic sheets.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from merging your PR! -->

<!-- Tick the box below (put an X instead of a space between the brackets) if you have tested your changes and this is ready for review. Leave unticked if you have yet to test your changes and this is not ready for review. -->

- [x] I affirm that I have tested all of my proposed changes and that if this pr fucks up again im giving up and asking someone else to do it

## Why It's Good For The Game
Showers are important and useful, same with IV drips. Since you cannot draw blood from a bag using a syringe, not having an IV drip means your blood bags would be effectively useless until you get to an outpost. Showers are useful for washing off blood, acid and doing surgery on plasmamen.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be worth adding. -->
