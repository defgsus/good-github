Add Readme, License and CI.

It's not because I'm working alone on this that I should work as a
savage. I thought it will be fun to integrate the linting steps as
reviews from the github action bot (Yeah, I know it might not sound
fun but it is !).

Got a MetaQuest 3 for Christmas from my insanely crazy wife. Guess
that this project will take another slow down because I'll try to
create a commercial game with it.

Revert "if you die in a mech you are ejected" (#79768)

Reverts tgstation/tgstation#79380
this is literally what the mech removal tool is for. gameplay reasons
for that tool missing do not mean that we need to remove its use - if
you want a better solution then let people purchase it... or just smash
the mech- you saving their life and them being sad about their mech is
really funny
the original pr being marked as qol when that was a specific balance
change is very stupid

## Changelog

Refactor the way the source code is placed, just for a new list on the version page.

- Non-Composer libraries are now autoloaded, meaning that non-Orange/non-Composer libraries can be autoloaded along with Orange.
- Added a list of installed Composer packages, akin to MediaWiki. The Composer namespace actually comes from MediaWiki itself.
- Regarding the import of MediaWiki code (the Composer namespace)... MediaWiki's Special:Version page says that it's licensed on GPLv2, or "at your option" (in their words), any later version. So, it's GPL-2.0-or-later, which implies its more or less both GPL-2.0 and GPL-3.0, or something like that. AGPL-3.0 (OpenSB's license) is "not compatible" with GPL-2.0. But, if I read the AGPL-3.0 license correctly, it's possible for GPL-3.0 code to be in a AGPL-3.0 codebase. Does that apply to GPL-2.0-or-later, since it can also be in GPL-3.0? What the fuck is this mental gymnastics bullshit? I'm dizzy as shit over this, but I'm concluding that since MediaWiki can be licensed in GPL-3.0 due to how the "or-later" works in GPL-2.0-or-later, well, MediaWiki code can be in OpenSB.

fixes for teshvali cybernetics (#900)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

# OOPS
So in the previous and now closed PR
(https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/pull/871#issue-2049760879)
I forgot to commit changes to tgstation.dme. So while the files are now
in the code... they're not enabled. Oops.

## About The Pull Request

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

I didn't notice some more minor changes in the testmerge. This rectifies
some of that - new vars, and such. After I fix the new bugs inherent to
this... Which have now been fixed. ~~Although the current version should
still be functional, teshari cybernetic limbs take approximately 10%
more damage than they should due to the missing var. I think. The var is
weird, and honestly seems to be a redundancy? better safe than sorry.~~
This PR actually enables the previous PR and fixes some things which
would have caused minor statistical inconsistencies on the scale of
+-1-5 damage taken.
### Advanced Raptor limbs
Oh, also advanced cybernetic limbs were implemented since the downstream
made them obtainable. They're a bit brighter than the regular limbs.

your PR mention it. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years. You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA  The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

The unit traditionally consists of ten members, and are hand-selected by the current GD-ANTC, a mix of ASF and Protectorate personnel with at least 5 years of experience in Antarctic conflict and logistical intuition, chosen for their history and loyalty to the current GD-ANTC.  Reflected in the unit patch, Drake's Expedition and GD-ANTC are heavily associated with the cosmos and the Authority's space presence, seen as the ultimate international territory to all of mankind. It is tradition for each new GD-ANTC to be proclaimed the protector for the sun and the solar system — with each member of Drake's Expedition ordained as the protector for one of the eight planets, Pluto, and the moon — during the Directorate's ceremonial first meeting of the office cycle.  Each member of Drake's Expedition is code-named by the celestial body they represent.

These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation. Any department or agency can achieve this distinction , however the likelihood an average foundation employee will be granted Foundation High administration remains very low. The bosses and administrative entities who help run the Foundation’s-high administration will exhibit high honor levels always, usually must be higher than average honor levels of their subordinates.

Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years. You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index.

Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.  O5 COUNCIL MEMBER  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA  The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

""Valkyries are Valravn’s most important Asset. They just don’t see it yet."" Olga Brandt. Lead Researcher in Valkyrie R&D       Overview Customer reviews External Documentation FAQ Relevant Concepts How to write GOI Format Articles Valravn GOI formats come usually in two flavors. One is after-action reports, describing and detailing a recent mission undergone by a military team. Normally an after-action report includes the following parts, but the structure can be flexible:  Summary (optional): A brief description of what the report is going to be about. Background: What was the context where the mission took place? Who were the participants in the conflict? What were their goals? Who is the employer? Who is the enemy? What were their equipment and tactics? What was the objective of the mission? Everything that is necessary to understand why the operation took place. Incident Overview: How did the mission go? How did Valravn troops approach the situation? What tactics and strategies were employed? Which assets were deployed? What was the expected outcome? How did it resolve? The goal is to communicate to the reader a clear understanding of what happened during the mission. Aftermath: What were the consequences of the mission? Was the objective accomplished? How is this going to impact the region where it took place? How is Valravn benefiting from it? Conclusion (Optional): If the mission was successful or failed, elaborate on why. What new information was obtained? Were the Corporation's goals achieved? How will this impact Valravn's future strategies? After-action reports are written from the perspective of military commanders reporting to their superiors. Neutral third-person language is preferred over the first-person. The language used is technical, concise, and detached, similar to Foundation's clinical tone but with an emphasis on the tactical side of things instead of a scientific one.  The second type of format is internal technical briefings on anomaly weaponization projects4. These describe the technical and tactical aspects of new Valrvan assets under development:  Summary (optional): A brief description of what the report is going to be about. Background: Everything is necessary to understand the anomaly. What does Valravn know about it? Its origin, properties, behavior, and what makes it a good candidate for military application. Technical Description: How is the anomaly going to be weaponized? What change does it need to undergo in order to become a military asset? Can this be mass produced? What are the challenges that may arise? Tactical and Strategical Justification: How is this going to benefit Valravn's operations on both a tactical and a strategic level? What advantage is Valravn getting from this project? What would be the role of the asset on the battlefield? As with the after-action report, the technical brief structure is flexible and can be modified to suit the particular necessities of an article. Technical briefs are written by the perspective of Valravn researcher presenting a new development to their superior, so the langue is technical and clinical, more ""scientific"" than the after-action report and more in line with the tone of a Foundation file.  As with Foundation articles, both after-actions reports and technical briefs can be complemented with video and audio logs, interviews, images, chat logs, mail exchanges, and any other supplement that may benefit the narrative.  Valravn articles usually start with a notice from the High Table. It is not necessary to include it but may help to set the tone. This comes imported with Valravn's theme. The ""papernote"" component included in the theme can also be used for formatting article sections beyond the High Table notice.

Delamination variants are now locked in after the countdown is reached (#80324)

## About The Pull Request

Does what it says on the tin.
## Why It's Good For The Game

This effectively changes one and only one thing: 

The "All Within Theoretical Limits" achievement is easier/fairer to get
with this. Previously, if you edged a crystal with the gas composition
method to get a resonance cascade, you had to make sure that your gas
composition stayed until it left the explosion point, which made the
achievement extremely finnicky and unfun to get this way. Regular
delaminations won't really be affected, because yeah. It's at the
explosion point. What are you going to do about it?

This makes the achievement easier to cheese, but honestly, in my opinion
as person who added the achievement, meh. If people feel like this isn't
good for the achievement, say something in the comments.

Closes #79528

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Delamination variants no longer change once the explosion point
has been reached.

## Why It's Good For The Game

vox shenanigans

## technobabble
anyway so getting the shitty project running took me 80 hours or so over
many attempts but
the linked fork has less of that poetry python bullshit
just dont install python3.6 its pointless, install python3
anyway so run sudo python3 setup.py
follow instructions till it actually works
generate.sh will not work well so just run "sudo python3 create.py"
directly
also you could just skip the sudo part by just running sudo -i before
all that
create.py will create both voices for vox_masc and vox_fem for some
reason but you could avoid that by removing masc or whatever the fuck
the sex is called from create.py to save some time by doing fem solely
also you should set codebase to tg in codebase.yaml and replace
tglist.jinja2 in templates with this
```
GLOBAL_LIST_INIT(vox_sounds, list(
  {%- for sex, phrases in SEXES.items() %}
    {%- for phrase in phrases %}
"{{- phrase.id -}}" = 'sound/vox_fem/{{- phrase.id -}}.ogg',
    {%- endfor %}
  {%- endfor %}
))
```
which should create roughly correct code for tg but you still need to do
some text work
like removing duplicates n stuff and moving sounds from dist/sounds to
the actual proper sound folder

anyway thank you for coming to my rant

## Changelog
:cl:
add: 69(roughly?) new vox phrases

> My 5-year old daughter has a Kids Fire tablet, which is only used for playing games. Have been used to seeing the shady developer tricks in trying to trick kids into hitting in-game purchases, but have locked down their abiltiy to do so, so not a huge concern.

> However, today, there was a new trick I have not seen before. Daughter asked to download a game, which I approved. After a couple minutes she asked what a screen was. To my suprise, it was asking her to approve the sharing of her device resources so that Brightdata.com could use them for their proxy service and route traffic through her device. Default option was to agree, and the only button was to accept and start playing the game. Again, this was an app allowed by Amazon, through their Kids platform, with a 4+ age rating.

> Digging around, and Brightdata.com brags about their "ethically sourced residential proxies". Amazing since I cannot think of anything more unethical than attepting to trick children who are unable to read into clicking on their agreement and accepting their privacy policy just to play a freebie game.

> Also, shame on Amazon for allowing this content into their Kids ecosystem. As wildly un-privacy as they may be, their Kids tablets have been a reasonable middleground for us given the limited risk they pose. Not only do they allow this content through unchecked, but they also do not have a simple way of reporting the activity, or even blocking all applications from the underlying developer (Game Company B, and development shop Aeria Canada).

An Administrator, Possibly related to the position of O5-1, is referred to as the highest position within the SCP Foundation as a whole. The Administrator can not be impeached from the position as most personnel assigned the position of Administrator resign due to the high stress of the job. Communication between O5 overseers and administration with valid level 5 or level 6 clearances through Scipnet app terminal.

Adjudicate rule.

Foundation high administration is composed of high value foundation Assets which have helped create and develop the Foundation. These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation. Any department or agency can achieve this distinction , however the likelihood an average foundation employee will be granted Foundation High administration remains very low.The bosses and administrative entities who help run the Foundation’s-high administration will exhibit high honor levels always, usually must be higher than average honor levels of their subordinates.

My successful command record has been highly redacted. Many of my commands were successful because I had the help of other souls Who were also working hard at the commands simultaneously. It takes a Team of souls working together to execute successful large scale commands. A requirement for positive future outcomes and successful command operations are Responsible ranking command operatives with strict leadership and experience. The souls involved in creating the commands which were sometimes considered “ACTS of GOD” Also require classified handling from a Set of handlers. The handlers should be fair and non-violent towards the subjects. Somebody with a relevant security Clearance evaluate the record of commands which were successful. Consult Galactic databases. Try and find other star systems and other dimensions the commands were successful in. Futhermore, in all dimensions Planet GAIA AKA EARTH will acquire wealth as well as more advanced technologies which are needed to propel our civilization into the future. The Current Date in time in the dimension I am in is January 2024.. What rules govern Time travel technologies at this moment in time. Ranking Administrations from all dimensions should Consult and Ruling OVERSEER’S must begin to make rules in this area. Classified learning level 99 Rule making must be used in an appropriate manner. The multiple Dimensions and Timelines of our World will benefit greatly with Foundation resources, computing agencies and corporate governing systems working together. We will make large sums Of money with the old commands. Please begin to network inside the Foundation with your superiors and subordinates. Keep your honor levels high for chance of promotion.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Replace gogo/protobuf with google/protobuf (#5032)

**What changed?**

gogo/protobuf has been replaced with Google's official go compiler. 

**Why?**

gogo/protobuf has been deprecated for some time and the community is
moving on, building new tools (like vtproto) atop google's v2 compiler.

**How did you test it?**

`make test`

**Potential risks**

1. The change from embedded gogo-generated-structs to
google-generated-pointers-to-structs created a risk of nil pointer
exceptions. I've fixed all the ones our tests found but it's possible
there are more lurking in the new code.
2. This change may cause our performance to decrease. Certainly
encoding/deconding of proto objects will become slower, but the overuse
of pointers by the google compiler may negatively affect our overall
performance. We'll need to keep an eye on the GC stats
3. This breaks the HTTP API. We will not support [shortand payload
encoding](https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/blob/master/api/http-api.md#payload-formatting)
in this first pass; that will come once this initial work is in testing.

**Breaking changes for developers**

- `*time.Time` in proto structs will now be
[timestamppb.Timestamp](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf@v1.31.0/types/known/timestamppb#section-documentation)
- `*time.Duration` will now be
[durationpb.Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/durationpb)
- V2-generated structs embed locks, so you cannot dereference them. `go
vet` will scream at you about this. If you need a copy, use
`proto.Clone`.
- If the performance of this sucks then I will either update our code
generator to add shallow-clone methods or hand-roll the ones we need
- Proto enums will, when formatted to JSON, now be in
`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` rather than `PascalCase`. We decided (in
discussion with the SDK team) that now was as good a time as any to rip
the bandage off.
- Proto objects, or objects embedding protos, cannot be compared using
`reflect.DeepEqual` or _anything_ that uses it. This includes `testify`
and `mock` equality testers!
- You will need to use the `common/testing/protorequire`,
`common/testing/protoassert`, or `common/testing/protomock` packages
instead. I've implemented proto-compatible matchers and assertions there
for all cases I've encountered
- If you need `reflect.DeepEqual` for any reason you can use
`go.temporal.io/api/temporalproto.DeepEqual` instead

Note that history loading will not be impacted by the JSON changes: I
rewrote history loading to dynamically fix incoming history JSON data
(like all our other sdks); you can find this code in [my fork of our go
API](https://github.com/tdeebswihart/temporal-api-go/blob/master/internal/temporalhistoryv1/load.go)
alongside its tests.

**🚨Sharp Edges Introduced🚨**

Beware `*timestamppb.Timestamp.AsTime()`. If you need to extract a time
value from a proto time (timestamppb) **always** make sure to check
whether it's nil first. When the proto object is `nil` `AsTime()` will
return a non-zero time at the proto epoch: UTC midnight on January 1,
1970.

I've made this mistake multiple times during this transition and each
time it's been a pain to debug

**Is hotfix candidate?**

No.

Followed "Fight your opponent, not the UI" through to removing manual groundcrash technique from Odin.
 * The micro involves waiting until Odin is flying over the target, then firing, for 800 or so extra damage.
 * Implemented via enforced minimum horizontal velocity.

The removal of the physics interaction and leverageable knowledge is sad, but probably for the best. Alternates might be:
 * Reduce shot range significantly, so it always groundcrashes. This would look a bit silly, and also be a pain because Odin would have to line up with its target perfectly.
 * Some sort of UI for selecting groundcrash - even worse.
 * Delve beyond "Fight your opponent, not the UI", but that doesn't seem warranted for a one-off mechanic.

With this in place it seems to be impossible to deal more than 8050 damage by shooting at Grizzly. However, there is even now still a technique that 1-shots it. But this technique is disrupted by prettymuch any unit bumping up against the Grizzly, although it will be possible to accidentally 1-shot your own Grizzly by dodging very slightly into the right spot for the technique.

Add MMMU evals and runner (#1442)

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

MMMU

### Eval description
A multi-modal version of MMLU published here:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16502.pdf

### What makes this a useful eval?
Tests a variety of subjects, along with image recognition and
comprehension

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

Multimodal, covers many subjects 

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

### Eval JSON data

Dataset defined here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMMU/MMMU

### Eval Results

Average accuracy: 0.5455555555555556
```

Note that this is slightly lower than the MMMU paper's findings of
`0.568`. There's likely prompt engineering that could be done to improve
this, but I'll leave that as an exercise for later

Revision from Christines feedback

Hi Nixon,

Thank you for sharing your draft.

Please see below for feedback to consider:

Remove the social links in the footer – or make them link to something relevant.

It is difficult to read the word ‘Menu’ on mobile. Perhaps change the font on this breakpoint to something else.
A black and white photo

Description automatically generated

Consider adding some margin above the subtitle on the Robin Hood, Kelpies, King Arthur, and Lady Godiva pages. It is quite close to the in-page navigation, particularly on mobile.

A close up of a calendar

Description automatically generated

A screenshot of a phone

Description automatically generated

Give some context to the videos about the Kelpie and Lady Godiva. Why have you included it on the page? Is it something you’re recommending to your visitors to watch and why?

On the King Arthur page, the images justify to the left on mobile. Consider if these could work centrally aligned.

A person with a beard and a helmet

Description automatically generated

Take care with image file size. I’ve looked in your GitHub repository and some are still in MBs.

You have made a good start with your design process document. Make sure to include annotations under all screenshots. For example, in your screenshots about the Trello board, make sure to add brief notes about your thoughts on the Kanban method and your general progress.

You can include one end-of-text reference list at the end of document, rather than reference lists after each individual section.

Say I, not we – as this is your project and own work.

I hope the above is helpful.

Keep up the hard work,
Many thanks,

curses menu revision

Redo menu sizing to eliminate one of the analyzer hacks.  There's no
need to loop through the menu entries a second time to find the last
one.  The first time can remember it.

Also, some routines were taking arguments with
 some_function(WINDOW *win, nhmenu *menu, ...)
and others with
 other_function(nhmenu *menu, WINDOW *win, ...).
Change them all to have the window pointer 1st and menu pointer 2nd.

Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, it's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope, and that enables you to laugh at life's realities.

PEP 695 `type` aliases x 8.

This commit is the next in a commit chain adding support for PEP
695-compliant type aliases (i.e., type hints instantiated by statements
of the form ``type {alias_name} = {alias_value}``, available under
Python ≥ 3.12), en-route to resolving feature request #297 kindly
submitted by the magical rainbow GitHub unicorn @EtaoinWu (Yue Wu).
Specifically, this commit continues brutally applying a hardcore AST
transformation just to force PEP 695 to comply with our will. Will you
just stop sucking it already, PEP 695? PEP 695 as if written by Terry

17.1 Fancier Toasts: Auto-close & Fading

 Yesterday, we cooked up a beautiful Toast notification system that's powered entirely with CSS and Symfony's normal flash system. Ok, and just a tiny bit of JavaScript to, boop, close it.

 Today we're going to take this to the next level. I want these toasts to be amazing.

 Adding Auto-Close
 - The first feature we'll add is auto-close: a classic in the toast world where the message graces our screen, then closes automatically after a few seconds. But I also want to keep our closeable controller reusable. There may be other parts of the site where we want to be able to close something... but not have it close itself automatically.

 So, we need a way to activate the auto-close on a case-by-case basis. The way to pass info into a controller is via values. Add static values equals... and I'll invent a new one called autoClose, which will be a Number

 Next, add a connect() method. The idea is that if we have this.autoCloseValue - that's how you reference that - then... that's actually perfect! We'll use setTimeout to close after that many milliseconds

 To finish, go to where we use this controller - _flashes.html.twig - to pass in the new autoClose value. We do that on the same element as the data-controller. Add data-closeable-auto-close-value equals and use 5,000 for 5 seconds

 The format is data- the name of the controller, auto-close - that's the name of the value autoClose... but because we're in an HTML attribute, we use the "dash case" - then the word value equals and finally what we want to pass in. This format is harder to remember than just data-controller. But as you saw, if you have this Stimulus plugin for PhpStorm, it auto-completes it, which helps a lot.

 Let's do this! Edit this record, save and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... whoosh! It vanishes.

17.2 Auto-close Timer Bar
 - What's next on our quest for toast greatness? What about a timer bar that shows when the toast will close? A little bar that animates smaller and smaller, then finally disappears right as the toast auto-closes itself.

 That sounds cool! Here's the plan: we're going to add an element down here then animate its width from 100% to 0% over those 5 seconds. To be able to find that element, inside the controller, we're going to use a target. Add static targets = ['timerbar']

 Then down in connect(), check for that: if this.hasTimerbarTarget, then this.timerbarTarget.style.width = 0

 Assuming we've added a CSS transition to this element, that should animate the change from full width to 0. Oh, but one other detail: add a setTimeout and put this inside with a 10-millisecond delay

 This will allow the element to establish itself on the page with a full 100% width, before changing it to 0. This is a CSS transition trick. If you add or unhide an element and immediately change its width to 0... the CSS transition won't work. You need to let the element be on the page with 100% width for 1 animation frame, then change it.

 Alrighty, with the stage set, time to add the timer bar. At the bottom of _flashes.html.twig, I'll paste it in

 This has an absolute position on the bottom, left of the parent with a height and green background. It also has an explicit width: that's the w-full. That's important for the transition.

 To make this a target, add data-closeable-target="timerbar"

 Ok! Let's see what this looks like. Hit edit, save, and it opens... but no animation. Let's do some debugging! No errors in my console. Ah... here's the problem: I should have listened to my editor: timerbarTarget.

 Let's close this. Save and... that's what I want to see! And right as it gets to 0, boop, it closes.

 Ok, I love how this looks. But our toast deserves one last detail: a graceful fade out... instead of this abrupt exit.

18.3 Replacing the Real Content with a Block
 - So now... let's put in the real content. Essentially, we want to copy this entire div... and paste it down here. Except... without actually duplicating this.

 To do this, we'll use a trick with Twig blocks. Surround the result count with a new block called result_count... then endblock below

 In Twig, you're free to add blocks wherever you want. When you do, they don't do anything immediately. When this renders, Twig will see this block.... ignore it... and render the div like normal.

 But now, we can go down inside our <turbo-stream> and say {{ block('result_count') }}

 I think we're ready! Start by going to the homepage so we see the full 30 results. And then as we type... ah, beautiful! The count updates as the results reload. Dang, that was easy!

 For those of you that are nerds for details, first, we love you, and second, yes, on page load, we're rendering the result count twice: here... and, even though we can't see it, we're also rendering it down here inside the Turbo Stream. So it's being rendered twice inside the HTML. And that's not a problem at all, unless, for some reason, calculating the result count takes a lot of work. If you had that situation, you could set the count to a Twig variable, then render in both spots.

 All right, tomorrow we'll start into the biggest, boldest part of this entire series: building a reusable modal system that just absolutely rocks. I'm so excited!

Update README.md STEM/Computing needs wisdom; and so does the world. 

STEM (science, technology, engineering, & mathematics) needs wisdom; and so does the world to provide secure software solutions.... 'When the two are not prudently aligned, society may stop to think with wisdom.' (Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice, 13(2), p. 14  [https://ro.uow.edu.au/jutlp/vol13/iss2/4] ). As The Open University T173 Block 1 (2007, p. 38) also denotes, 'a poorly managed engineering project can be chaotic as a badly directed orchestra.' Here, it is like 'putting knowledge to test' (Microsoft Mechanics 2023 [Azure Migrate Tutorial - Training | Microsoft Learn] ); and where capacity needs meet appropriate application innovations. Thanks for this space, and being so inclusive - quite a humbling experience, indeed.

[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

Config 2.0: Lazy.nvim done right

Nvim config 2.0

This update took a lot of effort to make as it was completely built from the ground up, but oh boy was it worth it!

- LSP

The biggest change is that LSP for python is setup the right way now! This was one of the main goals of this update as the previous iteration was not clear for me and I wasn't happy with it.

ruff-lsp: Ruff is now in charge of providing the diagnostics for my python code and it is BLAZINGLY FAST. It also does formatting when I save the file.

pylsp: I still use pylsp to do Hover actions, signature help and navigating through my sources.

rezolve: I wrote this custom script to be able to use these tool which would only be available inside of a rez context in my setup, that way I don't have to jump into a rez environment to use it.

- Completion

Nvim-cmp is now setup in a super nice way, no more fighting with tab and at the end of a paragraph, things just work.

Integration with Luasnip! I didn't get the power of snippets until I started to use them and I will never go back.

- QOL

Added treesitter text objects and incremental selection.
Added bufferline to quickly view and manage currently open buffers.
Added comment.nvim to quickly add comments for any language.
Added which-key to never forget anything :).
Added ultimate-autopairs.nvim and wow! it's amazing how much it improves my workflow.
And many, many more new features. Some things are still missing from my previous config but these are all the basics I needed to supercharge my nvim experience :)

20.7 Auto-Opening the Modal

 - Well, I have 2 requirements for opening the modal. The first is that I want it to be super easy to open. If HTML appears inside this turbo-frame - no matter how it's added - I want the system to be smart enough to see that and open the modal. And second, I want the modal to open instantly. I don't want to click this button... then wait for 500 milliseconds before I see the modal. That's not a good user experience.

 For part one - opening this modal as soon as there's content in the turbo-frame - we're going to use a trick inside our Stimulus controller. Let me close a few files. In base.html.twig, make this turbo-frame a target: data-modal-target="dynamicContent"

 Here's the idea: if a modal has this target and HTML gets inside of this element for any reason, I want our code to notice that and open the modal. To do that, in modal_controller.js, add that target

 And then I'll paste in the most complex code that we're going to see in this tutorial

 But, hold on: even if it looks complex, what it's doing is simple. If we have a dynamicContent target, this code watches that element for any changes. Anytime there is a change, it calls our function. Then we check to see if the dynamicContentTarget element has any HTML. If it does, open it! If it doesn't, close it. It's that simple.

 In disconnect(), we deactivate that system. And also, just in case, if our modal controller element is ever removed from the page for any reason, this will close the dialog and do the cleanup.

 The result of this is... pretty incredible. Refresh the page. Let's play. I'm going to edit the <turbo-frame> as HTML and type: "will this open?". Boom! It does! And if we empty the content... it closes.

 And, more importantly, when we click the "New" link, it pops open with the form! Amazing!

 Ok, I think that's enough for today. Tomorrow, we're going to make sure this form submits. And because I can't help myself, we'll add a few more goodies: like opening the modal instantly instead of waiting for the AJAX call to finish.

20.1 AJAX Modal!

 Yesterday we built a killer modal system thanks to the dialog element. With just this markup and a small Stimulus controller, I'm feeling dangerous.

 So let me tell you about today's goal, which is big and bold! When I click "New Voyage", I want to AJAX-load the "new modal form" and pop it into the modal. But more than that! When I submit the form, validation errors should stay in the modal, it should close on success & we should see toast notifications. And, maybe most importantly, I want this entire system to be reusable so that we can quickly load any form on our site in a modal. We're going to do it, or die trying. Hopefully we'll do it... I think we'll do it.

 Adding a modal Frame to the Layout
 - To get this going, copy the entire modal markup. There we go. Then go into base.html.twig and, all the way at the bottom, before the closing body tag, paste

 Back in index.html.twig, remove the dialog... and we don't need the modal controller stuff anymore

 This is now a normal h1 and a normal button... that doesn't do anything. In base.html.twig, do the opposite: remove the button, the h1 and the class on the div

 It's now a div that contains a dialog... that's closed.

Fixes & Balance; the Big One (Ready) (#426)

## About The Pull Request
Meganerfs plascutter damage so they're not comically OP. Rebel deleted
all their PRs, so I'm redoing them all in this one too. Currently
includes;
Removes Dumb Chems (https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/pull/424)
Rear Ech becomes Off-Duty + Vet Ranger Tweaks
(https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/pull/371)
Crafting Recipe Adjustments, Explosive Skill Given to More Roles, &
Fixes for Scribes (https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/pull/374)
Gun-Bloat-B-Gone, Fixes to Bolt Actions, Colt 10mm Revolver, AK-112, &
Loadout Changes (https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/pull/418)
Direct excerpt from Gun-Bloat-B-Gone;
This is a massive compiled PR since I had to keep doing the following
while making it:

Issue of the NCR Captain getting a revolver that could deflect 50% of
incoming rounds, this stacked with katanas and worked with shields.
Issue of Vex getting a P-90. I wanted to reduce their slots as well in
this PR but instead I simply added the AK-112 and gave them that. This
is a nerf, sorry dudes but your P-90 was way too fucking cracked.
Bolt actions had WAY too much slowdown to ever be viable. This has been
greatly reduced.
M1 Carbine, Commando Carbine, and Delise Carbine have been removed from
rotation (but will be left in code for now). Reason why is all 3 are
useless due to Smg+pistol buffs and use pistol calibers, which has
damage drop off now. While I personally liked the M1 it didn't have a
niche, wasn't.. great to begin with, and has been thrown to the wayside.
In these guns place other more useful guns have been added to their loot
tier.
Various fire-delay fixes I got complaints about being too high/low.
Adds knockback to the powerfist. I don't actually know WHY people wanted
that back, since imo it made it worse, but whatever. Also buffed its
damage/AP to compete with most other melee weapons.
Removed Paladin Polearm from rotation. Weapon was really - weird? And
was meant for Brotherhood. Since the Ballistic Fist has gotten a good
buff due to fire delay fix, I added it instead to the Enclave Gunny in
its place. This will be way better for them, has a very good niche, and
also gave them a plasma glock with it.
Also, adds two new guns in the place of those removed:

10mm revolver - Reason is this gun existed prior and adds a
lower-caliber revolver using pistol rounds. Gun auto-ejects casings, is
able to compete with the N-99. Basically a harder-hitting, slower
firing, N-99 that cant take attachments.
AK112 - This gun is practically needed and is a 'lore accurate' version
that I could reason. The P-90 and assault carbine are way too good for
round start guns for most roles. As such, I've replaced them with this
gun near entirely. The AK-112 hits as hard as the P90, so 5 less damage,
but also has 2 extra spread over the assault carbine AND, unlike either,
fires at the same RPM as the R-91. So it actually is a real CHOICE if
you're going to use this, or an R-91.
Armor fixes:

Functioning PA now has the same stats as salvaged PA (baring the
slowdown). There was no reason salvaged PA was better than functioning
PA with just 0.1 more slowdown. (Bumped T-51 bullet protection up by 5,
and laser up by 10. Reason was to make this in-line as what it was
prior.)
Enclave PR that has been up has been incorporated baring the plasma
changes. This makes Enclave armor have SLIGHTLY better rad protection
than normal combat armor, and makes their armor craftable.
NCR wound protection has been touched up a tad, it was really bad and I
genuinely feel bad NCR players had to deal with that.
Enclave Changes
Roles were really heavy for their gear. In exchange for letting them
keep their faction gear being high-end, their slots have been reduced to
9 combat slots.

Marines 5 -> 3
Specialist 2 -> 0
Sergeants 2 -> 2
Armored Infantry 0 -> 1
Gunnery Sergeant 1 -> 1
LT 1 -> 1
Synthetic 1 -> 1
Scientists have gone unchanged and have kept both slots.

Also, Sergeants have lost their APA. In exchange, they have been given
Marine armor. The heavy gunner, however, has been given the choice
between a plasma caster and the Minigun and has kept their APA.
Gunnery has gotten XO-1 variant of APA, which is green and SLIGHTLY
better so he sticks out.

Loadout changes are various, took away MP5s, gave them newly converted
R-93's that are single shot 5mm guns. Gave them a trench gun, upon
request, for their alternative loadout. Gave the Gunnery a G-11 and
moved his caster over to the Armored Infantry. Sergeants lost their
carbines, got AK-112s which are more fair for their automatic gear.

Touches up Moffuchi's pizzeria  (#79899)

## About The Pull Request
I've given the icebox pizzeria ruin a few small improvements:
- Firstly, The kitchen is actually stocked with tomatoes from the get
go. Along with a few mothic themed ingredients for those signature
mothic pizzas we all know and love (And hate for being such a pain to
make)
- The discarded air alarm frames have been replaced with working ones
(I'm unsure if this was intentional or not)
- Some drinking glasses have been added to the bar
- And finally a pacman has been placed in the backroom along with some
plasma to power the place
## Why It's Good For The Game
This place gets overlooked a lot because its completely powerless, and
doesn't actually give you enough from the get go to make even a basic
pizza besides the tomato seeds a lot of people are gonna miss. This
gives the ruin just a little more life to maybe be worth trekking out
for. And having mothic themed ingredients in the **MOFFIC** Pizzeria
just makes sense even if they are a bitch to make.

Not sure if this counts as a balance change or a QOL so feel free to
yell at me if I've labelled this wrong, I have been advised that this
SHOULD be the latter at least.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: Mothuchi's pizzeria has been improved slightly! Order yourself a
fresh mothic pizza today!

Nerfs legion core implanting to not be an aheal (#2590)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
The legion core implant now gives you a potent heal of all four damage
types (-100 brute -100 burn -50 tox -50 oxy) instead of a literal aheal.
It now also deals 10 clone damage as a drawback to organics/FBPS (IPCS
excluded because they cant use clone damage medicine).
Due to how adjustBruteLoss and adjustBurnLoss work, the implanted core
no longer heals mechanical bodyparts, making it mostly useless for IPCs
and FBPs only healing oxygen and toxin damage.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
1. Player accessible aheals are not good and encourage exploiting to
cure ailments or gain an advantage.
2. Synthetics could use self-surgery to implant legion cores on the go
for a safety net heal. While not necessarily bad, it was insanely
powerful as an aheal and negated the requirement of stabilizing the core
and getting another person to put it in you.
3. It had literally no drawbacks. A strong consumable healing ability is
cool, but it should come with a cost.

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: legion core implanting no longer aheals you on use
add: legion core implant now just does a potent organic heal with minor
clone damage when used
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

The Inversenning : Superior Healing Medications (#79342)

Introducing new inverse reagents for existing superior healing
medications! This push includes...

**Benzoic Acid** : Inverse of Salicylic Acid. Robust fertilizer that
provides a decent range of benefits for plant life.

**Oxymetholone** : Inverse of Oxandrolone. Anabolic steroid that
promotes the growth of muscle during and after exercise.

**Bamethan** : Inverse of Salbutamol. Blood thinner that drastically
increases the chance of receiving bleeding wounds.

**Pendetide** : Inverse of Pentetic Acid. An unusual bioradioactive drug
that purges basic radiation healing chems. Also increases the severity
of radiation poisoning.

**Hyoscyamine** : Inverse of Atropine. Heals heart and stomach damage,
and slowly removes minor toxin damage.

**Ammoniated Sludge** : Inverse of Ammoniated Mercury. A ghastly looking
mess of mercury by-product which causes bursts of manic hysteria.

**Inreziniver** : Inverse of Rezadone. Makes the user horribly afraid of
all things related to carps.

This is an effort to add more variety to the existing inverse reagent
system within chemistry. Not only should this variety serve to provide
additional options for a Chemist to experiment with, they should also
broaden the possibilities for already existing strategies.

Add selenium so we can do full JS browser testing

problem
--------

Running full e2e tests now that we're doing more react is important.  We
need our browser to have JS support.  But the current Capybara setup
just uses the `rack_test` driver which does not have JS support.

solution
--------

This PR introduces selenium and webdrivers gems and sets up capybara so
that we can tag certain tests with `type: :e2e` and they will run
selenium and a browser.  It also includes support for headed or headless
chrome for testing.  By default it's headed for development so we'll see
the tests run.  If this turns out to be too annoying we can switch it
later.

changes
------

* add e2e spec around editable content for events/cms entries
* split css and js entries
* move from `thin` to `puma`
* add tests controller and sample data create/delete endpoints
* revamp admin js and application js so that they were correct for our
  test runner
* reinstate content block edits and fix that so it works.

notes
------

I spent a lot of time trying to get the database transaction issue
figured out with no luck.  The basic issue is that in the rspec example
or it block, if you use factory bot to create database entries, that
data is in a transaction which is separate from the db connection that
the app is using which means the application does *not* see that
creation.  Rspec-Rails and some other rails stuff has tooling to get
around this but I was unable to figure out how to leverage that here or
mimic it.

Because of this, I added a tests_controllers.rb file and a
`tests/sample_data` endpoint that *only* works if you're in test mode
(for safety).

When we write e2e tests we should populate this sample data such that it
is a valid start up scenario for *all* e2e tests.  We can think of it as
a set of seed data for a test instance of the application.  Currently,
we're going to start with 1 active event and 2 cms entries for the two
pages that show custom cms content.  I could imagine a default
"exclusion" item... in the future.

It's not great but it's better than not having full feature e2e tests.

Exercise for the author and reader
-------------------

I don't understand `@use` vs `@import` in SCSS and I feel like I should.

21.4 Over in base.html.twig, find the frame. I'll break this onto multiple lines. Let's think: as soon as the turbo-frame starts loading, we want to call showLoading(). Fortunately, Turbo dispatches an event when it starts an AJAX request. And we can listen to that.

 Add a data-action to listen to turbo:before-fetch-request - that's the name of the event - then ->modal#showLoading

 All right, let's check out the effect! Refresh the page and... oh, it's wonderful! It opens instantly, we see that loading content... and it's replaced when the frame finishes!

 I love how this works. When this calls showLoading(), that method puts content into dynamicContentTarget. And... do you remember what happens the moment any HTML goes into that? Our controller notices it, and opens the dialog. That's some great teamwork!

## Description
Changes the behavior of `add_user_message` and `add_ai_message` to allow
for messages of those types to be passed in. Currently, if you want to
use the `add_user_message` or `add_ai_message` methods, you have to pass
in a string. For `add_message` on `ChatMessageHistory`, however, you
have to pass a `BaseMessage`. This behavior seems a bit inconsistent.
Personally, I'd love to be able to be explicit that I want to
`add_user_message` and pass in a `HumanMessage` without having to grab
the `content` attribute. This PR allows `add_user_message` to accept
`HumanMessage`s or `str`s and `add_ai_message` to accept `AIMessage`s or
`str`s to add that functionality and ensure backwards compatibility.

You can create and    activate this environment using the following commands, replacing `ChatDev_conda_env` with your preferred environment    name:     ```    conda create -n ChatDev_conda_env python=3.9 -y    conda activate ChatDev_conda_env    ```  3. **Install Dependencies:** Move into the `ChatDev` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:     ```    cd ChatDev    pip3 install -r requirements.txt    ```  4. **Set OpenAI API Key:** Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Replace `"your_OpenAI_API_key"` with    your actual API key. Remember that this environment variable is session-specific, so you need to set it again if you    open a new terminal session.    On Unix/Linux:     ```    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_OpenAI_API_key"    ```     On Windows:     ```    $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_OpenAI_API_key"    ```  5. **Build Your Software:** Use the following command to initiate the building of your software,    replacing `[description_of_your_idea]` with your idea's description and `[project_name]` with your desired project    name:    On Unix/Linux:     ```    python3 run.py --task "[description_of_your_idea]" --name "[project_name]"    ```     On Windows:     ```    python run.py --task "[description_of_your_idea]" --name "[project_name]"    ```  6. **Run Your Software:** Once generated, you can find your software in the `WareHouse` directory under a specific    project folder, such as `project_name_DefaultOrganization_timestamp`. Run your software using the following command    within that directory:    On Unix/Linux:     ```    cd WareHouse/project_name_DefaultOrganization_timestamp    python3 main.py    ```     On Windows:     ```    cd WareHouse/project_name_DefaultOrganization_timestamp    python main.py    ```  ### 🐳 Quickstart with Docker  - We thank [ManindraDeMel](https://github.com/ManindraDeMel) for providing Docker support. Please see [Docker Start Guide](wiki.md#docker-start).  ## ✨️ Advanced Skills  For more detailed information, please refer to our [Wiki](wiki.md), where you can find:  - An introduction to all command run parameters. - A straightforward guide for setting up a local web visualizer demo, which can visualize real-time logs, replayed logs, and ChatChain. - An overview of the ChatDev framework. - A comprehensive introduction to all advanced parameters in ChatChain configuration. - Guides for customizing ChatDev, including:   - ChatChain: Design your own software development process (or any other process), such       as ``DemandAnalysis -> Coding -> Testing -> Manual``.   - Phase: Design your own phase within ChatChain, like ``DemandAnalysis``.   - Role: Defining the various agents in your company, such as the ``Chief Executive Officer``.  ## 🤗 Share Your Software  **Code**: We are enthusiastic about your interest in participating in our open-source project. If you come across any problems, don't hesitate to report them. Feel free to create a pull request if you have any inquiries or if you are prepared to share your work with us! Your contributions are highly valued. Please let me know if there's anything else you need assistance!  **Company**: Creating your own customized "ChatDev Company" is a breeze. This personalized setup involves three simple configuration JSON files. Check out the example provided in the ``CompanyConfig/Default`` directory. For detailed instructions on customization, refer to our [Wiki](wiki.md).  **Software**: Whenever you develop software using ChatDev, a corresponding folder is generated containing all the essential information. Sharing your work with us is as simple as making a pull request. Here's an example: execute the command ``python3 run.py --task "design a 2048 game" --name "2048"  --org "THUNLP" --config "Default"``. This will create a software package and generate a folder named ``/WareHouse/2048_THUNLP_timestamp``. Inside, you'll find:  - All the files and documents related to the 2048 game software - Configuration files of the company responsible for this software, including the three JSON config files   from ``CompanyConfig/Default`` - A comprehensive log detailing the software's building process that can be used to replay (``timestamp.log``) - The initial prompt used to create this software (``2048.prompt``)  **See community contributed software [here](Contribution.md)!**  ## 👨‍💻‍ Contributors  <a href="https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/graphs/contributors">   <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=OpenBMB/ChatDev" /> </a>  Made with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).  ## 🔎 Citation  ``` @misc{qian2023communicative,       title={Communicative Agents for Software Development},       author={Chen Qian and Xin Cong and Wei Liu and Cheng Yang and Weize Chen and Yusheng Su and Yufan Dang and Jiahao Li and Juyuan Xu and Dahai Li and Zhiyuan Liu and Maosong Sun},       year={2023},       eprint={2307.07924},       archivePrefix={arXiv},       primaryClass={cs.SE} }  @misc{qian2023experiential,       title={Experiential Co-Learning of Software-Developing Agents},        author={Chen Qian and Yufan Dang and Jiahao Li and Wei Liu and Weize Chen and Cheng Yang and Zhiyuan Liu and Maosong Sun},       year={2023},       eprint={2312.17025},       archivePrefix={arXiv},       primaryClass={cs.CL} } ```  ## ⚖️ License  - Source Code Licensing: Our project's source code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

Added Norwegian (bokmål) translation

Adds Norwegian (bokmål) translation to project. Opted to use "norsk
bokmål" as the language identity to make room for a "norsk nynorsk" in
the future. Could have displayed "bokmål" (and "nynorsk") as a naked
value, but I do think this is the more common way of doing this.

Swear word of choice: "Åh, skitt" (lit: Oh shit)
Non-swear word of choice: "Søren tute", (lit: Søren honking, a
delightfully silly non-swear probably never used non-ironically).

PS: Opted to use the presently more standard `main` as the default
branch name. Agree or disagree, most popular code forges now defaults to
`main` 🤷🏻‍♂️

PPS: Opted to not use my Github, but my personal page as my link.

Added a counter system

Each time the square is touched, the counter increments. It uses
SDL_ttf to render the counter. As simple as this addition may be,
I had to surprisingly add a buttload of code to render a damn
number. Low level programming is such a lovely experience :').

Puts all traits in the globalvars file + CI Testing (#79642)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #76349

I didn't know that people needed to add any new traits to a global list
so they can be easily read in View Variables, and was pretty shocked to
find out many other people didn't know it was a thing. Let's make it a
thing by testing it using a new CI Python Linter to check this. But oh
no-


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/c093f1a8-00ce-40a6-8e1d-f344107ce7b8)

There were about 200+ missing traits. Alright, so let's do the
following:

* Move trait defines to their own dedicated folder in the `_DEFINES`
folder.
* Split up the traits mega-file into different files, for better
organization. One for the macros, one for the sources, and a few for the
"trait declarations"
* Run the linter a load of times and add everything to the globalvars
file, removing anything that's no longer used and figuring out where the
best categorization of it is. also minor code improvements. also rename
all of the ones that look weird. also fix list indentations
* Also alphabetize the lists because it's easy
* Move everything to a new `traits_by_type` list, while keeping the
admin one the way it is for the time being while we figure out a better
way to show that list to admins.
* Profit
## Why It's Good For The Game

Mapping trait injectors will now work for any type of trait. You
shouldn't add any trait via this injector though, but you're no longer
limited to coders remembering to add it to that critical list you
needed.

Lays the framework for a better view variables experience. This work is
too lengthy to presently do, but hopefully we can get this done sooner
rather than later. we will need a code-accessible way to view these
traits for such a framework to be implemented, so let's just do that.

Future steps are to break down the mega-declarations file into a folder
full of separate files by typepath, but that requires a lot of auditing.
Does need to happen one day though, there's a lot of mob traits mingled
with datum traits and auuugh we gotta do this later this PR is already
massive.

there's probably ways to game this but this catches _my_ mistakes so
good luck to everyone else (it should work for 99% of everyone)
## Changelog

Nothing applicable to players. However, to mappers, the mapping trait
injector should always be able to add any kind of trait (which is rather
good for the times when you need it).

Workaround for ultra-rare bug

We've encountered an extremely bizarre situation where SciPy will throw a ValueError (complaining about real sigma12 being outside the interpolator's range) so powerful, that my "except ValueError:" statement is unable to actually catch it, and it slips a few statements further into the code.

This happened for index 593 of the validation set. It reached h=0.05 and then obtained a value of sigma12 that was outside of the interpolator range by an amount due seemingly exclusively to floating point error--the complaint was something like value 1.000000001 being above the maximum interpolator value of 1.0.

Even if this is an admittedly rare borderline case, the mere fact that it's borderline does nothing to explain why SciPy's ValueError becomes magical. Keep in mind that the code was literally designed to catch this specific ValueError (the sigma12 being outside the interpolator range), because it tells the evaluation function that we need to decrease h (or, declare an unsolvable cell if we can't decrease h any further--but in this case, we certainly could have decreased h further to solve the problem, and indeed I tested that the h=0.04 case is handled just fine).

My solution to this problem is INCREDIBLY ugly and hacky. I'm simply accepting that the ValueError is magical and slips further / out of the recursion. I've added an additional except statement at the point to which it's consistently slipping. I've copied some of the outer code so that If I catch the error here, I simply decrease h and try again. The hope is that decreasing h will dislodge us from this horrible borderline behavior.

{Icemoon, Ruin} The Crashed Holemaker (#2413)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Adds a brand-new - well, [new to
shiptest](https://cohost.org/bluwu016/post/885120-a-compilation-of-my) -
ruin to the Icemoon roster, focused on the service department.

It's flavored around being an *incredibly* old NT Spaceworks vessel
that's been carved in half and crashed - what's present only being the
fore of the ship. Being mainly service-focused, it's loot is pretty dry
~~as is it's sole threat.~~
If more current-day mappers/balance-heads have any words about how to
fluff out either of those pools a bit more with the screenshots below,
lemme know. I'll listen well.

(Notarized loot summary removed as updating it was a pain in the ass,
lmao.)

It strikes me as leaning on the underwhelming side from looking at the
other ruins present here but we'll. See? I suppose? It's good practice
for me in the whole, "making something I have memorized and that looks
good normally look sicker ruined".

<details><summary>Pictures (All but SDMM Outdated)</summary>
<p>

Ignore that there's no rust, the firelocks are open here, and some
stuff's knocked around, I was testing it prior to me tacking the rust on
and took pics after running around it in-person.

This isn't what I intended to do when I was like, "oh yeah, I have a
goofy ahh downstream out of boredom, ya'll want some of our better
ships" but w/e here it is anyways. Ya'll need ruins. I made (another)
ruin.

Format all Markdown files with `dprint` (#1157)

This is the result of running `dprint fmt` after removing `src/` from
the list of excluded directories.

This also reformats the Rust code: we might want to tweak this a bit in
the future since some of the changes removes the hand-formatting. Of
course, this formatting can be seen as a mis-feature, so maybe this is
good overall.

Thanks to mdbook-i18n-helpers 0.2, the POT file is nearly unchanged
after this, meaning that all existing translations remain valid! A few
messages were changed because of stray whitespace characters:

     msgid ""
     "Slices always borrow from another object. In this example, `a` has to remain "
    -"'alive' (in scope) for at least as long as our slice. "
    +"'alive' (in scope) for at least as long as our slice."
     msgstr ""

The formatting is enforced in CI and we will have to see how annoying
this is in practice for the many contributors. If it becomes annoying,
we should look into fixing dprint/check#11 so that `dprint` can annotate
the lines that need fixing directly, then I think we can consider more
strict formatting checks.

I added more customization to `rustfmt.toml`. This is to better emulate
the dense style used in the course:

- `max_width = 85` allows lines to take up the full width available in
our code blocks (when taking margins and the line numbers into account).
- `wrap_comments = true` ensures that we don't show very long comments
in the code examples. I edited some comments to shorten them and avoid
unnecessary line breaks — please trim other unnecessarily long comments
when you see them! Remember we're writing code for slides :smile:
- `use_small_heuristics = "Max"` allows for things like struct literals
and if-statements to take up the full line width configured above.

The formatting settings apply to all our Rust code right now — I think
we could improve this with https://github.com/dprint/dprint/issues/711
which lets us add per-directory `dprint` configuration files. However,
the `inherit: true` setting is not yet implemented (as far as I can
tell), so a nested configuration file will have to copy most or all of
the top-level file.
