[MIRROR] Fixes all antag datum moodlets being removed when any single antag datum is removed [MDB IGNORE] (#19237)

* Fixes all antag datum moodlets being removed when any single antag datum is removed (#73305)

## About The Pull Request

All antag datums operated under the `antag_moodlet` mood category, which
is clearly an issue when you can (and commonly) have multiple antag
datums of different types on your mob.

New antag datums of different type will now no longer override older
antag datum moodlets, now they will stack. This means traitor
revolutionaries are the most zealous folk on the station.

This has a few potential oversights down the line:
- Someone adds an antag datum players can have duplicates of, and also
has a moodlet associated
- Re-used moodlets in antag datums that can easily be stacked will be
noticed
- Most solo antags used `focused` right now, but none can stack outside
of admemes

But I don't think it's an issue for now.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Prevents a quick revolution from stripping you of your joy.

Fixes #67313

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
fix: Revolutionary Heretics and Cultists Traitors no longer lose all of
their joy in life after being de-converted from their respective causes.
/:cl:

* Fixes all antag datum moodlets being removed when any single antag datum is removed

Station Trait: Spider Infestation (#73893)

## About The Pull Request

Hate having your cables eaten by mice? Nanotrasen have heard your
complaints and settled on a natural, _organic_, and eco-friendly
solution.

When this station trait is active, roundstart and event mouse spawns
have a chance to instead be replaced with duct spiders (both will exist,
it doesn't remove mice).
Duct spiders are largely harmless to humans, actively hunt other
maintenance creatures (such as mice), and have only one _tiny_ downside.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/224345781-2627be98-67f2-4cab-ac40-c6c9b35ea909.png)

These mobs can also sometimes be spawned by a minor scrubber clog event.

As a side note, all spider basic mobs with AI (except Araneus) will now
try to automatically fill a small area around them with webs.

Also I made it so that mobs will ignore their random_walking behaviour
if they're engaged in a `do_after`, just in case.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Adds a little bit of variety to things which can slightly annoy you in
maintenance.
Spiders will automatically make places they live in look like spiders
live there.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: A station trait which sometimes populates maintenance with small
spiders. You can wear them as a hat if you wanted to have a spider on
your head for some reason.
add: Spider mobs will automatically start webbing up their environment.

Mapgen fixes and speedups (ignore the branch name. I'm dumb) (#1637)

## About The Pull Request

Alters the structure of map/planet generation to squash some bugs and
improve performance.

Previously, planet maps were generated by placing the ruin first, and
THEN generating the turfs according to the map_generator datum. This has
been adjusted -- now, turfs are generated WITHOUT objects such as
mobs/flora, the ruin is placed, and THEN the objects are added (turfs
are "populated"). In conjunction with the addition of needed
AfterChange() calls to update the atmos adjacency of the generated
turfs, this ensures that planet atmos acts correctly surrounding ruins.

When deleting reservations (such as the deletion of planets after
undocking), all objects on the planet are rounded up in a list and
qdeleted. Although this causes a small lag spike, it SHOULD prevent
items from hanging out inside the edges of planets.

There's a feature to change the default baseturf of a virtual level,
ZTRAIT_BASETURF, that we now use. This should cut down on the instances
where a ruin on a planet is blown up and there's space underneath (might
still happen on asteroids, because the baseturf there is still space; I
didn't want space turfs without space as their baseturf).

Overmap encounter areas aren't global anymore (they no longer have the
flag UNIQUE_AREA). Don't fucking add the flag UNIQUE_AREA to anything
that should have weather in it, because if that area gets added anywhere
else that _actually respects the flag_ you'll end up with cross-planet
weather, because weather code sucks. This didn't cause bugs before,
because the flag wasn't respected; it will now.

The biome assoc list has been moved into the map generator datum, and
all encounters now generate using a map generator that either uses a
biome or replaces everything with a single turf. This prevents
duplication of cave generation code and makes dynamic overmap object
code slightly easier to understand.

Some systems have been altered to improve performance; many of these
changes are rather small, like the changes to turf population (mob
placement now uses a stack of recently-created mobs to check if there
are any nearby, instead of checking everything within 12 turfs; I've yet
to add ruin mobs to these stacks to avoid placing mobs near ruin mobs)
or lighting objects (removed a single line that changed the color of the
lighting object on init).

Starlight has been altered, so that small turf changes near space turfs
don't need to check as many nearby turfs and so that large turf changes
can be batched to prevent further recalculation. This is probably
responsible for the biggest performance increase.

Smoothing groups are cached before sorting instead of after, to prevent
sort calls on many atom inits; /tg/station uses a unit test to avoid
needing to sort at runtime ever, but I couldn't figure out how to do
that without larger changes or writing a unit test that attempted to
instance every atom once, which would be an undertaking of its own.

Gas strings have been similarly altered, and now their interpretation
defaults to copying from a cached, immutable version of the mix encoded
by the string. This avoids the significant overhead caused by repeated
calls to params2list(). Auxmos has a better solution to this,
__auxtools_parse_gas_string(), but our current custom build of Auxmos
doesn't support it.

There are a few other small changes that I'm probably forgetting about
and you should yell at me to read my own fucking code and tell you what
else I changed.

- [ ] I affirm that I have tested all of my proposed changes and that
any issues found during tested have been addressed.

I still need to manually check each planet type to make sure they aren't
fucked up, I should probably do some proper profiling comparisons.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fewer weird bugs, things generate faster, better* code.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Ruins don't sometimes start in hard vacuum anymore; planet turfs
now share atmos correctly.
fix: There hopefully shouldn't be any random stray objects sitting in
the edges of planets anymore.
fix: Planets now (hopefully) have the correct baseturfs (more or less).
When you bomb a ruin on a planet, it probably won't break through to
space anymore.
refactor: Planet generation has been refactored, improving performance
somewhat.

# Tests + Formatting

Haven't even looked at stdlib `tests.nu` yet.

Other todos:
* address module todos.
* integrate into std lib, rather than as standalone module. Somehow
arrange for `use .../standard_library/std.nu` to load this module
without having to put all the source in `std.nu`?
*  Maybe command should be `std dirs ...`?   
* what else do `enter` and `exit` do that this should do? Then deprecate
those commands.

Don't forget to add tests that cover your changes.

Make sure you've run and fixed any issues with these commands:

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to check standard code formatting (`cargo
fmt --all` applies these changes)
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used -A
clippy::needless_collect` to check that you're using the standard code
style
- `cargo test --workspace` to check that all tests pass

Fix Keek's Offset Sprites Finally (#5135)

Keekenox has fixed the pixel offsets for sprite assets, which is a
crucial improvement to the game. In the previous version, some sprites
appeared blurry and misaligned, making the game look unprofessional and
unpolished. With this commit, the sprites are correctly aligned,
improving the overall visual quality of the game. This is important
because it enhances the player experience and makes the game more
enjoyable.

Firstly, fixing the pixel offsets ensures that the sprites display
accurately across all devices and platforms. With the increasing
popularity of gaming on different devices, it is essential that the game
looks good and functions well across all of them. Inconsistent display
of assets can be frustrating for players and negatively impact their
experience. By addressing this issue, Keekenox has taken a step towards
creating a more accessible game, which can be played by a wider
audience.

Secondly, fixing the pixel offsets is important for the branding of the
game. The look and feel of the game are integral to creating a strong
brand image. The blurry and misaligned sprites make the game look less
polished and unprofessional. With the visual improvements from this
commit, the game now looks more visually appealing, and its brand image
is strengthened. This can lead to increased engagement, higher retention
rates, and better marketing opportunities.

Thirdly, by fixing the pixel offsets, Keekenox has made the game more
scalable. As the game grows and more assets are added, the risk of
misaligned and blurry sprites increases. By addressing this issue early
on, Keekenox has prevented potential headaches down the road, saving
time and resources in the long run. This demonstrates a commitment to
quality and attention to detail that players appreciate and respect.

Fourthly, fixing the pixel offsets is important for maintaining the
quality of the game. Players expect games to look and feel polished,
with attention given to even the smallest details. The misaligned and
blurry sprites detract from the overall quality of the game, leaving
players with a negative impression. By fixing this issue, Keekenox has
shown that they care about their players' experience and are committed
to delivering a high-quality game.

Lastly, fixing the pixel offsets has a direct impact on the player
experience. Games are meant to be enjoyable, and players want to immerse
themselves in a world that looks and feels great. Misaligned and blurry
sprites can be distracting and detract from the experience, making it
less enjoyable for the player. With the improvements made in this
commit, players can now enjoy the game without these distractions,
leading to increased satisfaction and potentially higher retention
rates.

In summary, fixing the pixel offsets for sprite assets is an important
improvement to the game. It ensures accurate display across all devices,
strengthens the brand image, improves scalability, maintains quality,
and enhances the player experience. Keekenox has demonstrated a
commitment to delivering a high-quality game, and players will
appreciate the attention to detail that went into this improvement.

Introducing KLapse - A kernel level livedisplay module v4.0:

Author: @tanish2k09 (email: tanish2k09.dev@gmail.com)

What is it?
Kernel-based Lapse ("K-Lapse") is a linear RGB scaling module that 'shifts' RGB based on time (of the day/selected by user), or (since v2.0) brightness. This concept is inspired from
LineageOS (formerly known as 'CyanogenMod') ROM's feature "livedisplay" which also changes the display settings (RGB, hue, temperature, etc) based on time.

Why did you decide to make this? (Tell me a story).
I (personally) am a big fan of the livedisplay feature found on LineageOS ROM. I used it every single day, since Android Lollipop. Starting from Android Nougat, a native night mode
solution was added to AOSP and it felt like livedisplay was still way superior, thanks to its various options (you could say it spoiled me, sure). I also maintained a kernel (Venom
kernel) for the device I was using at that time. It was all good until the OEM dropped support for the device at Android M, and XDA being XDA, was already working on N ROMs. The issue
was, these ROMs weren't LineageOS or based on it, so livedisplay was... gone. I decided I'll try to bring that feature to every other ROM. How would I do that? Of course! The kernel! It
worked on every single ROM, it was the key! I started to work on it ASAP and here it is, up on GitHub, licensed under GPL (check klapse.c), open to everyone :)

How does it work?
Think of it like a fancy night mode, but not really. Klapse is dependent on an RGB interface (like Gamma on MTK and KCAL on SD chipsets). It fetches time from the kernel, converts it to
local time, and selects and RGB set based on the time. The result is really smooth shifting of RGB over time.

How does it really work (dev)?
Klapse mode 1 (time-based scaling) uses a method void klapse_pulse(void) that should ideally be called every minute. This can be done by injecting a pulse call inside another method that
is called repeatedly naturally, like cpufreq or atomic or frame commits. It can be anything, whatever you like, even a kthread, as long as it is called repeatedly naturally. To execute
every 60 seconds, use jiffies or ktime, or any similar method. The pulse function fetches the current time and makes calculations based on the current hour and the values of the tunables
listed down below.

Klapse mode 2 (brightness-based scaling) uses a method void set_rgb_slider(<type> bl_lvl) where is the data type of the brightness level used in your kernel source. (OnePlus 6 uses u32
data type for bl_lvl) set_rgb_slider needs to be called/injected inside a function that sets brightness for your device. (OnePlus 6 uses dsi_panel.c for that, check out the diff for that
file in /op6)

What all stuff can it do?

1, Emulate night mode with the proper RGB settings
2, Smoothly scale from one set of RGB to another set of RGB in integral intervals over time.
3, Reduce perceived brightness using brightness_factor by reducing the amount of color on screen. Allows lower apparent brightness than system permits.
4, Scale RGB based on brightness of display (low brightness usually implies a dark environment, where yellowness is probably useful).
5, Automate the perceived brightness independent of whether klapse is enabled, using its own set of start and stop hours.
6, Be more efficient,faster by residing inside the kernel instead of having to use the HWC HAL like android's night mode.
7, (On older devices) Reduce stuttering or frame lags caused by native night mode.
8, An easier solution against overlay-based apps that run as service in userspace/Android and sometimes block apps asking for permissions.
9, Give you a Livedisplay alternative if it doesn't work in your ROM.
10, Impress your crush so you can get a date (Hey, don't forget to credit me if it works).

Alright, so this is a replacement for night mode?
NO! Not at all. One can say this is merely an alternative for LineageOS' Livedisplay, but inside a kernel. Night mode is a sub-function of both Livedisplay and KLapse. Most comparisons
here were made with night mode because that's what an average user uses, and will relate to the most. There is absolutely no reason for your Android kernel to not have KLapse. Go ahead
and add it or ask your kernel maintainer to. It's super-easy!

What can it NOT do (yet)?

1, Calculate scaling to the level of minutes, like "Start from 5:37pm till 7:19am". --TODO
2, Make coffee for you.
3, Fly you to the moon. Without a heavy suit.
4, Get you a monthly subscription of free food, cereal included.

All these following tunables are found in their respective files in /sys/klapse/

1. enable_klapse : A switch to enable or disable klapse. Values : 0 = off, 1 = on (since v2.0, 2 = brightness-dependent mode)
2. klapse_start_hour : The hour at which klapse should start scaling the RGB values from daytime to target (see next points). Values : 0-23
3. klapse_stop_hour : The hour by which klapse should scale back the RGB values from target to daytime (see next points). Values : 0-23
4. daytime_rgb : The RGB set that must be used for all the time outside of start and stop hour range.
5. target_rgb : The RGB set that must be scaled towards for all the time inside of start and stop hour range.
6. klapse_scaling_rate : Controls how soon the RGB reaches from daytime to target inside of start and stop hour range. Once target is reached, it remains constant till 30 minutes before
   stop hour, where target RGB scales back to daytime RGB.
7. brightness_factor : From the name itself, this value has the ability to bend perception and make your display appear as if it is at a lesser brightness level than it actually is at.
   It works by reducing the RGB values by the same factor. Values : 2-10, (10 means accurate brightness, 5 means 50% of current brightness, you get it)
8. brightness_factor_auto : A switch that allows you to automatically set the brightness factor in a set time range. Value : 0 = off, 1 = on
9. brightness_factor_auto_start_hour : The hour at which brightness_factor should be applied. Works only if #8 is 1. Values : 0-23
10. brightness_factor_auto_stop_hour : The hour at which brightness_factor should be reverted to 10. Works only if #8 is 1. Values : 0-23
11. backlight_range : The brightness range within which klapse should scale from daytime to target_rgb. Works only if #1 is 2. Values : MIN_BRIGHTNESS-MAX_BRIGHTNESS

#### Monday 2023-03-13 05:35:43 by Jonas Bernoulli

Distribute all back-ends with the emacsql package

There are two reasons for this.

- Going forward, packages that use `emacsql' and SQLite should use
  the best back-end that can be used with the Emacs instance in use,
  either `emacsql-sqlite-builtin`, `emacsql-sqlite-module`, or as a
  last resort `emacsql-sqlite'.

  That means that if we didn't bundle the back-end libraries with
  `emacsql' itself, these packages would have to depend on all three
  back-end packages in addition to `emacsql' itself.  (Alternatively
  they could not depend on any of the back-end packages, and instead
  make the user install the appropriate back-end, when they try to
  use the package.  That's a bad user experience and there likely
  would be bugs, making it even more painful.)

- EmacSQL is now distributed on NonGNU Elpa as well.  While we at
  Melpa encourages the creation of separate packages for optional
  extensions (which are not useful to all users, or which have
  additional dependencies) the Emacs maintainers prefer everything to
  be distribute as one package, even if that means that `defvar' and
  `declare-function' declarations are necessary to keep the compiler
  happy.

  I still think our way is usually better, but since three of the
  back-end libraries have to be distributed with the main package
  anyway, we might as well give in here and bundle the other three
  as well.

For the time being, we have to continue to *also* distribute the
back-end libraries as separate packages.

Several third-party packages depend on the existing `emacsql' and
`emacsql-sqlite' packages.  These packages should be updated to only
depend on `emacsql', but the latest released versions of these
packages will continue to depend on `emacsql-sqlite' as well.  If we
removed the recipe for that, that would remove the latest release of
that package from Melpa, not just the snapshot version.

This is the current roadmap:

0. Include all back-ends in `emacsql'.
1. Update dependant packages to only depend on `emacsql'.
2. Make changes to `emacsql', which are enabled by the former two
   steps, and which are blocking the creation of a new `emacsql'
   release.  (These changes are related to the addition of the
   additional SQLite back-ends.  So this is a bit of a chicken and
   egg problem, and this commit (0) is the first step to break out
   of that.)
3. Create an `emacsql' release.
4. Wait for new releases of all dependant packages.
5. Change the separate back-end packages to warn the user, asking
   them to remove all of these packages.
6. After waiting some more, remove the separate back-end packages.

While a back-end is installed as part of `emacsql' and as a separate
package, it is undefined which version is loaded, but until step (5)
the two versions should be the same, so it doesn't matter.

platform: always reconfigure IP routes even if removed externally

NML3Cfg is stateful, that means it remembers which address/route it
configured earlier. That is important because the API users of NML3Cfg
only say what the want to configure now, and NML3Cfg needs to remove
addresses/routes that it configured earlier but are no longer to be
present. Also, NetworkManager wants to allow the user to add
addresses/routes externally with `ip addr|route add` and NetworkManager
not removing it. This is a common use case for dispatcher scripts, but
in general, we want to allow other components to add addresses/routes.

We try something similar with the removal of routes/addresses managed by
NetworkManager. When NetworkManager adds a route/address, which later
disappears, then we assume that the user intentionally removed the
address/route and take the hint to not re-add it.

However, it doesn't work. It is problematic for two reasons:

- kernel can automatically remove routes. For example, deleting an IPv4
  address that is the prefsrc of a route, will cause kernel to delete
  that route. Sure, we may be unable to re-configure the route at this
  moment, but we shouldn't remember indefinitely that the route is
  supposed to be absent. Rather, we should re-add it when possible.

- kernel is a pain with validating consistencies of routes. For example,
  when a route has a nexthop gateway, then the gateway must be onlink
  (directly reachable), or kernel refuses to add it with "Nexthop has
  invalid gateway". Of course, when removing the onlink route kernel is
  fine leaving the gateway route behind, which it would otherwise refuse
  to add.
  Anyway. Such interdependencies for when kernel rejects adding a route
  with "Nexthop has invalid gateway" are non-trivial. We try to work
  around that by always adding the necessary onlink routes. See
  nm_l3_config_data_add_dependent_onlink_routes(). But if the user
  externally removed the dependent onlink route, and NetworkManager
  remembers to not re-adding it, then the efforts from
  nm_l3_config_data_add_dependent_onlink_routes() are ignored. This
  causes ripple effects and NetworkManager will also be unable to add the
  nexthop route.

Trying to preserve absence of routes that NetworkManager would like to
configure is not tenable. Don't do it anymore. There was anyway no
guarantee that on the next update NetworkManager wouldn't try to re-add
the route in question. For example, if the route came from DHCP, and the
lease temporarily went away and came back, then NetworkManager probably
would have (correctly) forgotten that the user wished that the route be
absent. This did not work reliably and it just causes problems.

Update Stylelint to v14, extend SCSS plugins, remove primer-* configs, resolve issues (#821)

This is a catch-all PR that modernizes and updates our Stylelint config, and resolves all open issues. This is a pretty big change - so I want to update all of our related dependencies in lockstep.

In particular, this PR

- [x] updates stylelint to `v14`
- [x] adds in the standard stylelint config for SCSS (`stylelint-config-standard-scss`)
- [x] swaps out `stylelint-config-prettier` for `stylelint-config-prettier-scss`
- [x] ~~properly update `@primer`-related plugins:~~ completely remove `primer` from our configuration
- [x] autofix, manually resolve, or disable all newly-introduced lint errors; **I've avoided manually resolving errors that would be a behavioural change**
- [x] re-runs `npm run format`

See the "next steps" section on some extra thoughts on disabling errors.

(implicitly, I'm also using node 16/the new package-lock format).

I've introduced several new disabled rules. Let me quickly explain what's going on; there are two categories of rules I've disabled:

1. rules that were temporary disables; they were frequent enough that I couldn't manually resolve them, but should be simple. **I plan on opening issues to re-enable each of these rules**, just after this PR
    - `declaration-block-no-redundant-longhand-properties`: this is just tedious and error-prone
    - `no-descending-specificity`: this one is tricky since it could have impacts on the cascade (though that seems unlikely)
    - `scss/no-global-function-names`: I think we need to [import map and then use `map.get`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64210390/sass-map-get-doesnt-work-map-get-does-what-gives), but I'll leave this as out of scope for now
2. rules that are long-term disables; due to the SASS-based nature of our theme, I think we'll keep these in limbo
    - `alpha-value-notation` causes problems with SASS using the `modern` syntax - literals like `50%` are not properly interpolated, and they cause formatting issues on the site
    - `color-function-notation` also causes problems with SASS, but in this case the `modern` syntax breaks SASS compilation; we're not alone (see this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71805735/error-function-rgb-is-missing-argument-green-in-sass)).

In addition, we have many inline `stylelint-disable` comments. I'd open a separate issue to audit them, especially since I think some disables are unnecessary.

**note: there hasn't been much other discussion, so I'm going to remove primer's stylelint config.**

If I do add `@primer/stylelint-config`, I get *a ton* of errors about now using `@primer`'s in-built SCSS variables. I imagine that we probably won't want to use these presets (though I could be wrong). In that case, I think we could either:

1. disable all of those rules
4. not use `@primer/stylelint-config`, since we're not actually using primer, and shift back to the standard SCSS config provided by Stylelint

~~Any thoughts here? I also don't have the original context as to why we do use the primer rules, perhaps @pmarsceill can chime in?~~

[FIX] website: redirect to case insensitive URL if not exact match

Before this commit, if a link to a page was not correct because of a
case mismatch, it would simply land on a 404 page.
While it's correct, as URL are case sensitive, it leads to a few bad UX
flow at the admin/editor level:
- Create a link in your page (on a text or a button eg), type an URL
  which does not exists (to create it after) like /Page
- Click on the link/button you just made, you are redirected to /Page
  which display a 404 with the "Create page" option (correct)
- When you click on that button, it will actually create a page with
  /page URL, leading to a mismatch between the URL you created and the
  page URL.
  Your link/button will still lead to a 404 URL as it points to /Page.

Since it's just a fallback when an exact URL match is not found, it
should not break anything and should not have bad impact at any level
(seo/speed etc).
Indeed:
- It's done through a 302 redirect
- `_serve_page()` is already a fallback case, so it will only make
  the `website.redirect` and 404 cases a bit slower due to the extra
  search query.

The only possible scenario seems to be if the user (mind the uppercase):
- Created a /Page page
- Created a redirect from /page to /another-page

In this case, /page won't land on /another-page but on /Page.
This flow seems unlikely and is not actually wrong either way.
At least, it certainly is less important than ensuring a case
insensitive fallback.

Finally, note that another solution would have been to either:
- Force page URL to lower case.
  -> This is not stable friendly, people might be relying on this to
     create pages with different casing:
     `/Batman-VII-The-Dark-Knight-Whatevers`, while not recommended,
     doesn't sounds idiot.
     On top of not being stable friendly, we probably want to keep
     offering this possibility
- Redirect all URLs to lowercase endpoints.
  -> This is obviously not stable and not Odoo's jobs. It should be
     something decided by the sysadmin and done at nginx (etc) level.

<!-- What does it change? What other things could this impact? -->

Gives back the ability for slimes to have a definitive sex. Cosmetic/visual things such as emotes/other stuff use the person's sex and not the gender and I feel like that the removal of slime's having sexes was just to show that the species refactor could handle unsexed species.

Workflow Repo Paths

Realized I didn't add the correct handling for where the repo is cloned from, I was supposed to add my own info in there, haha.

Not gonna lie, I've been using ChatGPT to help me out with learning these new tools, as they seem to be more confusing for me to understand than coding sometimes, geeez man. I see how they can speed things up, but they definitely take a while to fully dive into using in your own coding setup. Once you get on board though, it really is another level of cool. You just have to take that first leap! I guess I'm trying to do that with ChatGPT too, and it has shown itself to be very helpful to me already so far. I think my favorite thing about it is it's understanding in context for things you are asking it. It's less about keywords, and more about providing it with real context that it can break down and try to understand what you're trying to do. That's a really big thing to be able to break down. My thought about it is that it's still the same data that we're working with already (everything on the Internet), but it's a much more refined interface to be able to look at it through. The data's already out there, and now we have another tool to be able to look though, compare, and discern what we already know and have learned (as people, I guess I'd say). Of course the data on the Internet doesn't perfectly depict all of the information out in the world, but that's not ChatGPT's issue, that's because of what we've all decided to put up on the Internet in the first place. It also could be ChatGPT's fault for both parsing that Big-Data inaccurately, so I guess it's a bit 'lossless' on both sides, at least to how I'm thinking of it. If we as people can discern what we get out of our conversations with projects like ChatGPT, we can then *ourselves* also get the big picture from what it responds, since that's exactly what it's (GPT) doing also. I think this makes it "reliable-ish" in a way. I think navigating Wikipedia this way is also very smart. For how much data there is on a given resource you're looking at, I'd like to think that some majority of it is most likely credible. If you understand and accept that you don't know for sure though, than you can got to multiple different resources to try and see what each one represents. Then you yourself can decide how you want to take those conclusions.

Not sure what that rant was, or where that came from. That was awesome! XD

experimental_use(promise) (#25084)

* Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises

This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when 
something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
can run, then continue in a new task.

I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
separate commit.

* Move throwException to after work loop resumes

throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right 
before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
render the fiber again.

This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
(RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the 
RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
from appearing.

* Use expando to check whether promise has resolved

Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
resolved.

In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
the resolved value.

This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
by `Promise.allSettled`.

The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
without waiting a microtask.

* Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook

Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
implement it yet.

* use(promise)

Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components, 
but that is planned.

If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
"immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in 
previous commits.

Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing 
whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.

When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
principles largely apply.

The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
be deprecated.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

[SDPA] Add an optional scale kwarg (#95259)

# Summary
This PR adds an optional kwarg to torch torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention()
The new kwarg is a scaling factor that is applied after the q@k.T step of the computation. Made updates to the efficient kernel to support but flash and math were minimally updated to support as well.

Will reduce the complexity of: #94729 and has been asked for by a couple of users.

# Review Highlights
- As far as I know I did this the correct way and this both BC and FC compliant. However I always seem to break internal workloads so I would love if someone can advice I did this right?
- I named the optional arg 'scale'. This is probably dumb and I should name it 'scale_factor'. I will make this change but this is annoying and it will require someone thinking we should rename.
- 'scale' is interpreted as `Q@K.T * (scale)`

[FIX] stock,purchase,mrp: accumulative security days

Usecase to reproduce:
- Set the warehouse as 3 steps receipt
- Put a security delay of 3 days for purchase
- Set a product with a vendor and 1 days as LT
- Replenish with the orderpoint

You expect to have a schedule date for tomorrow that contains all the
product needed in the incoming 4 days.

Currenly the internal transfer from QC -> Stock is for tomorrow (ok).
The transfer from Inpur -> QC is plan for 2 days in the past. (not ok)
The PO date is plan for 5 days in the past. (not ok)

It happens because the system check at each `stock.rule` application if
purchase is part of the route. If it's then it applies the security lead
time. It's a mistake because we should apply it only the first time.

To fix it we directly set it when the orderpoint run and not during
`stock.move` creation.
However for MTO it's not that easy. We don't want to deliver too
early the customer. So we keep applying the delay during the
`stock.move` creation but only when it goes under the warehouse stock
location.

[GH-681] Correct hotkey override behaviors

Summary:
Makes hotkeys work again while inside the Monaco editor.

There's a long comment in `shortcuts.tsx` explaining why this was complicated, but to reiterate:
- `<HotKeys>` is normally the better component to use so that elements mounting/unmounting can all happily coexist and override each other's shortcuts depending on where the user's focus is
- Monaco exists outside of React's lifecycle, and therefore outside of where `<HotKeys>` is watching
- `<GlobalHotKeys>` listens outside of React's lifecycle, and can therefore notice events that happen there. We need this for Cmd+Enter to work while the editor is open.
- `<GlobalHotKeys>` _also_ has [frustrating behaviors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hotkeys#how-actions-are-resolved) if you try to override a shortcut like you would with `<HotKeys>`.
- This set of changes lets us do both things (shortcuts work when Monaco is open, and shortcuts can be overridden) using an ugly hack.
- This hack is less ugly than any other solution I tried.

Fixes #681

Test Plan:
- Try shortcuts like Cmd+Enter, Cmd+K, and Cmd+E when the UI first loads. All should behave.
- Try Cmd+Enter while the Command Palette is open (and its Run button is active). It should do whatever the palette says.
- Try Cmd+Enter, Cmd+E, and others while the editor is open and you're actively editing the PxL script. These shortcuts should all continue to perform their usual actions.
- Try Cmd+Enter while both the editor and the command palette are open. The command palette should "win" since it's the one in the foreground, even if the run button is disabled (in that case, it should do nothing).
- After closing the editor with Cmd+E, shortcuts should continue to work without having to click anywhere to get them working again.

docs: build-platforms: refine requirements on Python build dependencies

Historically, the critical dependency for both building and running
QEMU has been the distro packages.  Because QEMU is written in C and C's
package management has been tied to distros (at least if you do not want
to bundle libraries with the binary, otherwise I suppose you could use
something like conda or wrapdb), C dependencies of QEMU would target the
version that is shipped in relatively old but still commonly used distros.

For non-C libraries, however, the situation is different, as these
languages have their own package management tool (cpan, pip, gem, npm,
and so on).  For some of these languages, the amount of dependencies
for even a simple program can easily balloon to the point that many
distros have given up on packaging non-C code.  For this reason, it has
become increasingly normal for developers to download dependencies into
a self-contained local environment, instead of relying on distro packages.

Fortunately, this affects QEMU only at build time, as qemu.git does
not package non-C artifacts such as the qemu.qmp package; but still,
as we make more use of Python, we experience a clash between a support
policy that is written for the C world, and dependencies (both direct
and indirect) that increasingly do not care for the distro versions
and are quick at moving past Python runtime versions that are declared
end-of-life.

For example, Python 3.6 has been EOL'd since December 2021 and Meson 0.62
(released the following March) already dropped support for it.  Yet,
Python 3.6 is the default version of the Python runtime for RHEL/CentOS
8 and SLE 15, respectively the penultimate and the most recent version
of two distros that QEMU would like to support.  (It is also the version
used by Ubuntu 18.04, but QEMU stopped supporting it in April 2022).

There are good reasons to move forward with the deprecation of Python
3.6 in QEMU as well: completing the configure->meson switch (which
requires Meson 0.63), and making the QAPI generator fully typed (which
requires newer versions of not just mypy but also Python, due to PEP563).

Fortunately, these long-term support distros do include newer versions of
the Python runtime.  However, these more recent runtimes only come with
a very small subset of the Python packages that the distro includes.
Because most dependencies are optional tests (avocado, mypy, flake8)
and Meson is bundled with QEMU, the most noticeably missing package is
Sphinx (and the readthedocs theme).  There are four possibilities:

* we change the support policy and stop supporting CentOS 8 and SLE 15;
  not a good idea since CentOS 8 is not an unreasonable distro for us to
  want to continue to support

* we keep supporting Python 3.6 until CentOS 8 and SLE 15 stop being
  supported.  This is a possibility---but we may want to revise the support
  policy anyway because SLE 16 has not even been released, so this would
  mean delaying those desirable reasons for perhaps three years;

* we support Python 3.6 just for building documentation, i.e. we are
  careful not to use Python 3.7+ features in our Sphinx extensions but are
  free to use them elsewhere.  Besides being more complicated to understand
  for developers, this can be quite limiting; parts of the QAPI generator
  run at sphinx-build time, which would exclude one of the areas which
  would benefit from a newer version of the runtime;

* we only support Python 3.7+, which means CentOS 8 CI and users
  have to either install Sphinx from pip or disable documentation.

This proposed update to the support policy chooses the last of these
possibilities.  It does by modifying three aspects of the support
policy:

* it introduces different support periods for *native* vs. *non-native*
  dependencies.  Non-native dependencies are currently Python ones only,
  and for simplicity the policy only mentions Python; however, the concept
  generalizes to other languages with a well-known upstream package
  manager, that users of older distributions can fetch dependencies from;

* it opens up the possibility of taking non-native dependencies from their
  own package index instead of using the version in the distribution.  The
  wording right now is specific to dependencies that are only required at
  build time.  In the future we may have to refine it if, for example, parts
  of QEMU will be written in Rust; in that case, crates would be handled
  in a similar way to submodules and vendored in the release tarballs.

* it mentions specifically that optional build dependencies are excluded
  from the platform policy.  Tools such as mypy don't affect the ability
  to build QEMU and move fast enough that distros cannot standardize on
  a single version of them (for example RHEL9 does not package them at
  all, nor does it run them at rpmbuild time).  In other cases, such as
  cross compilers, we have alternatives.

Right now, non-native dependencies have to be download manually by
running "pip" before "configure".  In the future, it will be desirable
for configure to set up a virtual environment and download them in the
same way that it populates git submodules (but, in this case, without
vendoring them in the release tarballs).

Just like with submodules, this would make things easier for people
that can afford accessing the network in their build environment; the
option to populate the build environment manually would remain for
people whose build machines lack network access.  The change to the
support policy neither requires nor forbids this future change.

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].

Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

Bump version to 4.0-stable \o/

4 years of development.
12,000 merged pull requests.
7,000 fixed issues.
1,500 individual contributors across engine and docs.

The Godot 4.0 release is by all metrics our biggest release so far.
No stone has been left unturned, all parts of the engine have been
modernized, refactored, overhauled, rewritten, redesigned.

Our work is far from done. Many areas still have significant known issues,
and will require focused work from all willing contributors to fix blocking
bugs, implement missing features, optimize for performance or compatibility,
and improve the user experience.

But Godot 4.0 marks the start of the new, modern Godot Engine, and a solid
foundation for us all to build upon. Future 4.x releases will come with a
much faster cadence, enabling us to iterate quickly on new features and
improvements to what we already provide.

To all of you who were involved in making Godot 4.0 what it is today, however
big or small your contributions were:

THANK YOU!

This was a massive undertaking, and you all participated in unique and
wonderful ways to build a free and open source game engine for everyone to
use and enjoy. You are breathtaking! <3

[MIRROR] Rebuilds Luxury Shuttle (mostly), makes it emag-only [MDB IGNORE] (#19229)

* Rebuilds Luxury Shuttle (mostly), makes it emag-only (#72940)

## About The Pull Request
![2023 02 07-06 49
54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70376633/217159751-790e6ded-8525-4d13-a5b5-6a3d8076a00e.png)
Changes the really goofy old lux shuttle to a cooler layout with some
additions to make it a luxury and not just
"anti-poor-people protection + food"

Shuttle was made bigger to make it less cramped for the luxury class,
pool was moved to its own room, added an arcade
and a bar corner, has real lasers to shoot poors with (20c each shot),
has fire extinguishers now
Adds a new preopen variant of hardened shutters
Adds a paywall pin subtype for the luxury shuttle, and a laser gun
subtype

Made emag-only at a price of 10000 credits
## Why It's Good For The Game

The old luxury shuttle looked REALLY awful with its pool, was pretty
cramped even in the luxury section and BARELY resembled a luxury..
This luxury shuttle provides luxuries such as a less poorly designed
pool, more space for legs, arcade, to make it resemble a luxury unlike
the old one

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Luxury Shuttle is now bigger, and less ugly! Poor people still get
it rough though...
/:cl:

* Rebuilds Luxury Shuttle (mostly), makes it emag-only

WriteFile command implementation

Holy shit, I think I have made so many commits I might just get a deadly headache for today. I'm going to still continue. Anyway, at first the WriteFile command was very buggy but after a couple of patches I doubt anyone will be able to find a bug with this.

Starlight Polish (Space is blue!) (#72886)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Adds support to underlays to realize_overlays
Ensures decals properly handle plane offsets
Fixes space lighting double applying if it's changeturf'd into. this
will be important later
Makes solar vis_contents block emissives as expected
Moves transit tube overlays to update_overlays, adds emissive blockers
to them

#### Adds render steps

An expansion on render_target based emissive blockers. 
They allow us to hijack an object's appearance and draw it somewhere
else, or even modify it, THEN draw it somewhere else.
They chain quite nicely

Fixes shuttles deleting z holder objects

#### Makes space emissive, makes walls and floors block emissives
The core idea here goes like this:
We make space glow, and give its overlays some color

This way, the tile and space parallax remain fullbright, along with
anything that doesn't block emissives, but anything that does block
emissives will instead get shaded the color of starlight

This requires a bit of extra work, see later

This is done automatically with render relays, which now support
specifiying layer and color (Need to make an editor for these one of
these days)

The emissive blocking floor stuff requires making a second render plate
to prevent double scaling

Also adds some new layering defines for lighting, and ensures all turf
lights have a layer. We'll get to this soon

#### Makes things in space blue

We color them the same as starlight, by taking advantage of space being
emissive
This means that things in space that block emissive will block it
correctly and be colored blue by the light overlay, but space itself
will remain fullbright

This does require redefining what always_lit means, but nothing but
cordons use that so it's fineee


#### Makes glass above space glow, and some other stuff

Glass tiles that sit above space will now shine light with matching
color to the glasses color. This includes mat tiles.

Glass tiles (not mat because they have no alpha) also only partially
block emissives.
Adds a new proc that uses render steps to acomplish this, essentially
we're cutting out bits below X alpha and drawing what remains as an
emissive.

#### Modifies partial space showing to support glow

Essentially, alongside displaying space as an underlay, we also display
a light overlay colored like starlight.
That starlight overlay gets masked to only be visible in bits that do
not contain any alpha.

We also mask the turf lighting to not go into bits that have no alpha,
to ensure we get the effect we want.
This is done with that lighting layer thing I mentioned earlier.

#### Makes appearance realization's list output ordered

I want it output in order of overlay, sub overlay suboverlay, next
overlay
Need to use insert for that

## Why It's Good For The Game

Pretty!
Also having space be emissive is a very very good way to test for fucked
emissive blockers (If it's broken why are we even drawing the overlay)
I know for a fact mob blockers on lizards and socks are kinda yorked, I
think there's more

Fixes critical plane masters improperly not being readded in show_to (#72604)

## About The Pull Request

[Adds support for pulling z offset context from an atom's
plane](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/9f215c5316e5cfdbedf6a23ff97dfee0e523354b)

This is needed to fix paper bins, since the object we plane set there
isn't actually on a z level.
Useful elsewhere too!

[Fixes compiler errors that came from asserting that plane spokesmen had
a plane
var](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/b830002443f2fbe230e9ff00236d7a46a9f2eec7)

[Ensures lighting backdrops ALWAYS exist for each lighting
plane.](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/0e931169f7c5336333bc6f41353c82f603fc1170)

They can't float becuase we can see more then one plane at once yaknow?

[Fixes parallax going to shit if a mob moved zs without having a
client](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/244b2b25baecfc644505a3ea1e348e0cb97a04e0)

Issue lies with how is_outside_bounds just blocked any plane readding
It's possible for a client to not be connected during z moves, so we
need to account for them rejoining in show_to, instead of just blocking
any of our edge cases.

Fixing this involved having parallax override blocks for show_plane and
anything with the right critical flags ensuring mobs have JUST the right
PMs and relays.
It's duped logic but I'm unsure of how else to handle it and frankly
this stuff is just kinda depressing.
Might refactor later

[show_to can be called twice successfully with no hide_from
call.](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/092581a5c06f7f884f48d41c96fa9300327ef214)

Ensures no runtimes off the registers from this

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fixes #72543
Fixes lighting looking batshit on multiz. None reported this I cry into
the night.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Fixes parallax showing up ABOVE the game if you moved z levels
while disconnected

Finishing to write likelihood class:

I rewrote the clas because my code was getting cluttered and shitty.

I also realised that i could get away with far less loops, so this is
another reason why i rewrote it.

For now I just did everything in numpy.

I will try to do the cuda part in the way i mentioned (everything in the
same class, different methods for doing the same stuff on gpu or on
cpu)

I will try to actually test the code tonight, so maybe it will be ready
by tomorrow (this in the case everything goes smoothly, which i kinda
doubt).

Anyway i think this  new version is way better (i.e.: way simpler for
doing the same stuff) than the stuff i was writing up until this
morning.

Basically, everything is taken from there, but i wrote too many useless
methods that wouldve made the runtime significantly increas...
The reason is that (idk what i was thinking back then) I was computing
the spatial and chromatic kernels separately over each pixel, and then
multuply the results. Like this we wouldve iterated over the image more
than once

Ofc like this is now its far better, as we loop over the pixels only
once and compute everything on the fly.

I will test the code later. Thankssss

Rework and update our screenshots and docs

And now for the least fun part of 311's development. A lot of changes,
both old and new, had never been documented (as a random example, when
discussing the Change To... master command, the readme claimed that
using it would corrupt cosaves and linked to #236, which was fixed and
closed in 0a300af01a85bb3535d3194203fd34cc0d3e9b29 *5 years ago*. So I
kept getting distracted and rewrote more and more stuff and now we're
here:

 251 files changed, 4322 insertions(+), 2259 deletions(-)

There's so many changes in here, I can't even begin to describe them.
Merging it ASAP because I don't think anyone wants to look at this for
more than a second. If I never have to touch the damn readme again,
it'll be too soon. This literally took weeks, with me having to take
frequent breaks lest I burn out.

Some ugly notes from my squashed commits follow:

Also included some random usability tweaks, e.g. bumping the default
size of the doc browser to something actually usable.

Unify dialogue/dialog over the codebase

Most places in our codebase use 'dialog', so I went with that. Obviously
there are still more than a thousand 'dialogue's left because of
Skyrim's vanilla files. I also didn't touch anything in the records, we
want to match the CK and xEdit there.

Add an option to disable the column header menus

Since we allow disabling the global menu, we should allow going the
other way as well.

Focus and select all text in Plugin Name field

Pretty sure it used to do that, but it's not doing it anymore for me.
Easy enough to fix.

Mopy/bash/basher/links_init.py:
Because bare booleans getting passed around is no fun.

Replace country flags with SVGs

Easiest SVGs in the world to find, obviously. Even saves space for all
but Brazil (not surprising, look at that flag).

pt_PT -> pt_BR

That's not European Portuguese, that's Brazilian Portuguese. Note the
TODO, if we ever get a pt_PT translation we need to ditch that deletion
command. And while I'm in the vicinity, English -> American English.

Update some old tool directories

Also update the Photoshop icon, I don't even know what that old one is
supposed to be.

Mashes several of the Whitesands Survivor Camp ruins into one extra large ruin (#1640)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Combines the whitesands surface camp adobe, farm, gunslingers,
survivors, hunters and saloon into one massive, 59x59 ruin. Some various
extra loot and changes have been made throughout, generally to improve
the experience of digging through the trash for goodies. Changes the
riot shotgun in the saloon to a double barrel shotgun. Also cleans up
the various issues with the ruins, like walls under doors, or area
passthroughs being used excessively over the outside of the ruins,
resulting in them generating in the middle of mountains buried in the
rock.

"Well, why didn't you add the drugstore?" The loot in it was too good.
The stuff in there can really help a ship get on its feet, and I am not
gonna deprive them of that just to shove it in an already packed massive
ruin area. I'm not saying it doesn't need its own remap, just that it
doesn't fit well with the other camps put into this ruin.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

<!-- Tick the box below (put an X instead of a space between the
brackets) if you have tested your changes and this is ready for review.
Leave unticked if you have yet to test your changes and this is not
ready for review. -->

- [x] I affirm that I have tested all of my proposed changes and that
any issues found during tested have been addressed.

## Why It's Good For The Game
"a ruin that is tiny and sucks on purpose is still bad" and holy shit
did most of the camps fit this criteria. Survivor, Gunslinger, and
Hunter camp variants were the smallest ruins in the game next to the one
that was just a single tumor, and constantly took up entire map
generations just to be a massive dissapointment to any player that came
across them. Or they would spawn in the middle of an acid lake. Either
way this ruin is massive and should provide a breath of fresh air for
scavengers and combat hungry miners alike.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

workingcopy: make FileChangeDetectorTrait parallel friendly

Summary:
I want to parallelize the work this object does, but the trait interface is serial (and synchronous):

```
pub trait FileChangeDetectorTrait {
    // Check if file size and mtime are unchanged (otherwise queue "maybe changed" result).
    fn has_changed(&mut self, ts: &mut TreeState, path: &RepoPath) -> Result<FileChangeResult>;

    // Resolve "maybe changed" files by checking contents.
    fn resolve_maybes(&self) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = Result<ResolvedFileChangeResult>> + Send>;
}
```

It also was a bit annoying to use because it reported results w/ two different types, so the client needed duplicate handling. The new trait allows for asynchronous processing and only returns a single kind of result:

```
// Converting to an iterator signals you are done submitting paths.
pub trait FileChangeDetectorTrait: IntoIterator<Item = Result<ResolvedFileChangeResult>> {
    fn submit(&mut self, ts: &mut TreeState, path: &RepoPath);
}
```

I converted the existing concrete implementation to the new trait. It requires the object to buffer more results, but not any file data, so it shouldn't have much of an impact memory wise.

kbuild: remove the target in signal traps when interrupted

BugLink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1996812

[ Upstream commit a7f3257da8a86b96fb9bf1bba40ae0bbd7f1885a ]

When receiving some signal, GNU Make automatically deletes the target if
it has already been changed by the interrupted recipe.

If the target is possibly incomplete due to interruption, it must be
deleted so that it will be remade from scratch on the next run of make.
Otherwise, the target would remain corrupted permanently because its
timestamp had already been updated.

Thanks to this behavior of Make, you can stop the build any time by
pressing Ctrl-C, and just run 'make' to resume it.

Kbuild also relies on this feature, but it is equivalently important
for any build systems that make decisions based on timestamps (if you
want to support Ctrl-C reliably).

However, this does not always work as claimed; Make immediately dies
with Ctrl-C if its stderr goes into a pipe.

  [Test Makefile]

    foo:
            echo hello > $@
            sleep 3
            echo world >> $@

  [Test Result]

    $ make                         # hit Ctrl-C
    echo hello > foo
    sleep 3
    ^Cmake: *** Deleting file 'foo'
    make: *** [Makefile:3: foo] Interrupt

    $ make 2>&1 | cat              # hit Ctrl-C
    echo hello > foo
    sleep 3
    ^C$                            # 'foo' is often left-over

The reason is because SIGINT is sent to the entire process group.
In this example, SIGINT kills 'cat', and 'make' writes the message to
the closed pipe, then dies with SIGPIPE before cleaning the target.

A typical bad scenario (as reported by [1], [2]) is to save build log
by using the 'tee' command:

    $ make 2>&1 | tee log

This can be problematic for any build systems based on Make, so I hope
it will be fixed in GNU Make. The maintainer of GNU Make stated this is
a long-standing issue and difficult to fix [3]. It has not been fixed
yet as of writing.

So, we cannot rely on Make cleaning the target. We can do it by
ourselves, in signal traps.

As far as I understand, Make takes care of SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and
SITERM for the target removal. I added the traps for them, and also for
SIGPIPE just in case cmd_* rule prints something to stdout or stderr
(but I did not observe an actual case where SIGPIPE was triggered).

[Note 1]

The trap handler might be worth explaining.

    rm -f $@; trap - $(sig); kill -s $(sig) $$

This lets the shell kill itself by the signal it caught, so the parent
process can tell the child has exited on the signal. Generally, this is
a proper manner for handling signals, in case the calling program (like
Bash) may monitor WIFSIGNALED() and WTERMSIG() for WCE although this may
not be a big deal here because GNU Make handles SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT
in WUE and SIGTERM in IUE.

  IUE - Immediate Unconditional Exit
  WUE - Wait and Unconditional Exit
  WCE - Wait and Cooperative Exit

For details, see "Proper handling of SIGINT/SIGQUIT" [4].

[Note 2]

Reverting 392885ee82d3 ("kbuild: let fixdep directly write to .*.cmd
files") would directly address [1], but it only saves if_changed_dep.
As reported in [2], all commands that use redirection can potentially
leave an empty (i.e. broken) target.

[Note 3]

Another (even safer) approach might be to always write to a temporary
file, and rename it to $@ at the end of the recipe.

   <command>  > $(tmp-target)
   mv $(tmp-target) $@

It would require a lot of Makefile changes, and result in ugly code,
so I did not take it.

[Note 4]

A little more thoughts about a pattern rule with multiple targets (or
a grouped target).

    %.x %.y: %.z
            <recipe>

When interrupted, GNU Make deletes both %.x and %.y, while this solution
only deletes $@. Probably, this is not a big deal. The next run of make
will execute the rule again to create $@ along with the other files.

Gen 8 Battle Factory: Remove Darmanitan-Galar's Choice Band set (#9354)

* Gen 8 Battle Factory: Remove Band set from Ubers Darmanitan-Galar 

Credentials: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1042959218208157696/1067534457160089731/image.png (i am "lost wind's elegy")

Darm-G's firepower is just fine with scarf; there aren't many (if any?) relevant 1hkos or 2hkos you miss out on compared to band. The only one I can think of is missing out on the OHKO vs Sp. Def Necrozma Dusk Mane, and nobody's leaving their NDM in anyway + you probably have like 12 other things to deal with it.

Without scarf, however, you miss out on really good source of offensive checking and revenge killing potential. Scarf outspeeds huge threats like non scarf Yveltal, Eternatus, Calyrex-Shadow, etc. 

What sparks had to say about band darm in proper SS Ubers:
sparks — Today at 1:53 PM
not really but with band building needs to be more focused cos the speed over the 90s and etern etc is insane with scarf

sparks — Today at 1:54 PM
while with band you're very much focused on "how to take out ndm and capitalize while not being weak to ho"

As a secondary factor, it would make Ubers in BF a lot better. Currently you have to not only win the coinflip of what move Darm clicks but also the coinflip of what item it is. Both of these are more or less up to random chance.

Inventory and PrntScrn upgrades

-MAN OH MAN that was a real challange. I set up the assignSlotValueOnly functionality and that was far more difficult than I had imagined. However, from the user standpoint, it should be incredibly easy to use. If you want it to be printed as "key: value" you pass it normally to assignSlot(1, myMap). However, if you don't want it formatted like that, you can print out just the value using an optional bool argument, assignSlot(1, myMap, true), that sets a isValueOnly flag, which gets used when formatting the map to print.
- To accomplish this, I created a new struct called slot { map, isValueOnly }. The isValueOnly flag is then used to determine how the information is going to be printed to the screen. After some trial and error (mostly error) I decided not to use function pointers (you're welcome future you). Instead, I decided I would just add some if logic to handle the two cases of key:value or valueOnly. Those few sentences make it sound like it was a pretty straightforward afair, but it felt like a gigantic mess. And I think I did make a mistake at this point (well later it will be revealed I had made two), which was that I should have scrapped all of my changes to this file completely and taken a break of maybe 30 minutes. That would have given some time to reflect on what I had done and come back to a completely clean slate. However, I did not do that, I barely took a break and only reverted a portion of what I had changed. By doing that, I felt a bit like I was standing on bad foundation and that maybe some of the errors I was getting were because I hadn't completely reverted the file and I had left something that should have been deleted. That nagging question sat on my mind for quite a while. Then I had gotten so far that I started succumbing to the sunk-cost fallacy. The issue I was facing was having to do with pointers, references, and types. It's a common issue to run into, but this one has taken the longest to fix out of any of them. Indeed, I was not actually able to fix it, so I deleted it. Made it simpler. I went with storing only the isValueOnly flag and using that to branch logic. HOWEVER, remember when I had mentioned that there was a second bug? Well, there was and it was pretty rooky. At one point, I was passing an obj as a copy and not as a reference, so I wasn't getting the changes I had expected to see. So after trying to do one of the most complex pointer/reference configuration I've done so far, I made the very error that they use to teach how references work.
- Well, overall it was a good weekend though. I made two pretty significant changes to core functionality relating to inventory and printing. The only coding thing that I did not get to yet was moving the obj data over into GameState.
-There is one outstanding issue that we are going to have to face sooner or later: Print Order. You can't have inventories seemingly change order.

Inventory enhancement shared pointers (#8)

* Starting implementation of GameState object (#7)

* Add files via upload

* Started implementing the Game State object.

- GameState time. I started by moving the prepLoop inventories and GameObjects into the GameState object. I relearned a couple of things while doing. One I don't think I've dealt with since my first coding classes at Everett Community College, the other is something I've been kinda dreading.
- The first thing: Relearning about Constructor Initializer Lists. In my GS_Campaign class I need to have some Inventories. However, the constructor for those inventories need to be called in order to create them properly. So I couldn't simply declare it as "Inventory equipmentInv;" and start using it. It needs to call the Inventory(string name) constuructor. That simple declaration on the header file doesn't cut it. Previously, I had this done as part of the declaration in the header file.  it was "Inventory equipmentInv = Inventory("Equipment")". This would call the constructor properly. However, this is apparently not best practice. You don't want to do constructor calls as part of your declerations in your class header files. According to ChatGPT, the benefits are:
	- Improved performance: Initializing member variables in the constructor initialization list can be more efficient than initializing them in the constructor body, especially for complex objects.
	- Consistent initialization: Initialization lists ensure that member variables are always initialized to a valid state, even if an exception is thrown during construction.
	- Cleaner code: Initialization lists can make the code easier to read and understand, especially for classes with many member variables.
- I don't exactly know what it is more effecient, but I am sold none-the-less. Similar to doing the std:: namespace thing. It may feel weird at first, but I should get use to it and just make it part of how I opperate.
- Now, I will only put the declaration of the member variable in the header page Inventory equipmentInv. And then in the constructor, you would do this:
	GS_Campaign::GS_Campaign() :
	equipmentInv("Equipment")
	{};
- The other issue that came up (the thing I've been kinda dreading or at least was hoping to avoid) would be memory management involved in maintaining gameObjects. In order for my gameState to be able to create objects in its constructor and then also access those later, I need them to not be destroyed in the constructor. To do this, I have to use the "new" keyword, which allocates memory on the heap. However, that will also mean that I'm on the hook for deleting them. Now, I'm already planning on passing that object around mostly by pointer. In fact, Inventory is set up hold pointers. The easiest way to do this will be to use shared pointers. AKA smart pointers. These will maintain the object so long as the object has an existing reference pointing to it. If all of the pointers are destroyed, then the object will also be destroyed. Which is what I want. The question is going to be, how are these shared pointers going to be created?

* Converted Inventory.inv from ptrs to shared_ptrs.

- OK, today I'm going to try and change my Inventory class over from a list of regular pointers, to a list of shared_pointers or smart pointers as they are called. I had initially avoided these when I started, as I didn't quite understand why they were different. However, they have a major benefit over regular pointers, in that, when an object is created with a shared pointer, the shared pointer will keep track of how many other pointers are pointing to it. When there are no more pointers pointing to the object, the object will be destroyed. This is great, because for the GameState class to maintain objects, it needs to use the 'new' keyword and add them to the heap. The only way to get those objects off the heap is to destroy them. I could try to create some grand scheme for how this will work, but I don't actually need to, I can just let the shared pointers do that. Currently, the Inventory class keeps track of all it's objects as regular pointers, which means that I would have to handle destroying them. However, if I move them to shared pointers, then the objects will destroy themselves. So that's what we are gonna do.
- To do this, I'm going to need a new library that I have not used called <memory>.
- That was actually really easy! All I had to do was change the function declarations and definitions and the declaration of the objects themselves. I also streamlined the declaration of the objects in GS_Campaign so that I'm not declaring the obj first, then passing it. Now I declare it directly in the argument, which means I don't have an extra pointer inside of GS_Campaign.
- I would get into the techical details, but there really isn't that much difference between this and regular pointers. I just had to ask chatGPT a couple of syntax questions and now it's working.

That title made me think of Rush Dreamline, now I want to play that while I write this :D

This further moves the app over to working in a more component-based manner, using less element IDs in this case.

First time using ChatGPT myself, tonight! My parents and I all tried it out. I think I do actually like the potential that it has. It's yet another thing to either dive right into and to try and embed into your life since it probably will eventually anyways, vs trying to stay away from it. I asked it some questions about the Legacy Console Edition world save format, and it was actually nearly accurate about everything! The only thing it didn't know correctly is that the Region files are named `.mcr` still, instead of `.mca` like modern versions of Java Edition. It also let me know that the Leveldown npm module actually does support zlib compression, and that's great news to me! Earlier before working on Flatlands today, I was looking into using `node-leveldb-zlib` as WASM in the browser, but that looked like it was gonna be a very heavy task to try and get done and working. If Leveldown does in fact have zlib support like GPT says it does, that will help a very big amount to getting Bedrock world save opening working in the browser! Browser-first is my biggest thing now that the web is so powerful nowadays.

Also just found out about a ton of news for WebKit/iOS! PWAs (Home Screen Web Apps :P ) are getting *muuuch* more powerful coming up here soon! I'm absolutely astounded with how much work the WebKit team appears to be putting into their browser for Web Apps now. Whether it's because of the possible lawsuits against Apple for the anti-competition things or not, they really are doing a great job at playing catch-up right now. Either way, I'm very happy that they are moving forward in that regard. As a dev, it makes me very happy to be able to prospect Apple's platforms to be great places for Web Apps in the future. Such a stark difference!

The lyrics to Dreamline actually collide very similar to some of my conversations today out and about, yesterday and today have felt like some of those days where things just start to click again, and you kind of feel like you know what your doing in life, and where you're going. While it's probably not too much different, you kind of have a glimpse that you know what you're doing might be the right thing for you.

Roll The Bones is a great album, gotta listen to this more often! It's also clicking for me tonight :)

Note to me: I should use the paragraph above for my own lyrics, that's a neat idea :D

Been working on my music production and sharing the last few days too, the Flatlands album being up is very happy-ing (?) to me, it's great to be moving forward with that (my music catalog stack overflow, haha).

Service Re-Worker

Upgraded the Service Worker! Now it's fancy just like STE's Service Worker setup.

Listening to Neurotica now, I love this song just as much as I remember back in freshman year while walking to school. Good times :D

I also just realized that I think this is where I started liking that flange/chorus-sound that I realized I liked on Metropolis Pt. 2, I think I was having light flashbacks to Rush when I heard that album about a year or two later in 2019. I've more recently been wondering where Petrucci got that taste for it too, as now I've been picking up on it more when listening to Rush and bands from that time. I have always really liked Lifeson's tone too, especially the chord strikes. You Bet Your Life is reminding me of Presto, Chain Lightning. Rush albums from that era remind me of my early high school years now; looking back on it, I guess that's when I ended up looking into them the most! High school really was great, even with the pandemic and all. Learned so much just those few years :)
