post What a weird, profound, and beautiful book. This is a very Mormon novel, and in all the best ways. It takes Mormonism seriously—even literally—but not uncritically. I'd wager that Peck has read Grant Hardy, and my favorite bit in an amazing book is a throwaway joke about farewell expressions in French in a way that only someone who knows and loves the Book of Mormon would do. More than all of that, it is a profound and optimistic (but never naïve) story about redemption knowing no bounds. I can't recommend it enough.

new Player Animation system NOT achieved

so this may have been a massive waste of time. the amount of issues borne from beginning to implement the new system makes it seem that it's not worth doing at all. it still might be worth re-doing the entire thing from scratch, but the way it is now, it doesn't seem reasonably possible to convert the current system into the one i want.
there are many, many problems. one example is that of playback speed. we use an AnimationTree (AnimationNodeStateMachine) to connect various Animation nodes to each other. some of these AnimationNodes are BlendSpace2Ds. some of these BlendSpace2Ds have timescale properties, which get changed based on various things in-game. for example, getting slowed slows your animations' timescales. so when an AnimationNode is determined to be traveled to, it plays its animation at the correct timescale.
the problem with simply having a "FunctionPlayer" is that an AnimationPlayer can only have 1 timescale set, unless it is set on a per Animation basis (which is what the AnimationTree handles). so unless we make an entirely new AnimationTree for Function Animations, which is its own complex & potentially overcomplicated task, the new system will not function with the current one.
another issue, which remains unsolved because it makes no fucking sense, is that occasionally a FunctionPlayer's animation will play twice. occasionally. it's not set to loop. the function that plays the animation gets called once. believe me, i spent hours checking. but it still plays twice. it doesn't loop indefinitely, and it doesn't play once, as it's supposed to. it plays twice. but only if you hold a specific direction when the animation finishes! not otherwise. fuck this stupid fucking piece of fucking garbage system. how the fuck am i supposed to fix problems if the problems don't make sense? it's literally impossible to begin conceptualizing a way you MIGHT go about STARTING to THINK about a problem like this, because the behaviour it generates has no basis in reality. it just does it's own thing, for no reason, and with no way to stop it. and you can try to figure it out, but you will have wasted hours of your fucking life. wasted because you will have learned nothing but that problems that don't make sense can exist and can be literally impossible to solve unless re-creating systems from scratch, which i guess i'll have to spend another fucking day doing now.
unbelievably frustrating. i can continue to shoot blind and continue to fail or i can give up. those are my options. i have no other options. both will end up with me wasting more of my fucking time.
for now, the new Animation tracks remain, as with the old ones. the new ones have been disabled, though, and the old functionality remains.

brainstorming solutions

i can't conceptualize a way to handle the original issue (too many identical tracks on player animations) without making things more complicated.
since timescales are set via methods, it would work if we had a different FunctionPlayer per timescale setter method. right now there are 4:
1. movement speed
2. evade speed
3. attack speed
4. hit speed (not currently used; i plan on being able to adjust the length of time of players' hitstun)

so, MovementFunctionPlayer, EvasionFunctionPlayer, AttackFunctionPlayer, and HitFunctionPlayer. 4 ADDITIONAL AnimationPlayers... however, they won't have a large number of animations. movement doesn't need any, now that i think about it, because the Run & Idle animations don't have function calls, for now. so that's one taken care of... until things like idle animations & footsteps/footprints are implemented, in which case the run animations might get method tracks.
Evasion has 2 actions: Roll & Backstep. OK.
Attack has currently has 7 per weapon type: Attack1, Attack2, Attack2_Frenzy, Attack3, Recovery, Tech1, and Tech2.
it also could be the case that we don't set the timescales for Techs, as it could potentially result in some unwanted behaviour. that's a decision for another time, though.
then finally the Hit FunctionPlayer, which will only contain 1 or two "Hit" animations.
i don't think i want to have 6 AnimationPlayer nodes on our Player. it's way too convoluted and the functionality it'd provide is neither scalable nor convenient.
which leaves the other option of creating a new FunctionAnimationTree: it's more complex, which means more room for error and potentially more difficulty in scaling - though potentially less. but no, it's not a good solution either. it's a terrible one, probably worse than the multiple AnimationPlayers.
a lazy version of the AnimationTree solution - and i'm getting desperate here - would be to make a copy of the current AnimationTree node, replace its root AnimationPlayer with the FunctionPlayer, and then replace each Animation inside of each BlendSpace with the correct function animation. STILL this doesn't seem right because of how complex of a solution it is for what seems like the fucking simplest of fucking problems. it would take forever to implement and it's not guaranteed to work. i have no fucking idea what i'm doing.
part of me thinks at this point it may be worth re-doing the entire thing from scratch, and be very strict about using advance_conditions in the AnimationTree as opposed to variables within the player script.
basically, i need an AnimationPlayer/AnimationTree to run IN PARALLEL with the current one. that's it. that's what i need. another AnimationPlayer, that plays the same animations at the same speed at the same time. when one animation plays, it tells the other animationPlayer to play its corresponding Function animation. THAT'S FUCKING IT. IT'S NOT A FUCKING COMPLICATED TASK I WANT TO ACHIEVE.
but i have another idea. it's potentially shit, potentially messy, but it also has the potential to work and then never be touched again. it involves using Signals:
when an Animation is played, it emits a signal... i'm already over this idea, because i've tested the AnimationTree i currently use and some AnimationNodes don't emit signals. so yeah that won't work.

The C Libyaml as provided by the makers of PyYAML is shadow depricated
It has a buffer overflow, compilation issues on MUSL and hasn't had a
maintainer for at least a few months. It also only supports YAML 1.1
and the YAML 1.2 spec is out. YAML's official https://yaml.org website
actually linked a newer project which is more complete, more maintained
and supports the YAML 1.2 spec. This library is:
  https://github.com/pantoniou/libfyaml
libfyaml also has a loaded document traversal function embedded into the
library, so I don't have to build it from scratch like I was just doing
for two days. Oh, not to mention they at least made an attempt to
document the damn API properly. It's actually pretty trash documentation
but at least they tried lol. Libyaml just says read the .h for API.
Not the worst docs but still a little poopy.

no solution

project reverted; it appears there is no solution to the multiple identical track problem, and that every possible potential solution i attempted to conceptualize ended up generating more problems than fixes. so i have to know when to give up, and it is here.
luckily, godot-4 has ways to copy tracks, so it's not as painful as before, but it's still pretty bad. i have no idea why such a feature was overlooked. i have wasted an entire day.
it'd be nice if AnimationTree could control more than one AnimationPlayer. or if AnimationPlayer could play 2 animations at the same time. or if 2 animations could share a single animation track. there are countless logical solutions to this problem, yet no way of implementing any of them. i can't use multiple animation players because i have no way of stopping them if the animationState changes. i can't use multiple trees because i can't have them sharing advance_conditions - that and i'd just be generating as many problems as i'd be solving. the only solution is to manually copy tracks? really? i can't believe it, i really can't.
we can extend classes, scripts, nodes, EVERYTHING. inheritance is a fucking thing that exists. WHY can't i make root animations that extend? in other words:
i have 4 animations. i want them all to do exactly the same thing. when i change that thing, the change is reflected in the 4 animations.
i then want those 4 animations to animate something different from one another, while retaining the shared aspect of the first thing. IS THIS NOT POSSIBLE????

make packet handler work

i still haven't actually tested any of this yet lol but in theory it should all work

i'll probably either actually test az-client and fix all the remaining issues or update the azalea crate next

ok also one thing that i'm not particularly happy with is how the packet handlers are doing ugly queries like
```rs
let local_player = ecs
    .query::<&LocalPlayer>()
    .get_mut(ecs, player_entity)
    .unwrap();
```
i think the right way to solve it would be by putting every packet handler in its own system but i haven't come up with a way to make that not be really annoying yet

Finally shelled out for LunarCell

Used in several old school shipyards, this plugin generates spobs.

Yeah, I know it's not free. Hell, neither is union bytes painter. It does really good planet generation. It's what Onyx used, and the idiosyncrasies of those particular spobs are seared into my mind. So I might as well not fight it. I'll need to remove the black background, but, hell, here they are.

I'm keeping them the same size so that I can apply hopefully the same mask to all of them when I cut them into sprites - anything marked 'untitled' uses one mask, anything marked 'rc' uses another.

If people complain I might branch out and do more planets. I dunno. I like these a lot.

Improve characters' starting kits (Hellmonk)

One of the most interesting and exciting decisions in Dungeon Crawl
is when and where to use your consumable items. In the very early
game, characters may not yet have any consumables, which diminishes
the tactical aspect of the game.

So, let's try to give most characters some options which, if used
wisely, can help them with a tough situation.

- All 'mages' ('pure casters') start with a potion of magic.
- Gladiators get a throwing weapon; javelin, large rock or boomerangs.
- Monks get a potion of ambrosia. (See, it's divine.)
- Hunters get a scroll of immo.
- Brigands get an additional poisoned & curare dart.
- Artificers trade their xom piece for nine charges of iceblast.
- Wanderers get an additional random potion or scroll.
- Delvers get nothing, for now, since I'm already pretty happy with
  how they play. They're a challenge anyway, really. :)
- Berserkers and Cinder Acolytes likewise get nothing. They already
  have perfectly good early game buttons.
- Abyssal Knights start at 60 piety (just over 2*) instead of 38 (just
  over 1*). This should allow them to use Bend Space if needed.
  (I think they're still quite weak.)
- Chaos Knights get Artificer's xom chesspiece.
- Transmuters get a potion of lignification, which should work well
  with their unarmed combat focus. It's also very thematic.
- Warpers get more boomerangs of dispersal.
- Arkane Markspersons get a scroll of vulnerability.
- Enchanters get another potion of invisibility.
- Fighters are unchanged.

This should also be a nice compensation for various recent changes that
increased early game difficulty.

Practice Project - 4: World Happiness Report (type_1)

Problem Statement:
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

Attribute Information:

What is Dystopia?

Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables, thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive width. The lowest scores observed for the six key variables, therefore, characterize Dystopia. Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world’s lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom and least social support, it is referred to as “Dystopia,” in contrast to Utopia.

What are the residuals?

The residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country, reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over-or-under explain average life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries.

The Objectives of this project are as follows:

What do the columns succeeding the Happiness Score (like Family, Generosity, etc.) describe?

The following columns: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Trust Government Corruption describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country.
The Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness Score (1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country.

The Dystopia Residual is already provided in the dataset. 

If you add all these factors up, you get the happiness score so it might be un-reliable to model them to predict Happiness Scores.

You need to predict the happiness score considering all the other factors mentioned in the dataset.

Downlaod Files:

Steps included in this project:

i. Importing essential libraries
ii. Loading and reading Data
iii. Understanding Data Visualization
iv. Checking and finding Missing Values in the datatset
v. Exploring Variables (EDA)
vi. Performing Correlation analysis

9.3 Ok, now that our service has a tag, we're going to write a little more code that automatically calls the subscribe method on GameApplication for every service with that tag. This is also going to go in Kernel, but in a different method. In this case, we're going to implement something called a "compiler pass".

 Add a new interface called CompilerPassInterface. Then, below, go back to "Code Generate", "Implement Methods", and select process()

 Compiler passes are a bit more advanced, but super cool! It's a piece of code that runs at the very end of the container and services being built... and you can do whatever you want inside.

 Check it out! Say $definition = $container->findDefinition(GameApplication::class)

 No, this does not return the GameApplication object. It returns a Definition object that knows everything about how to instantiate a GameApplication, like its class, constructor arguments, and any calls it might have on it.

 Next, say $taggedObservers = $container->findTaggedServiceIds('game.observer')

 This will return an array of all the services that have the game.observer tag. Then we can loop over them with foreach ($taggedObservers as $id => $tags). The $id is the service id... and $tags is an array because you can technically put the same tag on a service multiple times... but that's not something we care about

 Now say $definition->addMethodCall(), which is the PHP version of calls in YAML. Pass this the subscribe method and, for the arguments, a new Reference() (the one from DependencyInjection), with id

 This is a fancy way of saying that we want the subscribe() method to be called on GameApplication... and for it to pass the service that holds the game.observer tag.

 The end result is the same as what we had before in services.yaml... just more dynamic and better for impressing your programmer friends. So, remove all of the YAML code we added

 If we try our game again...

  ./bin/console app:game:play
 No errors! And... yes! It still works! If we need to add another observer later, we can just create a class, make it implement GameObserverInterface and... done! It will automatically be subscribed to GameApplication.

 Observer Pattern in the Wild
 - So that is the observer pattern. How it looks can differ, with different method names for subscribing. Heck, sometimes the observers are passed in through the constructor! But the idea is always the same: a central object loops over and calls a method on a collection of other objects when something happens.

 Where do we see this in the wild? It shows up in a lot of places, but here's one example. Over on Symfony's GitHub page, I'm going to hit "T" and search for a class called LocaleSwitcher. If you need to do something in your application each time the locale switches, you can register your code with the LocaleSwitcher and it will call you. In this case, the observers are passed through the constructor. And then you can see down here, after the locale is set, it loops over all of those and calls setLocale(). So LocaleSwitcher is the subject, and these are the observers.

 How do you register an observer? Not surprisingly, it's by creating a class that implements LocaleAwareInterface. Thanks to autoconfiguration, Symfony will automatically tag your service with kernel.locale_aware. Yup, it uses the same mechanism for hooking all of this up that we just used!

 Benefits of the Observer Pattern
 - The benefits of the observer pattern are actually best described by looking at the SOLID principles. This pattern helps the Single Responsibility pattern because you can encapsulate (or isolate) code into smaller classes. Instead of putting everything into GameApplication, like all of our XP logic right here, we were able to isolate things in XpEarnedObserver and keep both classes more focused. This pattern also helps with the Open-closed Principle, because we can now extend the behavior of GameApplication without modifying its code.

 The observer pattern also follows the Dependency Inversion Principle or DIP, which is one of the trickier principles if you ask me. Anyways, DIP is happy because the high-level class - GameApplication - accepts an interface - GameObserverInterface - and that interface was designed for the purpose of how GameApplication will use it. From GameApplication's perspective, this interface represents something that wants to "observe" what happens when something occurs within the game. Namely, the fight finishing. And so, GameObserverInterface is a good name.

 But, if we had named it based on how the observers will use the interface, that would have made DIP sad. For example, had we called it XpChangerInterface and the method timeToChangeTheXp, that would be a violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle. If that's fuzzy and you want to know more, check out our SOLID tutorial.

 Next, let's quickly turn to the brother pattern of observer: Pub/sub.

10.2 Registering Listeners... Manually
 - So finally, let's register a listener to this event. Open GameCommand: the place where we're initializing our app. We'll see how to do all of this properly with Symfony's container in a minute, but I want to keep it simple to start. In the constructor, add private readonly EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher

 I know, I am being a little inconsistent between when I use readonly and not. Technically, I could use readonly on all of the constructor arguments... it's just not something I care about all that much. It does look cool though.

 Choosing the Correct EventDispatcherInterface
 - Down here, anywhere before our app actually starts, say $this->eventDispatcher->. Notice that the only method this has is dispatch(). I made a... tiny mistake. Let's back up. In GameApplication, when I autowired EventDispatcherInterface, I chose the one from Psr\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface, which contains the dispatch() method we need. So that's great.

 Inside of GameCommand, we autowired that same interface. But if you want the ability to attach listeners at run time, you need to autowire EventDispatcherInterface from Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher instead of Psr

 The one from Symfony extends the one from Psr:

 In reality, regardless of which interface you use, Symfony will always pass us the same object. That object does have a method on it called addListener(). So even if I had used the Psr interface, this method would have existed... it just would have looked funny inside of my editor.

 Anyways, the first argument of this is the name of the event, which is going to match the class name that we're dispatching. So we can say FightStartingEvent::class. And then, to keep it simple, I'm going to be lazy and pass an inline function(). I'll also use ($io)... so that inside I can say $io->note('Fight is starting...')

 And... done! We're dispatching the event inside of GameApplication... and since we've registered the listener here, it should be called!

 Let's try it! At your terminal, say:

  php ./bin/console app:game:play
 We'll choose our character and... got it - [NOTE] Fight is starting.... If we battle again... we get the same message. Awesome!

 Next, let's make this more powerful by passing information to our listener, like who is about to battle. Plus, we'll see how the event listener system is used in a real Symfony app by leveraging the container to wire everything up.

11.3 I'll undo all of that inside of GameApplication, FightStartingEvent and also GameCommand.

 Creating an Event Subscriber
 - As easy as this inline listener is, it's more common to create a separate class for your listener. You can either create a listener class, which is basically a class that has this code here as a public function, or you can create a class called a subscriber. Both are completely valid ways to use the pub/sub pattern. The only difference is how you register a listener versus a subscriber, which is pretty minor, and you'll see that in a minute. Let's refactor to a subscriber because they're easier to set up in Symfony.

 In the Event/ directory, create a new PHP class called... how about... OutputFightStartingSubscriber, since this subscriber is going to output that a battle is beginning

 Event listeners don't need to extend any base class or implement any interface, but event subscribers do. They need to implement EventSubscriberInterface

 Go to "Code" -> "Generate" or Command+N on a Mac and select "Implement methods" to generate getSubscribedEvents()

 Nice! With an event subscriber, you'll list which events you subscribe to right inside this class. So we'll say FightStartingEvent::class => 'onFightStart'

 This says:

  When the FightStartingEvent happens, I want you to call the onFightStart() method right inside this class!

 Create that: public function onFightStart()... which will receive a FightStartingEvent argument

 For the guts of this, go over to GameCommand and steal the $io line

 By the way, the  object is kind of hard to pass from console commands into other parts of your code... so I'm going to ignore that complexity here and just create a new one with $io = new SymfonyStyle(new ArrayInput([]), new ConsoleOutput()

 Now that we have a subscriber, back in GameCommand, let's hook that up! Instead of addListener(), say addSubscriber(), and inside of that, new OutputFightStartingSubscriber

 Easy! Testing time! I'll exit, choose my character and... wow! It's working so well, it's outputting twice. We're amazing!

12.1 One more design pattern to go! And honestly, I think we may have saved the best for last. It's the decorator pattern. This pattern is a structural pattern, so it's all about how you organize and connect related classes. That will make more sense as we uncover it.

 Definition
 - Here's the technical definition:

 The decorator pattern allows you to attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

  Yeah... Let's try this definition instead:

 The decorator pattern is like an intentional man-in-the-middle attack. You replace a class with your custom implementation, run some code, then call the true method.

 Before we get any deeper and nerdier, let's see it in action.

 The Goal
 - Here's the goal: I want to print something onto the screen whenever a player levels up. The logic for leveling up lives inside of XpCalculator

 But instead of changing the code in this class, we're going to apply the decorator pattern, which will allow us to run code before or after this logic... without actually changing the code inside.

 This is a particularly common pattern to leverage if the class you want to modify is a vendor service that... you can't actually change. And especially if that class doesn't give us any other way to hook into it, like by implementing the observer or strategy patterns.

 Adding the Interface to Support Decoration
 - For the decorator pattern to work, there's just one rule: the class that we want to decorate (meaning the class we want to extend or modify - XpCalculator in our case) needs to implement an interface. You'll see why in a few minutes. If XpCalculator were a vendor package, we... would just have to hope they did a good job and made it implement an interface.

 But since this is our code, we can add one. In the Service/ directory, create a new class... but change it to an interface. Let's call it XpCalculatorInterface. Then, I'll go steal the method signature for addXp(), paste that here, add a use statement and a semicolon

 Easy enough!

 Over in XpCalculator, implement XpCalculatorInterface

 This shows us why a class must implement an interface to support decoration. Because the classes that use our XpCalculator can now type-hint an interface instead of the concrete class, we're going to be able to swap out the true XpCalculator for our own class, known as the decorator. Let's create that class now!

Auto merge of #13810 - tfpk:tfpk/macro-inline, r=Veykril

Add action to expand a declarative macro once, inline. Fixes #13598

This commit adds a new r-a method, `expandMacroInline`, which expands the macro that's currently selected. See  #13598 for the most applicable issue; though I suspect it'll resolve part of #5949 and make #11888 significantly easier).

The macro works like this:

![rust-analyser-feature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10906982/208813167-3123e379-8fd5-4206-a4f4-5af1129565f9.gif)

I have 2 questions before this PR can be merged:

1. **Should we rustfmt the output?** The advantage of doing this is neater code. The disadvantages are we'd have to format the whole expr/stmt/block (since there's no point just formatting one part, especially over multiple lines), and maybe it moves the code around more in weird ways. My suggestion here is to start off by not doing any formatting; and if it appears useful we can decide to do formatting in a later release.
2.   **Is it worth solving the `$crate` hygiene issue now?** -- I think this PR is usable as of right now for some use-cases; but it is annoying that many common macros (i.e. `println!()`, `format!()`) can't be expanded further unless the user guesses the correct `$crate` value. The trouble with solving that issue is that I think it's complicated and imperfect. If we do solve it; we'd also need to either change the existing `expandMacro`/`expandMacroInline` commands; provide some option to allow/disallow `$crate` expanding; or come to some other compromise.

commit: give a hint when a commit message has been abandoned

If we launch an editor for the user to create a commit
message, they may put significant work into doing so.
Typically we try to check common mistakes that could cause
the commit to fail early, so that we die before the user
goes to the trouble.

We may still experience some errors afterwards, though; in
this case, the user is given no hint that their commit
message has been saved. Let's tell them where it is.

ahead-behind: do not die when we see no INTERESTING pending object

We currently die if we are fed an ahead/behind with zero
objects (`foo..foo` in the most basic case, but in practice
something like `foo@{upstream}..foo`, when `foo` has just
been merged).  The problem is that we let
`handle_revision_arg` parse it, and then pick the pieces out
of the pending object list. So "^foo" looks no different to
us there than "foo".

This patch hacks around it by picking up the UNINTERESTING
object in that case. However, this isn't great because:

  1. Now we won't notice some types of bogus input.

  2. We end up reporting the name of the UNINTERESTING object.

We probably should pick apart the ".." ourselves, or even
just change it to ":" or whitespace.

kvnemesis: uniquely identify all versions

This is essentially a v2 of kvnemesis. While a lot of code has changed, it's not a rewrite, rather we are actually bringing kvnemesis closer to the idea which ultimately led to it being built. That idea is that if values can uniquely identify the operation which wrote them, serializability checking becomes easier as any observation of a value totally orders the reader and the writer with respect to each other. "Easier" meant both simpler code, as well as actually being able to computationally do the verification on complex histories.

Prior to this PR, kvnemesis was writing unique values where it could, but it couldn't do it for deletions - after all, a deletion is like writing a "nothing" to MVCC, and there wasn't any way to make two "nothings" distinguishable. Having broken with the basic premise of unique values, there was a lot of bending over backwards going on to avoid, for the most part, devolving into a "normal" serializability checker. However, for contrived edge cases this would not be avoidable, and so there would be histories that kvnemesis just couldn't handle.

"v2" (this PR) gets this right. The main contribution is that we now thread kvnemesis' sequence numbers all the way down into MVCC and back up with the RangeFeed. Values are now truly unique: a deletion tombstone is identifiable via its `MVCCValueHeader`, which carries the `kvnemesisutil.Seq` of the `Operation` that originally wrote it. On top of this, everything "just works" as you expect.

Plumbing testing-only fields through the KV API protobufs isn't something that was taken lightly and that required a good amount of deliberation. However, we figured out a clever (maybe too clever?) way to have these fields be zero-sized in production, meaning they cannot possibly affect production logic and they also do not influence struct sizes or the wire encoding. As a drawback, kvnemesis requires the `crdb_test` build tag (it will `t.Skip()` otherwise).

The remainder of this PR is mostly improvements in code quality. `echodriven` testing was introduced for many of the tests that could benefit from it. The core components of kvnemesis were reworked for clarity (the author spent the first week very confused and wishes for that experience to remain unrepeated by anyone). kvnemesis also tracks the execution timestamps as reported by the KV layer, which a future change could [use](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/92898) for additional validation.

Of note is the updated doc comment, which is reproduced below in entirety.

Package kvnemesis exercises the KV API with random concurrent traffic (as
well as splits, merges, etc) and then validates that the observed behaviors
are serializable.

It does so in polynomial time based on the techniques used by [Elle] (see in
particular section 4.2.3), using the after-the-fact MVCC history as a record
of truth. It ensures that all write operations embed a unique identifier that
is stored in MVCC history, and can thus identify which of its operations'
mutations are reflected in the database ("recoverability" in Elle parlance).

A run of kvnemesis proceeds as follows.

First, a Generator is instantiated. It can create, upon request, a sequence
in which each element is a random Operation. Operations that are mutations
(i.e. not pure reads) are assigned a unique kvnemesisutil.Seq which will be
stored alongside the MVCC data written by the Operation.

A pool of worker threads concurrently generates Operations and executes them
against a CockroachDB cluster. Some of these Operations may
succeed, some may fail, and for some of them an ambiguous result may be
encountered.
Alongside this random traffic, kvnemesis maintains a RangeFeed that ingests
the MVCC history. This creates a "carbon copy" of the MVCC history.

All of these workers wind down once they have in aggregate completed a
configured number of steps.

Next, kvnemesis validates that the Operations that were executed and the
results they saw match the MVCC history, i.e. checks for Serializability. In
general, this is an NP-hard problem[^1], but the use of unique sequence
numbers (kvnemesisutil.Seq) makes it tractable, as each mutation in the MVCC
keyspace uniquely identifies the Operation that must have written the value.

We make use of this property as follows. First, the Validate method iterates
through all Operations performed and, for each, inspects

- the type of the Operation (i.e. Put, Delete, Get, ...),
- the (point or range) key of the operation, and
- its results (i.e. whether there was an error or which key-value pairs were returned).

Each atomic unit (i.e. individual non-transactional operation, or batch of
non-transactional operations, or transaction) results in a slice (in order
in which the Operations within executed[^2]) of observations, where each
element is either an observed read or an observed write.

For example, a Batch that first writes `v1` to `k1`, then scans `[k1-k3)`
(reading its own write as well as some other key k2 with value v2) and then
deletes `k3` would generate the following slice:

       [
         observedWrite(k1->v1),
         observedScan(k1->v1, k2->v2),
         observedWrite(k3->v3),
       ]

Each such slice (i.e. atomic unit) will then be compared to the MVCC history.
For all units that succeeded, their writes must match up with versions in
the MVCC history, and this matching is trivial thanks to unique values
(including for deletions, since we embed the kvnemesisutil.Seq in the value),
and in particular a single write will entirely fix the MVCC timestamp at
which the atomic unit must have executed.

For each read (i.e. get or scan), we compute at which time intervals each
read would have been valid. For example, if the MVCC history for a key `k1`
is as follows:

                  k1

       	 -----------------
       	 t5      v2
       	 t4
       	 t3
       	 t2     <del>
       	 t1      v1

then

  - observedGet(k1->v1)  is valid for [t1,t2),
  - observedGet(k1->nil) is valid for [0,t1) and [t2,t5), and
  - observedGet(k1->v2)  is valid for [t5,inf).

By intersecting the time intervals for each Operation in an atomic unit, we
then get the MVCC timestamps at which this Operation would have observed what
it ended up observing. If this intersection is empty, serializability must have
been violated.

In the error case, kvnemesis verifies that no part of the Operation became visible.
For ambiguous results, kvnemesis requires that either no Operation become visible,
or otherwise treats the atomic unit as committed.

The KV API also has the capability to return the actual execution timestamp directly
with responses. At the time of writing, kvnemesis does verify that it does do this
reliably, but it does not verify that the execution timestamp is contained in the
intersection of time intervals obtained from inspecting MVCC history[^3].

[Elle]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10554.pdf
[^1]: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/322154.322158
[^2]: there is currently concurrency within the atomic unit in kvnemesis. It
could in theory carry out multiple reads concurrently while not also writing,
such as DistSQL does, but this is not implemented today. See:

https://www.cnx-software.com/2023/01/02/150-axelera-m2-ai-accelerator-214-tops/

Huh what is this?

> Axelera M.2 AI accelerator module is said to deliver up to 214 TOPS of AI inference and up to 3200 FPS with ResNet -50 in a compact M.2 2280 form factor.

> Few details are available at this time, but the module is based on the company’s Metis AIPU (AI Processing Unit) using in-memory computing based on arrays of SRAM memory devices used to “store a matrix and perform matrix-vector multiplications “in-place” without intermediate movement of data”. This technology is said to “radically” increase the number of operations per computer cycle with without suffering from issues such as noise or lower accuracy.

> That would still be a serious jump compared to the Hailo 8 M.2 card with up to 26 TOPS, and even more when compared to the popular Coral Edge or Myriad X accelerators.

I've never heard of these things. Maybe I should start following this blog for real.

Right now I'd make that same decision, but if it can hold the line here for another month or so, I'd buy either way.

Bear markets are swift affairs. You have negative quarters following one another. If it can avoid collapsing for another 4-6 weeks, I'd say it is safe to get in.

Too bad I do not have money to put where my mouth is.

1:55pm. 47.55k. Let me take a break here. I need to do the chores anyway.

Simplified and unified Chacha20 API

We had 6 functions.  Now we only have 3.

While the basic variants are a bit more convenient to use, I don't
expect users will be using them frequently enough for it to matter.  But
having 6 functions to chose from instead of 3 is in my opinion a
non-negligible cost.

Then there's HChacha20, the odd one out.  While we're here breaking the
API left and right, I figured I needed a stable naming scheme for
everything.  And I think each function should be named
crypto_<cluster>_<function_name>(), with relatively few clusters.  And
HChacha20 quite clearly belong to the "chacha20" cluster, even though
it's sometimes used as kind of a hash (for the extended nonce DJB only
relies on its properties as a bastardised stream cipher).

And while we're speaking clusters, I'm considering having one man page
per cluster, with no regards towards whether a function is "advanced" or
not.  In practice this would mean:

- Bundling HChacha20 and Chacha20 functions in the same man page.  This
  would help highlight how they're related.

- Bundling low-level EdDSA building blocks with the high-level
  construction.  We can always push the advanced stuff down the man
  page, but the main point here is to make it easier to find.  Oh and
  we'd perhaps add the conversion to X25519 as well.

- Bundling dirty X25519 function together with the clean one. And
  perhaps the conversion to EdDSA too.

- The Elligator functions are already documented together, but I think
  they deserve their dedicated prefix. Like, "crypto_elligator_".

However we go about it, I'd like to strive towards a more systematic way
of documenting things, to the point of enabling some automatic checks as
hinted in #250.

Remove myGMRS query source

I was hesitant to add this because the owner expressed some desire to
convert this to a paid-only feature in the future. However, he
assured me it would remain available to non-premium members in order
to enable CHIRP support, so I put it in. Now, nine days after it was
available in a build, the story has changed and the feature will be
restricted to premium-only users, contrary to the original agreement.

We have one other paid-only query source in CHIRP and that is
RadioReference. It's quite a pain because only developers with premium
accounts can work on that code, which has been a problem ever since we
added it. However, RadioReference is huge and undeniably worth the
trouble. Since myGMRS is ... not that, I'm removing it so we don't
end up with a long-lived feature that we can't maintain.
