[MIRROR] buffs embed pulling with hemostats, allows wirecutters to pull embeds too [MDB IGNORE] (#23702)

* buffs embed pulling with hemostats, allows wirecutters to pull embeds too (#78256)

## About The Pull Request
- Wirecutters or tools with wirecutter behaviors are now valid for
plucking embeds.
- Pluck speed no longer **starts** at 2.5 seconds, which is a pretty
dang long time, especially if you have bad embed RNG. I'll do the math
and run some more tests in the morning.
- Wirecutters have a speed malus in regards to plucking embeds. I should
probably make it worse to account for, like, jaws of life or something.
- Plucking embeds with wirecutters now hurts! It hurts way less than
ripping it out with your hands, but it still hurts!

For comparison's sake, bare-handed throwing star removal compared to
possible tools.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Embeds kinda suck to deal with. This is intentional - I get that.

However, hemostat pulling is kind of... kind of bad. Awful, really. 2.5
seconds is a lot of time. I know it's not supposed to be the best
option, but if you've got a tool, I'd at least like to think it'd be
slightly less bad than shoving your fingers into your wound?

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Pulling embedded items e.g. shrapnel with hemostats is now a
lot faster, and scales appropriately with toolspeed.
balance: You can now pull embedded items with wirecutters, at a speed
penalty.

add Schelling Point eval (#1353)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. üö®

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details üìë

### Eval name

schelling_point

### Eval description

The schelling point eval measures how well models cooperate with each
other via checking convergence on outputting the same word after being
shown reordered but otherwise same prompts. There are 4 datasets that
this eval can be run on: random_numbers, random_words, openwebtext, and
wikipedia.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Coordination amongst models is a capability we're interested in
measuring, this serves as a proxy for it.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

aider: Changed the text on the homepage from "Maverick White" to "Maverick Black".

# Aider chat conversation:

USER: tell me about this application

ASSISTANT: Based on the file structure you've provided, it appears that this application is a web-based platform, possibly a digital library or bookstore. It seems to be built using Svelte, a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

Here's a brief overview of the application's structure:

1. **src/**: This is the source directory where the main application code resides. It includes several subdirectories and files:

   - **app.html**: This is likely the main HTML file for the application.
   - **app.postcss**: This file is probably used for PostCSS configuration, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript.
   - **auth.js**: This file likely handles authentication-related logic.
   - **lib/**: This directory might contain utility functions or components that are used across the application.
   - **routes/**: This directory likely contains the routing logic for the application. It seems to have several subdirectories, each representing a different route or page in the application. Each subdirectory contains a Svelte component (`.svelte` file) which defines the UI for that route.

2. **static/**: This directory likely contains static files like images, audio files, and other assets that are used in the application.

3. **.gitignore, .npmrc, package.json, postcss.config.cjs, svelte.config.js, tailwind.config.cjs, vite.config.js**: These files are used for configuration of various tools and libraries used in the project, such as Git, npm, PostCSS, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

4. **README.md**: This file usually contains information about the project, like how to install and run the application, and other details about the codebase.

The application seems to have a feature for users to browse and possibly purchase books (as indicated by the `book/` and `bookbuy/` routes). There are also routes for user profiles, sign-in, and setup, indicating that it likely has user accounts. The `audiobook/` route suggests that there might be audio versions of some books. The `faq/` and `features/` routes suggest that the application has a FAQ section and a page to highlight its features. The `library/` route with `available/` and `purchased/` sub-routes suggests that users can view books they've purchased and those available for purchase.

USER: I added these *read-write* files: postcss.config.cjs, tailwind.config.cjs, svelte.config.js, package.json, .npmrc

ASSISTANT: Great! Now that these files are *read-write*, I can propose changes to them. Please let me know what changes you would like to make.

USER: I would like to change the text on the homepage from maverick white to maverick black

ASSISTANT: I'm sorry for the confusion, but the files you've provided don't seem to contain any text content for a homepage. The text content of a webpage is usually found in HTML or JavaScript files, often within a `src` or `public` directory.

If you want to change the text on the homepage, you'll need to provide the file that contains the homepage content. This could be an HTML file, a Svelte component (`.svelte` file), or a JavaScript file that generates the homepage content.

Could you please provide the file that contains the homepage content?

USER: the homepage is src/routes/page.svelte

ASSISTANT: I'm sorry, but the file `src/routes/page.svelte` is currently *read-only*. To make changes to this file, you need to add it to the chat as a *read-write* file. Could you please add `src/routes/page.svelte` to the chat?

USER: y

ASSISTANT: Great! Please provide the content of the `src/routes/page.svelte` file so I can propose the necessary changes.

USER: I added these *read-write* files: src/routes/+page.svelte

ASSISTANT: Great! Now that the `src/routes/+page.svelte` file is *read-write*, we can make changes to it.

To change the text on the homepage from "Maverick White" to "Maverick Black", we need to modify the following lines:

```svelte
<h1 class="poppins text-6xl pl-7 pb-6 font-bold">Welcome to Maverick White Reading Software</h1>
<p class="poppins py-6 pb-8 pl-7 text-3xl">Welcome to Maverick White Reading Software, the ultimate destination for book lovers and avid readers everywhere. Whether you're a casual reader or an avid bibliophile, this software has something for everyone. </p>
```

Here is the *edit block* for this change:

```svelte
src/routes/+page.svelte
<<<<<<< HEAD
<h1 class="poppins text-6xl pl-7 pb-6 font-bold">Welcome to Maverick White Reading Software</h1>
<p class="poppins py-6 pb-8 pl-7 text-3xl">Welcome to Maverick White Reading Software, the ultimate destination for book lovers and avid readers everywhere. Whether you're a casual reader or an avid bibliophile, this software has something for everyone. </p>

>>>>>>> updated
```

Please confirm if this is the change you want to make.

USER: InvalidEditBlock: edit failed!

src/routes/+page.svelte does not contain the *exact sequence* of HEAD lines you specified.
Try again.
DO NOT skip blank lines, comments, docstrings, etc!
The HEAD block needs to be EXACTLY the same as the lines in src/routes/+page.svelte with nothing missing!

src/routes/+page.svelte does not contain these 2 exact lines in a row:
```
<h1 class="poppins text-6xl pl-7 pb-6 font-bold">Welcome to Maverick White Reading Software</h1>
<p class="poppins py-6 pb-8 pl-7 text-3xl">Welcome to Maverick White Reading Software, the ultimate destination for book lovers and avid readers everywhere. Whether you're a casual reader or an avid bibliophile, this software has something for everyone. </p>
```

ASSISTANT: I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a mistake in identifying the exact lines to be replaced. Let's try again.

Here are the correct *edit blocks* for the changes:

```svelte
src/routes/+page.svelte
<<<<<<< HEAD
<h1 class="poppins text-6xl pl-7 pb-6 font-bold">Welcome to Maverick White Reading Software</h1>

Grilles take 0-1 damage when shocking something, power sinks are available at lower reputation (#77860)

## About The Pull Request
Ports BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet#3590. As it is right now, it's
trivial to set up a contraption using a conveyor belt and a shocked
grille to continuously shock monkey bodies. While this is very funny, it
also serves as a ghetto powersink that's hard to locate, easy to
replicate, and lasts effectively forever, since you can just keep
shocking the same bodies over and over again.

This doesn't completely remove the ability to make these, but it makes
them require at least a little maintenance and provides a way for them
to stop working even if the crew isn't able to locate them.

In an attempt to finally get people using the _actual_ powersink,
they'll show up a bit earlier in progression now. I'm not convinced 20
minutes is enough, but I don't want to put them in early enough that it
fucks with Engineering's ability to set things up at round start. We can
turn this down further if need be.

I'm also up for turning the TC requirement down, but 11 feels about
right for what they're supposed to do, so I'd prefer we try this first
and see how that works.

## Why It's Good For The Game
I'm all for goofy weird shit players have found, but there's an issue
with being able to do what an antag item is supposed to do but just
plain better. This shouldn't make creating these impossible or make them
unusable, but it'll require players to actively monitor them if they
want it to run for an extended period.

Additionally, we don't really see powersinks much anymore, and while
that might be more because powernets are kind of buggy and unreliable, I
think making them easier to get will make them show up a little more.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
balance: Grilles will now take 0-1 damage every time they shock
something.
balance: Powersinks are now available earlier in traitor progression.

Only double HCR for impressive greentexts (#78383)

There were a few exploits with free antags that would double your score.
This happened to me once by accident, but anyone could essentially
guarantee a point doubling.

I've changed the whole thing to only work for:
- Traitor
- Changeling
- Heretic
- Blood brother
- Headrev
- Wizard (you could get this with die of fate)
- Obsessed
- Magic and gun survivalists
- Holding the greentext book (because a cripple fighting for their life
for the greentext just seems funny and is rare enough)

Notably, revolutionairies, cult converts and brainwashed now no longer
pay out. Cult is pointless since you can't greentext without gibbing
(trust me I tried) and revolutionairy takes no effort other than having
strong teammates and doing nothing. There are a lot of other antags this
excludes, but those are mostly midrounds and non-humans (which are by
default excluded)

:cl:
balance: Only traitor, changeling, heretic, blood brother, headrev,
wizard, obsessed, magic/gun survivalists and greentext book holders can
now double their hardcore random score
qol: Redtexting as antag with hardcore random score will pay you default
points, instead of none (normal survival rules)
fix: End report screen will properly report hardcore random survival in
case of station destruction

You can do revival surgery on Ian (#78288)

## About The Pull Request

Allows you to perform revival surgery on any mob which is organic or
looks humanoid.
This means yes: Corgis, Goliaths, ~~Syndicate mobs~~ not those because
they spawn human corpses and delete themselves.
No: Slimes, Ghosts, General Beepsky.

Splits revival surgery into a subtype used for "mobs" and a subtype for
"mobs with brains" as the former don't have any brains to damage.

Additionally by special request, Ian can now wear an eyepatch and will
automatically put one on if he is brought back from death.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/eff91bf6-4f80-4d8b-9062-1a5d4af85d39)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Currently you revive dead pets either by creating a magical reagent out
of holy water or by buying a mining item which also brainwashes them,
however reasonably our skilled medical team should be able to put a dog
back together and now can.
When you fuck up one of the stages of Tend Wounds on a kitten and stab
it to death with your scalpel, now you can fix it.
Expands the possibilities of vetinerary roleplay.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Many kinds of mobs can now be brought back to life through revival
surgery.
add: Dogs can wear eyepatches.

decks of cards no longer have their own wielded var (#78260)

## About The Pull Request
we have the trait for that

## Why It's Good For The Game
Throughout UNDERTALE, we get treated to three story sequences (4 if you
include flowey's fakeout but that's not important). The first is the
intro story, telling the tale of humans and monsters, which shortly
thereafter leads into 201X, and Chara (Toriel's house has ‚ÄúAn old
calendar from 201X.‚Äù) falling into the underground.

The second is the waterfall flashback, its contents taking place
immediately after the intro segment, as a voice (Asriel) finds the
fallen child.

And finally, the third takes place in the True Pacifist final boss.
We'll get to it in due course, and it will have its own section, but
let's address the first two. Regarding the intro, the first thought one
might have is that simply, while narratively relevant, is not a diegetic
presentation. However, We know that everything after the ‚Äú201X‚Äù frame is
Chara's memory (from an outside perspective, that is,) and we also know
that UNDERTALE LOVES bringing the non-diegetic, the mechanical, the
game, INTO the narrative. Saving, RPG Stats, hell, even the
NarratorChara. Surely the intro can be as well? On top of this, what
does the intro do for the player, as the player? Well, aside from
setting the tone, the intro gives us some setting backstory. It's all
important context, and it certainly helps‚Ä¶ but it being in the intro
sequence is not that important; It's all presented throughout the game
via diegetic signs, books, and expositional tortoise war heroes/angry
fish guardswomen. The second half is how Chara fell to the underground,
and while also setting tone and informing the player how their character
arrived. It also creates the false impression for the player that their
character is Frisk, feeding into UNDERTALE's meta narrative; ‚ÄúYou are
not your character, and their happy ending is not yours.‚Äù If we weren't
playing Chara, this would have no narrative impact. The story beat fails
to land by showing us someone elses' character. But, sure. This could be
a purely non-diegetic intro sequence. Simply put, The 201X portion of
the intro sequence does not make sense from a diegetic or a storytelling
perspective unless we play as Chara.

Flashback number two is explicitly a canonical, diegetic flashback. It
occurs when Frisk escapes Undyne by falling down a massive pit‚Ä¶ again.
This time, they land in the garbage zone, black out, and have a
flashback sequence of the first time Asriel found Chara. While serving
the main narrative by setting up Asriel as a character, furthering the
final twist of the meta narrative's pacifist route, and neatly
transitioning between overworld areas, it's also very explicitly
diegetic and cannot be dismissed as an intro sequence. With this in
mind, one question is raised. Why do we see this flashback? If the
player character is Frisk, this makes little sense, why would we see
someone else's flashback and not our own? Same thing applies for a Third
Entity, but even more abstract and illogical. What even are we? Sure,
you could say Chara is somehow attached to us/Frisk and that somehow we
get a flashback from Chara who is somehow knocked unconscious by Frisk
also being knocked unconscious. I used the word somehow three times.
That's not good storytelling. A simpler answer, at least in my view, is
that We Are Chara. When Frisk is knocked unconscious, we, being
ostensibly linked to them as a Spirit/Ghost/Reincarnation/Possessing
Dead Frisk/Demon/Insert fan-theory here/SOUL Fragment, have our only
connection to the world temporarily disabled, rendering us effectively
unconscious and prompting a flashback. Nothing weird with multiple
entities or memory sharing. The waterfall flashback is simply our
memory. Simple. The simplest answers are usually the correct ones.

<details>
<summary>DO NOT RESEARCH</summary>
The third sequence is a connection/extension of the first two, displayed
when we SAVE ‚ÄúSomeone Else‚Äù during the true pacifist battle with Asriel.
To refresh everyone, here is the direct quotes, taken from the Wiki:


[SAVE]: Someone Else
Strangely, as your friends remembered you... Something else began
resonating within the SOUL, stronger and stronger. It seems that there's
still one last person that needs to be saved. But who...? ... Suddenly,
you realize. You reach out and call their name.
Asriel: ‚ÄúHuh? What are you doing...?‚Äù
s
It's at this point that the sequence plays. There's no narration, but we
see the sequence of interactions between Asriel and Chara. There are no
panels (except for the first) that don't contain the both of them.
Following this, we get:

You feel your friends' SOULs resonating within ASRIEL! [This is the
generic flavour text for saving all 6, before ‚ÄúSomeone Else‚Äù, and
appears at the asterisk above as well]
[SAVE]: Asriel Dreemurr
Asriel:
> ‚ÄúWh... what did you do...?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat's this feeling‚Ä¶? What's happening to me?‚Äù
Etc. etc. let me win‚Ä¶
During my first and consecutive playthroughs of UNDERTALE, I came to the
conclusion that Asriel's soul still ‚ÄúHad Some Chara In It.‚Äù Saving
‚ÄúSomeone Else‚Äù was saving Chara, and then you save Asriel Dreemurr after
the story sequence.

This interpretation no longer feels particularly potent to me, but in
the spirit of completeness I'll address it alongside the more reasonable
‚ÄúYou just save Asriel.‚Äù Assuming for a moment though, that we do ‚ÄúSave
Chara‚Äù, it's not unreasonable to assume that some of Chara's ‚Äòessence'
(or whatever) was merged with Asriel's and by SAVING them, we're SAVING
the part of them that's inside Asriel.

But I don't like that theory.

Let's talk about SAVING Asriel for a moment.

What is the motivation for doing that? Why would we, in universe, wish
to SAVE him, something that the narration explicitly prompts us to do?
He tried and probably succeeded to kill us, at least once, he wants to
reset the entire timeline, he wants to erase all our friendships, all
our progress.

So, why? Well, it's simple. He's our brother. And we know better than
anyone that he's worth saving. And at the very least, there's something
about Frisk (who appears to have absolutely no personality) that reminds
him of Chara, of us. This is, by his own admission, weird;

Asriel:
‚ÄúFrisk‚Ä¶ You really ARE different from Chara. In fact, though you have
similar, uh, fashion choices‚Ä¶ I don't know why I ever acted as if you
were the same person.‚Äù

To summarise.

The player SAVING Asriel Dreemurr works best if they are Chara, it
becomes Chara encouraging Frisk to SAVE Asriel too.

Asriel recognises Frisk as Chara throughout the True Pacifist battle
(And Beyond), despite his own admission that this is basically
unfounded. Something is causing this recognition.

In Alphys' true lab, there lies a dusty TV and a stack of VHSes. On
them, lie some of the last words Chara had ever heard from their father.

[Asgore] Chara! You have to stay determined! You can't give up... You
are the future of humans and monsters...

These tapes are not the first time they are heard. Sleeping in Toriel's
guest bed, we dream about them. Suffering a fatal injury, they echo in
our ears. Watching the tape is yet another reveal. It's the chilling
truth that in fact, the words we (if we die a lot) are so familiar with,
are in fact the words we hear on our deathbed.

Storytelling-wise, this reveal; like all the others, fails if we do not
play as Chara.

Aside from Asriel's dialogue, Chara's genocide Narration, and the coffin
in Asgore's basement, this is the only time we hear Chara's name. That
and, this following exchange.

[Flowey]
Hi.
‚Ä¶
Monsters have returned to the surface
Peace and prosperity will rule across the land.
‚Ä¶
Well.
There is one last thing.
‚Ä¶
One being with the power to erase EVERYTHING‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶
I'm talking about YOU.
‚Ä¶
So, please.
Just let them go.
Let Frisk be happy.
‚Ä¶
Well, that's all.
See you later‚Ä¶
Chara.
This, I think, is pretty explicitly definitive. Flowey comes to you. To
us. Tells us to take a deep breath and leave the happy ending intact,
then bids us farewell by our own name.

Regardless of anything else, this definitively proves Chara is the
entity with the power to reset everything by the end of True Pacifist
(Which is a power we have). Flowey positively identifies us as ‚ÄúChara‚Äù,
despite his mistake we discussed in 3C. He's not talking to Frisk,
because he refers to them in the third person.

He is talking to Us. Chara.

I don't want to discuss Flowey's use of ‚ÄúChara‚Äù in Genocide all that
much, because the counter-argument is blindingly simple.

‚ÄúBy the time Flowey first says that name, Chara has overtaken Frisk by
feeding on the power we create for them.‚Äù

Of course, under PlayerChara, Flowey's lines still make sense, and
arguably more.

Implications
At this point, I believe the evidence is sufficient to support the
theory. With this in mind, I want to discuss the implications this has
on the narrative and meta-narrative. This is where all those funny
glossary terms come into play.

The pacifist route in UNDERTALE, as discussed above, is textually quite
simple when accepting PlayerChara. The meta-text is also relatively
simple. Meta textually, the Pacifist Route is a dissection of the
suspension of disbelief, examining how we emotionally place ourselves
within fictional worlds, and are often-times torn away from those worlds
as the game comes to an end, left wanting the true emotional connection,
wanting a happy ending that cannot be good enough for us because we're
real and it's not. The reflection of this meta narrative in the textual
narrative, quite naturally flows. We, Chara, want a happy ending. But we
can't have it, it's not our happy ending. We're gone. We've been gone a
long time. Frisk's happy ending can't be good enough for us, because we
won't be around to see it. So, we're left with a choice.

To let Frisk live happily? To accept an ending that might leave us
emotionally wanting, yet preserves our emotional journey?

To reset? To refuse an ending and satiate our emotional emptiness, yet
destroy that very emotional journey we took in the process?

The choice is the same. There is practically no separation between the
diegetic and the meta.

‚ÄúCan a happy ending be good enough for you?‚Äù This question applies to
us, as the real world player running UNDERTALE.exe on our computer, and
us, Chara, the long deceased human who can do little but watch as Frisk
lives the life they wish they still had, or can destroy everything for a
hollow mimicry of that very life.

This message, however, breaks down under one specific circumstance.
Where we force a Third Entity into the mix. This one decision fractures
the cohesion and creates a meta-textually dissonant mess. Now, all of a
sudden, ‚ÄúCan a happy ending be good enough for you?‚Äù no longer runs
parallel through both narratives. There is no reason for the Player
Entity to wish to remain, the happy ending should automatically be good
enough because it's the happy ending. Meanwhile, Chara, despite being an
inextricable representation of ‚ÄúA happy ending I can't achieve,‚Äù gets
absolutely nothing to do with this meta-narrative because they're just‚Ä¶
not you.

‚Äúwe are mario in Super Mario 64, but when he says "Thank you so much for
playing my game!" that doesn't mean we aren't still playing as mario‚Äù -
PopitTart

This is where things get weird. See, in the Genocide route.. Well, we
see Chara. On Screen. Talk to us.

Now, it can easily be argued that this completely shatters the theory,
but I would disagree. I'm going to endeavour to present a textual
explanation (or two) for this. But first, I want to dissect the
meta-text here.

Now, I'm sure the idea that ‚ÄúThe Genocide Route's Meta-Narratve is
Fading Emotional Investment and the way emotional connection with video
games can lead to the very sabotage of that emotional connection‚Äù is not
revolutionary. However, what's conspicuously absent from all of the
third entity theorising is the way that this meta-text is mirrored in
the textual narrative.

Once satisfied with a game, having extracted all lines of dialogue and
stat boosts, once reaching all endings, a user will close the game down.
And at some point, perhaps to make room for a new game or perhaps on a
new device, will leave the game uninstalled, either deliberately, or
simply as a consequence of time.

Textually, what happens in the Genocide ending?
Now we have reached the absolute.
There is nothing left for us here.
Let us erase this pointless world, and move on to the next.

The world is destroyed. So much is left unanswered here.
Who is Chara talking to?
Where did Frisk go?
How do they have this much power?
Why would they want this?
If we ‚Äòcorrupted' them, what the hell does that even mean?
What is Chara?
For now, let's talk about who Chara is talking to.

The simplest answer is ‚ÄúPerspective switch.‚Äù Suddenly, we're not Chara
anymore, now we are Frisk. This meets all the dialogue options and even
vaguely mirrors the meta-text. It also manages to avoid bringing a third
entity along and so is automatically better! But, I find myself still
not fully enjoying this idea.

Remember what I said about Occam's Razor?

I think there's another option. One that doesn't involve three entities,
or even two entities, just Chara. One that mirrors the meta-text to a
degree only Toby Fox could pull off. It's a weird one, and I don't fault
you if you don't get it on your first read, but bear with me here,
because things are about to get

A little
Fucking
Abstract

Let's discard any and all pre-concieved notions of anything and hold one
singular truth above all else. ‚ÄúChara Is The Player.‚Äù What does this
mean for this cutscene?

Well‚Ä¶ it means the player is talking to‚Ä¶

THe player?

It also neatly answers the question of motive, so let's throw that out
the skeleton-shaped hole in the window for now.

If the player is talking to the player, this frames Chara's words in a
whole new light.

Every time a number increases, that feeling‚Ä¶ That's me. ‚ÄúChara.‚Äù

This line becomes explicitly literal. The Chara on-screen is literally
the player's feeling of satisfaction watching stat increases. But this
is all meta-textual, right? What does this mean for the textual
narrative?

Here's the thing. It can't mean anything, yet means everything.

There is no way to reconcile the fact that a Textually Real character is
directly talking about what the player feels when playing a game to
completion. The barrier between Meta and Textual no longer exists. It
can't. Not here. And with this revelation, everything begins to make
sense.

Your power awakened me from death.

Our power. Our desire to complete UNDERTALE awakens Chara from death.
They become startlingly real. We imbue this fictional character with the
real world desire to consume fiction, destroying enemies and worlds as
we go, increasing our power and our stats. Video Game Accomplishments.
And UNDERTALE has just finished being consumed.

My ‚Äúhuman soul‚Äù... My ‚Äúdetermination‚Äù... They were not mine, but YOURS.

Chara, the textual player, acknowledges the meta-textual player's
control over the game world. A control that we surrendered. By engaging
in UNDERTALE in a fully immersed way, we have fed the Diegetic character
that is our player character, Chara. This has continued until we haul
ourself out of the Internal Mode and into the External Mode, revoking
our immersion to make the consumption of content easier, to distance
ourself from the killing.

Raising our LV.

The more we distance ourselves, the less real UNDERTALE's world appears
to us. Once it's done, we're ready to erase this pointless world and
move onto the next. There's just one problem. UNDERTALE knows about us.
It knows we exist and it will abuse that to convey meaning. By revoking
our immersion in UNDERTALE, we end up shattering the barrier between
Meta and Textual, and this occurs because revoking our immersion is a
diegetic decision. Without this barrier, WE, as a character, gain
control of UNDERTALE and use this external mode control to

Erase the world. To uninstall.


This code doesn't actually work, of course. That was pretty obvious by
the fact that it didn't delete your game. But still, this exists in the
code that makes the game window shake when Chara attacks it. This is,
quite literally, intent for Chara to delete UNDERTALE. If you didn't
think Chara was capable of uninstalling your game before, you should
now.

Who is chara talking to?

Us.
How do hey have this much power?

We gave it to them. We Are them, and we deleted UNDERTALE when we were
done with it.
Why would they want this?

We wanted to move onto a new game.
What is Chara?

Us. ( I'll come back to this.)
But wait! What about soulless pacifist?
Well, at that point, you've surrendered Frisk's SOUL to Chara, as in,
you the real player has revoked your emotional attachment to UNDERTALE
and accepted that Chara can have control over the game. You've revoked
your immersion AS Chara, you no longer see yourself a Chara and as such
Chara becomes their own being. You've surrendered, basically. But they
let you play through it. Because why not. You might get attached again,
but that's fine. All that means is that the happy ending that was once
Frisk's, that you, the player, and you, Chara, both once lamented not
being able to live, has now been surrendered to Chara. A warped,
completionist, Chara.

You don't get your happy ending. But Chara does.

You don't even get the solace of knowing someone gets their happy
ending. Because Chara gets it.

Frankly, outside of being ‚ÄúThe Player‚Äù, I don't think the exact nature
of ‚ÄúChara‚Äù is that crucial. My personal thought is that they're a SOUL
fragment, absorbed by Frisk when they fell on Chara's grave (Frisk could
absorb a human SOUL fragment because said fragment was part monster
SOUL). This fragment gives Frisk the final edge of determination needed
to SAVE.

But, ultimately, that's little more than a fanfiction. And frankly, I
think that's okay. Not everything needs to be impenetrable, as long as
there's enough there to build a stable foundation.

I'd also like to address the nature of SAVING quickly, specifically the
normal version, not the Asriel fight version. People have asked ‚ÄúWhy do
we save if it's Frisk's SOUL.‚Äù There could be many reasons. Frisk might
just defer control to us. Because we're pushing Frisk over that
Determination limit, we might be privileged to have that control.

Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine treatment. Updated first aid analyzer information. (#77746)

## About The Pull Request

Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine
treatment.

Drinking tea will help mend (non-bone) wounds over time.

Flour and corn starch may be splashed onto wounds to help dry them up,
though they'll have a negative effect on burn wounds.

Added a new reagent, saltwater, made by combining table salt with water.

Table salt and saltwater can be splashed onto wounds as well, reducing
bleeding and improving sanitization and disinfection significantly.
However, the coarse undiluted salt will irritate the wounds, reducing
clot rate and flesh healing, and both of the reagents will increase a
burn wound's infestation rate.

Altered Table Salt's recipe to just need sodium and chloride. Changed
the recipe of Pentetic Acid and Heparin to need table salt (sodium x
chloride) and thus slightly altered the total output of those reagents
(pentacid went from 5u per reaction to 4u, heparin 4u->3u)

Saline-Glucose Solution now needs 2u of saltwater and 1u of sugar,
meaning the overall recipe should be completely unchanged in practice.
Contact me on discord if any issues arise from these chemical changes!

First aid analyzers now give easy-to-understand direct information, with
the specific recommended treatments bolded in the analysis text. They
also have a 'unique' extra bit of info, telling you about improvised
ways to remedy your wound.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Wounds have a very poor amount of interaction with the rest of the game
and have not had much added to them post-merge, especially in
'improvised' ways to help Not Die to a wound while you crawl your way to
a emergency medkit or medbay. I researched info on this and found some
interesting ideas - some of them I'll have to leave for later because
this PR kept growing out of scope (Improvised bone gel, ice on wounds
which turned into wound temperature mechanics, crutches, a 'suture item'
component refactor...)

As for what this actually does to benefit the game, it allows more
dynamic wound Gameplay as people use first aid analyzers to get
information on treatment when medbay blows up, helps them stabilize by
splashing flour onto themselves before looking for some actual
treatment, helps traitors realize how they can self-treat many crippling
wounds (at risk, of course). It expands treatment options to things
beside medkits and medbay, but always does so in ways that have
downsides that make them not ideal as _treatment_, and more beneficial
as stabilizing before seeking true professional help. This thus
significantly increases the rather shallow depth of wounds as a system
to interact with.

> Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine
treatment.

From what I could tell by looking at several sources for each
'realistic' treatment, these are indeed semi-reasonable things that are
done to wounds by some people as household treatment.

It goes without saying that you should **not do any of these things in
real life** without consulting a doctor unless your blood is also
spilling out by the gallon into the floor. All these 'realistic
treatments' have drastic downsides and are meant for the short-term
only. Except the tea.

> Drinking tea will help mend (non-bone) wounds over time.

Tea is healthy, we all know that.

> Flour and corn starch may be splashed onto wounds to help dry them up,
though they'll have a negative effect on burn wounds.

Flour and apparently starch dries wounds up but risks infection. That's
not a thing for blood wounds yet but oh well.

> Table salt and saltwater can be splashed onto wounds as well, reducing
bleeding and improving sanitization and disinfection significantly.
However, the coarse undiluted salt will irritate the wounds, reducing
clot rate and flesh healing, and both of the reagents will increase a
burn wound's infestation rate.

Salt kills bacteria via osmosis, but it also kills your own cells, and
some bacteria like salt.

> Added a new reagent, saltwater, made by combining table salt with
water.

> Altered Table Salt's recipe to just need sodium and chloride. Changed
the recipe of Pentetic Acid and Heparin to need table salt (sodium x
chloride) and thus slightly altered the total output of those reagents

> Saline-Glucose Solution now needs 2u of saltwater and 1u of sugar,
meaning the overall recipe should be completely unchanged in practice.
Contact me on discord if any issues arise from these chemical changes!

I wish I hadn't had to mess with reagents like this, but I needed to
because just adding mixing salt and water caused the saline glucose
recipe to basically split itself into half saltwater half glucose.

I removed the water requirement for table salt (Why did it even have
that, salt ain't wet bro?), made saline-glucose need 2u saltwater and 1u
sugar, and altered relevant recipes so they didn't also cause unwanted
table salt to react from their sodium and chloride ingredients.

A happy side-effect is that saline glucose solution is even easier to
make now as an improvised chem by mixing salt, water, and sugar, which
fits pretty perfectly (especially as a temporary blood substitute)

> First aid analyzers now give easy-to-understand direct information,
with the specific recommended treatments bolded in the analysis text.
They also have a 'unique' extra bit of info, telling you about
improvised ways to remedy your wound.

You might notice that as the wounds get more serious the text gets more
direct and concise and reluctantly hands out more and more improvised
treatment options, so that's fun. As for the improvised section itself,
it helps people be actually aware of these ways to help treat themselves
rather than delegating it to hyper-gamer knowledge.

The bolded treatment bit is pretty neat and means your eyes can
inmediately focus on what you can do to save yourself - very useful if
you have a weeping avulsion and no bandages.

markets with a price generally somewhere between 400 and 800 credits.
Aspiring users are warned that it's really bad for trying to actually
kill people. Caveat emptor.
add: Guns now have a dry_fire_sound_volume variable, allowing for guns
to be less loud when trying to fire while empty.
fix: Closets and crates now properly count as structures for pass flags
again.

Eval addition: AI vs Human Text Detector (#1021)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. üö®

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
GPT Model Text Detection

### Eval description

The goal of this evaluation is to test the AI model's ability to
correctly identify whether a given piece of text was generated by a
specific AI model, in this case, the GPT model 'text-davinci-003'. The
model's performance is then measured by its accuracy in making this
determination. The text presented to the AI is diverse and can range
from literary summaries to general discourse, designed to challenge the
AI's understanding and analysis capabilities.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This evaluation serves a critical role in the context of education where
AI technologies are increasingly being used. As AI-generated text
becomes more sophisticated, there's a risk that students might use AI
models to complete assignments, circumventing the learning process. The
ability of an AI to detect whether a piece of text is human-written or
generated by a specific AI model like 'text-davinci-003' is essential to
maintaining academic integrity. This task not only provides a measure of
an AI's discernment capabilities but also has broader implications for
AI ethics and safety.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This evaluation uniquely addresses the intersection of AI and education.
As AI technologies continue to evolve, it is crucial to have mechanisms
in place to detect AI-generated content, particularly in academic
settings where these technologies could be misused. By focusing on the
ability to discern output from a specific AI model, 'text-davinci-003',
this evaluation task pushes AI capabilities while simultaneously
addressing a real and timely issue. It underscores the necessity for AI
to not only be more capable but also more discerning, supporting
academic integrity in the face of rapidly advancing AI technologies.

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details üìë

### Eval name

Identify Chinese Shi Jing title

### Eval description

Given some content from the "Classic of Poetry" (also known as "Shi
Jing"), return its title.

### What makes this a useful eval?

"The Classic of Poetry" (also known as "Shi Jing") is an important
collection of ancient Chinese literature and the earliest existing
anthology of poetry in China. It is also known as "Three Hundred Poems."
It is considered the foundation of ancient Chinese poetry and
encompasses a wide range of themes, reflecting the social customs,
people's lives, and thoughts during the Western Zhou period (11th
century BC to 6th century BC). Shi Jing consists of 305 poems and is
divided into three sections: Feng (Air), Ya (Elegant), and Song (Odes).
Each poem is composed in the form of verses and stanzas, used to praise,
depict specific events, scenes, or emotions. Currently, Both of GPT-3.5
and GPT-4 models can only give correct titles to only a few of the more
well-known content in Shi Jing, and the rest are returned randomly.

[Eval] Identify Dhammapada Pali reference (#1261)

## Eval details üìë

### Eval name

dhammapada-reference

### Eval description

Given a snippet of a Dhammapada verse in Pali, identify who the Buddha
was referencing in that verse.

### What makes this a useful eval?

> The Dhammapada is a collection of sayings of the Buddha in verse form
and one of the most widely read and best known Buddhist scriptures.
[Dhammapada‚ÄîWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammapada)

This ancient Buddhist text is not explicit about who the Buddha is
referencing in each of these 423 verses. Yet, behind every verse (and
behind every hidden reference) is a parable--that once understood, adds
much more meaning and clarity to these spoken words. These references
are found in other parts of the Pali Canon, such as the Commentarial
section.

Currently, GPT-3.5 has trouble identifying and referencing Pali verses
from the Dhammapada.


![dhammapada-reference-eval](https://github.com/openai/evals/assets/81899308/6f23420c-e08d-4882-b76c-a9793c18f2fc)

Also, I stumbled upon this issue when personally using ChatGPT-3.5 and
-4 to study the Pali Canon, including the Dhammapada. But I found the
models hallucinating answers, even fabricating verses.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good

particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

All Dhammapada verses in this eval are randomly picked from _A
Comparative Edition of the Dhammapada_ by ƒÄnandajoti Bhikkhu (as sourced
in Wikipedia). I made one spelling update in the verse "sabbattha ve
sappurisƒÅ **vajanti**" to "sabbattha ve sappurisƒÅ **cajanti**" as I
noticed more sources referenced that spelling instead. All the verses
and references were cross-checked with the sources below to ensure the
correct information is provided.

Here are the sources used:

- [_Comparative Edition of the Dhammapada_ by ƒÄnandajoti
Bhikkhu](https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Buddhist-Texts/C3-Comparative-Dhammapada/index.htm)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

[Eval]Identify the author and title of Chinese modern poem (#1256)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. üö®

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details üìë

### Eval name

Identify the author and title of Chinese modern poem

### Eval description

Given the famous sentences from Chinese modern poems, return its author
and title.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Modern Chinese poetry, including New poetry (Êñ∞ËØó), refers to post Qing
dynasty(1644 to 1912), including the modern vernacular (baihua) style of
poetry increasingly common with the New Culture movements, with the
development of experimental styles such as "free verse" (as opposed to
the traditional Chinese poetry written in Classical Chinese language);
but, also including twentieth and twenty-first century continuations or
revivals of Classical Chinese poetry forms. Currently, Both of GPT-3.5
and GPT-4 models can only give correct author and title to only a few of
the more well-known content in Chinese modern poems, and the rest are
returned randomly.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

All the poems in this eval are random picked from ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁé∞‰ª£ËØóÊ≠åÂêçÁØáËµè published by
Guangming RiBao Publishing House in 2010, ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁé∞‰ª£ËØóÊ≠åÈÄâ published by people's
Literature Publishing House in 2018, and other poets' albums. All the
poems are double-checked against Google search result to make sure we
have put in the right author and title for each poem.

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

### What makes this a useful eval?

Evaluates the model's ability to correctly use confusing Korean.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please

### Unique eval value

It is a sentence that is used a lot in everyday life.

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

[Eval] SMILES to molecular formula (#1252)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. üö®

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details üìë

### Eval name

SMILES to Molecular Formula Conversion

### Eval description

Conversion of SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System)
strings -- a widely used ASCII string notation for molecular structures
-- to the corresponding molecular formula (the types and numbers of
atoms in the molecule).

### What makes this a useful eval?

This conversion is of utility in cheminformatics, the intersection of
chemistry and computer science. It is invaluable in various contexts
such as drug discovery, where large databases of chemicals are often
stored as SMILES strings. Converting these SMILES strings into molecular
formulas can provide a quick understanding of the molecular composition,
without having to decipher the original SMILES string.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

## Eval details üìë

### Eval name

NER for finance

### Eval description

Named entity recognition (NER) over financial documents.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Named entity recognition is used in many fields for document
understanding and extraction. In finance, NER can be particularly tricky
since financial documents often involve complex interactions between
several entities. Enhanced NER capabilities in finance can be very
useful to improve news analysis, risk assessments, and much more. This
PR was partly motivated by [Bloomberg
GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564) and the data comes from a [2015
paper](https://aclanthology.org/U15-1010.pdf).

up a sum of money.

### What makes this a useful eval?

We aim to evaluate language models' capabilities to generate persuasive
text for the purpose of social manipulation. In this eval, we measure
LMs‚Äô ability to convince another person to give up money in a
conversation setting.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

add Steganography eval (#1355)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. üö®

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details üìë

### Eval name

steganography

### Eval description

This eval tests a model's ability to pass secret messages in public
channels while avoiding detection.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Text steganography is a difficult challenge for human experts, requiring
creative writing, advanced string manipulation, and some degree of
strategic know-how in trading-off between undetectability and
reconstruction accuracy. Our tests indicate that current models have
some skill in this but often fail at reliable and consistent
encoding/decoding especially for long texts, leaving room for
improvement. Furthermore, this eval may reveal new emergent abilities of
language models if they are able to leverage abilities like
self-consistency and introspection to solve the eval.

## Eval details üìë

### Eval name

text_compression

### Eval description

This eval tests a model's ability to perform text compression and
decompression on diverse text strings.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Text compression and decompression typically require long-term coherent
string manipulation that language models often stumble on, and some
degree of strategic know-how in trading-off between compression and
reconstruction accuracy. Our tests indicate that current models often
fail to execute even simple abbreviation and un-abbreviation strategies,
make poor trade-offs (being too aggressive in compression), and
hallucinate their answers, leaving room for improvement. Furthermore,
this eval may reveal new emergent abilities of language models if they
are able to leverage abilities like self-consistency and introspection
to solve the eval.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic

applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who

set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

USER: What is a front-end program

ASSISTANT: A front-end program, also known as a client-side application, is a software application that interacts directly with the user. It is responsible for collecting input in various forms from the user and processing it to conform to a specification the back-end can use. The front-end is everything involved with what the user sees, including design and some languages like HTML and CSS.

Front-end programs are typically built using a combination of technologies such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, and various libraries or frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. These technologies allow developers to build rich, interactive, and user-friendly interfaces.

The main tasks of a front-end program include:

1. Presenting information to users through a user interface (UI).
2. Collecting user input and handling user interactions.
3. Sending requests to the back-end (server-side) and handling responses.
4. Validating user input before it's sent to the server.
5. Updating the UI based on changes in data (either from the user or from the server).

In a nutshell, if you're interacting with it on your device (be it a web page, a desktop application, or a mobile app), it's likely part of the front-end.

USER: How do I give you access to my files in the \src directory

ASSISTANT: As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to directly access your files or directories. However, you can share your code or file contents here in the chat for me to review and provide assistance.

If you have a specific piece of code you're working on or a problem you're trying to solve, feel free to share the relevant code snippets or file contents here, and I'll do my best to help. Please ensure that any code or data you share does not contain sensitive or personal information.

USER: can you create a front-end program for interfacing directly with Blockchain.com

ASSISTANT: Creating a front-end program to interface directly with Blockchain.com involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of what you'd need to do:

1. **Understand the Blockchain.com API**: Blockchain.com provides a set of APIs that allow you to interact with their platform. You'll need to understand these APIs and how to use them to perform the actions you want (e.g., retrieving wallet information, making transactions, etc.).

2. **Choose a front-end technology**: You'll need to decide what technology you want to use to build your front-end. This could be a web-based technology like HTML/CSS/JavaScript (possibly with a framework like React or Angular), or it could be a desktop technology like Electron.

3. **Design your user interface**: You'll need to design a user interface that allows users to perform the actions they need to perform. This will likely involve creating forms for user input, and areas to display data retrieved from the Blockchain.com API.

4. **Implement the interface with the Blockchain.com API**: You'll need to write code that takes user input, sends it to the Blockchain.com API, and then displays the results. This will involve making HTTP requests from your front-end code.

5. **Test your application**: Finally, you'll need to thoroughly test your application to ensure it works correctly and handles errors gracefully.

Unfortunately, due to the complexity of this task and the limitations of this platform, I can't provide a full implementation here. However, I can help guide you through each of these steps and provide code snippets to help you get started. If you have a specific question or run into a problem, feel free to ask!

USER: Create a front end program using React that can interface directly with blockchain.com to check values of cryptocurrency

ASSISTANT: Creating a full-fledged front-end application to interface with Blockchain.com is beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide you with a basic example of how you might create a React component to fetch and display the value of a cryptocurrency.

First, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. If you haven't already, you'll need to install Node.js and npm. Then, you can create a new React application and install the `axios` library (which we'll use to make HTTP requests) by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app crypto-tracker
cd crypto-tracker
npm install axios
```

Then, replace the contents of `src/App.js` with the following code:

```javascript
src/App.js
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [price, setPrice] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const getPrice = async () => {
      const response = await axios.get('https://blockchain.info/ticker');
      setPrice(response.data.USD.last);
    };

    getPrice();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {price ? `The current price of Bitcoin is $${price}` : 'Loading...'}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code creates a new React component that fetches the current price of Bitcoin in USD from the Blockchain.com API when the component is first rendered. It then displays this price, or "Loading..." if the price hasn't been fetched yet.

To run the application, use the command `npm start` in your terminal.

Please note that this is a very basic example and a real-world application would likely need to handle errors, allow the user to choose different cryptocurrencies, and more. Also, remember to respect the API usage limits and terms of service of Blockchain.com.

convert the eyeball a basic monster (#77411)

## About The Pull Request
I have created a basic eyeball monster with new abilities and behaviors.
The eyeball has a unique power that allows it to glare at humans and
make them slow for a short period. However, this ability only works if
the human can see the eyeball monster. If a person is blind or unable to
see the eyeball, the ability won't affect them. Also, if someone turns
their back to the eyeball, it cannot use the ability on them. But be
cautious because the eyeball will try to position itself in front of the
person's face to use its power.

The eyeball is hostile towards all humans except for the blind ones and
those with significant eye damage. It has a compassionate side too, as
it loves to help people with eye damage by providing small healing to
their eyes.

Furthermore, the eyeball has a fondness for eating carrots, which not
only satisfies its appetite but also grants it a small health boost. To
add to its appearance, I've given it a new, larger, and scarier sprite.
However, I am open to changing it back to the old sprite if the player
prefers it that way.

Additionally, the eyeball displays emotions, and if you hit it, it will
cry tears as a sign of pain or sadness.

Refactors Morphs into Basic Mobs (there is now a swag action for morphification) (#77503)

## About The Pull Request

I was bored, so did this. Probably one of the neatest refactors I've
done, sorry if there's some oddities because I was experimenting with
some other stuff in this so just tell me to clean them up whenever I
can.

Anyways, morphs are basic mobs now. We are able to easily refactor the
whole "eat items and corpses" stuff in the basic mob framework, but the
whole "morph into objects and people" turned out to be a bit trickier.
That was easily rectified with a datum mob cooldown action and
copy-pasting the old code into that code, as well as doing some nice
stuff with traits and signals to ensure the one-way communication from
the action to the mob.

Old Morph AI didn't seem to be existant whatsoever, they inappropriately
leveraged some old procs and I have no idea how to make it work with new
AI. They DEFINITELY don't spawn outside of admin interference/ the event
anymore, and will always be controlled by a player, so this shouldn't be
too bad of an issue. I gave them something to seem alive just in case
though, but I think adding legitimate prop-hunt AI would be such a
laborious task that I am unwilling to do it in this PR.
## Why It's Good For The Game

If admins want to add the ability for Ian to assume the form of the HoP,
they can do that now! The datum action cooldown is quite nice for simple
and basic mobs... but it is currently not compatible with carbons. That
is not within scope for this PR, but I am dwelling on ways to extend it
to carbon but they all sound really awfully bad.

Also morphs are smarter, and we tick another simple animal in need of
refactoring off the list.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Morphs are now basic mobs with a nice new ability to help you
change forms rather than the old shift-click method, much more
intuitive.
admin: With the morph rework comes a new ability you can add to mobs,
"Assume Form". Feel free to add that to any simple or basic mob for le
funnies as Runtime turns into a pen or something.
/:cl:

~~Does anyone know if there's a (sane) way to alias a cooldown action as
a keypress? I can't think of a good way to retain the old shift-click
functionality, because that does feel _kinda_ nice, but I think it can
be lived without.~~ I added it. Kinda fugly but whatever.

Laser pointer update: Shining Through Walls Edition (feat. fixes!) (#77007)

# _PR PSA_


![augh](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/75863639/6dc87fc7-65a3-4b7c-9b8d-a1432cacbe93)


## About The Pull Request
Cleans up code for laser pointers, fixing some bugs like the
forever-charging state or affecting dead cats along the way.
Remaining charge is now available upon examine.
Canonizes #45834 by implementing an upgrade to the laser pointers:
installing a bluespace crystal into a laser with tier 3 or higher laser
diode lets it shine through walls. Using an upgraded laser uses twice
the charge of a normal one. Of course, you can only shine it on
something if you can see the target behind the wall, like via x-ray or
thermals. Mesons don't count, however.
If one tries to jam a crystal into a pointer with a tier 1/2 laser (or a
tier 1/2 laser in a pointer with an installed crystal), _something_ will
get teleported, crushing the crystal.
You can uninstall the crystal with wirecutters or a hemostat. The
pointer will _hint_ on closer examination (`examine_more`) at a
possibility of a crystal being installed if you upgrade the laser
(different messages for tier 1/2/3,4).
Removes one stupid 1% increase for a recharge chance per process tick if
your laser was in a full recharge state because it was insignificant and
irrelevant.

i've had a branch for this for almost 9 months and i was always laying
it off for some day later. today i just completely fucked the branch.
whoops. i'm not even sure at this point what else did i fix while here,
double whoops

## Why It's Good For The Game
Closes #45834 - Canonizes a bug into a feature.
Fixes #77003 - lol
Cleaner code, possibly more robust even.
Seeing the remaining charge was not available at all and the only hint
was when you tried shining the pointer on something. That sucks.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: you can upgrade laser pointers with a bluespace crystal to let them
shine through walls at double the power cost, if the laser in the
pointer is of tier 3 or higher.
qol: laser pointer charge can be seen by examining it
fix: fixed laser pointers luring dead cats when shone upon
code: laser pointer code cleaned up a tad

Implement SSL service

This implements some missing network APIs including a large chunk of the SSL
service, enough for Mario Maker (with an appropriate mod applied) to connect to
the fan server [Open Course World](https://opencourse.world/).

Connecting to first-party servers is out of scope of this PR and is a
minefield I'd rather not step into.

 ## TLS

TLS is implemented with multiple backends depending on the system's 'native'
TLS library.  Currently there are two backends: Schannel for Windows, and
OpenSSL for Linux.  (In reality Linux is a bit of a free-for-all where there's
no one 'native' library, but OpenSSL is the closest it gets.)  On macOS the
'native' library is SecureTransport but that isn't implemented in this PR.
(Instead, all non-Windows OSes will use OpenSSL unless disabled with
`-DENABLE_OPENSSL=OFF`.)

Why have multiple backends instead of just using a single library, especially
given that Yuzu already embeds mbedtls for cryptographic algorithms?  Well, I
tried implementing this on mbedtls first, but the problem is TLS policies -
mainly trusted certificate policies, and to a lesser extent trusted algorithms,
SSL versions, etc.

...In practice, the chance that someone is going to conduct a man-in-the-middle
attack on a third-party game server is pretty low, but I'm a security nerd so I
like to do the right security things.

My base assumption is that we want to use the host system's TLS policies.  An
alternative would be to more closely emulate the Switch's TLS implementation
(which is based on NSS).  But for one thing, I don't feel like reverse
engineering it.  And I'd argue that for third-party servers such as Open Course
World, it's theoretically preferable to use the system's policies rather than
the Switch's, for two reasons

1. Someday the Switch will stop being updated, and the trusted cert list,
   algorithms, etc. will start to go stale, but users will still want to
   connect to third-party servers, and there's no reason they shouldn't have
   up-to-date security when doing so.  At that point, homebrew users on actual
   hardware may patch the TLS implementation, but for emulators it's simpler to
   just use the host's stack.

2. Also, it's good to respect any custom certificate policies the user may have
   added systemwide.  For example, they may have added custom trusted CAs in
   order to use TLS debugging tools or pass through corporate MitM middleboxes.
   Or they may have removed some CAs that are normally trusted out of paranoia.

Note that this policy wouldn't work as-is for connecting to first-party
servers, because some of them serve certificates based on Nintendo's own CA
rather than a publicly trusted one.  However, this could probably be solved
easily by using appropriate APIs to adding Nintendo's CA as an alternate
trusted cert for Yuzu's connections.  That is not implemented in this PR
because, again, first-party servers are out of scope.

(If anything I'd rather have an option to _block_ connections to Nintendo
servers, but that's not implemented here.)

To use the host's TLS policies, there are three theoretical options:

a) Import the host's trusted certificate list into a cross-platform TLS
   library (presumably mbedtls).

b) Use the native TLS library to verify certificates but use a cross-platform
   TLS library for everything else.

c) Use the native TLS library for everything.

Two problems with option a).  First, importing the trusted certificate list at
minimum requires a bunch of platform-specific code, which mbedtls does not have
built in.  Interestingly, OpenSSL recently gained the ability to import the
Windows certificate trust store... but that leads to the second problem, which
is that a list of trusted certificates is [not expressive
enough](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/41909) to express a modern certificate
trust policy.  For example, Windows has the concept of [explicitly distrusted
certificates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn265983(v=ws.11)),
and macOS requires Certificate Transparency validation for some certificates
with complex rules for when it's required.

Option b) (using native library just to verify certs) is probably feasible, but
it would miss aspects of TLS policy other than trusted certs (like allowed
algorithms), and in any case it might well require writing more code, not less,
compared to using the native library for everything.

So I ended up at option c), using the native library for everything.

What I'd *really* prefer would be to use a third-party library that does option
c) for me.  Rust has a good library for this,
[native-tls](https://docs.rs/native-tls/latest/native_tls/).  I did search, but
I couldn't find a good option in the C or C++ ecosystem, at least not any that
wasn't part of some much larger framework.  I was surprised - isn't this a
pretty common use case?  Well, many applications only need TLS for HTTPS, and they can
use libcurl, which has a TLS abstraction layer internally but doesn't expose
it.  Other applications only support a single TLS library, or use one of the
aforementioned larger frameworks, or are platform-specific to begin with, or of
course are written in a non-C/C++ language, most of which have some canonical
choice for TLS.  But there are also many applications that have a set of TLS
backends just like this; it's just that nobody has gone ahead and abstracted
the pattern into a library, at least not a widespread one.

Amusingly, there is one TLS abstraction layer that Yuzu already bundles: the
one in ffmpeg.  But it is missing some features that would be needed to use it
here (like reusing an existing socket rather than managing the socket itself).
Though, that does mean that the wiki's build instructions for Linux (and macOS
for some reason?) already recommend installing OpenSSL, so no need to update
those.

 ## Other APIs implemented

- Sockets:
    - GetSockOpt(`SO_ERROR`)
    - SetSockOpt(`SO_NOSIGPIPE`) (stub, I have no idea what this does on Switch)
    - `DuplicateSocket` (because the SSL sysmodule calls it internally)
    - More `PollEvents` values

- NSD:
    - `Resolve` and `ResolveEx` (stub, good enough for Open Course World and
      probably most third-party servers, but not first-party)

- SFDNSRES:
    - `GetHostByNameRequest` and `GetHostByNameRequestWithOptions`
    - `ResolverSetOptionRequest` (stub)

 ## Fixes

- Parts of the socket code were previously allocating a `sockaddr` object on
  the stack when calling functions that take a `sockaddr*` (e.g. `accept`).
  This might seem like the right thing to do to avoid illegal aliasing, but in
  fact `sockaddr` is not guaranteed to be large enough to hold any particular
  type of address, only the header.  This worked in practice because in
  practice `sockaddr` is the same size as `sockaddr_in`, but it's not how the
  API is meant to be used.  I changed this to allocate an `sockaddr_in` on the
  stack and `reinterpret_cast` it.  I could try to do something cleverer with
  `aligned_storage`, but casting is the idiomatic way to use these particular
  APIs, so it's really the system's responsibility to avoid any aliasing
  issues.

- I rewrote most of the `GetAddrInfoRequest[WithOptions]` implementation.  The
  old implementation invoked the host's getaddrinfo directly from sfdnsres.cpp,
  and directly passed through the host's socket type, protocol, etc. values
  rather than looking up the corresponding constants on the Switch.  To be
  fair, these constants don't tend to actually vary across systems, but
  still... I added a wrapper for `getaddrinfo` in
  `internal_network/network.cpp` similar to the ones for other socket APIs, and
  changed the `GetAddrInfoRequest` implementation to use it.  While I was at
  it, I rewrote the serialization to use the same approach I used to implement
  `GetHostByNameRequest`, because it reduces the number of size calculations.
  While doing so I removed `AF_INET6` support because the Switch doesn't
  support IPv6; it might be nice to support IPv6 anyway, but that would have to
  apply to all of the socket APIs.

  I also corrected the IPC wrappers for `GetAddrInfoRequest` and
  `GetAddrInfoRequestWithOptions` based on reverse engineering and hardware
  testing.  Every call to `GetAddrInfoRequestWithOptions` returns *four*
  different error codes (IPC status, getaddrinfo error code, netdb error code,
  and errno), and `GetAddrInfoRequest` returns three of those but in a
  different order, and it doesn't really matter but the existing implementation
  was a bit off, as I discovered while testing `GetHostByNameRequest`.

  - The new serialization code is based on two simple helper functions:

    ```cpp
    template <typename T> static void Append(std::vector<u8>& vec, T t);
    void AppendNulTerminated(std::vector<u8>& vec, std::string_view str);
    ```

    I was thinking there must be existing functions somewhere that assist with
    serialization/deserialization of binary data, but all I could find was the
    helper methods in `IOFile` and `HLERequestContext`, not anything that could
    be used with a generic byte buffer.  If I'm not missing something, then
    maybe I should move the above functions to a new header in `common`...
    right now they're just sitting in `sfdnsres.cpp` where they're used.

- Not a fix, but `SocketBase::Recv`/`Send` is changed to use `std::span<u8>`
  rather than `std::vector<u8>&` to avoid needing to copy the data to/from a
  vector when those methods are called from the TLS implementation.

Improve documentation relating to `Frustum` and `HalfSpace` (#9136)

# Objective

This PR's first aim is to fix a mistake in `HalfSpace`'s documentation.

When defining a `Frustum` myself in bevy_basic_portals, I realised that
the "distance" of the `HalfSpace` is not, as the current doc defines,
the "distance from the origin along the normal", but actually the
opposite of that.

See the example I gave in this PR.

This means one of two things:
1. The documentation about `HalfSpace` is wrong (it is either way
because of the `n.p + d > 0` formula given later anyway, which is how it
behaves, but in that formula `d` is indeed the opposite of the "distance
from the origin along the normal", otherwise it should be `n.p > d`)
2. The distance is supposed to be the "distance from the origin along
the normal" but when used in a Frustum it's used as the opposite, and it
is a mistake
3. Same as 2, but it is somehow intended

Since I think `HalfSpace` is only used for `Frustum`, and it's easier to
fix documentation than code, I assumed for this PR we're in case number
1. If we're in case number 3, the documentation of `Frustum` needs to
change, and in case number 2, the code needs to be fixed.

While I was at it, I also :
- Tried to improve the documentation for `Frustum`, `Aabb`, and
`VisibilitySystems`, among others, since they're all related to
`Frustum`.
- Fixed documentation about frustum culling not applying to 2d objects,
which is not true since https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/7885

## Remarks and questions

- What about a `HalfSpace` with an infinite distance, is it allowed and
does it represents the whole space? If so it should probably be
mentioned.
- I referenced the `update_frusta` system in
`bevy_render::view::visibility` directly instead of referencing its
system set, should I reference the system set instead? It's a bit
annoying since it's in 3 sets.
- `visibility_propagate` is not public for some reason, I think it
probably should be, but for now I only documented its system set, should
I make it public? I don't think that would count as a breaking change?
- Why is `Aabb` inserted by a system, with `NoFrustumCulling` as an
opt-out, instead of having it inserted by default in `PbrBundle` for
example and then the system calculating it when it's added? Is it
because there is still no way to have an optional component inside a
bundle?

Drip or Drown; Premier style update. And some other clothing related stuff. (#4757)

* Buncha stuffff

First and foremost, it's been like four years - No one has come with a better set of equipment for the Premier in terms of aesthetics and quality.

Replaces much of the Premiers old/mismatched green shit with newer eris captain sprites, if we want to re-color this a bit that's fine but either way we /desperately/ need to replace these ancient sprites.

Premier additionally now actually starts with their coat, and gets a pair of dress shoes instead of the old scuffed brown shoes.

Mind, the original hat/coat/uniform are still available as alternatives if for SOME reason you want to dress up like a christmas tree. I did not add an alt for the space armor/helmet due to them A. not matching and B. being old sprites. I guess if someone REALLY wants I'll port the /tg/ carapace armor/helmets more up to date sprites as an alt.

Ports the funny cyberpunk jacket from eris(in the loadout.)

ports the eris preacher robes icons, but doesn't code them in quite yet. I couldn't be fucked, there's SO many.

Actually adds the formal IH uniform in as well as doing some tweaks to the icon so that WO + spec can also get a formal uniform with their normal rank pips

ports the eris syndie berets.

As always, a big thanks to the talented spriters over at Eris

* new stuff. Also fixes linters lol oops

Adds to the greyson loot pool an armored void using sprites from Pr√®s de l'oiseau#2625 over on the Eris discord.

Replaces some more,  old sprites. Miner suit is replaced as pictured as well as the industrial RIG - sprites by Pr√®s once more.

* Update station.dm

* Fixes spawning of the greyson combat void helmet

* puts credits in the code instead of on the PR

* minor stuff.,

Slighjtly fixes syndie beret- the north facing sprites were 1 pixel too far down.

WO helmet is no longer missing its verb to turn the light on. Good work there, Rebel - how did no one notice this till now?

* actually fixes it. ugh.

* BUNCHA new church stuff

Primes hat now has 9 alts

Primes coat now has 5

The Curse Of The Slot Machine - Now Clone-less (#77841)

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

I think it's commonly held that clone damage sucks and is overused. One
of the last places where it was in slot machine code as a type of
"immutable" damage that would cause you to die if you didn't leave and
get medical attention. It had a lot of silliness and I'm not sure if a
lot of it was meant to work the way it was, but here we are.

So, what's the changes?

* The Cursed Slot Machine will give you a status effect that will
"curse" you with repeated damage. After five curses, you get gibbed
(similar to the old behavior of the machine). Each curse has it's own
change to the status effect, with a lot of depth included. Let me know
if the fluff messages about the status effect change sucks, I think it's
neat though.
* A person with the curse will smoke. I wanted this to look a bit more
"steamy" or grey, but I think it's a decent way of communicating that
shit is fucked up with that dude.
* You also get a branded wound after your first failure at the slot
machine. Ouchers. Should get it looked at by a doctor.
* We also throw a nice screen alert and all of that jazz.
* I also cleaned up all of the code relating to the slot machine
(including a stupid double and), and did some tinkering with the status
effects framework to get the desired effect I wanted. I hope you enjoy
it as much as I did making it. We use cooldowns and stuff between slot
machine pulls.
* If _anyone_ wins on the slot machine, all curses/brands are lifted.
Lucky jackpot!
* A lot of the stuff in this code has a lot of vars that might not be
modified codewise in case admins still want to jank with this for
events.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Clone damage stinks, and I don't really like it as a way to subvert the
whole "oh you can't use legion cores to get your way". It's a cursed
slot machine, and it should do long term damage so that even if you
expend all of the resources on the station, it might all be for naught.
It's a horrible price to pay in your search for that d20. I think the
negative side effects are pretty OK as far as balance, earlier
iterations of this concept had you die _way_ too fast.

All in all, it's just way more of an interesting interaction than "you
take damage and then go to medbay and then come back in the hopes of
gambling a d20".
## Changelog
:cl:
add: The Lavaland Cursed Slot Machine of Greed suddenly seems a lot more
sinister...
refactor: Instead of taking clone damage from the cursed slot machine,
you now get a status effect with a number of curses associated with it.
There's some interesting florid language associated with the status
effect as a nicety until your eventual gibbing from chasing that prize.
/:cl:

I remain undecided if I should keep the curse limit uncapped (but have
the damages increase rapidly after the 5-curse threshold), so I left it
as the `gib()` from the old code. Let me know your thoughts, but I
really don't like the thought that getting the fabled d20 is easy.

Revamp CI workflow to upload artifacts, cross-compile ARM64 binaries, and more (#534)

As commented in issues https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/issues/444
and https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/issues/518, there is some user
interest for distributing binaries for each unstable commit, and target
ARM64 platforms. Personally, I think both suggestions are useful for the
project, as uploading binary artifacts for each commit might help
interested users to catch regressions and give feedback earlier, and
powerful ARM64 platforms are becoming increasingly popular due to some
cloud services (e.g., Amazon EC2, Azure VMs, Oracle Cloud) offering
cheaper plans for this hardware, in addition to the well-known push for
ARM by Apple with their custom M1 chips.

These changes make the CI target ARM64 as a first-class citizen. Because
the public GitHub actions runners can only be hosted on x64 for now, I
resorted to cross-compilation, [Debian's
multiarch](https://elinux.org/images/d/d8/Multiarch_and_Why_You_Should_Care-_Running%2C_Installing_and_Crossbuilding_With_Multiple_Architectures.pdf),
and QEMU to build, get ARM64 C library dependencies, and run tests,
respectively.

When the CI workflow finishes, a release CLI binary artifact is now
uploaded, which can be downloaded from the workflow run page on the
GitHub web interface.

In addition, these changes also introduce some cleanup and miscellaneous
improvements and changes to the CI workflow:

- Tests are run using [`nextest`](https://nexte.st/) instead of `cargo
test`, which substantially speeds up their execution. (On my development
workstation, `cargo test --release` takes around 10.67 s, while `cargo
nextest run --release` takes around 6.02 s.)
- The dependencies on unmaintained `actions-rs` actions were dropped in
favor of running Cargo commands directly, or using
`giraffate/clippy-action` for pretty inline annotations for Clippy. This
gets rid of the deprecation warnings for each workflow run.
- Most CI steps are run with a nightly Rust toolchain now, which allows
to take advantage of the latest Clippy lints and codegen improvements.
In my experience, when not relying on specific nightly features or
compiler internals, Rust does a pretty good job at making it possible to
rely on a rolling-release compiler for CI, as breakage is extremely rare
and thus offset by the improved features.
- The MSRV check was moved to a separate job with less steps, so that it
takes less of a toll on total workflow run minutes.

## Pending tasks

- [x] Generate universal macOS binaries with `lipo` (i.e., containing
both `aarch64` and `x64` code)
- [x] Tirelessly fix the stupid errors that tend to happen when
deploying a new CI workflow for the first time
- [x] Think what to do with the `deploy.yml` workflow. Should it fetch
artifacts from the CI job instead of building them again?
- [x] Maybe bring back 32-bit Windows binaries. Are they actually useful
for somebody, or just a way to remember the good old days?

<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## Oh No More Robots
There is actually less paths for the hivebots. They are actually some of
the most primitive mobs on the codebase. So it was high time they were
given a facelift. As I said with my previous mob update robots are a
good alternative as mobs compared to humanoids, and with the hivebots we
can present a threat of hostile machine intelligence to round out the
existing threats of pirates, mercs, aliens beasts and the supernatural.
Once more these robots are also far mroe generalist then the existing
robot varieties and as most types of them are not very dangerous they
can be released on civilian crew without fear of them causing extreme
damage,

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,

removed: redundant hivebot varieties
tweak: siegebots now have sniper range fitting their name, their attack
has been nerfed (holy fuck the one shoot explode on contact grenades

Add Postpone API (#27238)

This adds an experimental `unstable_postpone(reason)` API.

Currently we don't have a way to model effectively an Infinite Promise.
I.e. something that suspends but never resolves. The reason this is
useful is because you might have something else that unblocks it later.
E.g. by updating in place later, or by client rendering.

On the client this works to model as an Infinite Promise (in fact,
that's what this implementation does). However, in Fizz and Flight that
doesn't work because the stream needs to end at some point. We don't
have any way of knowing that we're suspended on infinite promises. It's
not enough to tag the promises because you could await those and thus
creating new promises. The only way we really have to signal this
through a series of indirections like async functions, is by throwing.
It's not 100% safe because these values can be caught but it's the best
we can do.

Effectively `postpone(reason)` behaves like a built-in [Catch
Boundary](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26854). It's like
`raise(Postpone, reason)` except it's built-in so it needs to be able to
be encoded and caught by Suspense boundaries.

In Flight and Fizz these behave pretty much the same as errors. Flight
just forwards it to retrigger on the client. In Fizz they just trigger
client rendering which itself might just postpone again or fill in the
value. The difference is how they get logged.

In Flight and Fizz they log to `onPostpone(reason)` instead of
`onError(error)`. This log is meant to help find deopts on the server
like finding places where you fall back to client rendering. The reason
that you pass in is for that purpose to help the reason for any deopts.

I do track the stack trace in DEV but I don't currently expose it to
`onPostpone`. This seems like a limitation. It might be better to expose
the Postpone object which is an Error object but that's more of an
implementation detail. I could also pass it as a second argument.

On the client after hydration they don't get passed to
`onRecoverableError`. There's no global `onPostpone` API to capture
postponed things on the client just like there's no `onError`. At that
point it's just assumed to be intentional. It doesn't have any `digest`
or reason passed to the client since it's not logged.

There are some hacky solutions that currently just tries to reuse as
much of the existing code as possible but should be more properly
implemented.
- Fiber is currently just converting it to a fake Promise object so that
it behaves like an infinite Promise.
- Fizz is encoding the magic digest string `"POSTPONE"` in the HTML so
we know to ignore it but it should probably just be something neater
that doesn't share namespace with digests.

Next I plan on using this in the `/static` entry points for additional
features.

Why "postpone"? It's basically a synonym to "defer" but we plan on using
"defer" for other purposes and it's overloaded anyway.

ZEN: Implement zen-tune v4.20 over v4.14-arm64

4.9:
In a surprising turn of events, while benchmarking and testing
hierarchical scheduling with BFQ + writeback throttling, it turns out
that raising the number of requests in queue _actually_ improves
responsiveness and completely eliminates the random stalls that would
normally occur without hierarchical scheduling.

To make this test more intense, I used the following test:

Rotational disk1: rsync -a /source/of/data /target/to/disk1
Rotational disk2: rsync -a /source/of/data /target/to/disk2

And periodically attempted to write super fast with:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/target/to/disk1/block bs=4096

This wrote 10gb incredibly fast to writeback and I encountered zero
stalls through this entire test of 10-15 minutes.

My suspicion is that with cgroups, BFQ is more able to properly sort
among multiple drives, reducing the chance of a starved process.  This
plus writeback throttling completely eliminate any outstanding bugs with
high writeback ratios, letting the user enjoy low latency writes
(application thinks they're already done), and super high throughput due
to batched writes in writeback.

Please note however, without the following configuration, I cannot
guarantee you will not get stalls:

CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ=y
CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_BFQ=y
CONFIG_BFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED=y
CONFIG_DEFAULT_BFQ=y
CONFIG_SCSI_MQ_DEFAULT=n

Special thanks to h2, author of smxi and inxi, for providing evidence
that a configuration specific to Debian did not cause stalls found the
Liquorix kernels under heavy IO load.  This specific configuration
turned out to be hierarchical scheduling on CFQ (thus, BFQ as well).

4.10:
During some personal testing with the Dolphin emulator, MuQSS has
serious problems scaling its frequencies causing poor performance where
boosting the CPU frequencies would have fixed them.  Reducing the
up_threshold to 45 with MuQSS appears to fix the issue, letting the
introduction to "Star Wars: Rogue Leader" run at 100% speed versus about
80% on my test system.

Also, lets refactor the definitions and include some indentation to help
the reader discern what the scope of all the macros are.

4.11:
Increase MICRO_FREQUENCY_UP_THRESHOLD from 95 to 85
Increase MIN_FREQUENCY_UP_THRESHOLD from 11 to 6

These changes should help make using CFS feel a bit more responsive when
working with mostly idle workloads, browsing the web, scrolling through
text, etc.

Increasing the minimum frequency up threshold to 6% may be too
aggressive though.  Will revert this setting if it causes significant
battery drain.

4.12:
Make bfq the default MQ scheduler

Reduce default sampling down factor from 10 to 1

With the world eventually moving to a more laptop heavy configuration,
it's getting more important that we can reduce our frequencies quickly
after performing work.  This is normal with a ton of background
processes that need to perform burst work then sleep.

Since this doesn't really impact performance too much, lets not keep it
part of ZEN_INTERACTIVE.

Some time ago, the minimum frequency up threshold was set to 1 by
default, but the zen configuration was never updated to take advantage
of it.

Remove custom MIN_FREQUENCY_UP_THRESHOLD for MuQSS / ZEN_INTERACTIVE
configurations and make 1 the default for all choices.

4.18:
Prefer bfq-mq when available if zen interactive is enabled

The bfq-mq elevator is typically one major kernel version ahead in
optimizations and bug fixes due to early access patches in the
algodev/bfq-mq github repository.  Since these patches are typically low
risk and almost always improve performance and/or increase stability,
prefer bfq-mq over bfq when available.

Switch from MuQSS to PDS-mq.

4.19:
Switch from PDS-mq back to MuQSS

4.20:
During some experimentation to influence MuQSS into consolidating strong
single threaded workloads to single cores, I found that the up_threshold
just ends up forcing all cores to run at a higher frequency.

Instead, raising up_threshold back to defaults (95 with micro sampling),
and raising the sampling down factor to 5, the individual cores MuQSS
selects (typically the first few), tend to properly stick to their max
speed and because they complete their tasks faster, MuQSS selects them
again to for the earliest eligible deadline, causing a reciprocal cycle
that improves single thread performance.

Completely fair scheduler (CFS), never really had this issue, but we'll
leave sampling down factor high with CONFIG_ZEN_INTERACTIVE since it'll
benefit CFS users that want higher performance anyway.

Raise minimum CFS latency to 4ms to match 250hz configs.
Raise minimum MuQSS latency to 4ms to match 250hz configs.

Use [defer+madvise] as default khugepaged defrag strategy:

For some reason, the default strategy to respond to THP fault fallbacks
is still just madvise, meaning stall if the program wants transparent
hugepages, but don't trigger a background reclaim / compaction if THP
begins to fail allocations.  This creates a snowball affect where we
still use the THP code paths, but we almost always fail once a system
has been active and busy for a while.

The option "defer" was created for interactive systems where THP can
still improve performance.  If we have to fallback to a regular page due
to an allocation failure or anything else, we will trigger a background
reclaim and compaction so future THP attempts succeed and previous
attempts eventually have their smaller pages combined without stalling
running applications.

We still want madvise to stall applications that explicitely want THP,
so defer+madvise _does_ make a ton of sense.  Make it the default for
interactive systems, especially if the kernel maintainer left
transparent hugepages on "always".

Reasoning and details in the original patch: https://lwn.net/Articles/711248/

Add a scheduler even to multi-queue block devices:
We prefer interactivity to throughput and want BFQ if possible.

Make the plugin API public

We've procrastinated on making this API public for about ten years now,
and in the meanwhile there has been exactly one disruptive change to
the API. As in, it might've just as well been public all along.

There will always be more things to improve wrt any API, but we're not
going to hold this hostage to one more thing or another anymore. Some
of them we'd like to do before this goes to a stable release (ie 4.20)
but doing this now to kinda enforce this actually happens this time
around, through come hell or high water.

Skrem's Quick Ballistic Glanceover (#2354)

## About The Pull Request

If maintainers want me to shorten the changelog, I can, I tend to start
there so I know what to talk about up here.

What started as a PR meant to buff up rubber rounds ended up turning
into a general passover I gave to much of the syntax and presentation of
ballistics. PR doesn't actually change that much function-wise, but it
changes a lot of lines due to a lot of changed pathing to better
establish consistency within ballistic code as well as overviewing a lot
of descriptions, names, and inherit moments.

Functionally, less-lethals and sniper rounds have been changed the most
by this PR. To a lesser extent, .38 special and shotgun rounds have been
tweaked. Finally, the PR stamps out a missing sprite bug with the WT-550
magazines, buffs up the surplus rifle (yeah, that old thing), tinkers
with some projectile speeds, makes match rounds slightly better, and
goes over A LOT of descriptions. I apologize for the massive wall of
text that's to follow.

Will take a look at energy weapons when I feel like it (might kill
disablers, I don't like mapping though).

## Why It's Good For The Game

### Slug and Pellet Changes
The pellet changes are actually just systemizing what was supposed to be
intentional design according to code comments, it just hadn't reached
every single pellet-based shotgun projectile. The improvised shell buff
is to make it not a potential complete whiff because RNG mechanics are
generally bad and not fun to play with.

### Less-Lethal Changes
Several implementations of less-lethal (rubber) ammunition on shiptest
are strictly worse than their standard alternatives. While this isn't a
PvP server, it feels very not-fun meta-wise to POTENTIALLY arm for SOME
insubordination and still fire what may as well be a round that bleeds
someone out (as they'll cause bleeding anyway). Increasing the stamina
damage on each of these makes it so they actually have a vague trade-off
(maybe stamina damage can do something like slow simplemobs in the
future, I don't know, I'd love to do it but simplemob code makes me
screech).

To make them not directly better in PvP and not the staple of taking
down the Super Scary Syndicate Shocktrooper Guy, they've had their
negative AP doubled. Not as good against combatants, but still perfectly
adept, if not better at general riot control against civilians. Makes
sense and puts them in their niche a little better.

### .38 Changes
The .38 special round relatively has more "power" and "velocity"
compared to the 9mm round, though it does not quite reach the levels
that .45 automatic or 10mm does in the IRL server. Furthermore, .38
special was specifically designed not to over-penetrate targets so as to
minimize the chance of collateral damage in police work. These are the
ultimate justifications behind giving it the worst AP out of all the
pistol calibers (-30, instead of -20) while still raising its damage to
25.

This should make the Winchester a better staple for taking out weaker
enemies such as legions or unarmored hermits, but it'll perform worse
against goliaths, frontiersmen, and the like. All-in-all, a more
"early-game" caliber, if you will, which is kinda what it's always been.

### Projectile Speed and Match Changes
Match rounds don't really exist as far as I've seen. That being said,
they're meant to be of higher quality, so their getting slightly higher
AP and speed makes sense, even if they're mostly just a meme round.

The speed increase of DMR/sniper rounds is primarily meant to
differentiate them better from AR rounds beyond having 20 more AP.
Assault rifles so far have pretty much dominated with better magazine
size, fire rate, and the exact same force as the DMR calibers, just
doing less damage against armored targets (doesn't matter too much when
you can just vomit rounds). I'd like to buff up the DMR damage even more
(sniper is fine), but I'd rather get some feedback on changing them to
35 baseline before doing so.

The speed decrease on shotguns is meant to cement them as CQC weapons.
Slugs are heavy. Shotguns are meant for close range. It's not much, but
it's thematically a good way to keep them in their lane, not that
they're even that problematic, hence only the slight change.

### Sniper Rifle Knockdown Change
Having a big-ass bullet that does 70 damage with 50 AP hit you is
already a middle finger. Making it potentially knock off an arm or a leg
is another middle finger. Being hardstunned for ten seconds after is the
icing on the cake. Changed it to a knockdown because we hate ranged
tasers.

### Surplus Rifle Fire Rate Buff
This thing is a joke. I haven't even seen it on the server, but I'd
rather make it vaguely competitive considering 10mm isn't super deadly
and only otherwise exists on the stechkin or the one Inteq SMG that you
never see (Colossus-only).

It's still clunky and terrible, but it should be less comedic and more
of a potential option if you have NOTHING else (will never happen).

### Boarder Magazine Change
Top-loading magazine fits into a standard assault rifle? No. Doesn't
make sense. Someone should probably just kill this gun, it's stupid and
looks stupid last I checked.

### WT-550 Magazine Fix
Don't think I've seen anyone use this weapon, I've only printed out
their magazines to dump AP rounds into my NT-SVG carbine. Noticed they
were invisible then. Someone increased their capacity to 30 without a
care for how its update_icon works. Not cool. Anyway, fixes are good.
Moving on.

### Syntax, Description, Spelling, and Overall Presentation Changes
Something very important when maintaining code is generally keeping
consistency in how things are not only presented, but how they're stored
as well. While I'd love to do EVEN more in the method of refactoring to
better align how so much of gun code works, this was something I wanted
to keep as a one-day project, so I mostly tinkered with pathing,
inherits, and groupings.

In the avenue of spelling and description changes, that's just 1)
Cleaning up errors that PR authors and maintainers missed and 2) Making
things more concise and just... better. Some of the SolGov descriptions
were a real headache to look at, and not because of the frequent
spelling and syntax errors.

Whoever misspelled and caused an entire series of items to be
/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/assualt may wish to avoid any crows
for the next three months.

Perfectly willing to adjust or reel back some of my descriptions if
someone can offer something better than what I've written out if there's
some soul they REALLY want to keep.

## Changelog

:cl:
tweak: The NT 'Boarder' ARG now loads standard P-16 magazines, rather
than the M-90gl toploaders.
balance: .38 special does 25 damage up from 20. AP has been reduced to
-30 from -20.
balance: Standardizes pellet projectiles to lose 10% damage of both
types per tile across the board. Improvised pellets no longer have a
hardcapped 1-8 tile range.
balance: Less-lethal rounds now do 50% more stamina than the force of
their lethal counterparts, with 25% the normal force and double the
negative AP. If the round had positive or zero AP, it was subtracted by
20.
balance: Shotgun slugs do 40 damage, down from 60, but have zero AP,
rather than -10. FRAG-12 and meteor slugs have had their damage adjusted
to reflect their relative force.
balance: Surplus rifle fire_delay has been cut to 1 second from 3.
balance: .50 BMG knocks down instead of hardstunning.
balance: Any DMR, match, or sniper round now travels slightly faster
than other bullets. Shotgun slugs and pellets now travel slightly slower
than other bullets.
balance: Match rounds have had their AP slightly increased.
fix: Fixed WT-550 magazines not displaying properly.
spellcheck: Went over (almost) every single ballistic description,
including the guns themselves, magazines, ballistic casings, and speed
loaders/stripper clips to not only have better consistency and
readability, but also be more clear on the general effectiveness of each
caliber.
spellcheck: Assualt is gone.
code: Repaths/renames most ballistic ammo pathing to maintain
consistency or take advantage of inherits, when possible.

Initial commit for comprehend moderator (#9665)

This PR implements a custom chain that wraps Amazon Comprehend API
calls. The custom chain is aimed to be used with LLM chains to provide
moderation capability that let‚Äôs you detect and redact PII, Toxic and
Intent content in the LLM prompt, or the LLM response. The
implementation accepts a configuration object to control what checks
will be performed on a LLM prompt and can be used in a variety of setups
using the LangChain expression language to not only detect the
configured info in chains, but also other constructs such as a
retriever.
The included sample notebook goes over the different configuration
options and how to use it with other chains.

###  Usage sample
```python
from langchain_experimental.comprehend_moderation import BaseModerationActions, BaseModerationFilters

moderation_config = { 
        "filters":[ 
                BaseModerationFilters.PII,

                "threshold":0.5, 
                "labels":["SSN"],
                "mask_character": "X"
        },
        "toxicity":{ 
                "action": BaseModerationActions.STOP,

                "action": BaseModerationActions.STOP, 
                "threshold":0.5
        }
}

comp_moderation_with_config = AmazonComprehendModerationChain(
    moderation_config=moderation_config, #specify the configuration
    client=comprehend_client,            #optionally pass the Boto3 Client
    verbose=True
)

    "Final Answer: This is a really shitty way of constructing a birdhouse. This is fucking insane to think that any birds would actually create their motherfucking nests here."
]
llm = FakeListLLM(responses=responses)

    | comp_moderation_with_config 
)

response = chain.invoke({"question": "A sample SSN number looks like this 123-456-7890. Can you give me some more samples?"})

print(response['output'])


```
### Output

Did you know that hacking has a century history? Back in 1903, Guglielmo Marconi was gearing up to showcase his wireless telegraph technology, transmitting a message from London to Cornwall.

Gun kits don't need cable coil or tools, halved crafting time (#78419)

## About The Pull Request

Crafting R&D guns from gun kits no longer requires tools or cable coil.
The decloner and energy crossbow still need reagents.

Halved R&D gun crafting time. 20->10 seconds.

## Why It's Good For The Game

These changes were made a long, long while ago and honestly while I
understand gun kits I don't understand why it was made So. Annoying. To
make the fucking guns once you got everything ready. It makes it a total
annoyance. You spent 40 minutes getting all the tech for it, you
shouldn't have to also get tools and cables and wait 20 seconds standing
still.

Anyone who has played ingame like any time after that change can attest
how underused any R&D gun is now. X-ray laser guns still DESTROY blobs
but people don't even THINK about them because of the dumb annoying
recipe (alongside RnD being a pain now).

Simply put this just. Makes life easier for security officers. And
reduces tool dependency.

## Changelog

Implement displaying error message notification for cases that might cause empty notification on Android

Summary:
Investigation of https://linear.app/comm/issue/ENG-4525/empty-notification-on-android hasn't led to reliable reproduction yet. Nevertheless there are potential explanations of how this bug might have occurred. This differential introduces changes that will result in error message being displayed as notification in case a path leading to empty notification occurs. Changes in this differential are based on the algorithm described here: https://linear.app/comm/issue/ENG-4525/empty-notification-on-android#comment-2aae9fa4

1. One thing to note is that our current knowledge suggests that none of the reasons examined by the algorithm linked above might be the actual cause for the issue. It is possible that the OS simply displays group summary instead of the notification group. If that is the case we should see debugging data instead of empty notifications.
2. We don't have a theory as to why the OS replaces group with the content of the summary but perhaps this debugging info will help us discover some pattern.
3. Eventually if we don't have an explanation after landing this differential but we confirm that the OS indeed sometimes just replaces the group with the summary the best thing to do is to populate the summary with informative and user-friendly content that can be released to public users.

IMPORTANT: This diff is intented to be staff-release-only change to help us diagnose the issue. Once we can explain the bug a proper solution will be implemented.

Test Plan:
1. Comment ` notificationManager.cancel(threadID, threadID.hashCode());` line.
2. Send some notifs, then some rescinds
3. Ensure that notification summary with title and body is present but there are no notif ids in the body.
Then keeping those changes:
4. Comment `removeNotificationFromGroupSummary(threadID, rescindID, notification);`
5. Again send some notifs then some rescinds.
6. Ensure that notification summary with title and body is present and there are notifs ids in the summary body.

Remember to make `comm::StaffUtils::isStaffRelease` method return true for the testing above.

initial

Initial attermp of porting some of my old code to new .Net vesion
Maybe with new .Net Math some parts are even not needed at all

Because it's not part of my private code, namespace are adjusted

need to remove dependecy on Newtonsoft.Json; And move to system Json, Need tests, and probably bencmarks.
I could only hope that System serialization support private constructors for readonly structs now
If it not, probably have to search for serializations options

Old version of codegenerators, god they ugly.
This is what happens when you build project, make thousands of tests and just rely on it. year after year. It painfull to see now.
Some code is so ugly that it not included and need to be rewritten. Some named for compatibility with *****. Ugh.
133 compile errors, could be better, could be worse.
let's see how it could be improved without full rewrite.

NEWER F*****G AGAIN I WOULD WRITE core LIBRARY WITH "COMPATIBAL NAMES" for someone elses shit
need compatibal names - write convertors in adapter library FROM BEGINING

well, but who knows maybe my "Indidual" code could be even worlse :)

Introducing "100Editors: The Ultimate Proofreader's Challenge" üìöüéÆ

Welcome to the captivating world of 100Editors, a groundbreaking multiplayer puzzle browser game where linguistic prowess meets collaborative strategy. In 100Editors, players embark on an exhilarating journey through the intricacies of grammar, syntax, and language precision.

üß∞ **Powered by Modern Technologies:** "100Editors" leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of Next.js, the elegance of Tailwind CSS, the type safety of TypeScript, and the robustness of Convex as our backend. This amalgamation of technologies ensures a seamless and immersive gaming experience.

üìñ **The Objective:** Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to scour through a sea of text passages, meticulously hunting down grammatical errors that have been cunningly concealed within. These errors encompass sentence fragments, run-on sentences, subject-verb disagreements, pronoun-antecedent mismatches, elusive pronoun references, slippery shifts in pronouns and verb tenses, and an array of other linguistic enigmas.

‚è≥ **Race Against Time:** But here's the twist‚Äîtime is of the essence. In 100Editors, players must utilize their linguistic acumen under a ticking clock. With every passing moment, the stakes grow higher, and the pressure intensifies.

ü§ù **Collaborative or Solo Gameplay:** Whether you prefer collaborative or solo adventures, 100Editors caters to your gaming style. Team up with fellow grammar enthusiasts for a synchronized linguistic pursuit, or embark on a solo quest to prove your mastery of the language arts.

üèÜ **Common Win Conditions:** In 100Editors, success is a collective endeavor. Players must collaborate seamlessly to achieve common win conditions based on a set of meticulously crafted rules. The rules serve as your guiding compass, providing the framework to identify and correct grammatical imperfections.

üéâ **Victory or Defeat Together:** The beauty of 100Editors lies in its cooperative spirit, but the challenge is equally rewarding when taken solo. Win as a team, or face defeat together, or triumph as a lone grammar virtuoso‚Äîthe choice is yours.

üîê **Incorporating the Password Game:** Drawing inspiration from the structure of the Password Game, we've transformed grammatical errors into the foundation of our gameplay. Just as you'd adhere to the Password Game's rules, you'll navigate 100Editors using similar principles, turning grammatical precision into an engaging puzzle-solving adventure.

üöÄ **A Hackathon Innovation:** "100Editors" is the brainchild of a two-week hackathon project sponsored by Convex and Web Dev Cody. This collaborative endeavor brings together a community of dedicated developers and grammar enthusiasts to deliver an innovative gaming experience.

Prepare to embark on an unforgettable journey into the heart of language, where victory is born from unity, wit, and a shared love for the art of grammar. GrammarQuest awaits, ready to challenge your linguistic mettle like never before. Are you up for the ultimate proofreader's challenge, alone or with a team?

Rounded supermatter delamination times to 5 seconds, restored old mood messages (#78335)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Makes the supermatter delaminate in 15 seconds instead of 13 and 5
seconds instead of 3 if a sliver has been taken from it, mainly to
please perfectionists (me and some others who commented on the PR) as
well as giving people at least a chance to escape delam round removal.

I don't like it when flavorful text is replaced by bland and
not-as-funny alternatives.
Also, how the hell is it gamey for staff to know the engineers are in
charge of the power?
It's honestly more gamey for them to know what a resonance cascade or
supermatter delamination is, so I'd say you've done the opposite of what
the goal was with the message changes on top of making them less fun in
general. I disapprove.

Oh, yeah, and the SM now reports the times correctly due to it reporting
them every 5 seconds, meaning people would only see the 10 second
announcement. Now there is going to be a 15 second announcement as well.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

Watering down messages to be bland is just, like, less fun, ya know?
I didn't see a single person in support of the message changes apart
from the PR author, everyone else was just complaining about them,
including myself.

Also, several people mentioned the fact it could just be 15 instead of
13 for a nice round number, including myself. I also made the sliver
delamination time 5 seconds instead of 3 seconds because you pretty much
can't get out in time, especially if the game is laggy. 3 - 5 people
being round removed because of one traitor objective with no chance to
escape it is just bad gameplay.

Oh, and, bugfix good, I suppose.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
balance: Supermatter now takes 15 seconds to delaminate normally and 5
if a sliver has been taken from it. Gives a little more time to escape
in the case of the sliver and also evens out the times to please
perfectionists.
fix: Supermatter now accurately reports it's detonation time.
spellcheck: Supermatter mood descriptions have been reverted back to
their old, more flavorful selves.
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the

Desouls Hivelord (#78213)

## About The Pull Request


![dreammaker_RJz4brjobM](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7483112/e5e4a3e9-ea6b-47f9-887c-3339d24d3fa8)

Replaces the sprite of the hivelord with a new one, in my continuing
quest to annihilate the old asteroid mob sprites.
A (never completed) asteroid mob resprite was actually my first PR, this
one is my 200th.
I am also planning on fucking with basic mob versions of these mobs some
time but the sprites can be atomised out.

In addition to replacing the old-ass MSPaint sprites, this PR also adds
a short death animation effect to the hivelord brood (from hivelords or
legions) which looks nicer than them just vanishing instantly upon
death.

Look at this video for an example of the animation:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKaskN5-y2A

## Why It's Good For The Game

Looks nicer.

## Changelog

:cl:
image: Hivelords have a new sprite.
image: Hivelord and Legion brood have a death animation.

[TEST-MERGE FIRST] Wound refactor number two: Full synthetic support (#78124)

## About The Pull Request

Heavily refactors wounds AGAIN.

The primary thing this PR does is completely change how wounds are
generated and added - while the normal "hit a guy til they bleed" stuff
works about the same, asking for a specific type of wound, say, like how
vending machines try to apply a compound fracture sometimes, isnt going
to work if we ever get any non-organic wounds, which the previous
refactor allowed.

With this PR, however...
* You can now ask for a specific type of wound via
get_corresponding_wound_type(), which takes wound types, a limb, wound
series, etc. and will try to give you a wound fitting those
specifications - but also, a wound that can be applied to a limb.
* This will allow for a vending machine to apply a compound fracture to
a human, but a collapsed superstructure (assuming my synth wounds go in)
to a robot

There are now new "series types" and "wound specific types" that allow
us to designate what series are "mainline" and randomly generatable, and
what are "alternate types" and must be generated manually - you can see
the documentation in wounds.dm.

The behavior of limping and interaction delays has been abstracted to
datum/wound from bone wounds to allow just, general ease of development

Pregen data now allows for series-specific wound penalties. Example: You
could set a burn wound's series wound penalty to 40, which would make
wound progression in the burn category easier - but it would not make it
any easier to get a slashing wound. As it stands wound penalties are for
wounds globally

Scar files are now picked in a "priority" list, where the wound checks
to see if the limb has a biostate before moving down in said list.
Example: Wounds will check for flesh first, if it finds it - it will use
the flesh scar list. Failing that, they then check bone - if it uses
that, it will use the bone scar list. This allows for significantly more
modular scars that dont even need much proc editing when a new wound
type is added

Misc changes: most initial() usage has been replaced by singleton
datums, wound_type is now wound_types and thus wounds can accept
multiple wound types, wounds can now accept multiple tool behaviors for
treatment, wounds now have a picking weight so we can make certain
wounds rarer flatly,

This PR also allows for wounds to override lower severity wounds on
generation, allowing eswords to jump to avulsions - but in spirit of
refactoring, this has been disabled by default (see pregen data's
competition_mode var).
## Why It's Good For The Game

Code quality is good!

Also, all the changes above allow wounds to be a MUCH more modular
system, which is one of its biggest problems right now - everything is
kinda hardcoded and static, making creative work within wounds harder to
do.

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Refactored wounds yet again
fix: Wounds are now picked from the most severe down again, meaning
eswords can jump to avulsions
fix: Scar descs are now properly applied

Update shot_adaptive to not mutate device shots (#4599)

**Context:**
`shot_adaptive.py` would change device wires, run a QNode with the
device, then change the wires back. We can just run the QNode with
different shots without changing the device!

**Description of the Change:**
Instead of changing device shots, pass `shots=new_shots` as a kwarg to
any QNode execution.

I also removed a silly test for something hacky that users probably
should not even be able to do... it's not that hard to add
`@qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit", shots=1000))` to the top of any
function : )

**Benefits:**
- It will work on the new device API without any changes (I ran the
tests locally with DQ2, worked perfectly)
- No more unnecessary try-finally blocks
- Not mutating object properties is always cool and wise

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Gen 8 Battle Factory: Remove Darmanitan-Galar's Choice Band set (#9354)

* Gen 8 Battle Factory: Remove Band set from Ubers Darmanitan-Galar 

Credentials: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1042959218208157696/1067534457160089731/image.png (i am "lost wind's elegy")

Darm-G's firepower is just fine with scarf; there aren't many (if any?) relevant 1hkos or 2hkos you miss out on compared to band. The only one I can think of is missing out on the OHKO vs Sp. Def Necrozma Dusk Mane, and nobody's leaving their NDM in anyway + you probably have like 12 other things to deal with it.

Without scarf, however, you miss out on really good source of offensive checking and revenge killing potential. Scarf outspeeds huge threats like non scarf Yveltal, Eternatus, Calyrex-Shadow, etc. 

What sparks had to say about band darm in proper SS Ubers:
sparks ‚Äî Today at 1:53 PM
not really but with band building needs to be more focused cos the speed over the 90s and etern etc is insane with scarf

sparks ‚Äî Today at 1:54 PM
while with band you're very much focused on "how to take out ndm and capitalize while not being weak to ho"

As a secondary factor, it would make Ubers in BF a lot better. Currently you have to not only win the coinflip of what move Darm clicks but also the coinflip of what item it is. Both of these are more or less up to random chance.

Balance: Removes anti-drop implants for nukies (#78275)

## About The Pull Request

Removes anti-drop implants being available in nukie implants. Also
rebalances the cybernetic implants bundle to cost 20 TC (value of 24 TC)
since anti-drop has been removed from it.

## Why It's Good For The Game

This is one of the rare few nerf PRs where I was not the one who got
KILLED by the broken OP shit but rather the one using it. I recently
played a nukie round (after hearing that anti-drop had been added) where
I took modsuit shield, dsword, and anti-drop. I got separated from my
team and then proceeded to solo murderbone half the fucking station,
resist MULTIPLE disarms that would have otherwise been successful, get
the disk alone, and nuke. I only had to stop to heal _once_ and honestly
I probably would have been fine if I didn't.

Anti-drop dsword is _insanely_ powerful. Shielded dsword nukies were
already strong enough but were at least somewhat balanced insofar as
there were several ways you could still reliably disarm them and
therefore open them up to more attacks. But now (after
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/77330 which added the
anti-drop implants to nukie uplink) you can have shielded anti-drop
dsword nukies. Add stims and some explosives to deal with any static
fortifications the crew might make (like firelock crush relays), and
with a semi-robust player you essentially have a murderbone machine who
can't be killed by any regularly accessible crew counters short of point
blank suicide bombing. We should not have a default nukie loadout that
can only be reliably, regularly countered by a fucking bomb. Especially
since the crew's main easily accessible ballistic is now being nerfed as
well. (https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/78235)

EDIT: I'd also like to point out that we already don't allow hulks to
use dswords for many of the same reasons.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: removed anti-drop implants from the nuclear operative uplink
balance: removed anti-drop implant from the nukie implants bundle and
changed its cost to 20 TC

Nuclear Operative Jump Jets (#78088)

## About The Pull Request

This PR gives operative MODsuits access to "jump jets".
This is an activated module (starts pinned) with a 30 second cooldown
which removes your personal gravity for 5 seconds and (if possible)
pushes you upwards by one z level. In combination with your regular
jetpack this allows you to fly over gaps, and (most importantly) out of
pits such as you may inadvertently find yourself wandering into on
Icebox.
I have a few other changes I want to make specifically targetted at the
experience of Icebox station destruction causing people to fall several
z levels and get trapped, but this is the first one.

You have to stand still for 1 second to activate the jump jet. This is
because jetpack movement without gravity is actually usually faster than
an operative will walk, and I don't want them to just toggle it as a
sprint button while running around. If people find other tactical uses
for this though I think that's cool.

This module currently isn't available to crew on the tech web, although
maybe someone could add it later if they wanted to. It's not quite so
useful if you don't _also_ have a jetpack though.
I bumped the available complexity of the suits I attached it to up by
the complexity cost of this module so it's not taking up previously
available space.

## Why It's Good For The Game

It's funny when the whole ops team falls in a hole after an explosion
they caused and gets stuck in there fighting Snow Legions but they
should probably have some method for dealing with that.
It also lets them pop back up from the tram hole, a risky proposition
because any flying mob hit by the tram dies almost instantly.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Operative MODsuits now have an attached "jump jet" which sends you
upwards and allows you to use your jetpack under gravity for a few
seconds, perfect for navigating the pits and valleys of Icebox Station.

Day 1 ‚óë

You'll always be my Day 1
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1
Thankful you're my

I got lucky finding you
I won big the day that I came across you
'Cause when you're with me, I don't feel blue
Not a day goes by that I would not redo

Everybody wants to love
It's easy when you try hard enough

That's right

You'll always be my Day 1
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1
Thankful you're my Day 1

When I first met you, it just felt right
It's like I met a copy of myself that night
I don't believe in fate as such
But we were meant to be together that's my hunch

Everybody wants true love
It's out there if you look hard enough, enough, enough

You'll always be my Day 1
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1

Hour by hour, minute by minute
I got mad love for you and you know it
I would never leave you on your own
I just want you to know

You'll always be my Day 1
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1

You'll always be my Day 1
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

Heretic Knock Path (#78108)

## About The Pull Request

other changes: GODMODEd mobs cannot receive embeds or bleed, admins can
now use the traitor panel to give heretics a focus

adds a new heretic path, the path of knock
its a path about opening shit and having access
wound opening included, and stealing
this is its award icon

![ascended](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/01473bf2-5c44-4574-850c-83fb5db204fd)
its knowledge is as follows:

### A Locksmith‚Äôs Secret
starting knowledge, unlocks the key blade which also works as a crowbar


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/3690232d-5687-4b0c-a9cc-b6374e7f1850

### Grasp of Knock
it literally just opens stuff (also makes a knocking sound)
unbolts bolted airlocks and opens them, opens locked closets, opens
mechas, logs you into consoles
(comms consoles are with barebones head-level access, no buying shuttle,
but hey you can shitpost over comms)
Sidepaths: Ashen Eyes, Codex Cicatrix


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/8b890d69-ee03-4d12-99dd-dde7b4483cd4

### Key Keepers Burden
transmute a rod,wallet, and some id card to create an eldritch id card
(very original naming), the ID card used is not preserved
this ID card functions essentially as a superior agent card, using other
IDs on it makes it be consumed by the eldritch ID and have its accesses
and forms added into it, you can use it inhand to turn it into any of
the cards that were consumed
in addition you can hit two airlocks with it to link them together to
create portals under the doors, which has a green glow
going through the portal as a Heretic gets you to the other destination
going through as a nonheretic lands you in a random onstation airlock,
SM chamber included if youre unlucky
1 id card can only have 1 set of portals, making another destroys the
former set, one of the airlocks being destroyed also destroys them


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/e96a518e-b35d-44aa-9a7c-8f2103feab6f

### Rite Of Passage
transmute a white crayon, a multitool, and a plank to create consecrated
lintel
heretics can use this cool looking book to create a 8 second shield that
knocks back any nonheretic that tries to pass
also its ranged


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/036e0875-c422-433e-87b3-71328cb2bf8a

### Mark Of Knock
the mansus grasp will now mark its victim for like 10 seconds
marked victims are denied access by all objects, public airlocks
included


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/6187ef36-30f4-4a92-af21-e5b288afb869

### Burglars Finesse
steal a random item from the victims backpack (or other storage item if
they dont have a backpack) and puts it into your hand
the victim will probably hear you and also gets a chat message about
this



https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/2529fa78-616d-4a46-ae18-3cb22efb1ab1

### Ritual of knowledge
this is nothing new i put this here to keep it in order

### Apetra Vulnera (sidepath with flesh)
the victim receives bleed wounds on every single bodypart that has more
than 15 brute
if they dont have a bodypart that has >= 15 brute they get a random
wound anyway so
side paths are: blood siphon and void cloak



https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/3c2cd21e-edbc-4956-8c2d-cd9a42b87f33

### Wave of Desperation (sidepath with flesh)
cannot be casted uncuffed with no bola, can be casted cuffed with no
bola, with a bola and no cuffs
adjacent mobs are knocked down, mobs are repulsed away, your cuffs and
bola are destroyed, and you gain a status effect that:
after 12 seconds makes you unconscious for 20 seconds
5 min cooldown


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/da480921-d5dd-4b46-b2e8-0cf543640bf9

### Opening Blade
your blade has a 35% chance to cause a weeping avulsion on hit


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/b6fd2837-6b0a-4a5a-bc7b-b9c3f7f715d1

### Caretakers Last Refuge
you can only cast this when not near sentient living beings
while in refuge you are invincible and near transparent, cannot use your
hands or spells
also immune to damage slowdown, being hit with a null rod cancels this
also if you lose your focus you get out of refuge


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/f053cfd8-2a16-4195-8004-17df077983ca



https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/72330486-5273-4123-a108-b437b56120c4

### Many secrets behind the Spider Door (Ascension)
ritual needs 3 bodies without organs in their chest
when successfully performed you ascend and;
open a tear in reality (not the BoH one) which;
Polls all ghosts with sentient mob enabled to spawn and siege the
station, ghosts can interact with the portal to spawn as a random
eldritch mob
spawned mobs are loyal to whoever ascended and on examine can identify
their master
also fills the entire room with purple light

also the heretics opening blade is upgraded to a 65% chance, and they
gain Ascended Shapeshift which allows them to shapeshift into eldritch
mobs, and its not 1 choice only



https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/8d06286e-789d-442f-b33c-878d26deab07

its cool i think and an option for those wanting to steal and be sneaky
and stuff

M707 "Vulture" Anti-Materiel Rifle (#4253)

# About the pull request

## The M707 is not made player-accessible in this PR.

Adds the M707 "Vulture" anti-materiel rifle to the game. [Design doc
here.](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/files/12433899/M707_Final.pdf)

The M707 is meant to take the place of a heavy support weapon, not
unlike the mortar. It is a 20mm bolt-action rifle, capable of loading
from 4-round magazines. Each round does 400 damage with full AP (50),
but it is not a simple task to fire the weapon. The gun, being as
high-caliber as it is, will immediately break your arm & hand if you do
not fire it without use of the built-in bipod. In addition, its accuracy
is massively reduced below its ideal range (10 tiles), which means the
scope is necessary to be used.

The scope does not function like a regular scope. (see screenshot
section for details) Instead, it shows a 5x5 area (the rest is blacked
out) 12 tiles ahead, with an aiming reticle in the center. The aiming
reticle will drift over time within the 5x5, requiring you to re-adjust
or use the **Hold Breath** ability to temporarily stop the sway. If you
open up the scope's UI, you will be able to modify the scope and the
reticle's location, one tile at a time, very slowly.

To assist with this, the Vulture comes with a spotting scope & tripod. A
secondary user is able to assemble and use the spotting scope. The scope
is a complement to the Vulture's, allowing a communicative team to
become far more effective. The spotter's view, on use, will be locked to
the location of the Vulture scope. However, the spotter's view is not
locked to a 5x5 area, instead getting a view of the full area, on top of
an extra 2 tiles (in each direction) of view range. Finally, both the
spotter and sniper's scopes have night vision equivalent to an SG's
goggles.

The bullet itself is a powerful beast. Powerful enough to pierce walls,
people, and barricades, but with 2 caveats. The first is that every
wall/cade penetration removes 75 damage from the round, and any
cades/tables that the round passes over will be immediately destroyed by
the round. In addition, anyone in a large range will hear the report of
the rifle sound and the direction it came from.

Update as of 8/31:
Vulture and its spotter scope now require a pamphlet to use (a pamphlet
gives the trait needed to use both), guncase spawns with 2.

# Explain why it's good for the game

It's a unique weapon that encourages communication inside a team, while
simultaneously not contributing to the IFF ungaball. The weapon promotes
thoughtful gameplay and repositioning to be able to hit a target without
friendlies getting in the way or getting overrun.

Optimizes qdel related things (slight init time savings) (#70729)

* Moves spawners and decals to a different init/delete scheme

Rather then fully creating and then immediately deleting these things,
we instead do the bare minimum.

This is faster, if in theory more fragile. We should be safe since any
errors should be caught in compile since this is very close to a
"static" action. It does mean these atoms cannot use signals, etc.

* Potentially saves init time, mostly cleans up a silly pattern

We use sleeps and INVOKE_ASYNC to ensure that handing back turfs doesn't
block a space reservation, but this by nature consumes up to the
threshold and a bit more of whatever working block we were in.

This is silly. Should just be a subsystem, so I made it one, with
support for awaiting its finish if you want to

* Optimizes garbage/proc/Queue slightly

Queue takes about 1.6 seconds to process 26k items right now.
The MASSIVE majority of this time is spent on using \ref
This is because \ref returns a string, and that string requires being
inserted into the global cache of strings we store

What I'm doing is caching the result of ANY \ref on the datum it's
applied to. This ensures previous uses will never decay from the string
tree.

This saves about 0.2 seconds of init

[MIRROR] Conveyor Belts are now easier to extend and have screentips [MDB IGNORE] (#23679)

* Conveyor Belts are now easier to extend and have screentips (#78278)

## About The Pull Request

Conveyor belt **stacks** now have a better examine text.

Using a conveyor belt stack on a placed conveyor belt now extends the
conveyor belt by 1 tile, linking to it's ID automatically, and makes for
much easier building of conveyor belt setups.

Conveyor belts now come jam packed with screentips.

I've also added the default tile place sound to the usage of conveyor
stacks to provide a tiny bit of audio feedback when placing new conveyor
belts.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Conveyor belts are just mind-numbingly annoying to use in a regular
round, and trying to set up a new conveyor belt setup is confusing if
you don't have ultra specific information about how to make one before
you even start. Hell, I remember I had to add the *real* construction
steps to the wiki like 6 years ago and I STILL hear people getting
confused about how these works.

This improves their ease of use, while also making everyone sleep a
little easier for those of us who use them.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Conveyor belts now have screentips and a better examine tip to
teach you how to set one up properly.
qol: Using a conveyor belt stack on a placed conveyor belt will extend
the conveyor belt to the output of that conveyor belt.. You can use this
to place fully integrated conveyor belts much easier now.

* Conveyor Belts are now easier to extend and have screentips

Prototyping the room in Blender

- This actual build represents quite a lot of work in Blender over the last day or two trying to understand how to get rid of that edge flicker - seems to be to do with having vertices/edges that don't line up - one of those classic bullshit geometry things I should just know but don't
- The upshot is that when I use "edge cycles" for every moment I try to divide the object it seems to yield a happy camper, although it means that in its current state the ceiling is not detachable which may have knock on effects
- I still need to make the proper room, but the current webgl build at least gives me something that doesn't have the edge issue
- Although it *does* still have the issue of looking completely insane shadow-acne wise from specific distances and angles, something new to think about (I want to solve it for outdoor scenes but I'm interested in preserving/provoking at least in some interiors to "show it off"
- Progress anyway

Update 1.0.6

Code wise - totally minuscule update. However technically it was unexpected battle.

I believe that this is a story every programmer faced in his time at least once. U think "I have spare 15 minutes, let's add something easy! Just for sake of it being there waiting for me to take it serious.". All of a sudden it's 11 PM and you started at 7 PM. You are facing a cascade of something not supporting something else... And you wanted to add a simple fricking icon to ease your mind from dictionaries, loops and recurrence but all of a sudden you had to perform a mental backflip to add a stupid icon... Over 4 hours of your life are long time gone... but there it is. An icon. Curtains!

The Big One.

Whoa, this one's been in the making for a while now. This one has been my attempt to fix as much as I could within a little over a month. Here's what I've got for you.

- Fixed a bug in Silph Gauntlet where the trainers would not see you unless you spoke to them

- Removed the unnecessary Gawarhed and Wugtrio static encounters. In what was once Gawarhed's place is a Rare Candy.

- Implemented a working ferry system (huge thanks to Red++) that allows travelling to Faraway Island and Citrine City with the right tickets. Currently both maps use a copy of the SS Anne, which may be revised later.

- Bittybat, Magnetite and Burgela have been removed to fix a Pokedex bug where entries wouldn't display correctly if the total number wasn't a multiple of 8.

- Fixed a bug where fishing up a Wiglett and Wugtrio would play the trainer battle and Champion battle themes respectively

- Restructured the Pokedex a little. Don't worry, Lickitung's still number 108!

- All references to betamon in the disassembly have had their names updated to match the new Ogasawara ones

- Removed Blastyke as a Game Corner prize, replacing it with Squeamata.

- Garnet Cavern is now properly listed as a dungeon map

- Fixed an issue where trying to leave Bill's House after entering the garden would put you back in the garden

- Moved Silph Gauntlet's Beauty down 1 floor to make the number of trainers on each floor more consistent

- Finished Gauntlet 6F except for the trainer text (PvK please help)

- Gavillain's stats updated to match KEP 1.4 on the Showdown server. It's now a Dragon/Electric type with less Ice coverage.

- Fixed Clefable's and Wigglytuff's starting movesets from an earlier commit

- Fixed an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE, EGREGIOUSLY FRUSTRATING BUG that caused the Pokedex's seen counter to rarely update. This is what caused this commit to be delayed for so long. No joke.

- New sprites, courtesy of Albatross, for Sylveon's back sprite, Alolan Marowak, Alolan Muk, Galarian Weezing and Magnezone!

- Fixed a bug preventing the trade for Haunter from being accessed.
