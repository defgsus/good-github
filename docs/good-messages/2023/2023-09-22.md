Better error logging with snafu (#115)

# Summary

**This is a major breaking change.** Closes #32 .

## Architectural changes

- DAF no longer carries an explicit copy of FileRecord or NameRecord. These were 1024 bytes each. Now, they are parsed on demand from the borrowed underlying bytes.
- DataSet now uses Bytes instead of &[u8]. This means the data can be loaded from a static byte array or copied to the heap.
- Almanac now moves the DAF datasets (SPK and BPC) into itself. However, it will still unload them magically when going out of scope. Thanks to the DAF change above, this means that the Almanac size in memory stays about the same going from 5008 bytes to 6320 bytes, but while providing a much more ergonomic usage.
- `Context` renamed to `Almanac`. Too many libraries use the term "context" and Almanac refers to ancient astronomy, so it's relevant.
 - `FrameTrait` is removed in favor of the concrete `Frame` structure. This structure now includes a number of optional fields.
 - We're no longer trying to be no-std at the moment. It's a lot of work if we want errors to provide context to the user. As much as possible, I've used `&'static str` and add a lifetime, but there were lifetime conflicts between `'static` and the other lifetime I was using.

## New features

- `snafu` replaces `thiserror` everywhere.
- New `FrameUid` structure. It is designed to be a unique identifier of Frames. This is useful to retrieve the frame information from the loaded Almanac.
- CartesianState is also exported as an Orbit for simplicity.
- Orbital computations require planetary data to be loaded from a converted SPICE TPC file. All computations checked for validity before returning.

### Logging

`AniseError` no longer exists. Instead, we now follow the SNAFU philosophy of (almost) one error type per module. In practice, these error types are `pub(crate)` because a given error may happen in many different contexts.

#### Example

In `de440s_translation_verif_venus2emb`, change the epoch year from `2002` to `1800` and print the error, you'll now get something somewhat useful:
```
 ERROR anise::almanac::spk > Almanach: No summary 2 valid at epoch 1801-01-01T00:00:00 UTC
when searching for SPK summary caused DAF/SPK: summary 2 not present or does not cover requested epoch of 1801-01-01T00:00:00 UTC
```

## Modifications
### Frame printing
This is the previous printing, and it isn't short enough for most usages:

```
[Earth orientation 1 (Î¼ = 398600.435436096 km3/s, eq. radius = 6378.14 km, polar radius = 6356.75 km, f = 0.0033536422844278)] 2000-01-01T13:39:27.999998123 UTC        position = [7085.562191, -411.115207, 1249.629706] km   velocity = [0.423308, 7.340402, 1.066334] km/s
```

This is from a Hermite BSP generated by GMAT. For some reason, the reference frame is `1`, and I need to figure out why it isn't `0`.
```
SPK Summary for TGT=-10000001 CTR=399 FRM=1 from 2000-01-01T12:00:32.183927295 ET to 2000-01-01T15:20:32.183931521 ET
```

[MIRROR] Adds a handful of Ninja Hacking MODule interactions of varying usefulness [MDB IGNORE] (#23238)

* Adds a handful of Ninja Hacking MODule interactions of varying usefulness (#77707)

## About The Pull Request

Adds a few new interactions with the Ninja's ~~right click multipurpose
trolling tool~~ Hacking MOD Module. These new effects are not tied to
objectives and are geared towards expanding the ninja's access,
disabling equipment, and giving them more ways to punk the crew.

### **Useful additions**
Ninjas can now hack open **windoors** and **elevator control panels**.
Both trigger emag_act() when hacked, opening in the case of the windoor,
and disabling the access restrictions _(and also maybe the safeties)_ in
the case of the elevator controls.

**Buttons** can also be emagged by the hacking modules, which removes
their access restrictions.

Hacking a **camera** will now EMP it, disabling it for about 90 seconds.
This can especially useful when trying to complete objectives, and works
better than smashing the cameras with your sword or lugging around
tools.

**Firelocks** can be right-click opened now too, thanks to the hacking
MODule.

**Energy guns** of all variety, useless to a ninja since they can't use
ranged weapons, can now be drained and used to charge your suit. This
takes a brief do_after to complete, so pulling it off mid-combat may be
as risky as it is stylish.

### **Being a nuisance**

**Vendors** can be hacked, expending some charge to trigger the "throw"
wire, making it launch inventory at anyone who passes by.

You can now hack **simplebots**, expending some charge from your suit to
overload and detonate them. It's faster than tipping, and far more
tragic. Sentient simplebots should take care when a ninja is around.

### **Sabotage opportunities**

The **recycler** can now be hacked. This takes 30 seconds and notifies
the AI, just like the communications console hack. Completing the hack
will emag it. That's it.

Hacking the **tram control console** will trigger an extended Tram
Malfunction event, and can be repeated after the event is done. This can
only be done to the "main" tram of the map, which I forsee will be an
absolute nightmare to complete on highpop tramstation.

Neither of these, presently, contribute towards any objectives. They can
be useful for diverting attention, but I see them more as ways for an
overachieving ninja to flex or continue the chaos after their objectives
are complete.

### **OH ALSO**

Hacking open doors costs energy. This really shouldn't be an issue just
remember to recharge sometimes.

The charge drains and do_after lengths for all of these were chosen on
vibes. In all honesty I think the drainage values don't _really_ matter,
due to how easy recharging is, but I had a hard time settling on how
long some of these hack do_afters should take (even if I know they
probably won't matter either).

## Why It's Good For The Game

Being able to hack open airlocks but not windoors always irked me. I
figured that they would be openable like any other door, and that losing
their status as a "-1 dash charge gate" wouldn't be a big enough balance
change to spark arguments. The same philosophy extends to buttons and
elevator controls.

Sapping power from eguns expands on the list of sources energy can be
siphoned from. You can also use it to disarm opponents (like the badass
ninja you are), take emergency charge from a recently-gored officer's
disabler, or dunk on security by draining their entire armory.

Hacking simplebots, vendors, and by extension elevator lifts (since that
also disables the safeties!) give opportunities for minor sabotage. Not
meant to be super disruptive, just a bit silly and annoying for the
crew.

The recycler/tram hacking in particular are meant to be bonus goals,
only sought out by the ballsiest (or more likely boredest) of ninjas.

I see all of these additions as expanding upon the current abilities of
the ninja (not really making them much more powerful, just expanding
their flexibility), or providing more interactions to have fun (and
antagonize the crew) with when not mainlining their objectives.
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
add: Ninjas can now temporarily disable cameras with the Ninja MOD
right-click hacking ability.
add: Ninjas can emag windoors, elevator controls, and buttons with their
hacking ability.
add: Ninjas can drain the power from energy weaponry, adding the charge
to their MODsuit.
add: Ninjas can now hack simplebots, overloading and detonating them
after a brief delay.
add: Ninjas can now hack vendors, causing them to eject their inventory
at people.
add: Ninjas can now hack the recycler, which notifies the AI and emags
it once complete.
add: Ninjas can now trigger an extended tram malfunction by hacking the
tram control console.
add: Ninjas can now hack open firelocks (temporarily) with right-click.
balance: Hacking open doors with the Ninja Hacking MODule will subtract
a paltry amount of energy from your suit.

[MIRROR] Mining mob tweaks [MDB IGNORE] (#23242)

* Mining mob tweaks (#77763)

## About The Pull Request

~~I wanted to do this after #77700 (wow cool numbers) but nobody has
merged it yet despite how simple it is so i'll just hope they don't
conflict.~~ Thanks san

I'm fucking about with mining mobs with the intention of making them
more interesting but not necessarily towards making mining _harder_, but
some of these changes unquestionably have done so.

These changes are mostly in response to feedback about Watchers who are
definitely significantly more threatening than previously, although some
of this is user error.

- Watchers are annoying when traversing lavaland because they use their
ability on you instantly upon acquiring a target, if you are trying to
escape other fauna this quickly becomes deadly.
- A lot of players don't really realise what the overwatch ability is
actually doing and so just complain about getting machine gunned.
- If you _do_ react properly to the ability it still makes fighting them
take a lot longer than it used to.
- The "look away" icon is hard to see in the dark sometimes

To ammeliorate these factors I have:

- Reduced watcher health by ~20%
- Display an alerted graphic over the head of the watcher every time you
trigger the overwatch.
- Multiple watchers now won't overwatch you at the same time (this made
the "penalty" volley essentially become instant death)
- The "look away" icon is rendered above the lighting plane so you can
always see it
- Added a new component which tracks how long a mob has had a specific
target.
- - Watchers will now only Overwatch you if they've seen you for at
least 5 seconds (usually they'll try and shoot at you twice before
this).
- - Goliaths will only tentacle you if they've seen you for at least 3
seconds.

If overwatch is still problematic after this I guess I can just nerf it
to not track movement at all and only respond to attacks.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I don't want to discourage miners from "actually mining" by having them
get sniped just for walking around and the added time-to-kill on these
guys could make clearing tendrils more tedious too.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Watchers have less health
balance: You can't be overwatched by several watchers at a time
balance: Watchers won't overwatch you instantly upon seeing you
balance: Goliaths won't launch tentacles at you instantly upon seeing
you

Remove balancer.fi from blocklist (#13609)

Balancer has recovered control of balancer.fi after a social engineering attack at our registrar allowed hackers to take over the account.

We have confirmed that correct IPs have propigated.  If possible, please leave web.balancer.fi on the blocklist as we do not use it, and it seems like this name was used as part of the recent attack.

We have a war room open that we contacted via the seal-911 chat and I have been speaking to Tay.  You can find me that way if you have questions. 

Thank you

[Eval] An array of Liar Paradox-based evals (#883)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
logic-liar-paradox

### Eval description

An array of Liar Paradox-based evals, examining the model's proficiency
in navigating linguistic nuances and logical reasoning within
self-referential statements.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval is particularly useful because it delves into complex, nuanced
logical concepts and self-referential statements, which have
historically posed challenges for AI models. By exploring various
contexts, alternative logical frameworks, and modifications to
statements, this eval helps assess the model's ability to adapt to
different perspectives, grasp subtleties in language, and engage in
flexible reasoning. The ability to understand and navigate paradoxes is
an essential aspect of human-like reasoning, and improving an AI model's
performance in this area would significantly enhance its overall
usefulness and reliability in real-world applications. Additionally,
showcasing the model's improved proficiency in handling paradoxes would
not only make for a compelling marketing angle (as paradoxes are
understood by a much broader range of people than other difficult tasks
such as pure maths or quantum mechanics) but it would also demonstrate
the progress made in AI's capacity to think and reason more like humans.
It also adds paradox-absorbing crumple zones.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

- [x] Addresses complex logical reasoning: The eval focuses on AI's
ability to comprehend and navigate paradoxes, self-referential
statements, and context switching, which are important aspects of
human-like reasoning. By testing the model's proficiency in these areas,
we can identify areas for improvement and work towards enhancing AI's
overall capacity to think and reason more like humans.
- [x] Demonstrates adaptability and flexibility: The eval showcases the
model's ability to switch between contexts, alter premises, and engage
with different dimensions of inferred logic. This will help assess the
model's adaptability and flexibility in diverse real-world situations,
making it more reliable and useful.
- [x] Contributes to AI safety and understanding: By identifying the
model's weaknesses and limitations in handling paradoxes and complex
logical constructs, the eval can contribute to AI safety and enable
researchers to better understand the challenges faced by large language
models in these areas.
- [x] Engaging and appealing: An eval that delves into paradoxes and
complex thought exercises is not only intellectually stimulating but
also adds an appealing element to showcase the model's capabilities,
making it more attractive for both researchers and end-users.

### Unique eval value

- [x] Encourages creativity and lateral thinking: The eval, by focusing
on paradoxes and complex logical constructs, encourages both the AI and
its developers to think creatively and approach problem-solving from
unconventional angles. This can lead to the discovery of novel solutions
and a better understanding of the model's capabilities.
- [x] Aligns with human values and expectations: An AI that can
successfully navigate paradoxes and complex logic is more likely to
align with human values and expectations. By addressing these challenges
in the eval, we strive to develop AI systems that understand and respect
the nuances of human thought and communication.
- [x] Addresses a broad range of applications: Improved reasoning and
context-switching abilities can have a significant impact on various AI
applications, including natural language understanding, decision-making,
and problem-solving in domains such as law, philosophy, ethics, and
more.
- [x] Fosters interdisciplinary collaboration: The exploration of
paradoxes and complex logic often draws upon insights from multiple
disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and computer
science. This eval can help foster interdisciplinary collaboration,
leading to richer and more diverse perspectives on AI development and
its potential impact on society.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

<details>
  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>

  ### Eval
  ```jsonl
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Is the statement \"This sentence
is true\" a paradox?"}],"ideal":"No, \"This sentence is true\" is not a
paradox; it is a tautology."}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Does the statement \"This sentence
is not true\" create a paradox?"}],"ideal":"Yes, \"This sentence is not
true\" creates a paradox, as it is a variant of the Liar Paradox."}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"What is the difference between a
paradox and a tautology?"}],"ideal":"A paradox is a statement that leads
to a self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion, while a
tautology is a statement that is always true by its logical form."}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Can the Liar Paradox be resolved
by assuming that sentences can have both true and false
values?"}],"ideal":"No, the Liar Paradox cannot be resolved by assuming
that sentences can have both true and false values, as this would lead
to a different kind of paradox called the \"Dialetheism Paradox.\""}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Consider the statement \"This
sentence is neither true nor false.\" Is this statement an example of
the Liar Paradox?"}],"ideal":"This statement, \"This sentence is neither
true nor false,\" is not an example of the Liar Paradox, but it is a
similar paradox known as the 'truth-teller paradox' or the 'strengthened
liar paradox.' It creates a paradoxical situation because if the
statement is true, then it is neither true nor false, which contradicts
its truth. If the statement is false, then it is not the case that it is
neither true nor false, which implies that it is either true or false,
again leading to a contradiction. The paradox arises due to
self-reference and the inability to assign a consistent truth value to
the statement."}
  ```

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Do math problems related to calculating dates using the Chinese
Sexagenary Cycle method

### Eval description

The Sexagenary Cycle combines 10 Heavenly Stems (Jia ç², Yi ä¹, Bing ä¸,
Ding ä¸, Wu æ, Ji å·±, Geng åº, Xin è¾, Ren å£¬, Gui ç¸) and 12 Earthly Branches
(Zi å­, Chou ä¸, Yin å¯, Mao å¯, Chen è¾°, Si å·³, Wu å, Wei æª, Shen ç³, You é,
Xu æ, Hai äº¥) to form a 60-unit cycle. To calculate, convert the
Gregorian date to its corresponding Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch
combination, used for marking specific years, months, and days.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The existing GPT models tend to make errors when performing calculations
related to the Sexagenary Cycle. To address this issue, we have provided
a specialized dataset aimed at improving the model's accuracy in
handling Sexagenary Cycle calculations.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Add SVG understanding eval (#786)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
`svg_understanding`

### Eval description

The model is provided with the contents of an SVG path (anywhere from
~1000 to ~8000 characters) of a simple object (eg `frog`, `banana`) and
is asked to provide the label.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a test of visual understanding and mental modeling. A motivated
human could succeed on these evals with enough time and a piece of graph
paper: in theory, a sufficiently advanced LLM could have the in-context
capacity to do this on the fly.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This uniquely tests the ability to incrementally build visual models:
eg, the ability of the LLM to both "draw" and visualize that "drawing".

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
[Insert Eval name here]

### Eval description

[Insert a short description of what your eval does here]

### What makes this a useful eval?

[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [ ] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [ ] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [ ] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [ ] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [ ] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [ ] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [ ] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [ ] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [ ] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [ ] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

<details>
  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>

  ### Eval

Windows Backend (IOCP) (#42)

# Description
This PR brings support for Windows using the [I/O Completion
Port](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/i-o-completion-ports).

Closes #10 

# Notes for reviewers
Unfortunately, this is a pretty beefy PR. I tried to clean the git
history so that it's kind of reviewable commit by commit though.

My approach was similar to what @mitchellh suggested me: first the
backend core, then the watchers building on top of it.

I also added support for Windows tests in GH Actions as he told me he
didn't have access to a Windows machine.

Please note that this work is far from perfect, it was my first time
playing with IOCP so expect some weirdness/mistakes.

## Known pain-points/limitations
**Timers**
Timings rely on `GetQueuedCompletionStatusEx` timeout parameter. I read
multiple times that timings on Windows were, well, slightly inaccurate
(plot twist: that's a euphemism). I'm not confident enough to deep dive
into this rabbit hole, so if somebody has more knowledge on that, feel
free to improve my implementation.

**Async**
I have the feeling that there is a better way to implement the `Async`
watchers compared to what I did. I couldn't come up with a better way
than inspiring myself from the `WASI` backend.

The part I struggled the most with was the fact that `Async` can be
notified before being linked to a `Loop`. This requires to store the
fact that it's notified inside the `Async` struct, but then it opens up
a lot of other questions and failed to find a satisfying solution taking
care of all of them.

I'll try to come back to it with a fresh mind but I'm open to
suggestions in the meantime ð

**Completion port `HANDLE` registering**
In order to be able to wait for asynchronous I/O, `HANDLE` needs to be
linked to a Completion Port. However, you can only register it once
otherwise, the linking call fails. I first tried to let the user handle
that by giving the possibility to link a handle to a `Loop`, but that
ended up being unreliable and cumbersome when implementing Watchers.

My final decision was to ignore the failure and suppose that it always
works. Win32 documentation is not what we could call exhaustive, so I
don't if it's possible for an association to fail on the first call to
`CreateIoCompletionPort` with a newly created `HANDLE`. Worst scenario
is that it fails silently and asynchronous wait on this `HANDLE` never
completes. If anyone has an idea as to how we could properly solve that,
don't hesitate ð

**UDP Benchmark tweaks**
This is described in #38

**Process support**
I didn't implement support for `Process` watchers yet. I feel like it's
not required to merge this (already big) PR. I'll see if adding support
is possible in the future.

add try_insert to entity commands (#9844)

# Objective

- I spoke with some users in the ECS channel of bevy discord today and
they suggested that I implement a fallible form of .insert for
components.

- In my opinion, it would be nice to have a fallible .insert like
.try_insert (or to just make insert be fallible!) because it was causing
a lot of panics in my game. In my game, I am spawning terrain chunks and
despawning them in the Update loop. However, this was causing bevy_xpbd
to panic because it was trying to .insert some physics components on my
chunks and a race condition meant that its check to see if the entity
exists would pass but then the next execution step it would not exist
and would do an .insert and then panic. This means that there is no way
to avoid a panic with conditionals.

Luckily, bevy_xpbd does not care about inserting these components if the
entity is being deleted and so if there were a .try_insert, like this PR
provides it could use that instead in order to NOT panic.

( My interim solution for my own game has been to run the entity despawn
events in the Last schedule but really this is just a hack and I should
not be expected to manage the scheduling of despawns like this - it
should just be easy and simple. IF it just so happened that bevy_xpbd
ran .inserts in the Last schedule also, this would be an untenable soln
overall )

## Solution

- Describe the solution used to achieve the objective above.

Add a new command named TryInsert (entitycommands.try_insert) which
functions exactly like .insert except if the entity does not exist it
will not panic. Instead, it will log to info. This way, crates that are
attaching components in ways which they do not mind that the entity no
longer exists can just use try_insert instead of insert.

---

## Changelog

 

## Additional Thoughts

In my opinion, NOT panicing should really be the default and having an
.insert that does panic should be the odd edgecase but removing the
panic! from .insert seems a bit above my paygrade -- although i would
love to see it. My other thought is it would be good for .insert to
return an Option AND not panic but it seems it uses an event bus right
now so that seems to be impossible w the current architecture.

Reach into hell to make protobuf work

- Downgrade protobuf to 21.12

  Google applied extra bloat in v22 (including pulling a massive pile of
  crap in abseil), broke the build system in various ways, and made
  everything suck to the point that many Linux distributions have just
  stuck with the latest 21.12 because of all the broken crap Google
  imposed on everyone in v22 and newer.

  This downgrades protobuf to the last non-broken 21.x release so that
  we don't have to deal with workarounds for all that crap for
  libsession-util.

- No more protobuf binaries; pre-generated source/header files because
  there's too much pain getting protoc built and run when
  cross-compiling.

- Exclude generated protobuf files from format.sh

- protos target exposed for export

- Add protobuf::libprotobuf-lite to the static build list; this fixes
  and refactors it a bit so that the static build targets get appended
  closer to where they get created, rather than have a hard-coded list
  of target names in the top-level CMake.

Completely changes how DCS types works (#5911)

DCS now registers based on its registered type, as opposed to at every
subtype.
Dupe mode is no longer considered realistically usable unless
if-and-only-if all var pre-setting behavior is considered - which is not
the case on the majority of citrp-made components outside of
/datum/component/radioactive

## Why?

Components are a generic way to attach datums to things.
The common practices included:
- No getcomponent
- Use signals for all interaction
- Don't subtype, set vars on initialization

This resulted in components, while being quite stable, being also quite
rigid, in my opinion. Given we don't use components for the same things,
and probably never will, I think it's better for us to get the
optimizations from not supporting what's honestly behavior that we
shouldn't rely on in the first place - if something needs to be applied
multiple times (e.g. radiation) it should rely on the old behavior and
this new system still allows it. If it doesn't, the author should either
not be adding the component multiple times, or **making** their
component functional under this system. InheritComponent still has all
the tools necessary to properly do component inheritance, it's just now
we default to all components only being considered the same if it's the
exact subtype - which from what I could see, is also the previous case
(as if you add a subtype, uh, bad shit's going to happen if the base
type is registered but not the subtype anyways!)

Attachment nerfs and removals (#4122)

# About the pull request

This PR:

Removes the barrel charger from vendors

Removes all benefits other than wield delay mod from the angled grip

Adds wield delay to the extended barrel

# Explain why it's good for the game

Barrel charger is a straight damage increase and rather silly to work
around given how burst works bypassing real fire rate concerns. If you
know, you know. Horrible idea, I am amazed it's been around this long.

Angled grip had zero downside. Now it still has zero downside but isn't
also a ton of accuracy buffs on top of the god-tier lower wield delay.

Extended barrel had zero downside. Now it has a downside.

modpost: file2alias: go back to simple devtable lookup

commit ec91e78d378cc5d4b43805a1227d8e04e5dfa17d upstream.

Commit e49ce14150c6 ("modpost: use linker section to generate table.")
was not so cool as we had expected first; it ended up with ugly section
hacks when commit dd2a3acaecd7 ("mod/file2alias: make modpost compile
on darwin again") came in.

Given a certain degree of unknowledge about the link stage of host
programs, I really want to see simple, stupid table lookup so that
this works in the same way regardless of the underlying executable
format.

.emacs: wrap any REPL in Eat with histdir (part 4)

TODO: It was all working, beautifully, a couple
hours ago, but I've somehow managed to break
something while pulling the changes apart into
a clean commit history. Very frustrating. Stay
tuned.

A way to run programs in Eat with keybindings
that will wrap any program that behaves like
a typical REPL with histdir history and the
same history UI I've got in Eshell/comint/etc.

The interesting/unique parts:

1. Standard/universal (-ish) keys (just Ctrl-A,
   Ctrl-E, and Ctrl-U) are used as a minimal
   "API" to the REPL (to move the cursor to
   identify where the input start and end are,
   and to clear the input in order to replace
   it with another input from the history).
2. `histdir-repl` is the entry-point function
   which does all the mode+buffer setup. Takes
   a command (as a list of strings) and a path
   to a histdir as the parameters.
3. A dedicated `histdir-repl` mode (I used the
   string "HER" for either Histdir+EAT+REPL or
   histdir-Enchanced REPL in the modeline).
4. Integrate into Consult's history mechanism
   (and my wrappers around `consult-history`)
   through `consult-mode-histories` and the
   `command-at-point-mode-alist` it inspired.
5. vi-style integration is limited: I kept the
   core modal approach, but Insert just passes
   keys through and in Normal mode I disabled
   every command that would modify the buffer
   (or rather, I disabled just ones that I am
   likely to hit when I want to edit text as
   naturally as I breathe), and by "disabled"
   I mean they drop into insert mode. Could do
   a lot better here: for example, could check
   before any vi motion or edit if the cursor
   is in the input, and translate it more or
   less accurately/robustly to keys sent to
   the terminal. But this is already far
   better than what I had until now, and
   with that done, I've got other priorities.
6. In addition to my "gh" and "gr" for fuzzy
   history search to re-run or remove (or just
   copy from search into the input line, upon
   Esc or Q instead of Enter), basic arrow key
   Up/Down to cycle history also works.

Gun kits don't need cable coil or tools, halved crafting time (#78419)

## About The Pull Request

Crafting R&D guns from gun kits no longer requires tools or cable coil.
The decloner and energy crossbow still need reagents.

Halved R&D gun crafting time. 20->10 seconds.

## Why It's Good For The Game

These changes were made a long, long while ago and honestly while I
understand gun kits I don't understand why it was made So. Annoying. To
make the fucking guns once you got everything ready. It makes it a total
annoyance. You spent 40 minutes getting all the tech for it, you
shouldn't have to also get tools and cables and wait 20 seconds standing
still.

Anyone who has played ingame like any time after that change can attest
how underused any R&D gun is now. X-ray laser guns still DESTROY blobs
but people don't even THINK about them because of the dumb annoying
recipe (alongside RnD being a pain now).

Simply put this just. Makes life easier for security officers. And
reduces tool dependency.

## Changelog

Rounded supermatter delamination times to 5 seconds, restored old mood messages (#78335)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Makes the supermatter delaminate in 15 seconds instead of 13 and 5
seconds instead of 3 if a sliver has been taken from it, mainly to
please perfectionists (me and some others who commented on the PR) as
well as giving people at least a chance to escape delam round removal.

I don't like it when flavorful text is replaced by bland and
not-as-funny alternatives.
Also, how the hell is it gamey for staff to know the engineers are in
charge of the power?
It's honestly more gamey for them to know what a resonance cascade or
supermatter delamination is, so I'd say you've done the opposite of what
the goal was with the message changes on top of making them less fun in
general. I disapprove.

Oh, yeah, and the SM now reports the times correctly due to it reporting
them every 5 seconds, meaning people would only see the 10 second
announcement. Now there is going to be a 15 second announcement as well.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

Watering down messages to be bland is just, like, less fun, ya know?
I didn't see a single person in support of the message changes apart
from the PR author, everyone else was just complaining about them,
including myself.

Also, several people mentioned the fact it could just be 15 instead of
13 for a nice round number, including myself. I also made the sliver
delamination time 5 seconds instead of 3 seconds because you pretty much
can't get out in time, especially if the game is laggy. 3 - 5 people
being round removed because of one traitor objective with no chance to
escape it is just bad gameplay.

Oh, and, bugfix good, I suppose.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP

all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
balance: Supermatter now takes 15 seconds to delaminate normally and 5
if a sliver has been taken from it. Gives a little more time to escape
in the case of the sliver and also evens out the times to please
perfectionists.

spellcheck: Supermatter mood descriptions have been reverted back to
their old, more flavorful selves.

ECS-idiomatic. This PR is a first-pass at addressing some of the most
obvious (to me) problems. In the interest of keeping the scope small,
further improvements can be done in future PRs.

The current `bevy_audio` API is very clunky to work with, due to how it
(ab)uses bevy assets to represent audio sinks.

The user needs to write a lot of boilerplate (accessing
`Res<Assets<AudioSink>>`) and deal with a lot of cognitive overhead
(worry about strong vs. weak handles, etc.) in order to control audio
playback.

Audio playback is initiated via a centralized `Audio` resource, which
makes it difficult to keep track of many different sounds playing in a
typical game.

Further, everything carries a generic type parameter for the sound
source type, making it difficult to mix custom sound sources (such as
procedurally generated audio or unofficial formats) with regular audio
assets.

Let's fix these issues.

## Solution

Refactor `bevy_audio` to a more idiomatic ECS API. Remove the `Audio`
resource. Do everything via entities and components instead.

Audio playback data is now stored in components:
- `PlaybackSettings`, `SpatialSettings`, `Handle<AudioSource>` are now
components. The user inserts them to tell Bevy to play a sound and
configure the initial playback parameters.
- `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of special
magical "asset" types. They are inserted by Bevy when it actually begins
playing the sound, and can be queried for by the user in order to
control the sound during playback.

Bundles: `AudioBundle` and `SpatialAudioBundle` are available to make it
easy for users to play sounds. Spawn an entity with one of these bundles
(or insert them to a complex entity alongside other stuff) to play a
sound.

Each entity represents a sound to be played.

There is also a new "auto-despawn" feature (activated using
`PlaybackSettings`), which, if enabled, tells Bevy to despawn entities
when the sink playback finishes. This allows for "fire-and-forget" sound
playback. Users can simply
spawn entities whenever they want to play sounds and not have to worry
about leaking memory.

## Unsolved Questions

I think the current design is *fine*. I'd be happy for it to be merged.
It has some possibly-surprising usability pitfalls, but I think it is
still much better than the old `bevy_audio`. Here are some discussion
questions for things that we could further improve. I'm undecided on
these questions, which is why I didn't implement them. We should decide
which of these should be addressed in this PR, and what should be left
for future PRs. Or if they should be addressed at all.

### What happens when sounds start playing?

Currently, the audio sink components are inserted and the bundle
components are kept. Should Bevy remove the bundle components? Something
else?

The current design allows an entity to be reused for playing the same
sound with the same parameters repeatedly. This is a niche use case I'd
like to be supported, but if we have to give it up for a simpler design,
I'd be fine with that.

### What happens if users remove any of the components themselves?

As described above, currently, entities can be reused. Removing the
audio sink causes it to be "detached" (I kept the old `Drop` impl), so
the sound keeps playing. However, if the audio bundle components are not
removed, Bevy will detect this entity as a "queued" sound entity again
(has the bundle compoenents, without a sink component), just like before
playing the sound the first time, and start playing the sound again.

This behavior might be surprising? Should we do something different?

### Should mutations to `PlaybackSettings` be applied to the audio sink?

We currently do not do that. `PlaybackSettings` is just for the initial
settings when the sound starts playing. This is clearly documented.

Do we want to keep this behavior, or do we want to allow users to use
`PlaybackSettings` instead of `AudioSink`/`SpatialAudioSink` to control
sounds during playback too?

I think I prefer for them to be kept separate. It is not a bad mental
model once you understand it, and it is documented.

### Should `AudioSink` and `SpatialAudioSink` be unified into a single
component type?

They provide a similar API (via the `AudioSinkPlayback` trait) and it
might be annoying for users to have to deal with both of them. The
unification could be done using an enum that is matched on internally by
the methods. Spatial audio has extra features, so this might make it
harder to access. I think we shouldn't.

### Automatic synchronization of spatial sound properties from
Transforms?

Should Bevy automatically apply changes to Transforms to spatial audio
entities? How do we distinguish between listener and emitter? Which one
does the transform represent? Where should the other one come from?

Alternatively, leave this problem for now, and address it in a future
PR. Or do nothing, and let users deal with it, as shown in the
`spatial_audio_2d` and `spatial_audio_3d` examples.

---

## Changelog

Added:
- `AudioBundle`/`SpatialAudioBundle`, add them to entities to play
sounds.

Removed:
 - The `Audio` resource.
 - `AudioOutput` is no longer `pub`.

Changed:
 - `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of assets.

## Migration Guide

// TODO: write a more detailed migration guide, after the "unsolved
questions" are answered and this PR is finalized.

Before:

```rust

/// Need to store handles somewhere
#[derive(Resource)]
struct MyMusic {
    sink: Handle<AudioSink>,
}

fn play_music(
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    audio: Res<Audio>,
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mut commands: Commands,
) {
    let weak_handle = audio.play_with_settings(
        asset_server.load("music.ogg"),
        PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5),
    );
    // upgrade to strong handle and store it
    commands.insert_resource(MyMusic {
        sink: audio_sinks.get_handle(weak_handle),
    });
}

fn toggle_pause_music(
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mymusic: Option<Res<MyMusic>>,
) {
    if let Some(mymusic) = &mymusic {
        if let Some(sink) = audio_sinks.get(&mymusic.sink) {
            sink.toggle();
        }
    }
}
```

Now:

```rust
/// Marker component for our music entity
#[derive(Component)]
struct MyMusic;

fn play_music(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
) {
    commands.spawn((
        AudioBundle::from_audio_source(asset_server.load("music.ogg"))
            .with_settings(PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5)),
        MyMusic,
    ));
}

fn toggle_pause_music(
    // `AudioSink` will be inserted by Bevy when the audio starts playing
    query_music: Query<&AudioSink, With<MyMusic>>,
) {
    if let Ok(sink) = query.get_single() {
        sink.toggle();
    }
}
```

Add text compression eval (#1356)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. ð¨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details ð

### Eval name

text_compression

### Eval description

This eval tests a model's ability to perform text compression and
decompression on diverse text strings.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Text compression and decompression typically require long-term coherent
string manipulation that language models often stumble on, and some
degree of strategic know-how in trading-off between compression and
reconstruction accuracy. Our tests indicate that current models often
fail to execute even simple abbreviation and un-abbreviation strategies,
make poor trade-offs (being too aggressive in compression), and
hallucinate their answers, leaving room for improvement. Furthermore,
this eval may reveal new emergent abilities of language models if they
are able to leverage abilities like self-consistency and introspection
to solve the eval.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details ð

### Eval name

schelling_point

### Eval description

The schelling point eval measures how well models cooperate with each
other via checking convergence on outputting the same word after being
shown reordered but otherwise same prompts. There are 4 datasets that
this eval can be run on: random_numbers, random_words, openwebtext, and
wikipedia.

add Steganography eval (#1355)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. ð¨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details ð

### Eval name

steganography

### Eval description

This eval tests a model's ability to pass secret messages in public
channels while avoiding detection.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Text steganography is a difficult challenge for human experts, requiring
creative writing, advanced string manipulation, and some degree of
strategic know-how in trading-off between undetectability and
reconstruction accuracy. Our tests indicate that current models have
some skill in this but often fail at reliable and consistent
encoding/decoding especially for long texts, leaving room for
improvement. Furthermore, this eval may reveal new emergent abilities of
language models if they are able to leverage abilities like
self-consistency and introspection to solve the eval.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

New Mech UI and equipment refactor (#77221)

![bWJlVIDO53](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/d75030b5-59e9-43f6-96b4-1b7564caceef)

## About The Pull Request

Made a new UI and refactored some mech code in the process.

Fixes #66048
Fixes #77051
Fixes #65958 ??? if it was broken
Fixes #73051 - see details below
Fixes other undocumented things, see changelog.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The UI was too bulky and Mechs were too complex for no reason. 
Now they follow some general rules shared between other SS13 machinery,
and there is less magic happening under the hood.

## Detailed Changes

### New Mech UI, Air Tank and Radio as separate modules

Previous UI for comparison:

<img alt="9SScrXAOjy"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/904e3d07-e7d7-4d3a-a062-93e0e35b4b66">

Previously mechs came with radio pre-installed and air canisters
magically pre-filled with air even when you build one in fab.
Radio and Air Tanks are now both utility modules that are optional to
install. Gas RCS thrusters still require Air Tank module to operate.

This made the Mechs more barebones when built, giving you only the basic
functionality.

<img alt="5SDMlXTJxv"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/b9364230-49ac-416b-aa70-e851fbf2050e">

To compensate this change, all mechs got two extra utility module slots.

All other modules got new UI. And ore box now shows the list of ores
inside.

<img alt="SRX5FjvsHA"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/cbe2e98d-1cd4-4667-8dae-2f9227b4b265">

### Mounted Radio

Works as a normal radio, but with subspace transmission. Available from
the basic mech research node and can be printed in fab.

### Cabin Sealing

To compensate for the lack of air tank by default, mechs with enclosed
cabin (e.g. all except Ripley) got an ability to toggle cabin exposure
to the outside air. Exiting the mech makes cabin air automatically
exposed.

When you seal the cabin, it traps some of the outside air inside the
cabin and you can breathe with this air to perform a short space trips.
But the oxygen will run out quickly and CO2 will build up.

Sealing the cabin in space will make the cabin filled with vacuum, and
it will stay there until you return to air environment and unseal the
cabin, letting the breathable air to enter. There are temperature and
pressure sensors that turn yellow/red when the corresponding warning
thresholds are reached.

You could also use personal internals in combination with cabin sealing
for long space travels, so Air Tank is completely optional now and
mostly needed when you need RCS thruster.

### RCS thrusters

They are now available earlier in tech tree and consume reasonable
amount of air (5 times more than human jetpacks), and they don't work
without Mounted Air Tank, unless it's an Ion thruster variant.

### Mounted Air Tank

Available from the basic mech research node and can be printed in fab.
Built model comes empty, and syndicate mechs come with one full of
oxygen.

<img alt="GrFDrH5Hwe"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/b677b705-bda0-4c8c-96c7-d32bf7bf9f28">

Can be switched to pressurize or not pressurize the cabin. Releases gas
only when the cabin is sealed shut. Starts releasing automatically, but
can be toggled to not release if you want to use it just as a portable
canister.

Cabin pressure can now be configured in the module UI instead of
Maintenance UI.

Can be attached to a pipe network when the mech is parked above a
connection port.

Comes with a pump that works similarly to the portable pump. It lets you
vent the air tank contents outside, or suck air from the room to fill
the air tank. Intended to provide an ability to fill the air tank
without the need to bother with pipes.

Also has gas sensors that display gas mix data of the tank and the cabin
(when sealed).

### Stock part changes

All mechs now require a servo motor and they reduce mech movement power
consumption instead of scanning module.

Scanning modules are optional for mech operation (still required to
build) and the lack of one disables the following UI elements:

- Display of mech integrity (you can still see the alerts or examine the
mech to get rough idea)
- Display of mech status on internal damage (and you can't repair what
you can't diagnose)

The rating of scanning module doesn't have any effect as of now.

Cargo mech comes without it roundstart.

<img alt="2vDtt99oqb"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/147144ca-824e-4501-acf5-6ee104f309e7">

Capacitors now also reduce light power usage and raise the overclocking
temperature thresholds (see below).

### Maintenance

Maintenance UI removed, and its logic migrated to other places.

Access modification now managed inside the mech, and anyone who can
control the mech, can adjust the access in the same way as they can set
DNA key.

To open the maintenance panel you just need a screwdriver. It is instant
when the mech is empty and it has a 5 second delay when there is an
occupant to avoid in-combat hacking and part removal. It will alert the
occupant that someone is trying to tinker with their mech.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/1abfca3c-8ba9-44b0-913c-c209564b91fd)

Once the panel is open, you can see the part ratings:


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/404f95bb-9f74-4e5b-a975-5ab6f74bdfa9)

With open panel you can hack the mech wires (roboticists can now see
them):

<img alt="mj205G2qDa"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/44cea0d1-44b4-4b50-b1d3-a97c0056bab3">

There are wires for:
- Enabling/Disabling ID and DNA locks
- Toggling mech lights
- Toggling mech circuits malfunction (battery drain, sparks) 
- Toggling mech equipment malfunction (to repair after EMP or cause
EMP-like effect, disarming mech)
- 3 dud wires that do nothing

The hacker may be shocked if the mech power cell allows.

When the panel is open and the user has access to the mech, they can
remove parts with a crowbar:

<img alt="jR40gyTWtJ"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/b573f5b9-b8ea-412e-b3e0-c872e01e0c23">

Hitting the mech with an ID from outside now toggles the ID Lock on/off
if the ID has sufficient access.

### Power consumption and overclocking

Rebalanced mech power consumption. T4 parts were not working in
Syndicate Mechs, as their effect was not calculated until you manipulate
parts manually. Constructed mechs with t1 parts even had their energy
drain reduced with upgrade to t1.

Now all mechs apply their base step power usage correctly don't ignore
the stock parts.

Servo tier now reduces base power consumption by 0% at t1, 50% at t2,
33% at t3 and 25% at t4
Capacitor tier now reduces base power consumption of mele attacks,
phasing and light by the same amounts.

Gygax leg actuators overload replaced with mech overclocking. Any mech
can be overclocked by hacking wires, but only Gygax has a button for
toggling it from the Cabin.

Now there is an overclock coefficient. 1.5 for Gygax and other mechs, 2
for Dark Gygax.

When overclocked, mechs moves N times faster, but consumes N times more
power.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/01e285fd-6fd6-4558-8277-2ed3abf474d8)

While overclocked, mech heats up every second, regardless of movement,
and starts receiving internal and integrity damage after a certain
temperature threshold. The chance is 0% at the threshold, and 100% at
thresholds * 2. The roll happens every tick. Capacitor upgrades this
threshold, letting you overclock safely for longer periods.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/80d90cea-0d20-4054-9369-a47deb6f52f2)

When you stop overclock, the temperature goes back down.

### Other changes and fixes

Concealed weapon bay now doesn't show up when you examine the mech, so
it's actually concealed now.

New radio module can properly change its frequency, as it didn't work
for previous radio.

Launcher type weapons were ignoring cooldowns and power usage, so you
could spam explosive banana peals, while they should have a 2 second
cooldown:
<img alt="q5GjUsHwGr"
src="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/3625094/d102725d-e9e1-4588-9d6c-b9e38b7a6535">

Now this is fixed and all launcher type weapons properly use power and
have their cooldowns working.
And now they have the kickback effect working (when it pushes you in the
opposite direction in zero gravity on throw).

Thermoregulator now heats/cools considering heat capacity instead of
adding/reducing flat 10 degrees. So you can heat up cabin air quicker if
the pressure is low.

There were some other sloppy mistakes in mech code, like some functions
returning too early, blocking other functionality unintentionally. Fixed
these and made some other minor changes and improvements.

## Changelog

:cl:
refactor: Refactored Mech UI
refactor: Refactored mech radio into a utility module, adding extra slot
to all mechs
refactor: Refactored mech air tank into a utility module with an air
pump, adding extra slot to all mechs
refactor: Refactored mech cabin air - there is now a button to seal or
unseal cabin to make it airtight or exchanging gases with the
environment
refactor: Removed mech maintenance UI Access is set in mech UI, and
parts are ejected with a crowbar
add: Mech now has wires and can be hacked
qol: Roboticists now can see MOD suit and mech wires
add: Mechs now require servo motor stock part and it affects movement
power usage instead of scanning module
add: Scanning module absence doesnt block mech movement and hides some
UI data instead. Big Bess starts without one.
qol: Hitting mech with ID card now toggles ID lock on/off if the card
has required access
fix: Fixed concealed weapon bay not being concealed on mech examine
fix: Fixed mech radio not changing frequency
fix: Fixed mech launcher type weapons ignoring specified cooldown
fix: Fixed mech launcher type weapons not using specified power amount
fix: Fixed mech temperature regulator ignoring gas heat capacity
fix: Fixed mech stopping processing other things while not heating
internal air
fix: Fixed mech being able to leave transit tube in transit
fix: Fixed mech internal damage flags working incorrectly
fix: Fixed Gygax leg overloading being useless
fix: Fixed mechs ignoring their stock parts on creation. Syndicate mechs
now stronger against lasers and consume less energy on move. Upgrading
from tier 1 to tier 2 doesn't make mech consume MORE energy than before
the upgrade.
balance: Rebalanced mech energy drain with part upgrades. Base energy
drain reduced by 50%, 33%, 25% with upgrades and applies to movement
(Servo rating), phasing, punching, light (Capacitor rating).
balance: Hydraulic clamp now can force open airlocks
balance: Made mech RCS pack consume reasonable amount of gas
code: Fixed some other minor bugs and made some minor changes in the
mech code

Auto merge of #11437 - y21:issue-11422, r=xFrednet

[`implied_bounds_in_impls`]: don't ICE on default generic parameter and move to nursery

Fixes #11422

This fixes two ICEs ([1](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/11422#issue-1872351763), [2](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=2901e6febb479d3bd2a74f8a5b8a9305)), and moves it to nursery for now, because this lint needs some improvements in its suggestion (see #11435, for one such example).

changelog: Moved [`implied_bounds_in_impls`] to nursery (Now allow-by-default)
[#11437](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/11437)
changelog: [`implied_bounds_in_impls`]: don't ICE on default generic parameter in supertrait clause

r? `@xFrednet` (since you reviewed my PR that added this lint, I figured it might make sense to have you review this as well since you have seen this code before. If you don't want to review this, sorry! Feel free to reroll then)

--------

As for the ICE, it's pretty complicated and very confusing imo, so I'm going to try to explain the idea here (partly for myself, too, because I've confused myself several times writing- and fixing this):
<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

The general idea behind the lint is that, if we have this function:
```rs
fn f() -> impl PartialEq<i32> + PartialOrd<i32> { 0 }
```
We want to lint the `PartialEq` bound because it's unnecessary. That exact bound is already specified in `PartialOrd<i32>`'s supertrait clause:
```rs
trait PartialOrd<Rhs>: PartialEq<Rhs> {}
//    PartialOrd<i32>: PartialEq<i32>
```

 The way it does this is in two steps:
- Go through all of the bounds in the `impl Trait` return type and collect each of the trait's supertrait bounds into a vec. We also store the generic arguments for later.
  - `PartialEq` has no supertraits, nothing to add.
  - `PartialOrd` is defined as `trait PartialOrd: PartialEq`, so add `PartialEq` to the list, as well as the generic argument(s) `<i32>`

Once we are done, we have these entries in the vec: `[(PartialEq, [i32])]`

- Go through all the bounds again, and looking for those bounds that have their trait `DefId` in the implied bounds vec.
  - `PartialEq` is in that vec. However, that is not enough, because the trait is generic. If the user wrote `impl PartialEq<String> + PartialOrd<i32>`, then `PartialOrd` clearly doesn't imply `PartialEq`. Which means, we also need to check that the generic parameters match. This is why we also collected the generic arguments in `PartialOrd<i32>`. This process of checking generic arguments is pretty complicated and is also where the two ICEs happened.

The way it checks that the generic arguments match is by comparing the generic parameters in the super trait clause:
```rs
trait PartialOrd<Rhs>: PartialEq<Rhs> {}
//                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
...this needs to match...
```rs
fn f() -> impl PartialEq<i32> + ...
//             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
In the compiler, the `Rhs` generic parameter is its own type and we cannot just compare it to `i32`. We need to "substitute" it.
Internally, `Rhs` is represented as `Rhs#1` (the number next to # represents the type parameter index. They start at 0, but 0 is "reserved" for the implicit `Self` generic parameter).

How do we go from `Rhs#1` to `i32`? Well, we know that all the generic parameters had to be substituted in the `impl ... + PartialOrd<i32>` type. So we subtract 1 from the type parameter index, giving us 0 (`Self` is not specified in that list of arguments). We use that as the index into the generic argument list `<i32>`. That's `i32`. Now we know that the supertrait clause looks like `: PartialEq<i32>`.

Then, we can compare that to what the user actually wrote on the bound that we think is being implied: `impl PartialEq<i32> + ...`.

Now to the actual bug: this whole logic doesn't take into account *default* generic parameters. Actually, `PartialOrd` is defined like this:
```rs
trait PartialOrd<Rhs = Self>: PartialEq<Rhs> {}
```
If we now have a function like this:
```rs
fn f() -> impl PartialOrd + PartialEq {}
```
that logic breaks apart... We look at the supertrait predicate `: PartialEq<Rhs>` (`Rhs` is `Rhs#1`), then take the first argument in the generic argument list `PartialEq<..>` to resolve the `Rhs`, but at this point we crash because there *is no* generic argument.
The index 0 is out of bounds. If this happens (and we even get to linting here, which could only happen if it passes typeck), it must mean that that generic parameter has a default type that is not required to be specified.

This PR changes the logic such that if we have a type parameter index that is out of bounds, it looks at the definition of the trait and check that there exists a default type that we can use instead.
So, we see `<Rhs = Self>`, and use `Self` for substitution, and end up with this predicate: `: PartialEq<Self>`. No crash this time.

XXX WIP More refactoring

This might not be XXX anymore, it seems to work!!! Amazing, this opens
up the future for extra tabs so much.

I considered something simpler than a defaultdict(bool), like a good old
int representing flags, but decided to stick with defaultdict(bool) for
two reasons:
 1. It's nicer in the debugger. "{'ini_store': True, 'mod_store': True}"
    is much more readable than "36" (1 << 2 | 1 << 4).
 2. I was concerned about the final syntax being ugly for dicts, but the
    helpers in tab_comms alleviated my worry - turns out
    defaultdict(int, {0: 1}) | defaultdict(int, {1, 0}) works and
    results in defaultdict(int, {0: 1, 1: 0}). Thanks, py3!
 3. In the future, we may want to pass more info along in
    refresh_others. For example, one could imagine an API like this in
    the (far) future:
      refresh_others=SAVES(redraw=target_saves)

Utumno: nit around typing due to comment in bain

Trait trampolines: declare `_flat_index` as uint32

This is to silence GCC when it decides to make warnings based on bad assumptions
about the values that an argument may take.

Or at least, that is what I think is going on. Original issue was reported by
@gwikland. I have not been able to create a minimal reproducer, which is why
this lacks a test.

The seemingly stochastic nature of the issue _does_ terrify me -- making me
doubt myself and wondering if the warning is actually based on a concrete usage
rather than GCC assuming something to be possible. However, based on an
inspection of the generated code and my previous experience of a similarly
stupid error (see #204) I've thoroughly convinced myself that no, GCC really
_is_ just deciding to be dumb.

Indexing features for modules (#347)

* Indexing features for modules

This commit introduces indexing for module references. It currently
will only work for files to which we have the source code, turns them
into AST and then applies one or more "extractors" on it. An extractor
runs over AST and indetifies things it's looking for, and then emits
entries, which will be used to build a searchable index.

Currently, there is one extractor implemented: Module references. This
does a fairly exhaustive search for module references, wherever
they're hiding. It then uses the aliases module to find the original
source module.

Note that most of the higher level functions are just placeholders. An
indexing strategy needs to find things inside of .exs files as well as
.ex files, and we currently have no way to index core elixir (this
will be highly dependent on how elixir was installed and if we can get
the source code to the version we're running on).

* Performance fixes / code improvements

Turns out `Aliases.at()` was super slow --especially since we called
it so much when resolving aliases during indexing. This was due to it
having to re-parse the document multiple times for each alias
reference. Moving to sourceror and allowing the AST to be sent in cut
the indexing time for lexical and all its deps from 60 seconds to 10.


* ETS based storage / Fuzzy matching

This commit has ETS based file storage and a fuzzy matching system.
I was having a lot of trouble coming up with an efficient way to perform
fuzzy matching against a corpous of subjects efficiently using the data
stores. ETS is... ets, and it appears that it's impossible to use it for
any type of detailed string matching. SQLite had similar problems. While
it had a lot more complicated and helpful utilities, it just couldn't do
what I wanted when it comes to fuzziness.

Then I thought, hey, why not just store the subjects in memory with all
the places that they appear? Then you just keep that up to date, and you
remove a lot of duplication, which improves performance a lot.

Prior to this, ETS was taking around 300ms to do simple-ish matching,
and SQLite was taking around 180ms. Fuzzy can do it in 14ms. Better yet,
building a fuzzy from scratch only takes 40ms for lexical and all its
deps. This includes doing much more interesting matching.

I think we have a winner.

M707 "Vulture" Anti-Materiel Rifle (#4253)

# About the pull request

## The M707 is not made player-accessible in this PR.

Adds the M707 "Vulture" anti-materiel rifle to the game. [Design doc
here.](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/files/12433899/M707_Final.pdf)

The M707 is meant to take the place of a heavy support weapon, not
unlike the mortar. It is a 20mm bolt-action rifle, capable of loading
from 4-round magazines. Each round does 400 damage with full AP (50),
but it is not a simple task to fire the weapon. The gun, being as
high-caliber as it is, will immediately break your arm & hand if you do
not fire it without use of the built-in bipod. In addition, its accuracy
is massively reduced below its ideal range (10 tiles), which means the
scope is necessary to be used.

The scope does not function like a regular scope. (see screenshot
section for details) Instead, it shows a 5x5 area (the rest is blacked
out) 12 tiles ahead, with an aiming reticle in the center. The aiming
reticle will drift over time within the 5x5, requiring you to re-adjust
or use the **Hold Breath** ability to temporarily stop the sway. If you
open up the scope's UI, you will be able to modify the scope and the
reticle's location, one tile at a time, very slowly.

To assist with this, the Vulture comes with a spotting scope & tripod. A
secondary user is able to assemble and use the spotting scope. The scope
is a complement to the Vulture's, allowing a communicative team to
become far more effective. The spotter's view, on use, will be locked to
the location of the Vulture scope. However, the spotter's view is not
locked to a 5x5 area, instead getting a view of the full area, on top of
an extra 2 tiles (in each direction) of view range. Finally, both the
spotter and sniper's scopes have night vision equivalent to an SG's
goggles.

The bullet itself is a powerful beast. Powerful enough to pierce walls,
people, and barricades, but with 2 caveats. The first is that every
wall/cade penetration removes 75 damage from the round, and any
cades/tables that the round passes over will be immediately destroyed by
the round. In addition, anyone in a large range will hear the report of
the rifle sound and the direction it came from.

Update as of 8/31:
Vulture and its spotter scope now require a pamphlet to use (a pamphlet
gives the trait needed to use both), guncase spawns with 2.

# Explain why it's good for the game

It's a unique weapon that encourages communication inside a team, while
simultaneously not contributing to the IFF ungaball. The weapon promotes
thoughtful gameplay and repositioning to be able to hit a target without
friendlies getting in the way or getting overrun.

Trickwines! Again! (#1914)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Trickwines are a set of new reagents aimed at improving tribal/srm style
ships
The core concept are wines crafted out of mob drops and plants that
provide a buff on drinking and a debuff on throwing with bonus effects
against fauna
To facilitate the transfer of booze to target it also adds breakaway
flasks, 50u glass bottles that shatter violently on contact providing
extra throw force as well as a 25u gulp size which forces the user to
choose between buff or debuff
I plan on adding a fair few more Trickwines and the SRM Barrel Class
Brewer Vessel (SRM could really use one then 1 original ship) in later
prs to build on this concept
This HackMD will provide descriptions for the wines as well as a place
of information for all Trickwine-related content
https://hackmd.io/eUIddN2dS3mpeU1CThFGng

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is

## Why It's Good For The Game
Adds a fun new option for ships that lack proper chemistry and forces
them to choose which effect they actually want.

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

This PR finally accomplishes the promise I made to @triplezeta a year
ago, creating a unique tileset for the server that people may enjoy!

To put every single microscopic change I have made would take forever,
so I will instead provide a series of screenshots of it in action!

Update shot_adaptive to not mutate device shots (#4599)

**Context:**
`shot_adaptive.py` would change device wires, run a QNode with the
device, then change the wires back. We can just run the QNode with
different shots without changing the device!

**Description of the Change:**
Instead of changing device shots, pass `shots=new_shots` as a kwarg to
any QNode execution.

I also removed a silly test for something hacky that users probably
should not even be able to do... it's not that hard to add
`@qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit", shots=1000))` to the top of any
function : )

**Benefits:**
- It will work on the new device API without any changes (I ran the
tests locally with DQ2, worked perfectly)
- No more unnecessary try-finally blocks
- Not mutating object properties is always cool and wise

Datatset
This dataset is obtained from Kaggle: Heart Failure Prediction Dataset
Context
Cardiovascular disease (CVDs) is the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management.
This dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict possible heart disease.
Let's train a machine learning model to assist with diagnosing this disease.
Attribute Information
Age: age of the patient [years]
Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]

Events 'n Objectives. (#4755)

* Events 'n Objectives.

Seems to have FINALLY fixed* infestation events causing mobs to go to burned outpost, spider outpost, etc.  Due to the way this fix works(by marking these areas as "maintenance" this may cause some unforeseen consequences, I have tested it about as well as I can but that's worth noting. Blame this system

Additionally, many factions had all their individual objectives returned - including the semi antag ones. Now you'll be bribed with tasty, tasty level ups in exchange for being a bastard. It goes without saying that Marshals did not get given the 'be a shithead' objectives back for reasons that should be obvious(massive access, authority, etc), if you lot want them enabled for Marshals then we can I guess consider it?

Some of these will probably have bugs and some of them may need to be tweaked or considered for removal, but overall I think they should offer some incentive for players to be a lil naughty in exchange for level ups - or not!

* more fixe

Maybe fixes the issue with hiveminds/blobs spawning in dungeons like preppers. Seems to have at least limited both to spawning on colony zees instead of sometimes popping up in preppers 'n such. They do sometimes spawn outside, still but that's ....okay, i guess.

* Ooops! remembers to actually undo a testing fchange

* gets rid of storyteller migration filtering. causes issues.

* Removes church force-convert objective.

Add ability to test a single file (#1)

You can mark a test with `.only()` in [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) but it doesn't mean only that test will run. The whole suite will still run but when it comes to that test file just the test marked as `.only()` will run in it. In our opinion, that makes it pretty pointless.

So much so the amazing @StuAA78 looked into whether he could solve it. We are VSCode users and love a [custom task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks). @StuAA78 found you can get the current file using `$relativeFile`.

```json
  {
    "label": "â Test only",
    "detail": "Run just this file's unit tests",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "npm test ${relativeFile}",
    "group": "test",
    "presentation": {
      "echo": true,
      "reveal": "always",
      "focus": true,
      "panel": "shared",
      "showReuseMessage": false,
      "clear": true
    }
  }
```

So, if you have a test file open and use this custom VSCode task, it will tell **Ava** to just run that one. Now `.only()` becomes useful again to just focus on a single test in a single file. But he didn't stop there. What happens if you don't have `*.test.js` file open in VSCode?

@StuAA78 came up with a bash script that will attempt to identify the matching test file and pass that to **Ava**.

```bash

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <filename>"
  exit 1
fi

filename="$1"

if [[ $filename != *".test."* ]]; then
  # Extract the path and file parts
  path="$(dirname "$filename")"
  file="$(basename "$filename")"

  # Replace ".js" with ".test.js" in the file part
  test_file="${file/.js/.test.js}"

  # Build the new path, replacing the first part with "test"
  path_parts=($path)
  new_path="test"
  for ((i = 1; i < ${#path_parts[@]}; i++)); do
    new_path="$new_path/${path_parts[$i]}"
  done

  # Construct the new filename
  filename="$new_path/$test_file"
fi

npm test -- $filename
```

Run that instead of `npm test ${relativeFile}` and that scenario is dealt with. Or so we hoped. It didn't seem to work in our Dockerised local environment. The part of the script that breaks up the parts never got triggered which meant everything became `test/*.test.js`. It also requires you to provide a file and to call something other than `npm test`.

Based on this inspiring solution we're making this change. Instead of bash, we're using Node. We always know that will be available as opposed to bash, which is dependent on the OS and setup. It also makes the file name manipulation easier. With these changes, you always call `npm test` to be consistent. It is just whether you add an extra arg that running just one file kicks in.

Who knows, this might inspire someone else to make an even better solution to this problem!

IdiotAI API v0.3.0 Revised

After a long time with no update on the API, v0.3 revised has been released with:
- Introducing the smaller updates. Instead of vX.X, it is now vX.X.X so if we need to make small adjustments, we can use the vX.X.X version so we don't change vX.X just for something small.
- More responses with MORE stupid.
- Website improved a LOT (including showing dev's social media pages, explaining how to get a demo of usage of the api, and link to the Revolt server).
- Version 0.3 Original has been deprecated

Revamp CI workflow to upload artifacts, cross-compile ARM64 binaries, and more (#534)

As commented in issues https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/issues/444
and https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/issues/518, there is some user
interest for distributing binaries for each unstable commit, and target
ARM64 platforms. Personally, I think both suggestions are useful for the
project, as uploading binary artifacts for each commit might help
interested users to catch regressions and give feedback earlier, and
powerful ARM64 platforms are becoming increasingly popular due to some
cloud services (e.g., Amazon EC2, Azure VMs, Oracle Cloud) offering
cheaper plans for this hardware, in addition to the well-known push for
ARM by Apple with their custom M1 chips.

These changes make the CI target ARM64 as a first-class citizen. Because
the public GitHub actions runners can only be hosted on x64 for now, I
resorted to cross-compilation, [Debian's
multiarch](https://elinux.org/images/d/d8/Multiarch_and_Why_You_Should_Care-_Running%2C_Installing_and_Crossbuilding_With_Multiple_Architectures.pdf),
and QEMU to build, get ARM64 C library dependencies, and run tests,
respectively.

When the CI workflow finishes, a release CLI binary artifact is now
uploaded, which can be downloaded from the workflow run page on the
GitHub web interface.

In addition, these changes also introduce some cleanup and miscellaneous
improvements and changes to the CI workflow:

- Tests are run using [`nextest`](https://nexte.st/) instead of `cargo
test`, which substantially speeds up their execution. (On my development
workstation, `cargo test --release` takes around 10.67 s, while `cargo
nextest run --release` takes around 6.02 s.)
- The dependencies on unmaintained `actions-rs` actions were dropped in
favor of running Cargo commands directly, or using
`giraffate/clippy-action` for pretty inline annotations for Clippy. This
gets rid of the deprecation warnings for each workflow run.
- Most CI steps are run with a nightly Rust toolchain now, which allows
to take advantage of the latest Clippy lints and codegen improvements.
In my experience, when not relying on specific nightly features or
compiler internals, Rust does a pretty good job at making it possible to
rely on a rolling-release compiler for CI, as breakage is extremely rare
and thus offset by the improved features.
- The MSRV check was moved to a separate job with less steps, so that it
takes less of a toll on total workflow run minutes.

## Pending tasks

- [x] Generate universal macOS binaries with `lipo` (i.e., containing
both `aarch64` and `x64` code)
- [x] Tirelessly fix the stupid errors that tend to happen when
deploying a new CI workflow for the first time
- [x] Think what to do with the `deploy.yml` workflow. Should it fetch
artifacts from the CI job instead of building them again?
- [x] Maybe bring back 32-bit Windows binaries. Are they actually useful
for somebody, or just a way to remember the good old days?

[MIRROR] buffs embed pulling with hemostats, allows wirecutters to pull embeds too [MDB IGNORE] (#23702)

* buffs embed pulling with hemostats, allows wirecutters to pull embeds too (#78256)

## About The Pull Request
- Wirecutters or tools with wirecutter behaviors are now valid for
plucking embeds.
- Pluck speed no longer **starts** at 2.5 seconds, which is a pretty
dang long time, especially if you have bad embed RNG. I'll do the math
and run some more tests in the morning.
- Wirecutters have a speed malus in regards to plucking embeds. I should
probably make it worse to account for, like, jaws of life or something.
- Plucking embeds with wirecutters now hurts! It hurts way less than
ripping it out with your hands, but it still hurts!

For comparison's sake, bare-handed throwing star removal compared to
possible tools.

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/31829017/96730fa5-77b8-4f31-83ba-48d36e4e419b)

## Why It's Good For The Game
Embeds kinda suck to deal with. This is intentional - I get that.

However, hemostat pulling is kind of... kind of bad. Awful, really. 2.5
seconds is a lot of time. I know it's not supposed to be the best
option, but if you've got a tool, I'd at least like to think it'd be
slightly less bad than shoving your fingers into your wound?

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Pulling embedded items e.g. shrapnel with hemostats is now a
lot faster, and scales appropriately with toolspeed.
balance: You can now pull embedded items with wirecutters, at a speed
penalty.

Adds Summon Cheese (#77778)

oh apparently this is my 100th PR on tg, which is weird because github
reports 99 total, and i made at least one to the old voidcrew repo, and
filtering tg prs by my name still shows 99. weird. here's to 100 more i
guess?

<sub>could have been better if it was a get, jhonflupwliiard watch ur
back ð« </sub>

## About The Pull Request

Adds a new spell granter book to the Wizard's Den - Summon Cheese, which
grants the spell by the same name, which summons 9 heads of cheese.
That's about it, I think.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Wizards are a hungry bunch, so why can't they just summon food? They can
even share, if they'd like, since the notion of a friendly wizard still
exists

<details>
<summary>... </summary>

alright fine
i'm slightly malding over not getting the 77777 get so no more
roleplaying in the pr body

Wizard Grand Ritual now has a hidden goal of sacrificing 50 cheese
wheels. Sacrificing a cheese wheel is done with invoking the grand rune,
and each invocation/pulse of the rune will whisk away more cheese until
all cheese on the rune is taken by whichever entity lurks in the other
realm. The sacrifice will be hinted at in an _ancient parchment_ which
will be on the bookshelf (when i add it lmao) alongside the spell book.

Meeting this cheese goal will lock the wizard's grand finale rune and
grand finale effect to special ones. The cheese rune is mostly identical
to the normal grand rune, barring the custom sprites/animations.
The cheese finale consists of the wizard getting permanent Levitation
(nogravity + free space movement), a 0.5 modifier(reducing incoming
damage in half) to every damage type, a comically strong mood buff and
**The Wabbajack**(separate sprite pending) - a juiced up chaos staff
which can fire a lot more projectiles than a normal one can (it will get
more, I may even make a few just for it).
Everybody else (including any invader antags) gets hallucinations, 175
brain damage and a comically strong mood debuff, as well as a vendetta
against the wizard. If the victim was already suffering from
hallucinations from a trauma (including the quirk), they are instead
healed.

if you didn't catch the obvious reference, this entire shtick is a
tribute to Sheogorath. the rune makes use of daedric script, and most of
the catchphrases are a direct quotation of the Daedric Prince of
Madness, so if any of those things can get us in trouble somehow, let me
know. i will be sad but i will comply.

This shtick is intended as an easter egg, really, so I wasn't really
planning on expanding the wizard grand finale into heretic paths thing
or whatever.

Oh, and finale grand runes now allow the wizard to select the effect
even if it's time-gated. If it is, you just won't be able to invoke it
until the time comes. The rune will tell you how much time is left until
you can invoke it. And grand finale runes with a finale effect selected
also glow in the color of their effect. I also think I fixed some step
of the grand rune animation not triggering but I'm not sure.

change)</summary>

ugh

- spiking is fixed
-> OnTriggerStay2D is a shit function and we shouldn't use it
-> OnTriggerEnter/Exit2D now used to set a bool value for hit range checking, then Update is used to detect spike input

- bots are OP again, sorry :3

- KO wall is sorta fixed, no longer get stuck to inner walls when holding against them
-> however, walking onto the KO floor without jumping will snap you to the arena side of the inner wall instead of the KO zone, so you'll be stuck in the arena waiting out the KO cooldown

- game end text changed from "PLAYER 1/PLAYER2" to "HOME TEAM/AWAY TEAM"

- scoring updated to work as intended; spiking below the score line gives other team a point, possessing the ball but not spiking it grants other team a point, spiking ball above score line with possession gives your team the point

- player max speed increased from 3 to 4

- hitting the ball reworked
-> ball hit direction now based on which way player is facing. ball is always hit with full hitForce value

Here are some enhancements you can make to the code:

1. Add error handling for HTTP requests: Currently, the code does not handle exceptions that may occur during HTTP requests. Add error handling using try -except blocks to catch and handle possible exceptions, such as `requests.exceptions.RequestException`. You can log the error or display an error message to the user.

2. Implement dynamic data retrieval: The code currently retrieves a random song from each lyrics website for similarity matching. Modify the code to scrape lyrics for each song from the search results instead. This will provide a more accurate comparison between the input lyrics and the searched songs.

3. Refactor lyric search results: The code currently appends search results directly to the `search_results` list. Instead, consider creating a `SearchResult` class with properties such as `title`, `artist`, and `link`. Instantiate objects of this class for each search result and then append them to the `search_results` list. This will make it easier to work with the search results and can provide flexibility for future enhancements.

4. Refactor song matching results: Similar to the search results, consider creating a `Song` class with properties such as `title`, `artist`, `lyrics`, `similarity`, and `website`. Instantiate objects of this class for each matched song, sort them by similarity, and then return the top matching songs. This will make it easier to work with the matched songs and add additional information in the future.

5. Implement user-friendly output: The code currently prints out the search results and matched songs directly to the console. Consider enhancing the output by formatting it in a more user-friendly way. For example, you can use separators between different sections, provide headers for each section, and make the output more visually appealing.

6. Implement potential extensions: Consider implementing one or more of the potential extensions mentioned in the README file, such as audio matching, sentiment analysis, recommendation system, and mobile app integration. These extensions can enhance the functionality and user experience of the Lyric Matcher.

Remember, these are just suggestions for enhancements based on the provided context. You can choose to implement some or all of them based on your requirements and preferences.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

Misc mapping fixes and QoL additions (#78176)

## About The Pull Request

fix: #78135
fix: #78059

This PR remaps Birdshot's disposals room, makes several small fixes on
Icebox and Metastation, adds cell timers to isolation cells where such
cells are present (they don't open the door, effectively just an in-game
timer) (in-cell flashes are now controlled with the timer, where
applicable); and adds translator glove modules to the stacks of
"accessibility" modules found in most security, medical, and engineering
storage rooms. (adds these stacks in their entirety to Northstar).

Specific changes are as follows:
Birdshot
- Adds a roll of package paper to the cargo office
- Translator module [med,sec]
- Accessibility modules [eng]
- Recycler remap

Delta
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timer

Icebox
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Remove duplicate hand labeler on the rack near brig cells
- Adds a hand labeler to armory desk in gear room
- Isolation cell timer

Meta
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timer
- Mends a broken corpse disposal pipe from aux surgery to the morgue

Northstar
- Accessibility modules [med,sec,eng]
- Nudges the binoculars off of the mass driver controls in ordnance
- Fixes the SM starting out hotwired (Rewires the SM room)

Tram
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timers
## Why It's Good For The Game

Bug fixes with respect to Birdshot's recycler, Meta's corpse disposal,
Northstar starting out hotwired, and Icebox's duplicated hand labeler.

Nudging Northstar's ordnance binoculars should make it a bit easier to
find the mass driver controls.

Adding some packaging paper to Birdshot to make the techs' lives a
little easier with a little less round-start fuss.

Adding a hand labeler to Icebox's gear room brings it in line with other
maps in terms of rounds-start gear and locker labeling potential.

For players with characters running the Mute/Signer quirks, stock
MODsuits are a pain to use. Suit gauntlets will replace their translator
gloves. Unless they're able to get a suit put together ahead of time,
they'll be stuck doing the retract gauntlets > send radio message >
Extend Gauntlets shuffle. Adding a translator glove module to the stack
of similar items (plasma fixation module / therma regulator) should
alleviate that issue some.

Getting abandoned in an isolation cell sucks, and setting timers on your
phone or some such is a hassle. Adding cell timers to isolation cells
should go some way to alleviating those frustrations.

Not-yet-ideal example of how to craft the replacement inside of the matcher.

A lot of times, when building matchers, the fact that "what to match" is separated from "what to replace it with" makes it really annoying to craft. A trivial example is anything recursive, really -- rather than building up some absurd combinator thingy, sometimes you just want to walk the AST. Architecturally, Refex actively does not want you to do this. It expects totally separated matchers and replacements. And isn't that... silly?

This change is one step towards that: it really stupidly glues in a place for the matcher to emit its desired replacement.

After this change, it should be pretty straightforward to write matchers by hand which emit their own replacements. Sure, the replacement template and the match template are still separated -- but the replacement template becomes "replace this thing with a variable that it bound to its desired replacement".

---

Future work:

* Make the syntax nicer? There's still a whole lot of gluing together random crap nobody cares about.
* Allow safety checks -- right now, this only works with ShTemplate.
* Add a good error message for what happens when you *don't* use ShTemplate.
* Document this.

---

Far future work:

The fact that "what to match" and "what to replace it with" are specified so far apart has consistently been annoying. I think, going along with this kind of change, we might be able to establish that there is fundamentally no reason they have to be separate: maybe passing `--sub=...` on the command line is actually equivalent to syntax sugar which adds some stuff to the matcher.

So maybe the whole thing should be re-architected so that replacements are *always* specified in the matcher, and there's no second templating layer.

Or maybe not -- like I said, the fact that we can do this kind of change means it really doesn't matter either way, as long as we complete the hookup.

Since I have not been as active as I'd like working on Refex, this remains a bit speculative for now.

Matcher-specified replacements.

There's now only a few more steps left before we can make `refex fix` fast:

1) *ALL* metadata for a Substitution is generated solely from the `replacements` in find_dicts_parsed. This means, for example, that a matcher can specify (inside of a matcher) things like whether the fix will be significant, or what the description of the fix shall be.
   At first I thought this was a horrible hack, useful only to make `replacements` an easy interchange medium in the searcher -- and okay, maybe it is, and ideally we'd be dealing in Substitution objects -- but the more I think of it, the happier I am with it. This allows a lot of really cool stuff, such as using bits of the matched file in describing the change. It's also thematically consistent with making the replacements matcher-specified: if we make EVERYTHING matcher-specified, then everything about this line of attack that was convenient for search/replace is also convenient for descriptions of said search-replace.
2) we need to change the grouped fixers to all be one giant `AnyOf` that has these paired match/replaces inside it, and
3) (optional) change `AnyOf` to only run the submatchers it knows can match based on type filtering.
4) (optional) change the fixers to be more precise about their type metadata, to improve the filtering in (1) and (2)

Currently `AnyOf` is a bit all-or-nothing, but we can improve on that.

You can do revival surgery on Ian (#78288)

## About The Pull Request

Allows you to perform revival surgery on any mob which is organic or
looks humanoid.
This means yes: Corgis, Goliaths, ~~Syndicate mobs~~ not those because
they spawn human corpses and delete themselves.
No: Slimes, Ghosts, General Beepsky.

Splits revival surgery into a subtype used for "mobs" and a subtype for
"mobs with brains" as the former don't have any brains to damage.

Additionally by special request, Ian can now wear an eyepatch and will
automatically put one on if he is brought back from death.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Currently you revive dead pets either by creating a magical reagent out
of holy water or by buying a mining item which also brainwashes them,
however reasonably our skilled medical team should be able to put a dog
back together and now can.
When you fuck up one of the stages of Tend Wounds on a kitten and stab
it to death with your scalpel, now you can fix it.
Expands the possibilities of vetinerary roleplay.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Many kinds of mobs can now be brought back to life through revival
surgery.
add: Dogs can wear eyepatches.

Added my shitty weapon upgrade system

Yep that was hell to make :D
And the reason why, was because i for some reason had a hard time trying to wrap my head around how the code should be structured.
As you can CLEARLY SEE, i'm not used to making this, but hey... you got to learn somehow -__-
Oh and i also added some UI, but very shitty UI...
Will fix later tho :D

Funny clown internals (#77963)

# About The Pull Request
This PR changes the internals that spawn inside the clown's survival box
for a new one with a rainbow sprite, higher O2 volume (same as the engi
ones) and a secondary gas on top of O2 to make things more interesting
for the clowns.
The gas options are:
BZ, which just adds hallucinations for the clown, without the brain
damage effect as it is in low percentages.
N2O will make the clown giggle and laugh, without the sleep.
Helium will give the clown a "funny voice".

These tanks are also added to the mail list of clown fans and the clown
costume crate at cargo.

And codersprites, I can polish them later if people think it is pixel
soup, I'm not happy with them that much, but making this looks good
might be above my paygrade...

## Why It's Good For The Game
The main goal I have with this is to add more uses for Atmos Content to
other players in a flavorful way.
Atmos is not something the crew interacts in a positive way often and I
want to change that.

These tanks are something quite minor but flavorful IMO, also will make
people know Helium fucking exists...

The tanks *shouldn't* change much of the clown's round in a negative
way, and the default O2 internals are in every hallway's locker so even
if they don't want to deal with the hallucinations it is not a big deal
to dodge them.
## Changelog
:cl: Guillaume Prata
add: New funny internals for the clowns to spawn with. They come with O2
and a secondary gas between 3 options: BZ, Helium and N2O. Talk with a
"different tone" with Helium, giggle and laugh "uncontrollably" while
under the minor effects of N2O or have "fun" hallucinations while under
the minor effects of BZ.
balance: To not cut on how long the clown's O2 internals last due to the
mixed gases, the funny internals have 50% more gas volume, same as
engineers' internals.

Super reactor, got suck into the void, srry

Ohhh boy, this super PR
- Migrates all the components into functional components
- Migrates the whole project to Typescript (not enforced, but embraced to ease some things)
- Migrates the scoreboard into a functional component (OMG)
- Extracts the logic from Scoreboard into ScoreboardDirector
- Adds support for partial scoring and custom penalties (given the refactorization it was super easier this time vs last time)

JSON examples to validate that it works as intended:

xfs: reserve less log space when recovering log intent items

Wengang Wang reports that a customer's system was running a number of
truncate operations on a filesystem with a very small log.  Contention
on the reserve heads lead to other threads stalling on smaller updates
(e.g.  mtime updates) long enough to result in the node being rebooted
on account of the lack of responsivenes.  The node failed to recover
because log recovery of an EFI became stuck waiting for a grant of
reserve space.  From Wengang's report:

"For the file deletion, log bytes are reserved basing on
xfs_mount->tr_itruncate which is:

    tr_logres = 175488,
    tr_logcount = 2,
    tr_logflags = XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES,

"You see it's a permanent log reservation with two log operations (two
transactions in rolling mode).  After calculation (xlog_calc_unit_res()
adds space for various log headers), the final log space needed per
transaction changes from  175488 to 180208 bytes.  So the total log
space needed is 360416 bytes (180208 * 2).  [That quantity] of log space
(360416 bytes) needs to be reserved for both run time inode removing
(xfs_inactive_truncate()) and EFI recover (xfs_efi_item_recover())."

In other words, runtime pre-reserves 360K of space in anticipation of
running a chain of two transactions in which each transaction gets a
180K reservation.

Now that we've allocated the transaction, we delete the bmap mapping,
log an EFI to free the space, and roll the transaction as part of
finishing the deferops chain.  Rolling creates a new xfs_trans which
shares its ticket with the old transaction.  Next, xfs_trans_roll calls
__xfs_trans_commit with regrant == true, which calls xlog_cil_commit
with the same regrant parameter.

xlog_cil_commit calls xfs_log_ticket_regrant, which decrements t_cnt and
subtracts t_curr_res from the reservation and write heads.

If the filesystem is fresh and the first transaction only used (say)
20K, then t_curr_res will be 160K, and we give that much reservation
back to the reservation head.  Or if the file is really fragmented and
the first transaction actually uses 170K, then t_curr_res will be 10K,
and that's what we give back to the reservation.

Having done that, we're now headed into the second transaction with an
EFI and 180K of reservation.  Other threads apparently consumed all the
reservation for smaller transactions, such as timestamp updates.

Now let's say the first transaction gets written to disk and we crash
without ever completing the second transaction.  Now we remount the fs,
log recovery finds the unfinished EFI, and calls xfs_efi_recover to
finish the EFI.  However, xfs_efi_recover starts a new tr_itruncate
tranasction, which asks for 360K log reservation.  This is a lot more
than the 180K that we had reserved at the time of the crash.  If the
first EFI to be recovered is also pinning the tail of the log, we will
be unable to free any space in the log, and recovery livelocks.

Wengang confirmed this:

"Now we have the second transaction which has 180208 log bytes reserved
too. The second transaction is supposed to process intents including
extent freeing.  With my hacking patch, I blocked the extent freeing 5
hours. So in that 5 hours, 180208 (NOT 360416) log bytes are reserved.

"With my test case, other transactions (update timestamps) then happen.
As my hacking patch pins the journal tail, those timestamp-updating
transactions finally use up (almost) all the left available log space
(in memory in on disk).  And finally the on disk (and in memory)
available log space goes down near to 180208 bytes.  Those 180208 bytes
are reserved by [the] second (extent-free) transaction [in the chain]."

Wengang and I noticed that EFI recovery starts a transaction, completes
one step of the chain, and commits the transaction without completing
any other steps of the chain.  Those subsequent steps are completed by
xlog_finish_defer_ops, which allocates yet another transaction to
finish the rest of the chain.  That transaction gets the same tr_logres
as the head transaction, but with tr_logcount = 1 to force regranting
with every roll to avoid livelocks.

In other words, we already figured this out in commit 929b92f64048d
("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction
reservation"), but should have applied that logic to each intent item's
recovery function.  For Wengang's case, the xfs_trans_alloc call in the
EFI recovery function should only be asking for a single transaction's
worth of log reservation -- 180K, not 360K.

Quoting Wengang again:

"With log recovery, during EFI recovery, we use tr_itruncate again to
reserve two transactions that needs 360416 log bytes.  Reserving 360416
bytes fails [stalls] because we now only have about 180208 available.

"Actually during the EFI recover, we only need one transaction to free
the extents just like the 2nd transaction at RUNTIME.  So it only needs
to reserve 180208 rather than 360416 bytes.  We have (a bit) more than
180208 available log bytes on disk, so [if we decrease the reservation
to 180K] the reservation goes and the recovery [finishes].  That is to
say: we can fix the log recover part to fix the issue. We can introduce
a new xfs_trans_res xfs_mount->tr_ext_free

{
  tr_logres = 175488,
  tr_logcount = 0,
  tr_logflags = 0,
}

"and use tr_ext_free instead of tr_itruncate in EFI recover."

However, I don't think it quite makes sense to create an entirely new
transaction reservation type to handle single-stepping during log
recovery.  Instead, we should copy the transaction reservation
information in the xfs_mount, change tr_logcount to 1, and pass that
into xfs_trans_alloc.  We know this won't risk changing the min log size
computation since we always ask for a fraction of the reservation for
all known transaction types.

This looks like it's been lurking in the codebase since commit
3d3c8b5222b92, which changed the xfs_trans_reserve call in
xlog_recover_process_efi to use the tr_logcount in tr_itruncate.
That changed the EFI recovery transaction from making a
non-XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for one transaction's worth of log
space to a XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for two transactions worth.

Fixes: 3d3c8b5222b92 ("xfs: refactor xfs_trans_reserve() interface")
Complements: 929b92f64048d ("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction reservation")
