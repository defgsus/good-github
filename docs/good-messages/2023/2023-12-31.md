Puts all traits in the globalvars file + CI Testing (#79642)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #76349

I didn't know that people needed to add any new traits to a global list
so they can be easily read in View Variables, and was pretty shocked to
find out many other people didn't know it was a thing. Let's make it a
thing by testing it using a new CI Python Linter to check this. But oh
no-


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/c093f1a8-00ce-40a6-8e1d-f344107ce7b8)

There were about 200+ missing traits. Alright, so let's do the
following:

* Move trait defines to their own dedicated folder in the `_DEFINES`
folder.
* Split up the traits mega-file into different files, for better
organization. One for the macros, one for the sources, and a few for the
"trait declarations"
* Run the linter a load of times and add everything to the globalvars
file, removing anything that's no longer used and figuring out where the
best categorization of it is. also minor code improvements. also rename
all of the ones that look weird. also fix list indentations
* Also alphabetize the lists because it's easy
* Move everything to a new `traits_by_type` list, while keeping the
admin one the way it is for the time being while we figure out a better
way to show that list to admins.
* Profit
## Why It's Good For The Game

Mapping trait injectors will now work for any type of trait. You
shouldn't add any trait via this injector though, but you're no longer
limited to coders remembering to add it to that critical list you
needed.

Lays the framework for a better view variables experience. This work is
too lengthy to presently do, but hopefully we can get this done sooner
rather than later. we will need a code-accessible way to view these
traits for such a framework to be implemented, so let's just do that.

Future steps are to break down the mega-declarations file into a folder
full of separate files by typepath, but that requires a lot of auditing.
Does need to happen one day though, there's a lot of mob traits mingled
with datum traits and auuugh we gotta do this later this PR is already
massive.

there's probably ways to game this but this catches _my_ mistakes so
good luck to everyone else (it should work for 99% of everyone)
## Changelog

Nothing applicable to players. However, to mappers, the mapping trait
injector should always be able to add any kind of trait (which is rather
good for the times when you need it).

The Inversenning : Superior Healing Medications (#79342)

Introducing new inverse reagents for existing superior healing
medications! This push includes...

**Benzoic Acid** : Inverse of Salicylic Acid. Robust fertilizer that
provides a decent range of benefits for plant life.

**Oxymetholone** : Inverse of Oxandrolone. Anabolic steroid that
promotes the growth of muscle during and after exercise.

**Bamethan** : Inverse of Salbutamol. Blood thinner that drastically
increases the chance of receiving bleeding wounds.

**Pendetide** : Inverse of Pentetic Acid. An unusual bioradioactive drug
that purges basic radiation healing chems. Also increases the severity
of radiation poisoning.

**Hyoscyamine** : Inverse of Atropine. Heals heart and stomach damage,
and slowly removes minor toxin damage.

**Ammoniated Sludge** : Inverse of Ammoniated Mercury. A ghastly looking
mess of mercury by-product which causes bursts of manic hysteria.

**Inreziniver** : Inverse of Rezadone. Makes the user horribly afraid of
all things related to carps.

This is an effort to add more variety to the existing inverse reagent
system within chemistry. Not only should this variety serve to provide
additional options for a Chemist to experiment with, they should also
broaden the possibilities for already existing strategies.

Delamination variants are now locked in after the countdown is reached (#80324)

## About The Pull Request

Does what it says on the tin.
## Why It's Good For The Game

This effectively changes one and only one thing: 

The "All Within Theoretical Limits" achievement is easier/fairer to get
with this. Previously, if you edged a crystal with the gas composition
method to get a resonance cascade, you had to make sure that your gas
composition stayed until it left the explosion point, which made the
achievement extremely finnicky and unfun to get this way. Regular
delaminations won't really be affected, because yeah. It's at the
explosion point. What are you going to do about it?

This makes the achievement easier to cheese, but honestly, in my opinion
as person who added the achievement, meh. If people feel like this isn't
good for the achievement, say something in the comments.

Closes #79528

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Delamination variants no longer change once the explosion point
has been reached.

Format all Markdown files with `dprint` (#1157)

This is the result of running `dprint fmt` after removing `src/` from
the list of excluded directories.

This also reformats the Rust code: we might want to tweak this a bit in
the future since some of the changes removes the hand-formatting. Of
course, this formatting can be seen as a mis-feature, so maybe this is
good overall.

Thanks to mdbook-i18n-helpers 0.2, the POT file is nearly unchanged
after this, meaning that all existing translations remain valid! A few
messages were changed because of stray whitespace characters:

     msgid ""
     "Slices always borrow from another object. In this example, `a` has to remain "
    -"'alive' (in scope) for at least as long as our slice. "
    +"'alive' (in scope) for at least as long as our slice."
     msgstr ""

The formatting is enforced in CI and we will have to see how annoying
this is in practice for the many contributors. If it becomes annoying,
we should look into fixing dprint/check#11 so that `dprint` can annotate
the lines that need fixing directly, then I think we can consider more
strict formatting checks.

I added more customization to `rustfmt.toml`. This is to better emulate
the dense style used in the course:

- `max_width = 85` allows lines to take up the full width available in
our code blocks (when taking margins and the line numbers into account).
- `wrap_comments = true` ensures that we don't show very long comments
in the code examples. I edited some comments to shorten them and avoid
unnecessary line breaks — please trim other unnecessarily long comments
when you see them! Remember we're writing code for slides :smile:
- `use_small_heuristics = "Max"` allows for things like struct literals
and if-statements to take up the full line width configured above.

The formatting settings apply to all our Rust code right now — I think
we could improve this with https://github.com/dprint/dprint/issues/711
which lets us add per-directory `dprint` configuration files. However,
the `inherit: true` setting is not yet implemented (as far as I can
tell), so a nested configuration file will have to copy most or all of
the top-level file.

[MIRROR] Refactor icemoon wolves into basic mobs and add taming + pack behavior [MDB IGNORE] (#25126)

* Refactor icemoon wolves into basic mobs and add taming + pack behavior (#79736)

## About The Pull Request

Ports icemoon wolves over to the basic mob framework with a bit of extra
stuff:

- Wolves call for help when attacked within a decently large radius.
Because you know, pack animals.
- Wolves can now be tamed with a slab of meat
- When tamed, wolves can be ridden like goliath mounts. Ride wolf, life
good. Pretend you're playing ARK and start shivering to death in thatch
huts for that High Roleplay experience.
- Tamed wolves have access to a bunch of pet commands (following, point
fetching, point attacking, play dead, etc) and will also defend their
owners vehemently if they're attacked.

You can probably tame multiple if you wanted to.

## Why It's Good For The Game

What part about riding wolves isn't entertaining? I don't really play
/tg/ that much so I can't argue too much about the balance implications
this might pose, but it's undoubtedly a stupid little gimmick and is
likely to be used by bored assistants and miners with too much time on
their hands.

Especially robust individuals will probably find a million things to do
with a basic mob capable of fetching, attacking on command and generally
being able to defend themselves decently well.

## Changelog

:cl: yooriss
refactor: Icemoon wolves now use the basic mob framework and should act
more intelligently, defending their pack.
add: Icemoon wolves can be tamed with slabs of meat and can be ridden as
mounts once friendly. Being rather large dogs, they also have access to
most of the pet commands you'd expect, such as fetching things, and
violently mauling people their owners point at.

OK SMARTASS INTERPRETER JUST HAVE IT ALL
OH THIS IS MISSING OH THAT IS MISSING WHO FUCKING CARES JUST COMPILE IT ANYWAYS AND IGNORE THE ONE GODDAMN MISSING FUNCTION UNTIL I COMMIT THE CODE
People be like "oh just use branches" "just commit a bit at a time" I TRY THAT AND THIS SHIT IS WHAT FUCKING HAPPENS
build failed build fauileldd sdfbsfogdiuhaeraipiz[p
It just leads to build failures
So when people tell me to use branches to confuse my code or make more """""organized""""" commits I link them to this message. Yes I'm tilted
Let's see Gradle fail this one too because it likes to be an asshole

- Add soul fire gen through WorldGenSoulFire and apply it to NetherChunkProvider, so soul fire appears on soul soil when enabled
- Due to failures with forge's custom item entity system, it has been removed and replaced with a mixin. Bugs include custom item-entities jittering when first spawned in and /give not dispensing the item into the player's inventory. It's clear the custom item entity system was NOT thoroughly tested by Forge. Old uninflammable items that exist in the world will be converted to the regular item entities automatically.
  - A system to add/remove items via the config or mod code will be added in the future, as well as adjusting their buoyancy
 - Add a biome list helper function to Utils.java, to make it easier to create biome lists with certain blacklists

vox shenanigans

## technobabble
anyway so getting the shitty project running took me 80 hours or so over
many attempts but
the linked fork has less of that poetry python bullshit
just dont install python3.6 its pointless, install python3
anyway so run sudo python3 setup.py
follow instructions till it actually works
generate.sh will not work well so just run "sudo python3 create.py"
directly
also you could just skip the sudo part by just running sudo -i before
all that
create.py will create both voices for vox_masc and vox_fem for some
reason but you could avoid that by removing masc or whatever the fuck
the sex is called from create.py to save some time by doing fem solely
also you should set codebase to tg in codebase.yaml and replace
tglist.jinja2 in templates with this
```
GLOBAL_LIST_INIT(vox_sounds, list(
  {%- for sex, phrases in SEXES.items() %}
    {%- for phrase in phrases %}
"{{- phrase.id -}}" = 'sound/vox_fem/{{- phrase.id -}}.ogg',
    {%- endfor %}
  {%- endfor %}
))
```
which should create roughly correct code for tg but you still need to do
some text work
like removing duplicates n stuff and moving sounds from dist/sounds to
the actual proper sound folder

anyway thank you for coming to my rant

## Changelog
:cl:
add: 69(roughly?) new vox phrases

All Star

Somebody once told me
The world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an L on her forehead

Well, the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart
But your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now
But wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water is getting warm
So you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it
And I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked
Could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said: Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart
But your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all star

Add selenium so we can do full JS browser testing

problem
--------

Running full e2e tests now that we're doing more react is important.  We
need our browser to have JS support.  But the current Capybara setup
just uses the `rack_test` driver which does not have JS support.

solution
--------

This PR introduces selenium and webdrivers gems and sets up capybara so
that we can tag certain tests with `type: :e2e` and they will run
selenium and a browser.  It also includes support for headed or headless
chrome for testing.  By default it's headed for development so we'll see
the tests run.  If this turns out to be too annoying we can switch it
later.

changes
------

* add e2e spec around editable content for events/cms entries
* split css and js entries
* move from `thin` to `puma`
* add tests controller and sample data create/delete endpoints
* revamp admin js and application js so that they were correct for our
  test runner
* reinstate content block edits and fix that so it works.

notes
------

I spent a lot of time trying to get the database transaction issue
figured out with no luck.  The basic issue is that in the rspec example
or it block, if you use factory bot to create database entries, that
data is in a transaction which is separate from the db connection that
the app is using which means the application does *not* see that
creation.  Rspec-Rails and some other rails stuff has tooling to get
around this but I was unable to figure out how to leverage that here or
mimic it.

Because of this, I added a tests_controllers.rb file and a
`tests/sample_data` endpoint that *only* works if you're in test mode
(for safety).

When we write e2e tests we should populate this sample data such that it
is a valid start up scenario for *all* e2e tests.  We can think of it as
a set of seed data for a test instance of the application.  Currently,
we're going to start with 1 active event and 2 cms entries for the two
pages that show custom cms content.  I could imagine a default
"exclusion" item... in the future.

It's not great but it's better than not having full feature e2e tests.

Exercise for the author and reader
-------------------

I don't understand `@use` vs `@import` in SCSS and I feel like I should.

A lot of changes

Organization, implemented the Y, and improved the movement controller.

BUGS/MISSING FEATURES SO FAR THAT I HAVE FOUND: Keyhole animation breaks when you press play (maybe we can make it so you can't press play when the keyhole animation is running), movement controller is still pretty bad, hole item on canvas goes out of frame, no Y item texture (using brick as placeholder), no play button without Y texture, no Y texture to go on top of that texture (using brick as placeholder) (note: I have a solution for the no y on door texture), and maybe we could make the parts of the play button falling a little more random with animation which also would make the hole not go offscreen (and they also fall differently if you pause while they are falling).

Also Adrian had an idea of "skeletons in the closet" for like a bedroom or something with a closet but one of the bones of the skeleton is a "skeleton key" which opens a door (but it gets used up). I also thought that maybe we could do hint messages appearing if you spend a while on a puzzle (that can be turned on and are off by default or maybe the opposite of that). For example:

A while on pause puzzle: "Think outside of the box"
Even longer on pause puzzle (it will have already told you the controls earlier: "Remember: Esc to pause"
Even longer on pause puzzle: "Esc to go outside of the box"
Way too long on pause puzzle (for other ones would also just give the solution): "Go into the pause menu and try to move around after a second to complete the puzzle"

I think either that or just a hint section of the menu would be good.

Also Adrian played through it and said that the Y puzzle was really hard because of all of the different symbols in the logo so we should definitely add hints for that.

Sorry this is so long but one last thing I think there could be like a piece of paper somewhere with a code that you dial into the phone and press the # then the screen turns on and it shows an easter egg.

PEP 695 `type` aliases x 9.

This commit is the next in a commit chain adding support for PEP
695-compliant type aliases (i.e., type hints instantiated by statements
of the form ``type {alias_name} = {alias_value}``, available under
Python ≥ 3.12), en-route to resolving feature request #297 kindly

# OOPS

I forgot to commit changes to tgstation.dme. So while the files are now
in the code... they're not enabled. Oops.

## About The Pull Request

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

I didn't notice some more minor changes in the testmerge. This rectifies
some of that - new vars, and such. After I fix the new bugs inherent to
this... Which have now been fixed. ~~Although the current version should
still be functional, teshari cybernetic limbs take approximately 10%
more damage than they should due to the missing var. I think. The var is
weird, and honestly seems to be a redundancy? better safe than sorry.~~
This PR actually enables the previous PR and fixes some things which
would have caused minor statistical inconsistencies on the scale of
+-1-5 damage taken.
### Advanced Raptor limbs
Oh, also advanced cybernetic limbs were implemented since the downstream
made them obtainable. They're a bit brighter than the regular limbs.

UPSTREAM: sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

[MIRROR] Touches up Moffuchi's pizzeria  [MDB IGNORE] (#25246)

* Touches up Moffuchi's pizzeria  (#79899)

## About The Pull Request
I've given the icebox pizzeria ruin a few small improvements:
- Firstly, The kitchen is actually stocked with tomatoes from the get
go. Along with a few mothic themed ingredients for those signature
mothic pizzas we all know and love (And hate for being such a pain to
make)
- The discarded air alarm frames have been replaced with working ones
(I'm unsure if this was intentional or not)
- Some drinking glasses have been added to the bar
- And finally a pacman has been placed in the backroom along with some
plasma to power the place
## Why It's Good For The Game
This place gets overlooked a lot because its completely powerless, and
doesn't actually give you enough from the get go to make even a basic
pizza besides the tomato seeds a lot of people are gonna miss. This
gives the ruin just a little more life to maybe be worth trekking out
for. And having mothic themed ingredients in the **MOFFIC** Pizzeria
just makes sense even if they are a bitch to make.

Not sure if this counts as a balance change or a QOL so feel free to
yell at me if I've labelled this wrong, I have been advised that this
SHOULD be the latter at least.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: Mothuchi's pizzeria has been improved slightly! Order yourself a
fresh mothic pizza today!

Makefile.lib: Lower kernel gzip compression to fastest

You're reading this - so you're trying to understand "JUST WHY OMG".
That's already a good step.

First of all, this is a downstream kernel - always keep that in mind!
Now, this kernel is targeting new *very powerful* Qualcomm platforms
like SM8250 and the Sony Edo platform - which has a very fast UFS card.

Keep in mind that the bootloader sets the CPU at a frequency that is
slightly faster than the "in the middle" ones, which is anyway not
veeeery fast - but that's good, really. I agree.

So.. check this out:   for Image.gz-dtb.....
COMP_LEVEL    SIZE
9             20116171
5      	      20220479
2      	      20940223
1      	      21231290

Remember again that we're loading from a UFS card and that
we are loading ~1.1MB more out of a 20MB file.
If you're smart enough you surely know already about RAM and CPU
overhead of very high compression levels.

If you still disagree with what I just did, read this commit description
another 20 times, or more, until you understand it. :)))

Nerfs legion core implanting to not be an aheal (#2590)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
The legion core implant now gives you a potent heal of all four damage
types (-100 brute -100 burn -50 tox -50 oxy) instead of a literal aheal.
It now also deals 10 clone damage as a drawback to organics/FBPS (IPCS
excluded because they cant use clone damage medicine).
Due to how adjustBruteLoss and adjustBurnLoss work, the implanted core
no longer heals mechanical bodyparts, making it mostly useless for IPCs
and FBPs only healing oxygen and toxin damage.

## Why It's Good For The Game
1. Player accessible aheals are not good and encourage exploiting to
cure ailments or gain an advantage.
2. Synthetics could use self-surgery to implant legion cores on the go
for a safety net heal. While not necessarily bad, it was insanely
powerful as an aheal and negated the requirement of stabilizing the core
and getting another person to put it in you.
3. It had literally no drawbacks. A strong consumable healing ability is
cool, but it should come with a cost.

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: legion core implanting no longer aheals you on use
add: legion core implant now just does a potent organic heal with minor

The team was quite busy working on new engines and enhancing existing ones. The list of supported games grew noticeably, and we now support these additions:

Adibou 1
Classical Cats
The Dark Eye
Dark Side
Escape From Hell
Gadget: Invention Travel and Adventure
Gobliiins 5
The Excavation of Hob's Barrow
Kingdom: The Far Reaches
Might and Magic Book One
Muppet Treasure Island
Nancy Drew: The Final Scene
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill
Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger
Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower
Primordia
Reah: Face the Unknown
Schizm: Mysterious Journey
Shardlight
Strangeland
Syberia and Syberia II (macOS versions only)
Technobabylon
The Vampire Diaries
Whispers of a Machine
Wrath of the Gods and four other Director titles.
14 AGS titles by Stranga and Cloak and Dagger
All together, we’ve introduced 50 new games and five new engines.

New platforms

We are happy to see the RetroArch port being properly rewritten, and the port is now part of our source code. The Atari port has also been redone from scratch and now talks natively to the hardware, skipping SDL as an intermediate layer. That made many more games playable on the platform. The Atari FireBee port is still using the SDL library, though.

Speed-optimized graphics

Thanks to the work of one of the GSoC participants this year, Wyatt Radkiewicz (a.k.a. eklipsed), we now use CPU-specific SIMD instructions such as SSE, AVX2, and NEON for drawing graphics in the AGS engine and in some generic routines. This led to 4-14x speedup in drawing for many cases.

Networking games

This year, we merged with the Backyard Sports Online project, which made it possible to play Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001 and Backyard Football 2002 over the internet with other humans. Also, the Moonbase Commander support is in active playtesting mode, though not yet ready for prime time.

Notable engine enhancements

The AGS engine has been brought up to version 3.6.0.53 from upstream.

For many engines, we added support for numerous Chinese and Japanese game variants.

Believe it or not, we implemented a lot of native GUI dialogs for SCUMM games, bringing them closer to the original experience. We also rewrote the sound code for the SCUMM Humongous Entertainment games, making them flawless.

We performed a deep review of the Broken Sword 1 game engine, implementing some small, previously unnoticed things like scene transitions, in-game menu peculiarities, accurate fonts, idle animations, and more. Now, the game is absolutely faithful to the original.

This thing is what you show people to make the write functional code...

Maneged to pass the start and end dates to the statistics components, but had its own pandora's box abd came with the problem that I had to call the events function twice.

Thinking to pass the events data to statics comp, but that would mean having to calculate the statics in the "front", not that there really is a front, so maybe that isn't a problem.

 Just want to get this over with so i never have to touch electron again.

 "Why should this Electron be saved? Doesn't it seem profoundly sick? Diseased? Like PWA has to be better, purely by the virtue that this is awful."

Add Readme, License and CI.

It's not because I'm working alone on this that I should work as a
savage. I thought it will be fun to integrate the linting steps as
reviews from the github action bot (Yeah, I know it might not sound
fun but it is !).

Got a MetaQuest 3 for Christmas from my insanely crazy wife. Guess
that this project will take another slow down because I'll try to
create a commercial game with it.

Add atmos roadmap (#78)

# Roadmap For Atmospherics

## Background

Most atmos players currently agree that atmos is not very fun to play,
for some of the following reasons:

1. There is little content to play after round-start setup. Part of the
problem is that things like distro and TEG are "set up and forget".

2. Atmos can't actually rectify atmos problems in a reasonable amount of
time. For example, if there actually is a plasma leak, scrubbers
typically work too slowly resulting in the plasma inevitably being lit
before it can be cleaned up.

3. Atmos techs don't play with the rest of the station, preferring to
isolate themselves to produce a funny green gas that is only
particularly useful for shuttle bombing. Mechanics like this violate the
[fundamental design
principles](en/general-development/feature-proposals/ss14-fundamental-design-principles.md).
While these mechanics shouldn't be removed per-se, more focus should be
given to mechanics that increase interactions with the station, like
making sure the air is breathable and well-heated.

## Proposal

Make atmos more fun to play by adding more challenges and processes
semi-inspired by real life.

**An atmos tech's primary job is to keep the station livable and
breathable.** There are a lot of interesting real life challenges
associated with making this happen, not in the least of which is that in
space, every gas molecule wants desperately to escape into the cold of
space. There is also the challenge of keeping the station appropriately
temperature-regulated despite the cold outside and occasional plasma
fires inside.

Where it does not conflict with fun (see below), **incorporate realistic
processes and simulations**. As stated in the [fundamental design
principles](en/general-development/feature-proposals/ss14-fundamental-design-principles.md),
intuitive simulation makes for a better game. Having real-life analogs
for gas behaviors helps make both atmos more discoverable and intuitive
for new players and also caters to atmos nerds.

None of these realism additions require any sort of math to play. Only a
basic understanding of the following principles should be enough to
understand and play:

1. You should not be able to spin energy out of thin air.
2. When given a choice, gas flows from high pressure to low pressure.
3. When given a choice, temperature transfers from hot to cold.

### An Interlude on Realism

The chief objective of a game is to be fun to play, and not to be
realistic. Where realism conflicts with fun, fun should be chosen every
time.

**However,** games are most fun when players have a sense of agency
(their actions matter in determining the final outcome of the game) and
when their challenges are struggles are believable.

In order for players' challenges and struggles to be believable, the
game universe must obey a consistent system of rules and physical
limitations. It would not be fun if players have a way to *deux ex
machina* out of every imaginable problem (e.g. Nukies? Why don't we use
the magical remote control that makes all the nukies disappear? After
all, we have *spess magic*.) We're in space, and it should be hard to
get gases because they tend to escape into... you know... space. Not
every station should have a magical gas miner.

But guess what? It turns out that realism provides both a set of
interesting problems and a set of rules for how a universe should
consistently behave. So by making things more realistic, we get both
interesting mechanics and a set of consistent rules for free. Of course
realism doesn't trump fun, and if it is fun to make something that is
unrealistic (e.g. plasma gas), then we should always pick fun.
**However, where realism does not conflict with being fun, then we
should opt to be realistic because it provides a set of interesting
problems and consistent rules.**

After all, why do we say that *PV=nRT*? Shouldn't we make up a different
gas law because realism is bad?

## High-Priority Proposals

These proposals should be implemented first, because they have an
outsized impact on atmos balance as a whole.

- **Phase out gas miners for all upstream maps.** It doesn't make sense
that all stations have free and plentiful sources of gas, otherwise you
might as well be on a planet. This is a game that is literally set in
space. It would make sense to keep a few specialty miners, e.g. for
plasma, if a station is set on a plasma mining planet. But in general,
all other gases should be imported via gas canisters. Miners should
still be kept available for any forks that choose to use them.

- This solves problems (1) and (3). Maintaining a livable atmos would
involve work during the round beyond setting up distro to pipe gas from
miners. It would help increase interactions with other departments, such
as cargo and salvage as atmos needs to order gas.

- Ensuring a appropriate round-start supply of gas would make the game
playable without a functional cargo department.

- This would discourage fighting fires or atmos problems by wholesale
spacing a section. There is currently very little downside to spacing a
section to get rid of problems because of an unlimited gas supply.

- There is [overwhelming consensus on mappers for
this](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/770682801607278632/1162179968915210280).

- As an interim or for very low pop-count maps, keep miners but make
them mine gas at low temperature that has to be heated up before use.
This preserves a bit of an incentive for atmos players to not space a
section at the first sign of trouble.

- **Globally increase MaxTransferRate** for devices that are not
flow-based, e.g. pumps.

- This solves problem (2). Among other things, it would make scrubbers
and other devices actually useful for combating atmospheric problems.
Currently players prefer to just space everything. Increasing this would
provide a feasible alternative.

## Medium Priority

- **Make all atmos devices flow-based.** This means driving gas flow as
a result of pressure differences created using pumps. The specific
offenders are currently any "pumped" device that is not a dedicated
pump, e.g. air vents, scrubbers, filters, and mixers.

- This addresses an issue about atmos intuition and accessibility.
Players should not have to understand the internal workings of the pipe
net system (e.g. a pipe is one big node, gases move between them). In
real life, a fan or pump creates a pressure difference, and pressure
differences drive gas flow. If you blow on one end of a straw, you can
expect it to come out of the other end, not get stuck in a pipe net.

- This also addresses (2). Instead of having a fixed upper bound on
volume transfer, transfer rates would always depend on the pressure
difference that you create.

- **Add maximum temperature and pressure limits for most devices.** It
does not make sense that you can contain the surface of the sun in your
pipes. Adding limits would encourage designing processes and systems
that work within reasonable constraints.

- Some "sub-optimal" setups are really unintuitive and wouldn't work in
real life due to temperature and pressure limits.

- There are some concerns about being able to run burn chambers and the
TEG. The screenshot below demonstrates a TEG that is capable of powering
an entire large-sized station (256.8 kW current output, the peak output
is quite a bit higher) with a maximum pressure excursion of 1600 kPa. It
shows that pipes that burst at reasonable pressures are entirely
consistent with having burn chambers. You just need to set them up
correctly.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3229565/274441724-712f4ebf-7440-4d81-879e-19aa29788822.png)

- This addresses problem (1), the "set up and forget" issue by adding
temperatures and pressures to monitor. It also allows the opportunity
for sabatoge.


- **Make heaters and freezers thermodynamically sound.** Keeping a
station properly heated or cooled is actually a substantial real-life
problem. Why deprive atmos techs an actual challenge that keeps gameplay
interesting? Because of the existence of generators like the TEG,
keeping things thermodynamically balanced is also a great way to prevent
infinite power hacks.

## Low Priority

- **Make station air flow-based.** Currently, air vents release air when
the pressure is too low, and by default scrubbers only scrub waste
gases. So if for some reason the station gets cold, there's no easy way
to cycle the air out and heat it up. Of course, you could set all the
scrubbers to siphon, heat your distro, and then set the air alarm to
fill. But that would just be describing a bad way of doing what real
life HVAC systems have always been doing: keep the air flowing.

- This addresses problem (2) by making it possible to better regulate
station temperature.

- **Make heaters and freezers binary.** Just like your central heating
and air conditioning circulate air through heat/cold coils, gases should
flow across heaters and freezers in order to exchange temperature.

- **Adding process-based alternatives to scrubbers and filters.** For
example, with gas reaction-based scrubbing processes, scrubbers with
limited uses, or physical processes.

- This addresses problems (1) and (3) by adding more content that is
directly related to the well-being of the station.

- One of the most pressing challenges in the real world is "how do you
separate different kinds of gas." Most current methods of gas extraction
are based on chemistry (e.g. real life carbon dioxide scrubbers contain
chemicals that react with CO2, pulling it out) or physical methods (e.g.
fractional distillation, where you cool down air in different stages to
get liquid nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) This creates a lot of opportunity for
new game play mechanics and industrial processes. This would also give
more opportunities to add gas-based reactions (i.e. more content).

- This does not advocate for removal of scrubbers and filters, but
rather makes it a mapper option, e.g. whether to use scrubbers at
round-start or make atmos set up a system depending on the desired level
of role-play.

- When set up correctly, these should have much higher processing rates
than scrubbers. This should give an incentive to set these up, e.g. on
longer rounds, while still keeping scrubbers as an option.

- This adds "optimization, tinkering, and creation of intricate builds."

- **Add gas condensation.** This would enable fractional distillation
and permit conversion between gas and the equivalent reagent.

- **Add pump efficiency curves.** Pumps have to work harder when they
create a larger pressure difference. As a result, pumping from 1 atm to
2 atm should be easier (read: faster) than pumping from 1 atm to 10 atm.
You could create a multi-stage pump, and indeed, that is what people in
real life do, at the trade-off of less throughput.

- **Breaking windows at high enough tile pressure differences.** To
handle explosions and resulting space wind without leaning on the
explosino system, and to encourage people to design burn chambers with
more controlled burns instead of always putting their pedal to the
metal.

- **Various QoL improvements** such as the RPD.

SDL 2 support (without removing SDL 1)

Second binary, which is actually partially because I plan to stick a
menu on this thing for HyperPixel touchscreen purposes.

Slightly ugly SDLVERSION hacks, but mostly the two are compatible. The
big changes are contained to the separate main binary, needing to do
different graphics setup.

render() must now use the provided, not remembered, framebuffer, and
report if it wants to update the screen, which the main binary takes
care of (flip for SDL1, more complicated dance for SDL2).

Some changes around palette handling. Also surface creation---SDL2 is
more pedantic about complaining if you hand it a pixel format bitfield
at the same time as saying "paletted, please".

VSCode noise.

Flag which hacks are working or misbehaving weirdly under SDL2.

Yes, this all needs a pile of refactoring, but as always time is short.

### Linkwarden 2.4

Read the blog: https://blog.linkwarden.app/releases/v2.4

#### What's New?

##### 🎨 Much Improved Design

Enjoy a visual upgrade with sleeker icons, enhanced coloring, and
redesigned link cards for a more engaging experience. Huge thanks to
[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) for this!

##### 🏛️ All Bookmarks Now Get Archived!

There is a background script that automatically processes each link,
creating archived versions without any user intervention. So from now
on, every bookmark you save, **including those imported from other
sources**, is automatically preserved, this means you'll have access to
your favorite article even if the original content is gone!

##### 🗃️ Archive Formats Other Than Webpages

You can now archive Links that contain a PDF or Image and link
preservation is no longer limited to webpages, for example:
https://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf

##### 📋 Added Compact List View

This new feature introduces a list-based format for viewing bookmarks.
It's designed for those who prefer a more structured and straightforward
way to browse their saved links. This view can be especially handy for
quickly scanning through numerous bookmarks, making it easier to find
what you're looking for.

##### 👍 Enhanced User Experience

There are many improvements made to enhance the user experience of the
app, like for instance you can now add new Collections right from the
navbar. Also when you try to delete a Link, you get a "Are you sure"
prompt to prevent accidentally deletion of your Links.

##### 🔐 Added Many More Single Sign-On and Oauth Integrations

From Authentik, to Apple, Google, and more... The list goes on.

##### ✅ And more...

cli: replace clap with lexopt and supporting code

ripgrep began it's life with docopt for argument parsing. Then it moved
to Clap and stayed there for a number of years. Clap has served ripgrep
well, and it probably could continue to serve ripgrep well, but I ended
up deciding to move off of it.

Why?

The first time I had the thought of moving off of Clap was during the
2->3->4 transition. I thought the 3.x and 4.x releases were great, but
for me, it ended up moving a little too quickly. Since the release of
4.x was telegraphed around when 3.x came out, I decided to just hold off
and wait to migrate to 4.x instead of doing a 3.x migration followed
shortly by another 4.x migration. Of course, I just never ended up doing
the migration at all. I never got around to it and there just wasn't a
compelling reason for me to upgrade. While I never investigated it, I
saw an upgrade as a non-trivial amount of work in part because I didn't
encapsulate the usage of Clap enough.

The above is just what got me started thinking about it. It wasn't
enough to get me to move off of it on its own. What ended up pushing me
over the edge was a combination of factors:

* As mentioned above, I didn't want to run on the migration treadmill.
This has proven to not be much of an issue, but at the time of the
2->3->4 releases, I didn't know how long Clap 4.x would be out before a
5.x would come out.
* The release of lexopt[1] caught my eye. IMO, that crate demonstrates
exactly how something new can arrive on the scene and just thoroughly
solve a problem minimalistically. It has the docs, the reasoning, the
simple API, the tests and good judgment. It gets all the weird corner
cases right that Clap also gets right (and is part of why I was
originally attracted to Clap).
* I have an overall desire to reduce the size of my dependency tree. In
part because a smaller dependency tree tends to correlate with better
compile times, but also in part because it reduces my reliance and trust
on others. It lets me be the "master" of ripgrep's destiny by reducing
the amount of behavior that is the result of someone else's decision
(whether good or bad).
* I perceived that Clap solves a more general problem than what I
actually need solved. Despite the vast number of flags that ripgrep has,
its requirements are actually pretty simple. We just need simple
switches and flags that support one value. No multi-value flags. No
sub-commands. And probably a lot of other functionality that Clap has
that makes it so flexible for so many different use cases. (I'm being
hand wavy on the last point.)

With all that said, perhaps most importantly, the future of ripgrep
possibly demands a more flexible CLI argument parser. In today's world,
I would really like, for example, flags like `--type` and `--type-not`
to be able to accumulate their repeated values into a single sequence
while respecting the order they appear on the CLI. For example, prior
to this migration, `rg regex-automata -Tlock -ttoml` would not return
results in `Cargo.lock` in this repository because the `-Tlock` always
took priority even though `-ttoml` appeared after it. But with this
migration, `-ttoml` now correctly overrides `-Tlock`. We would like to
do similar things for `-g/--glob` and `--iglob` and potentially even
now introduce a `-G/--glob-not` flag instead of requiring users to use
`!` to negate a glob. (Which I had done originally to work-around this
problem.) And some day, I'd like to add some kind of boolean matching to
ripgrep perhaps similar to how `git grep` does it. (Although I haven't
thought too carefully on a design yet.) In order to do that, I perceive
it would be difficult to implement correctly in Clap.

I believe that this last point is possible to implement correctly in
Clap 2.x, although it is awkward to do so. I have not looked closely
enough at the Clap 4.x API to know whether it's still possible there. In
any case, these were enough reasons to move off of Clap and own more of
the argument parsing process myself.

This did require a few things:

* I had to write my own logic for how arguments are combined into one
single state object. Of course, I wanted this. This was part of the
upside. But it's still code I didn't have to write for Clap.
* I had to write my own shell completion generator.
* I had to write my own `-h/--help` output generator.
* I also had to write my own man page generator. Well, I had to do this
with Clap 2.x too, although my understanding is that Clap 4.x supports
this. With that said, without having tried it, my guess is that I
probably wouldn't have liked the output it generated because I
ultimately had to write most of the roff by hand myself to get the man
page I wanted. (This also had the benefit of dropping the build
dependency on asciidoc/asciidoctor.)

While this is definitely a fair bit of extra work, it overall only cost
me a couple days. IMO, that's a good trade off given that this code is
unlikely to change again in any substantial way. And it should also
allow for more flexible semantics going forward.

Fixes #884, Fixes #1648, Fixes #1701, Fixes #1814, Fixes #1966

[MIRROR] Removes an exploit that can farm Russian revolver moodlets, adds Russian revolvers to the contraband section of games vendors [MDB IGNORE] (#25493)

* Removes an exploit that can farm Russian revolver moodlets, adds Russian revolvers to the contraband section of games vendors (#80159)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/80158 by making
curses block you from playing Russian roulette regardless of whether or
not there's a live bullet in your Russian revolver's chamber.

A Russian revolver has been added to the contraband section of each Good
Clean Fun vendor.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The bug is incredibly funny, but ~~I want GBP~~ probably should be
fixed.

There's no actual way to get (more) Russian revolvers outside of the
mapstart ones, and that can be a bit stifling to gimmicks that involve
them. And Russian roulette IS a game.

Like the roundstart ones, you could unload these vendor revolvers for
.357 bullets, but you can already just print .357 bullets from a hacked
autolathe directly, so I don't think that's an issue.

## Changelog

:cl: ATHATH
fix: Spacemen can no longer use curses to cheat at Russian roulette by
selectively blocking attempts to shoot themselves.
add: A Russian revolver has been added to the contraband section of each
Good Clean Fun vendor.

25.11 Pointing Tailwind at your Component PHP Classes
 - Though, one detail. Tailwind scans our source files, finds all the Tailwind classes we're using and includes those in the final CSS file. And because we're now including classes inside PHP, we need to make sure Tailwind sees those.

 In tailwind.config.js, on top, I'll paste in one more line to make it scan our Twig component PHP classes

 Changing the Component Tag Name
 - Ok, we're nearly done for today - but I want to celebrate and use the new component in one more spot: on the voyage index page, for the "New Voyage" button.

 Open index.html.twig... change this to a <twig:Button>... then we can remove most of these classes. The bold is specific to this spot I think

 When we refresh... it renders! Though... when I click... nothing happens! You probably saw why: this is now a button, not an a tag.

 That's okay: we can make our component just a bit more flexible. In Button.php, add another property: string $tag defaulting to button

 Then in the template, use {{ tag }} for the starting tag and the ending tag

 Finish in index.html.twig: pass tag="a"

 Now over here... when we click... got it!

 That's it! I hope you love Twig components as much as I do. But they can do even more! I didn't tell you how you can prefix any attribute with : to pass dynamic Twig variables or expressions to a prop. We also didn't discuss that the component PHP classes are services. Yea, you can add an __construct() function, autowire other services, like VoyageRepository, then use those to provide data to your template... making the entire component standalone and self-sufficient. That's one of my favorite features.

 Tomorrow we're going to keep leveraging Twig components to create a modal component... then see just how easily we can use modals whenever we want.

experimental_use(promise) (#25084)

* Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises

This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when 
something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
can run, then continue in a new task.

I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
separate commit.

* Move throwException to after work loop resumes

throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right 
before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
render the fiber again.

This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
(RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the 
RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
from appearing.

* Use expando to check whether promise has resolved

Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
resolved.

In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
the resolved value.

This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
by `Promise.allSettled`.

The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
without waiting a microtask.

* Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook

Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
implement it yet.

* use(promise)

Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components, 
but that is planned.

If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
"immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in 
previous commits.

Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing 
whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.

When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
principles largely apply.

The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
be deprecated.

26.9 Finally, let's frost this cake. Near the bottom of the content, I'll paste in the planet checkboxes

 This is more boring code! I loop over the planets and render input check boxes. My Symfony controller is already set up to read the planets parameter and filter the query.

 Final test. Open it up. Lovely! Now watch: click a few. When I press "See Results", the table should update. Boom. It did!

 But the coolest part is... how this worked! Think about it: I click this button... and the table reloads. That means the form is submitting. But... what caused that? Look at the button: there's no code to submit the form. So what's going on?

 Remember: this button, the planet checkboxes and this modal physically live inside the <form> element. And what happens when you press a button that lives inside a form? It submits the form! We run the modal#close, but we also allow the browser to do the default behavior: submitting the form. This is ancient alien technology at work!

 On the close button, I was a bit sneaky. When I added that, I included a type="button". That tells the browser to not submit any form that it might be inside. That's why when we click "X", nothing updates. But when we click "see results", the form submits.

 Woh! Best day ever! Tomorrow, it's time to look at Live components, where we take Twig components and let them re-render on the page via Ajax as the user interacts when them.
