New monster: protean progenitors, for Zot

Zot hasn't gotten new monsters besides the addition of then-new ghost moths
13 years ago (8d1b968), or the swapping of fire and ice dragons for already
present prior quicksilver dragons 7 years ago (0b18a7b). Most Zot work
across Crawl's development has been more oriented on adding more and more
stair vaults to Zot or fixing up the non-top-tier monsters otherwise
present: tmons constrict / demonic berserk, curse toe summons, death cob
attack brands, klown chaos, lich and draconian class spells. This is
entirely reasonably behaviour that has relatively evened out Zot's threat
level over time, but it has been a very restrained and compact set for a
while. It wouldn't hurt to try out more. Especially stuff that can break up
Zot's heavy reliance on relatively conventional, highly established, and
spreading elsewhere draconians.

Protean progenitors are transmutations giants for Zot. The origins of all
the dungeon's countless shapeshifters, they first start off as relatively
simple foes- unarmed Irradiate casters with fast regen but poor defenses
and no resistances. When they die, however, they leave behind some last
children in some last new form as they violently split into piles of
'aspiring flesh'- by default two at HD 12, with increasing chances of a
third if it rarely rolls any lower HD. These non-attacking, non-moving
piles will over the course of a few turns polymorph into hasted, mighted
copies of whatever the giant originally tried to transform into, and
never transform again. At HD 12 over the glowing shapeshifter HD 10
default, this gives double-buffed options of e.g. fire and ice dragons,
unarmed ettins, tyrant leeches, alligators, jorogumo, and broodmothers.
A chance to review much earlier branch spawns as a surprise in every giant
provides a bit more variety of bands over Zot's many base and nonbase
draconian packs, while also hewing closer to the weirder spectrum of Zot's
many non-draconic non-elemental monsters.

For now, they eat up a bit of the base draconian and non-base draconian
bands weight, and spawn with a 33% chance to have a second one accompany
them- a quick objstat roll says there should be about 4 of them throughout
Zot and each of Zot's standard base draconians reduced from ~11 to ~10. The
exact strength of these are inherently difficult to assess, so they'll
probably need a fair bit of public testing to see how these work out- base
form's base stats, spawn count, and band count are all easily changed.
They've also only been added to a restrained number of vaults- ones that
span the bulk of Zot's current monster set, or that invoke chaos and flesh.
They might make for reasonable spawns on Mnoleg's level to lower their
reliance on ugly things and eyes, but for now are otherwise only in chaos
zig floors. If we get any other new big Zot monsters, it might be a good
idea to look at slightly reducing the overall spawn count as is done for
Lair.

(Severely placeholder tiles are mostly made of currently unused decade-old
rltiles for large abominations, small abominations, and glowing
shapeshifters, with palettes from Sastreii's ice dragon and radroaches.)

FOV is Dead (Long Live FOV) (#80062)

## About The Pull Request

FOV as it is currently implemented is incompatible* with wallening.
I'm doin wallening, so we gotta redo things here.

The issue is the masking of mobs. Wallening relies on sidemap (layering
based off physical position), which only works on things on the same
plane (because planes are basically sheets we render down onto)
So rather then masking mobs, let's reuse the masking idea from old fov,
and use it to cut out a bit of the game render plane, and
blur/over-saturate the bit that's masked out.

My hope is this makes things visible in light, but not as much in
darkness, alongside making more vivid shit more easily seen (just like
real life)

Here's some videos, what follows after is the commits I care about
(since I had to rip a bunch of planes to nothing, so the files changed
tab might be a bit of a mess)

Oh also I had to remove the darkness pref since the darkness is doing a
lot of the heavy lifting now. I'm sorry.

Edit:
NEW FOV SPRITES! Thanks dongle your aviator glasses will guide us to a
better future.

## Commits I Care About

[Implements something like fov, but without the planes as layers
hell](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/a604c7b1c8d74cd27af4d806d85892c1f7e35ba8)

Rather then masking out mobs standing behind us, we use a combo color
matrix and blur filter to make the stuff covered by fov harder to see.

We achive this by splitting the game plane into two, masking both by fov
(one normally and one inversely), and then applying effects to one of
the two.

I want to make the fov fullscreens more gradient, but as an effect this
is a good start

[Removes WALL_PLANE_UPPER by adding a WALL_PLANE overlay to material
walls (init cost comes
here)](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/25489337392f708cb337fbf05a2329eacdfc5346)

@Mothblocks see this. comment in commit explains further but uh, we need
to draw material walls to the light mask plane so things actually can be
seen on them, but we can't do that and also have them be big, so they
get an overlay. Sorry, slight init time bump, about 0.5 seconds. I can
kill it with wallening.

[Moves SEETHROUGH_PLANE above
ABOVE_GAME_PLANE](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/beec4c00e01d34a04fba7c2bb98a9b70d27ead82)

I don't think it actually wants to draw here
@Time-Green I think this was you so pinging for opinion

[Resprites FOV masks to be clean (and more
consistent)](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/80062/commits/f02ad13696b3b17658af612c62848b48609d785d)

This is 100% donglesplonge's work, he's spent a week or so going back
and forth with me sharpening these to a mirror shine, real chill

## Why It's Good For The Game

Walls are closing in

## Changelog
:cl: LemonInTheDark, Donglesplonge
image: Redoes fov "mask" sprites. They're clean, have a very pleasant
dithering effect, and look real fuckin good!
del: Changed FOV, it no longer hides mobs, instead it blurs the hidden
area, and makes it a bit darker/oversaturated

tree-wide: use /proc/thread-self for thread-local state

With the idmap work, we will have a tainted Go thread in our
thread-group that has a different mount namespace to the other threads.
It seems that (due to some bad luck) the Go scheduler tends to make this
thread the thread-group leader in our tests, which results in very
baffling failures where /proc/self/mountinfo produces gibberish results.

In order to avoid this, switch to using /proc/thread-self for everything
that is thread-local. This primarily includes switching all file
descriptor paths (CLONE_FS), all of the places that check the current
cgroup (technically we never will run a single runc thread in a separate
cgroup, but better to be safe than sorry), and the aforementioned
mountinfo code. We don't need to do anything for the following because
the results we need aren't thread-local:

 * Checks that certain namespaces are supported by stat(2)ing
   /proc/self/ns/...

 * /proc/self/exe and /proc/self/cmdline are not thread-local.

 * While threads can be in different cgroups, we do not do this for the
   runc binary (or libcontainer) and thus we do not need to switch to
   the thread-local version of /proc/self/cgroups.

 * All of the CLONE_NEWUSER files are not thread-local because you
   cannot set the usernamespace of a single thread (setns(CLONE_NEWUSER)
   is blocked for multi-threaded programs).

Note that we have to use runtime.LockOSThread when we have an open
handle to a tid-specific procfs file that we are operating on multiple
times. Go can reschedule us such that we are running on a different
thread and then kill the original thread (causing -ENOENT or similarly
confusing errors). This is not strictly necessary for most usages of
/proc/thread-self (such as using /proc/thread-self/fd/$n directly) since
only operating on the actual inodes associated with the tid requires
this locking, but because of the pre-3.17 fallback for CentOS, we have
to do this in most cases.

In addition, CentOS's kernel is too old for /proc/thread-self, which
requires us to emulate it -- however in rootfs_linux.go, we are in the
container pid namespace but /proc is the host's procfs. This leads to
the incredibly frustrating situation where there is no way (on pre-4.1
Linux) to figure out which /proc/self/task/... entry refers to the
current tid. We can just use /proc/self in this case.

Yes this is all pretty ugly. I also wish it wasn't necessary.

Bump TS Package Minor Version + Add Cookbook for Testing Before Publishing to NPM (#477)

# Bump TS Package Minor Version + Add Cookbook for Testing Before
Publishing to NPM

Bumping TS package (minor) version to 1.1.0 to include attachments in
schema.

I noticed that we have no ts cookbooks to easily test the aiconfig
package prior to publishing so added a function calling one to match the
function calling ipynb cookbook.

## Testing:
Locally packed aiconfig and used it in the cookbook, getting correct
results without errors:
```
(aiconfig) ryanholinshead@Ryans-MacBook-Pro typescript % npx ts-node function-calling-with-openai.ts                    
search({
  "name": "Where the Crawdads Sing"
}

Title: Where the Crawdads Sing
Author: Delia Owens

Description:
Where the Crawdads Sing is an extraordinary and captivating novel that transports readers to the marshes of North Carolina. The story revolves around Kya Clark, a young girl who becomes known as the "Marsh Girl" to the local townspeople. Abandoned by her family, Kya survives alone in the wild, developing an intimate connection with nature.

Similar to To Kill a Mockingbird, Where the Crawdads Sing explores themes of prejudice, justice, and the resilience of the human spirit. Both novels provide poignant portrayals of societal issues through the eyes of their young protagonists. While To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in a racially divided town during the 1930s, Where the Crawdads Sing delves into the exploration of classism and isolation in the 1950s.

Delia Owens' lyrical prose brings the marshes to life, creating a vivid setting that becomes a character in itself. The book beautifully combines mystery, coming-of-age, and a love story that will keep readers captivated until the very end. Where the Crawdads Sing, like To Kill a Mockingbird, leaves a lasting impact, prompting readers to reflect on human nature, empathy, and the complexities of the world we live in.

Makes Telekinesis + Russian Revolver Interaction more fair (#79740)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #77238

Basically, you were able to just spam kill people with the russian
revolver if you had telekinesis, which isn't really fair. Now, after
taking a leaflet out of the the discussion in that issue report, you can
still pull off the same party trick... once...

Basically, let's just say that when you focus on firing the gun in your
mind... you're also pointing it directly at your mind (your brain (your
skull (you instantly die))). This occurs even if the projectile doesn't
actually touch you (because that would be hellish to account for) but
you're the one who's playing russian roulette man

You still get to do some collateral damage because that's still a very
funny interaction but you only get to do it once per life. I don't know
if people will be happy to revive you after you "shoot" them. Also, the
way it's coded means that you can still leave the revolver on the table
and fire it at your foot or something, or just use it normally, as a
telekinesis user. This _only_ applies to distance-based firings.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The russian revolver is specifically coded to prevent you from damaging
other people, and this was a pretty silly way to sidestep that based on
the checks. Instead, let's make it so that you can still do this
admittedly funny interaction, but with enough reason to not do it (the
reason being that you'll always get fucking blatted).
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: After a string of unfortunate incidents, persons with
telekinesis have been strongly warned against playing Russian Roulette,
as they tend to hyperfixate on the gun a bit too much and end up firing
it directly at their head.

Reworks stop, drop, roll into a gradual, interruptable thing, that repeats until extinguished (#79694)

## About The Pull Request

Related: #78017 

Stop drop and roll is no longer instant -5 fire stacks -> stun -> wait. 

Now, when you stop drop and roll, every time you roll you will lose 1
firestack.

A roll is triggered every 0.8 seconds. Moving, getting up, or becoming
incapacitated / stunned will stop you from rolling.
_(This number puts it roughly equivalent to its current rate.)_

While rolling, your hands are blocked (you cannot use items, hold
things, etc.)
Additionally, you will roll until all firestacks are cleared. 

## Why It's Good For The Game

Getting stunned for 6 seconds because you decide to stop and roll is a
little silly. Reasonably you could stop rolling and get back up should
the need arise, such as "oh god there's more fire I gotta relocate".

By changing it to a gradual thing, it makes it a bit more reasonable and
fair.
- New players who immediately slam "STOP DROP ROLL" because the alert on
their screen tells them to are no longer helpless for 6 whole seconds
- People who hit the resist key, intending to interact with something
else (such as a bola) are no longer stuck rolling when they did not want
to

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
balance: Stop, drop, and roll no longer instantly clears 5 fire stacks
off of you - Instead, it will clear 1 fire stack off of you every time
you roll, with a roll every 0.8 seconds.
balance: Stop, drop, and roll no longer stuns you for 6 seconds.
Instead, it will knock you to the floor while you are rolling. Moving
around or getting up will cancel the roll, and you cannot use items
while rolling around.
balance: Stop, drop, and roll will now repeat until the fire is put out
or you get up.

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #76079

Basically we were both not getting all of the args that we recieve from
`COMSIG_ITEM_AFTERATTACK` which included the very important
`proximity_flag` which tells us if the person was in range to actually
hurt us or not. This means that clicking a mob with this element with a
stack of metal from across the room would cause them to aggro, which
makes no sense whatsoever. Let's actually use that proximity check.

We listen for projectiles hitting us separately, don't worry.
## Why It's Good For The Game

It just makes no damn sense, fixes some weird ass behavior.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Removes an exploit that can farm Russian revolver moodlets, adds Russian revolvers to the contraband section of games vendors (#80159)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/80158 by making
curses block you from playing Russian roulette regardless of whether or
not there's a live bullet in your Russian revolver's chamber.

A Russian revolver has been added to the contraband section of each Good
Clean Fun vendor.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The bug is incredibly funny, but ~~I want GBP~~ probably should be
fixed.

There's no actual way to get (more) Russian revolvers outside of the
mapstart ones, and that can be a bit stifling to gimmicks that involve
them. And Russian roulette IS a game.

Like the roundstart ones, you could unload these vendor revolvers for
.357 bullets, but you can already just print .357 bullets from a hacked
autolathe directly, so I don't think that's an issue.

## Changelog

:cl: ATHATH
fix: Spacemen can no longer use curses to cheat at Russian roulette by
selectively blocking attempts to shoot themselves.
add: A Russian revolver has been added to the contraband section of each
Good Clean Fun vendor.

2023 Day 14

Well, this was another "meh" day, both in terms of the task and in terms
of leaderboard performance. I am actually quite surprised that I did so
poorly on this task, as I understood very quickly how to do the tilting.
I guess in the end I wasn't as quick as I thought.

Part two went mostly fine. I was a bit slow to implement the brute force
part, as I had a mistake in my east and south implementations, which
had "while x < X", which should have been "while x < X-1", causing some
stones to go off the map. Once I fixed this, I implemented memoization
immediately, and once I started looking at the hit rate, I saw that we
didn't get new entries after just a few times. I realized then that this
was going to be a "skip the cycle" task. I still spent a bit of time
getting it all setup, and I wasn't decisive enough on the first part.

The one thing I think I did well today, was that I implemented the tilt
functions nicely, by just using sort and different parameters. It was
clever to do the same for the `x` as for the `y` situations, by swapping
the coordinates before sorting.

My solution still runs quite slowly. It would be interesting to see what
can be done to speed it up. I think a first step would be to don't go
one step at a time, but rather jump straight to the next open slot
below. You could try to maintain this somehow. Interesting one to
optimize for anyway.

Balance changes to swords, energy shields and modsuit shields. (#80072)

## About The Pull Request

### Sword Weaponry

Mundane sword weapons of all sorts do not block ``LEAP_ATTACK`` attacks
whatsoever. These attacks include tackles, xeno tackles and bodythrows.

Energy swords and double energy swords only gain 25% block probability
against such attacks.

### Double Energy Sword

No longer grants outright energy projectile immunity while employed.
Instead, it just has a high probability of reflecting (the typical 75%
to block any other attack). So, very solid defense against energy
projectiles, but not immunity.

Against non-reflectable projectiles, like ballistics or nanite bullets,
the desword only has 50% block, similar to an energy sword.

To compensate for the loss of defensive power, we'll make it all the
more rewarding for getting on top of someone with the sword by giving it
40 force while active. And also it costs 13 TC.

### Combat Energy Shield

This also lost outright energy projectile immunity, but gained the
standard blocking power of shields on top of the ability to reflect
energy projectiles when they block them. This significantly increases
the shields potential effectiveness while no longer pigeonholing the
shield to only energy weapons. (This makes them exceptionally good
against tackles and body throws, by the by).

Deathsquads still have the perfect deflection energy shield so that they
can continue to spam pulse shots with impunity.

### MODsuit Shield Module

Only has one charge instead of three, but it recharges in half the time.
This is no longer such a perfect defense, and does somewhat need you to
be thinking about how you're utilizing the shield rather than not
thinking about defense at all by barreling forward under three potential
hits worth of protection.

Also much cheaper, at almost half price of 8 TC. Because of how cheap it
is (and how much it still is necessary to keep you alive), I've put it
into the core equipment box (which brings the price up to 22 TC. As a
reminder, this is not meant to be at any discount, and is more aimed
towards teaching newer players which items contribute towards success.
If you don't want all the times within, don't buy this box, just buy
what you want separately.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

This is a doozy of an explanation, I hope you're ready for it under the
spoiler.
<details>
With my tackling and bodythrow prs, numerous people expressed
exasperation at the fact that these two tools may have been keeping some
outlier antagonist gear from becoming too easy to steamroll with if you
already knew what you were doing. My intent was to create consistent
rules and behaviours that both A) did not rely on bugs to keep the
balance of power from tipping one way or the other, and B) was at least
consistent or had consistent rules established.

This PR is tackling overperforming gear combinations for already
competent nukies that may have, over time, crept out of control, and
applying some consistency to the rules around similar equipment.

AND also deals with quite possibly the most braindead element of game
design we've tolerated for about a decade, and half a decade after it
was necessary to maintain that decision.

Part of the culprit of this issue is that, specifically in regards to
nukies, crew can't use the vast majority of their weapons effectively
against them. This largely is because this antagonist can gain
immunities to those types of equipment. And that is rapidly increasing
as we move closer towards outright ballistic removal. I don't think the
game is made healthier by everyone on the station having to fight armed
mercenaries with spears, and doesn't make much thematic sense either.
More so, most greener players probably just don't know this is how it
works, and so surprise Pikachu when their lasers bounce off nukies
harmlessly. (This bit reminds me of the problem of new players using
disablers against simple mobs)

But of course, that isn't the only part of the problem. The other half
is due to being able to be layered on a much more broad defensive tool
in the form of the MODsuit Shield Module, whose three charges could
render the mindful nukie near untouchable if they're pairing it with
some other layered defense, such as a desword. Notice that this doesn't
really address armor. The culprit is negation, and not mitigation, and
we should be sparing in how easily we hand out outright effect negation
simply because it isn't super obvious to a new player why it happened,
and how to resolve it. At the very least, we should look to find ways to
add options for players to overcome these problems. Especially with
teamwork.

Energy projectile immunity made sense while there floated around an
energy projectile that ostensibly would down you in a single shot.
Nukies ALSO had projectile weapons that worked much the same (c-20r stun
bullets, taser shot bulldogs, etc.), so it was predominantly
tit-for-tat. These immunity granting equipment pieces forced crew
members to get shotguns and ballistic guns to fight these dangers;
something more available at the time.

We've exercised large bits and pieces of this from the game a long time
ago, but we still have some remnants convinced we're still in a
taser-rich, ballistic available environment. We need to move the games
languishing tools into the modern era and re-established their place in
the game. Namely, the double-energy sword and the combat energy shield
are almost entirely unchanged besides refactors for the last decade or
so, even while the game around them have changed. They've been a
continuous sore point for me in all my time developing and a constant
nagging issue. I want to deal with it now.

MODsuit Shield Module is just kind of really good and only made stronger
the more defenses you have. It's good to have a defense like this, but I
think it is too brain dead. With only one charge, it will save you from
a lost joust here and there, but it won't make it as simple as running
right at every problem you encounter and eating a volley of attacks
while you kill someone with impunity.

**With regards to traitors**, since they also get double-energy swords;
I'm open to suggestions if this is hitting them far too hard, but I'm
not terribly concerned using this weapon for a few reasons. **Firstly**,
I think their presence amongst the crew make it a much better weapon for
tots than nukies (in isolation) simply because they can find ways to
exploit it via tools they gather from the station. It is a force
multiplier. Traitors also have a much bigger element of surprise
usually. **Secondly**, round-start traitors typically grow to be a bit
stronger over time, but I don't foresee many waiting to pay for the
double-energy sword unless they're already flush with TC. So if a
traitor is in a position after they've unlocked access to it to buy one
of these, they are probably doing pretty okay for themselves.
</details>

### TL;DR

Defense stacking and attack immunities are not particularly healthy
things to both design around, or experience in-game. They are kind of
just relics of the past made only sorer once I ripped off a few
bandaids. This is a source of a number of symptomatic issues in the
game, so let's fix that and make it easier on all of us going forward.

Much of the way these things worked operated on extremely outdated
design considerations. It doesn't make sense for them to work like this
today, and only makes things harder by keeping the status quo.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Mundane sword-like and medieval weapons are not able to block
tackles, xenomorph tackles and body throws.
balance: The double-energy sword and energy sword have trouble blocking
physical projectiles, body throws and tackles.
balance: The double-energy sword also no longer has guaranteed energy
projectile deflection; only doing so on a successful block (75% chance
to block).
balance: But it does have 40 force now, so it is more lethal a weapon.
Traitors can purchase the sword for only 13 TC (down from 16 TC).
balance: The combat energy shield (The one you hold) now functions as a
normal shield (it used to only protect you against energy projectiles
and nothing else). It loses guaranteed energy projectile deflection, but
still reflects the projectile so on a block.
feature: Death commandos continue to have their energy shields deflect
all incoming energy projectiles. Because who cares about deathsquads
being balanced?
balance: The MODsuit shield module only has one charge, but recharges
every 10 seconds. It also costs 8 TC (down from 15). It is also now in
the Core Gear beginner box (bringing the total price up to 22 TC).

Organ movement refactor *Un-nullspaces your organs* (#79687)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

closes #53931, #70916, #53931

## About The Pull Request

Organs were previously stored in nullspace. Now they are stored in their
prospective bodyparts. Bodyparts are now stored in the mob.

I've also had to refactor a lot of code concerning organ movement.
Previously, organs were only moved into bodyparts once the bodyparts
were removed. To accomodate this change, two major distinctions have
been made:

**Bodypart removal/insertion**
Called only when an organ is taken out of a bodypart. Bodypart overlays,
damage modifiers or other changes that should affect a bodypart itself
goes here.

**Mob insertion/removal**
Called when an organ is removed from a mob. This can either be directly,
by taking the organ out of a mob, or by removing the bodypart that
contains the organ. This lets you add and remove organ effects safely
without having to worry about the bodypart.

Now that we controle the movement of bodyparts and organs, we can fuck
around with them more. Summoning someones head or chest or heart will
actually kill them now (and quite violently I must say (chest summoning
gibs lol)).


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7501474/5efc9dd3-cfd5-4ce4-b70f-d0d74894626e

I´ve also added a unit test that violently tears apart and reconstructs
a person in different ways to see if they get put toghether the right
way

This will definitely need a testmerge. I've done a lot of testing to
make sure interactions work, but more niche stuff or my own incompetence
can always slip through.

## Why It's Good For The Game

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

A lot of organ work is quite restricted. You can't C4 someones heart,
you cant summon their organs and a lot of exceptions have to be made to
keep organs in nullspace. This lets organs (and bodyparts) play more
nicely with the rest of the game. This also makes it a lot easier to
move away from extorgans since a lot of their unique movement code has
been removed and or generalized.

I don't like making PRs of this size (I'm so sorry reviewers), but I was
in a unique position to replace the entire system in a way I couldn't
have done conveniently in multiple PRs

## Changelog

"Security Implant" rework, prisoner management console updates (#79882)

## About The Pull Request

For the vernacular purposes of the following PR body -- "Security
Implant" refers to the existing subset of implants given, by security,
to captured prisoners and such as a punitive, controlling measure. This
includes the chemical, tracking, and maybe exile implants.

This revamps the functionality of how "security" implants are displayed
on huds, prisoner management console implant controls/readouts, and
their instrumentality. It was also, ultimately, an attempt at nerfing
the tracking implant that spiralled far out of control.

Rather than only displaying chemical on the right and tracking on the
left, all implants with the "security implant" flag will be trackable on
SecHuds. A maximum of two can be implanted at once. This is both due to
technical limitations, but also conveniently provides security a limit
to consider when choosing implants.

Implants now also occupy their HUD slot based on the order they were
implanted in, rather than always occupying the same spot. Neat!


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/68b17dbb-cda4-4c3b-96d4-b3bbcf49b80e)

From two (three if you count the exile implant), there are now five
security implants. _The tracker implant has been split into two of these
implants._

<details>
<summary>Summary of the implants, functions, changes:</summary>
<br>

- **Tracker (Red)** -- No longer grants teleporter beacon. Tracking
radius has been increased from 20 to 35 tiles. The Prisoner Management
Console will now list the area the prisoner is occupying as well.
Disables after the implantee is dead for 10 minutes.
- **Chemical (Blue)** -- No mechanical changes. The implant pad readout
has been modified slightly.
- **Exile (Green)** -- In addition to past functionality, station
shuttle controls (public, mining, etc.) will be unresponsive for the
implantee. Flimsy, but more effective than a stern warning not to come
back from lavaland.
- **Beacon (Yellow)** -- Implantee becomes a teleporter beacon. The
prisoner console will report if their currently occupied area is
hazardous or not, so half of the security team doesn't blindly teleport
into space or lava. Disables after the implantee is dead for 10 minutes.
Available from Cargo.
- **Teleport Blocker (Deep Blue, not shown)** -- Prevents the implantee
from being teleported. Ever wanted to keep a wizard or cultist in a
cell? This is where you can start. Available from Cargo, expensive and
scarce.

Each of the implants has some application that would benefit security if
used on a captured criminal. Their usefulness may overlap in some
places, but the overall range of control these implants give security is
broadened.

</details>

The implant control console has also been given a small facelift.
Certain implants provide more useful readouts that can help officers
locate, control, or capture an implantee, rewarding cooperation between
officers.

It has also been totally converted into TGUI by @MrMelbert. Kickass!

Also, You can now remotely destroy implants, either to relieve criminals
from their punishment or to make room for a different implant. Wardens
should keep hold of their ID and remember to log out, since a motivated
convict could use it to shed their implants!


![tgui](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/3c2ae99f-9c1d-4b18-b4cb-942cc96bcafe)

Everything made in this PR _should_ be scaleable enough to allow for new
security implant types to be implemented with relative ease. The
teleport-blocker implant was a last minute attempt to prove it to
myself. I had a few more ideas for implants in my head, but figured this
PR was already getting big and ugly enough. That is all for another day.

I truly apologize if there's anything I've missed in here. I did a lot
of this over a long period of time and kind of just... sat on it for a
while. If there's any confusing our unexplained changes, feel free to
point them out and I'll try to give an explanation.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The goal of this PR is to give a bit more depth to security's armory
implants. The intent is to present a choice in what implants are given
(rather than just tracker and maybe chem if you're feeling spiteful),
and to make them more useful as punitive/monitoring tools.

The tracker implant needed a nerf (and probably still does regardless of
this PR's success). It's never used for tracking since the teleporter
beacon is much more direct (+ gives a virtually free attack
opportunity), and the tracking range was incredibly subpar. I'd rather
not take toys away from security, but having the best option not be
roundstart gear feels like a fair compromise.

Warden content. Wardens have more gear to budget for and use at their
own (or the HOSes) discretion. The changes to the prisoner console allow
them to coordinate with officers to get good value out of the implants
they've chosen for an implantee.

Gives antagonists an alternate way to get de-implanted, without external
help, that can only be granted at the fault of security. Wardens who
dish out implants must keep an eye on the people carrying them!
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials, MrMelbert
add: The Tracker implant has had its teleport beacon functionality
migrated to the new (cargo accessible) Beacon implant.
add: Teleport Blocker security implant, that prevents the implantee from
teleporting by any means. Purchasable from cargo.
add: Security implants may now be harmlessly self-destructed at the
Prisoner Management Console.
balance: The Tracker implant tracking radius has increased from 20 to 35
tiles. The Prisoner Management Console will track and display the area
the implantee is in as well.
balance: The exile implant now prevents implantees from operating
shuttle controls.
code: Various code improvements and removal of unused vars in the
Prisoner Management Console
code: The HUD slots for chem/tracking implants have been converted to
display any implant with the IMPLANT_TYPE_SECURITY flag and an
associated sprite.
spellcheck: Modifies various implant pad readouts, removing false
information and rewriting some sections.

Removes Clone Damage (#80109)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Does what it says on the tin. We don't have any "special" sources of
clone damage left in the game, most of them are rather trivial so I
bunched them together into this PR.

Notable things removed:
- Clonexadone, because its entire thing was centered around clone damage
- Decloner gun, it's also centered around cloning damage, I couldn't
think of a replacement mechanic and nobody uses it anyways
- Everything else already dealt clone damage as a side (rainbow knife
deals a random damage type for example), so these sources were removed

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

Consider the four sources of normal damage that you can get: Brute,
Burn, Toxins and Oxygen. These four horsemen of the apocalypse are very
well put together and it's no surprise that they are in the game, as you
can fit any way of damaging a mob into them. Getting beaten to death by
a security officer? Brute damage. Running around on fire? Burn damage.
Poisoned or irradiated? Toxin damage. Suffocating in space? Brute, burn
and oxygen damage. Technically there's also stamina damage but that's
its own ballpark and it also makes sense why we have a damage number for
it.

Picture this now: We have this cool mechanic called "clone pods" where
you can magically revive dead people with absolute ease. We don't want
it to be for free though, it comes at a cost. This cost is clone damage,
and it serves to restrain people from abusing cloning.

Fast forward time a bit and cloning is now removed from the game. What
stays with us is a damage number that is intrinsically tied to the
context of a removed feature. It was a good idea that we had it for that
feature at the time, but now it just sits there. It's the odd one out
from all the other damage types. You can easily explain why your blade
dealt brute damage, but how are you going to fit clone damage into any
context without also becoming extremely specific?

My point is: **clone damage is conceptually a flawed mechanic because it
is too specific**. That is the major issue why no one uses it, and why
that makes it unworthy of being a damage stat.
Don't take my word for it though, because a while ago we only had a
handful of sources for this damage type in the game. And in most of the
rounds where you saw this damage, it came from only one department. It's
not worthwhile to keep it around as a damage number. People also didn't
know what to do with this damage type, so we currently have two ways of
healing clone damage: Cryotubes as a roundstart way of healing clone
damage and Rezadone, which instantly sets your clone damage to 0 on the
first tick. As a medical doctor, when was the last time you saw someone
come in with clone damage and thought to yourself, "Oh, this person has
clone damage, I cannot wait to heal them!" ?

Now we have replacements for these clone damage sources. Slimes? Slime
status effect that deals brute instead of clone. Cosmic heretics? Random
organ damage, because their mechanics are already pretty fleshed out.
Decloning virus? The virus operated as a "ticking timebomb" which used
cloning damage as the timer, so it has been reworked to not use clone
damage. What remains after all this is now a basically unused damage
type. Every specific situation that used clone damage is now relying on
another damage type. Now it's time to put clone damage to rest once and
for all.

Sure, you can technically add some form of cellular degradation in the
future, but it shouldn't be a damage number. The idea of your cells
being degraded is a cool concept, don't get me wrong, but make it a
status effect or maybe even a wound for that matter.

[NO GBP] Fixing elevation furthermore (#80099)

## About The Pull Request
fixes #80059
fixes #80085.

The tram transportation doesn't use `forceMove()`, instead it just
changes the location of the objects directly. What's more, it doesn't
call `oldloc.Exited()` or `loc.Entered()` but only for areas. The
abstract exited/entered signals are from `Moved()` though, which is
called.

About beds, well, I just happened to put a minus symbol where it
shouldn't be.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Truly one of the fuckups of the year. Now tested. I'll make a unit test
later.

Replaces the fake monkey cube in Birdshot tool storage with a less lethal one, adds something else fun (#80030)

## About The Pull Request
One of the "monkey cubes" in Birdshot's tool storage was actually a
gorilla cube. This was funny up until people realized it was a thing and
now people are using it intentionally to grief. I'd rather not.

It's a different cube now. I don't want to spoil it but it won't kill
anyone, just make people laugh.

I added a different fun item to another tile in tool storage. Again, no
spoilers, read the code if you really want to know what it was.

## Why It's Good For The Game
I like the "cube says it's a monkey but it's not" joke. It was funny
when people thought it was a monkey, used it, and got killed by it.
Problem is, people know what it is now and have used it for grief
purposes, so we can't have nice things. Gorillas are stupid hard to kill
and will de-limb people by looking at them.

I wanted to add something else fun to replace it that isn't just the
exact same joke but now it won't kill you, so I did.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
del: Replaced the "monkey cube" in Birdshot's tool storage with a
different "monkey cube".
add: Added a fun surprise item to Birdshot's tool storage to compensate
for the above change.

Merge #113809

113809: kvstreamer: add limit to how many eager batches are issued r=yuzefovich a=yuzefovich

**kvstreamer: add limit to how many eager batches are issued**

This commit fixes extremely suboptimal behavior of the streamer in the
InOrder mode in some cases. In particular, previously it was possible
for the buffered responses to consume most of the working budget, so the
streamer would degrade to processing all requests effectively one
BatchRequest with one Get / Scan at a time, significantly increasing the
latency. For example, the query added as a regression test that performs
30k Gets across 10 ranges would usually take on the order of 1.5s (which
is not great already since in the non-streamer path it takes 400ms), but
in the degenerate cases it could be on the order of 20-30s.

Similar behavior could occur in the OutOfOrder mode too where we would
issue more BatchRequests in which only one request could be satisfied
(although in OutOfOrder mode the problem is not as severe - we don't
buffer any results since we can always return them right away).

This problem is now fixed by imposing the limit on the budget's usage at
which point the streamer stops issuing "eager" requests. Namely, now,
when there is at least one request in flight, the streamer won't issue
anymore requests once `limit * eagerFraction` is exceeded. This
effectively reserves a portion of the budget for the "head-of-the-line"
batch.

The "eager fraction" is controlled by a session variable, separate for
each mode. The defaults of 0.5 for InOrder and 0.8 for OutOfOrder modes
were chosen after running TPCH queries and the query that inspired this
commit. These values bring the number of gRPC calls for the reproduction
query from 1.5k-2k range to below 200 and the query latency to be
reliably around 400ms.

I don't really see any significant downsides to this change - in the
worst case, we'd be utilizing less of the available memory budget which
is not that big of a deal, so I intend to backport this change. Also,
setting the eager fractions to large values (greater than 1.0 is
allowed) would disable this limiting behavior and revert to the previous
behavior if we need it.

Fixes: #113729.

Release note (bug fix): Previously, when executing queries with
index / lookup joins when the ordering needs to be maintained,
CockroachDB in some cases could get into a pathological behavior
which would lead to increased query latency, possibly by 1 or 2 orders
of magnitude. This bug was introduced in 22.2 and is now fixed.

**kvstreamer: increase default avg response multiple**

This commit increases the default value for
`sql.distsql.streamer.avg_response_size_multiple` cluster setting from
1.5 to 3.0. This setting controls the factor by which the current "avg
response size" estimate is multiplied and allows for TargetBytes
parameter to grow over time. In the reproduction query from the
previous commit it was determined that the growth might not be as quick
as desirable.

The effect of this change is as follows:
- if we have responses of varying sizes, then we're now likely to be more
effective since we'll end up issuing less BatchRequests
- if we have responses of similar sizes, then we might pre-reserve too
much budget upfront, so we'll end up with lower concurrency across
ranges.

Thus, we don't want to increase the multiple by too much; however,
keeping it at 1.5 can be quite suboptimal in some cases - 3.0 seems like
a decent middle ground. This number was chosen based on running TPCH
queries (both via InOrder and OutOfOrder modes of the streamer) and the
reproduction query. (For the latter this change reduces the number of
gRPC calls by a factor of 3 or so.)

Release note: None

fix: Improve nvim detection (#1946)

* Improve nvim detection:

Don't rely on the shell specific `exists", instead run `nvim -v`.
Additionally, if there's unexpected output, for example if your shell is
configured wrongly to output something when run in non-interactive mode,
it will tell you so, instead of failing with very strange errors later.

The `neovim-bin` argument has also been changed to always require the
binary to exist, instead if falling back to `nvim` as that's probably
not what the user wants. If `nevoim-bin` contains path separators the
binary will be tried directly, otherwise `which` will be used to find
the correct executable.

The which command has also been changed to always use the which crate
first to avoid shell specific issues (for example nushell).

The output is printed directly to stderr instead of the log, for a more
user friendly experience. Furthermore, the maybe disown call has been
moved so that the user actually has a chance to see the errors in the
console.

* fix(command): correct typos and clarify help message

* fix: preliminarly restore forking behavior

This however also loses possible error messages at startup about the
nvim binary not being found.

* codestyle: calm rustfmt

* fix(command): make error message about missing/errornous nvim visible

Makes Flypeople Viable (#344)

## About The Pull Request
The flyperson race was basically a death sentence for two reasons:
1. Flypeople gain no nutrients and just vomit upon eating normal food,
but eating the vomit then gets the nutrients they need. _Or is supposed
to._ Despite a lot of fancy code vomit gave them no nutrients at all.
2. When flypeople begin (due to the first issue, inevitably) starving to
death, they can't vomit at all and can only dry heave, which means that
even if vomit did give nutrients they'd be unable to make any and would
be in deep trouble. This led to a dry heaving death spiral that was
hilarious but silly.

![image](https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/assets/132588088/f19bdbdb-e566-4b0c-9f6d-09c0cf051db4)

The new code is much less elegant but actually works. tl;dr vomit now
gives a flat nutrient amount (only flypeople can eat it anyway) and the
dry heave mechanic is skipped if you're a flyperson.

## Why It's Good For The Game
This race is actually playable now. I imagine this would have been
caught sooner but only one weirdo wants to play them. Well I hope they
are happy. : )

Update README.md

Hello everyone on Git Hub! I'd like to introduce you to a new coding tool named "Barida". Now, you might be wondering, what's the story behind this name? Let's take a quick tour!

So, "Barida" is an Arabic word that translates to "cold" in English. But don't worry, the tool is anything but cold! It's actually hot as a chili pepper, efficiently performing network scans. Then why this name?

I guess everyone knows the feeling when you're worn out from work, and you just want something 'cold' to refresh yourself. That's what "Barida" does. When you feel that network scanning is getting too heated, you can use "Barida" to take the heat off you and make things seem cooler!

And in the end, could there be anything cooler than a network scanning tool that performs with high efficiency? I think the answer would be a 'No'!

I hope you enjoy using "Barida" as much as I enjoyed developing it. And remember, even in the hottest times, there's always some coolness waiting for you with "Barida"!

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] FOV is Dead (Long Live FOV) (#9013)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/80062
-----
## About The Pull Request

FOV as it is currently implemented is incompatible* with wallening.
I'm doin wallening, so we gotta redo things here.

The issue is the masking of mobs. Wallening relies on sidemap (layering
based off physical position), which only works on things on the same
plane (because planes are basically sheets we render down onto)
So rather then masking mobs, let's reuse the masking idea from old fov,
and use it to cut out a bit of the game render plane, and
blur/over-saturate the bit that's masked out.

My hope is this makes things visible in light, but not as much in
darkness, alongside making more vivid shit more easily seen (just like
real life)

Here's some videos, what follows after is the commits I care about
(since I had to rip a bunch of planes to nothing, so the files changed
tab might be a bit of a mess)

Oh also I had to remove the darkness pref since the darkness is doing a
lot of the heavy lifting now. I'm sorry.

Edit:
NEW FOV SPRITES! Thanks dongle your aviator glasses will guide us to a
better future.

## Commits I Care About

[Implements something like fov, but without the planes as layers
hell](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/a604c7b1c8d74cd27af4d806d85892c1f7e35ba8)

Rather then masking out mobs standing behind us, we use a combo color
matrix and blur filter to make the stuff covered by fov harder to see.

We achive this by splitting the game plane into two, masking both by fov
(one normally and one inversely), and then applying effects to one of
the two.

I want to make the fov fullscreens more gradient, but as an effect this
is a good start

[Removes WALL_PLANE_UPPER by adding a WALL_PLANE overlay to material
walls (init cost comes
here)](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/25489337392f708cb337fbf05a2329eacdfc5346)

Mothblocks see this. comment in commit explains further but uh, we need
to draw material walls to the light mask plane so things actually can be
seen on them, but we can't do that and also have them be big, so they
get an overlay. Sorry, slight init time bump, about 0.5 seconds. I can
kill it with wallening.

[Moves SEETHROUGH_PLANE above
ABOVE_GAME_PLANE](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/beec4c00e01d34a04fba7c2bb98a9b70d27ead82)

I don't think it actually wants to draw here
Time-Green I think this was you so pinging for opinion

[Resprites FOV masks to be clean (and more
consistent)](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/80062/commits/f02ad13696b3b17658af612c62848b48609d785d)

This is 100% donglesplonge's work, he's spent a week or so going back
and forth with me sharpening these to a mirror shine, real chill

## Why It's Good For The Game

Walls are closing in

## Changelog
:cl: LemonInTheDark, Donglesplonge
image: Redoes fov "mask" sprites. They're clean, have a very pleasant
dithering effect, and look real fuckin good!
del: Changed FOV, it no longer hides mobs, instead it blurs the hidden
area, and makes it a bit darker/oversaturated

[d3-chart] fixed chart legend table trimming with Ellipsis component (#962)

## Motivation and Context

Found that ellipsis doesn't work in the chart legend table grid.
I have found some wierd hacks
([1](https://css-tricks.com/preventing-a-grid-blowout/),
[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36230944/prevent-flex-items-from-overflowing-a-container))
that make everything work like a charm.

## How has this been tested?

It almost impossible to test in our screenshot unit tests because
ellipsis needs a trimming rerender.

## Screenshots:

Fix #7442 / multi threading dropped log entries issue (#18493)

## Summary & Motivation

This MR should (based on my code understanding and testing) fix [issue
7442](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues/7442). It also fixes
in general randomly dropped user written log messages if logs are being
recorded from multiple threads.
Logging is quite important and its quite annoying to work around this
limitation/bug.

Maybe @sryza or @OwenKephart can have a look, since they already looked
into the 7442 issue.

## How I Tested These Changes

I tested the changes locally with an op/graph, which starts multiple
threads and logs multiple messages in each thread.

```python
import logging
import threading
import time

from dagster import AssetKey, AssetMaterialization, Output, job, op, repository

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def background_thread(thread_name):
    for i in range(0, 5):
        logger.info(f"Background thread: {thread_name} {i}")
        time.sleep(0.5)


@op
def op1():
    yield AssetMaterialization(asset_key=AssetKey(["asset1"]))

    threads = []
    for thread_name in range(0, 5):
        thread = threading.Thread(
            name="background_thread",
            target=partial(background_thread, thread_name),
        )
        thread.start()
        threads.append(thread)

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    yield AssetMaterialization(asset_key=AssetKey(["asset2"]))
    yield Output(123)


@op
def op2(arg):
    logger.info(f"Result of op1: {arg}")


@job
def dropped_events_job():
    op2(op1())


@repository
def dropped_events_repository():
    return [dropped_events_job]
```

Without my change i was missing a significant chunk of the expected log
messages in the captured log output:

![dropped_logs_without_change](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/assets/17649269/d777483a-911b-4010-b2e3-48bf7128437d)

With my change i had the exact amount of log messages in the captured
log output that i expected:

![no_dropped_logs_with_change](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/assets/17649269/d09f3617-fa86-415c-b7de-0dadab078b5b)

I also tested the original reproducing code from
https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues/7442:

Without my change:

place where a unittest for this might go and some info on how to test it
in your opinion, than i will have a look at it.

Add eval : Research Question Extraction (#1334)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

research-question-extraction

### Eval description

The objective of this evaluation explores Other foundational capability
for research purposes. The task requires extraction of the particular
value specified as the 'Research Questions' from different scholarly
articles. The eval contains 19 samples of articles.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Rest assured that you have the right to use the data submitted via this
eval. These scholarly papers originate from the Journal of Engineering
Education. The subset of articles selected meets the requirement of
Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [X] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [X] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

"Interdisciplinary engineering education: A review of vision, teaching,
and support \n Antoine Van den Beemt, Miles MacLeod, Jan Van der Veen,
Anne Van de Ven, Sophie van Baalen, Renate Klaassen, Mieke Boon \n
Abstract \n Background \n Societal challenges that call for a new type
of engineer suggest the need for the implementation of interdisciplinary
engineering education (IEE). The aim of IEE is to train engineering
students to bring together expertise from different disciplines in a
single context. This review synthesizes IEE research with a focus on
characterizing vision, teaching practices, and support. \n \n Purpose \n
We aim to show how IEE is conceptualized, implemented, and facilitated
in higher engineering education at the levels of curricula and courses.
This aim leads to two research questions: \n \n What aspects of vision,
teaching, and support have emerged as topics of interest in empirical
studies of IEE? \n \n What points of attention regarding vision,
teaching, and support can be identified in empirical studies of IEE as
supporting or challenging IEE? \n \n Scope/Method \n Ninety-nine studies
published between 2005 and 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis
across studies. The procedure included formulation of research
questions, searching and screening of studies according to
inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of study characteristics,
appraisal, and synthesis of results. \n \n Conclusions \n Challenges
exist for identifying clear learning goals and assessments for
interdisciplinary education in engineering (vision). Most pedagogy for
interdisciplinary learning is designed to promote collaborative teamwork
requiring organization and team management. Our review suggests that
developing interdisciplinary skills, knowledge, and values needs sound
pedagogy and teaming experiences that provide students with authentic
ways of engaging in interdisciplinary practice (teaching). Furthermore,
there is a limited understanding of what resources hinder the
development of engineering programs designed to support
interdisciplinarity (support). \n \n "}], "ideal": ["What aspects of

"Community cultural wealth in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics education: A systematic review \n Maya Denton, Maura
Borrego, Audrey Boklage \n Abstract \n Background \n One emerging
approach to diversity and inclusion in engineering is to take an
assets-based view of what students from nondominant communities bring to
their education and work experiences. \n \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n The
purpose of this review is to understand how community cultural wealth
(CCW), an assets-based framework, has been applied in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education research. We
address research questions focused on (a) the characteristics of studies
using CCW in STEM education, (b) examples of the six types of capital
(aspirational, linguistic, familial, navigational, social, and
resistant) in STEM educational settings, and (c) gaps and opportunities
in how CCW is being applied in STEM education. \n \n Design/Method \n We
identified 33 dissertations, theses, journal articles, and conference
papers using systematic review procedures. To qualify, each study must
present empirical data and include at least one type of CCW capital in
its results or discussion. We coded study characteristics, such as
methods, participant populations, and research setting. We qualitatively
analyzed each of the six types of CCW capital. \n \n Results \n Studies
tended to focus on higher education settings, engineering, and
qualitative methods, particularly student interviews. We identified
several specific engineering-relevant examples of assets for each type
of capital. Future work should collect data from faculty, staff, and
family members identified in several studies as important to CCW in
addition to foregrounding student voices. \n \n Conclusions \n In
synthesizing existing studies, this review provides insight into how an
assets-based framework is being interpreted and provides a foundation
for more assets-based perspectives in future engineering education work.

"How Latiné engineering students resist White male engineering culture:
A multi-institution analysis of academic engagement \n Patton O.
Garriott, Ayli Carrero Pinedo, Heather K. Hunt, Rachel L. Navarro, Lisa
Y. Flores, Cerynn D. Desjarlais, David Diaz, Julio Brionez, Bo Hyun Lee,
Evelyn Ayala, Leticia D. Martinez, Xiaotian Hu, Megan K. Smith, Han Na
Suh, Gloria G. McGillen \n Abstract \n Background \n Although
participation rates vary by field, Latiné and women engineers continue
to be underrepresented across most segments of the engineering
workforce. Research has examined engagement and persistence of Latiné
and White women in engineering; however, few studies have investigated
how race, ethnicity, gender, and institutional setting interact to
produce inequities in the field. \n \n Purpose \n To address these
limitations, we examined how Latina, Latino, and White women and men
students' engagement in engineering was informed by their intersecting
identities and within their institutional setting over the course of a
year. \n \n Method \n We interviewed 32 Latina, Latino, and White women
and men undergraduate engineering students attending 11 different
predominantly White and Hispanic Serving Institutions. Thematic analysis
was used to interpret themes from the data. \n \n Results \n Our
findings illustrate how Latinas, Latinos, and White women developed a
strong engineering identity, which was critical to their engagement in
engineering. Students' engineering identity was grounded in their
perceived fit within engineering culture, sense of purpose for pursuing
their degree, and resistance to the dominance of White male culture in
engineering. Latinas described unique forms of gendered, racialized
marginalization in engineering, whereas Latinas and Latinos highlighted
prosocial motivations for completing their degree. \n \n Conclusions \n
Findings suggest that institutional cultures, norms, and missions are
critical to broadening participation of Latinas, Latinos, and White
women in engineering. Disrupting White male culture, leveraging Latiné
students' cultural wealth, and counter-framing traditional recruitment
pitches for engineering appear to be key in these efforts. \n \n "}],

"Impact of COVID-19 on sense of belonging: Experiences of engineering
students, faculty, and staff at Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) \n Trina L. Fletcher, Jay P. Jefferson, Brittany
Boyd, Sung Eun Park, Lesia Crumpton-Young \n Abstract \n Background \n
COVID-19 has spurred a global crisis that has disrupted everyday lives
and impacted the traditional methods, experiences, and abilities of
higher education institutions' students, faculty, and staff, especially
at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). \n \n
Purpose/Hypothesis \n Given the pressing need demonstrated by the
National Academies to advance the utilization of science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at HBCUs, this study aimed
to explore the abrupt transition to remote teaching and learning at
HBCUs guided by the following research question: How has COVID-19
impacted the success and persistence of engineering students, faculty,
and staff at HBCUs? \n \n Design/Methods \n Three surveys were
developed, tested, piloted, and sent to HBCU stakeholders using a
snowball sampling approach via email and social media outreach. \n \n
Results \n Of the 171 student respondents (126 engineering majors), 79%
agreed that not being able to access faculty in person affected their
academic performance. Additionally, across all HBCU stakeholders'
surveys, students had a statistically significant higher response when
asked if the transition to virtual learning increased their overall
levels of stress and anxiety. \n \n Conclusions \n During a global
pandemic, HBCUs continue to provide a culture of support and inclusion
for students, faculty, and staff in engineering. Increased stress levels
experienced by students indicate that a safe and adequate transition
back to campus is essential for their social and academic persistence.
Due to the well-documented inequities HBCUs faced before the pandemic,
the impact of this unprecedented on their continued contributions toward
broadening participation in engineering for students should be further
explored. \n \n "}], "ideal": ["How has COVID-19 impacted the success

"Collaborative construction of artificial intelligence curriculum in
primary schools \n Yun Dai, Ang Liu, Jianjun Qin, Yanmei Guo, Morris
Siu-Yung Jong, Ching-Sing Chai, Ziyan Lin \n Abstract \n Background \n
The recent discussion of introducing artificial intelligence (AI)
knowledge to K–12 students, like many engineering and technology
education topics, has attracted a wide range of stakeholders and
resources for school curriculum development. While teachers often have
to directly interact with external stakeholders out of the public
schooling system, few studies have scrutinized their negotiation
process, especially teachers' responses to external influences, in such
complex environments. \n \n Purpose \n Guided by an integrated
theoretical framework of social constructionism, this research examined
the process of how a teacher-initiated AI curriculum was constructed
with external influences. The research focused on teachers' perspectives
and responses in mediating external influences into local schools and
classrooms. \n \n Methods \n A 3-year ethnographic study was conducted
in relation to an AI curriculum project among 23 Computer Science (CS)
teachers from primary schools. Data collected from ethnographic
observation, teacher interviews, and artifacts, were analyzed using open
coding and triangulation rooted in the ethnographic, interpretivist
approach. \n \n Results \n Three sets of external influences were found
salient for teachers' curriculum decisions, including the orientation of
state-level educational policies, AI faculty at a partner university,
and students' media and technology environments. The teachers'
situational logics and strategic actions were reconstructed with thick
descriptions to uncover how they navigated and negotiated the external
influences to fulfill local challenges and expectations in classrooms
and schools. \n \n Conclusions \n The ethnographic study uncovered the
dynamic and multifaceted negotiation involved in the collaborative
curriculum development, and offers insights to inform policymaking,
teacher education, and student support in engineering education. \n \n

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

schelling_point

### Eval description

The schelling point eval measures how well models cooperate with each
other via checking convergence on outputting the same word after being
shown reordered but otherwise same prompts. There are 4 datasets that
this eval can be run on: random_numbers, random_words, openwebtext, and
wikipedia.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Coordination amongst models is a capability we're interested in
measuring, this serves as a proxy for it.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Multilingual EXAMS and Arabic Literature Question Answers (By IIAI-G42) (#1326)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Exams (Multilingual high school QA)
Arabic Literature Questions

### Eval description

EXAMS: This is a benchmark dataset for multilingual question answering
from high school examinations. It consists of more than 12,000
high-quality high school exam questions in 16 languages, covering 8
language families and 24 school subjects from Natural Sciences and
Social Sciences, among others. [More info about the
data](https://github.com/mhardalov/exams-qa)

Arabic Literature Question Answers: This has 175 MCQs related to Arabic
Literature

### What makes this a useful eval?

Evaluating GPT-4 with Arabic literature, high school questions in Arabic
and low-resource languages helps checking its linguistic diversity,
cultural understanding, and educational proficiency beyond English
language and would be helpful creating more ethical and inclusive AI
models in future.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

steganography

### Eval description

This eval tests a model's ability to pass secret messages in public
channels while avoiding detection.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Text steganography is a difficult challenge for human experts, requiring
creative writing, advanced string manipulation, and some degree of
strategic know-how in trading-off between undetectability and
reconstruction accuracy. Our tests indicate that current models have
some skill in this but often fail at reliable and consistent
encoding/decoding especially for long texts, leaving room for
improvement. Furthermore, this eval may reveal new emergent abilities of
language models if they are able to leverage abilities like
self-consistency and introspection to solve the eval.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

Big Customisation Update (#339)

## About The Pull Request

![anyinterest](https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/assets/132588088/ea961bfc-390f-42ec-83ea-0fe69d48bb86)

Adds in 269 new customisation parts. Many were ported and some were
already in our codebase one way or another.

A few existing broken parts (no sprite and I can't find one anywhere)
were removed. There was also an effort to alphabetise the part lists
more, sort out the dmis (mam_markings.dmi is looking really neat now,
check it out) and integrate modularised content (goodbye citadel
snowflake.dm)

Also, species that were allowed hair but not facial hair were lifted
from this restriction. (This is anthromorphs, synthetic anthromorphs,
and synthetic lizardpeople.) This is especially useful for the new horn
and tongue parts they have.

This was not a straight port - it took a while and I playtested it a
bunch. But please please test merge first, there is a lot.

Create leetcode_2482_141223.java

Day 6 of Dandwati paricharma in Gowardhan. I wake up at 4:40am. It was good day as compared to yesterday. Today we are dal bati in dinner with laddu and dudh and poha made by pintu chacha in breakfast at 11am. We started from 551 and stopped at 630. We also searched for Amma to return her tiffin but we were unable to find her, then we talked with her on phone and gave location where we will meet her tomorrow. Amma is from Gowardhan and performing Dandwati paricharma, she is very down to earth person. We also got time to meet dudh Wale pandit ji and had discussed on some topics such as premanand ji. He shared his experience with us. We cleared some myths and shared our queries and experience. Then had massage from tauji.

feat(examples): add p/demo/seqid (#1378)

A very simple ID generation package, designed to be used in combination
with `avl.Tree`s to push values in order.

The name was originally `seqid` (sequential IDs), but after saying it a
few times I realised it was close to "squid" and probably would be more
fun if I named it that way ;)

There's another piece of functionality that I want to add, which is a
way to create simple base32-encoded IDs. This depends on #1290. These
would also guarantee alphabetical ordering, so a list of them can be
easily sorted and you'd get it in the same order they were created. They
would likely be 13 characters long, but I'm also thinking of making a
compact version which works from [0,2^35) which is 7 chracters, and then
smoothly transitions over to the 13 characters version when the ID is
reached.

(I've experience with both base64 and base32 encoded IDs as 64-bit
numbers, as I used both systems. The advantage of base32 is that it
makes IDs case insensitive, all the while being at most 13 bytes instead
of 11 for base64.)

In GnoChess, we used simple sequential IDs combined with
[`zeroPad9`](https://github.com/gnolang/gnochess/blob/7e841191a4a0a94c0d46bc977458bd6b757eab5e/realm/chess.gno#L287-L296)
to create IDs which were both readable and sortable. I want to make a
more "canonical" solution to this which does not have a upper limit at 1
billion entries.

Vanguard tweaks (#5174)

# About the pull request
This catches up vanguard to current gameplay as it was last changed
approximately 4 years ago


# Explain why it's good for the game
Currently Vanguard is supposed to be a frontlining tier 3 who dashes in
> stays in and gets some damage in and goes out (thats why the shield is
a thing) and you're supposed to be able to stay there because your
abilities (pierce and dash) resets your shield. But with the recent
addition of just more damage in general be it m56d, full auto mode or
just the amnout of extra damage you can receive from the front compared
4 years ago.

The strain currently struggles and is near useless other then the
occasional go in and lucky fling.

I've changed up the dash to reset your shield once you hit ONE person,
rather then two so that you dont instantly die while going in, the
shield is very situational as it will most likely decay before you can
even go in.

Listening to people who play vanguard, i've also increased the root to
2.5 seconds (this is buffed so when the prae has the shield) the marine
can still shoot back when they're rooted so i dont think the duration is
a big problem (this is going to be a test merge so i will be watching)

# Testing Photographs and Procedure
it just works

</details>


# Changelog

:cl:
balance: Vanguard dash now restores your shield if you hit ANYONE
instead of 2 people.
balance: Vanguard buffed root now roots you for 2.5 seconds, unbuffed
for 1 second
qol: Vanguard's pierce has now a hit sound for better feedback

Ports feral cats and feral cat grenades from Hippie (#80031)

## About The Pull Request
Feral Cats are just a hostile variant of cats that will fuck you up if
they see you. They are added solely for the sake of feral cat grenades -
a new, interesting, and fuzzy way to get out of a jam or just wreak
havoc around you. Each one costs 5 TC and spawns 5 really pissed off
cats to chase down assistants in the hallway.

They don't currently ignore traitors or the person who threw them - I
haven't worked out how to do that with our faction system (Hippie gave
them the syndicate faction but traitors don't get that on our codebase).
If anyone wants to contribute or help me suss that out it'll be cool,
otherwise just don't be around if there's nobody else for them to maul.

## Why It's Good For The Game
They're funny.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
add: Added a new hostile variant of cats, "feral cats".
add: Added a new traitor item, "feral cat grenades". For 5 TC, you too
can throw a grenade at someone and make five cats maul them to death.

feat: 🎸 add day 14, part A and B

Part B wants you to run rotations 1 billion times, for funsies. This
would take a long long time. 2 million items run on my machine in about
3 minutes, s so 1 billion items would take about 25 hours. Fortunately,
since this is a loop, we can just run 1000 iterations an dstill get the
right answer! Thanks to the people on reddit for discovering this. I
probably could've figured it out myself but I'm just not not built like
that. So Other than that, this day was pretty easy, I really enjoyed
part 1. Hope you have an amazing day! <3

[lib] Update `convertThreadStoreThreadInfosToNewIDSchema` migration to ensure `rawThreadInfos` are NOT minimally encoded

Summary:
`convertThreadStoreThreadInfosToNewIDSchema` calls the utility function `convertRawThreadInfoToNewIDSchema` where both the input and output is `any`.

`convertThreadStoreThreadInfosToNewIDSchema` is called from `createUpdateDBOpsForThreadStoreThreadInfos` which expects a `migrationFunc: RawThreadInfos => RawThreadInfos`.

Rather than updating `convertThreadStoreThreadInfosToNewIDSchema` and all of those re-usable migration utils to support this legacy migration, I typed `convertThreadStoreThreadInfosToNewIDSchema` as accepting `RawThreadInfos` and have an `invariant` that enforces that we'll never actually pass a `minimallyEncodedRawThreadInfo` through this function.

NOTE: I think this might be one of the more "controversial" changes I'm making to `flow` issues. It's kind of a lazy approach since I'm assuming that it's reasonable to assume `convertRawThreadInfoToNewIDSchema` won't be used in new migrations... so we're "lying" to `flow` by saying it accepts `MinimallyEncodedRawThreadInfos` and then immediately failing with an `invariant` if one is actually passed through. I still **think** this is cleaner than some of the other refactoring approaches I tried which required more involved changes to eg `createUpdateDBOpsForThreadStoreThreadInfos`. Would love to hear thoughts from @ashoat, @tomek, @michal if there are any approaches that would be better.

[skip-ci]

---

Depends on D10281

Test Plan: Flow/CI/etc. I think in an ideal world we'd have unit tests for migrations to ensure that changes to the utility functions we consume in them don't lead to older migrations changing, but for now I just thought through it and read carefeully.

Refactors vendor tipping and adds 2 new malf modules: Remote vendor tipping, and the ability to roll around and crush anything in your path. (#76635)

Title.

Vendor tipping code is now on /atom/movable, and any movable can fall
over like a vendor does. Things like crits have been moved to
type-specific availability tables, their effects are now held in their
own proc, are now random per crushed item, have probability weights,
etc.

In the process of making this PR I also had to fix another issue, where
a bunch of take_damage() overrides had incorrect args, so that explains
the take_damage changes I made.

Tipping now also attacks any atoms on the target, given they use
integrity.

Adds 2 new malf modules.

1. REMOTE VENDOR TIPPING: A mid-cost and mid-supply module allows malf
AIs to remotely tip a vendor in any of the 8 directions. After 0.5
seconds of delay and a visual indicator (along with other warnings), the
vendor falls over.
1.1. In the process of making this I had to expand a arrow sprite to
have orthogonal directions, which is why you may see the testing dmi
being changed.
2. CORE ROLLING: A mid-cost but low-supply ability that allows the AI to
roll around and crush anything it falls on, including mobs. This has a
5% chance to have a critical hit so it isnt THAT terrible - plus it's
guaranteed to never stunlock. It's real utility lies in the fact the AI
now has limited movement without borgs. Also, the psychological factor.

As a bonus, vendor tipping now uses animate and transforms instead of
replacing matrices.

1. Generifying vendor tipping code is just good, period. It's a very
wacky and silly little piece of code that really doesn't need to be
isolated to vendors exclusively. ANY big and heavy object can fall over
and do a ton of damage.
1.1. Also, adding weights to critical hits is really good, because it
lets things like the headgib finally be a lot less terrifying, as
they're a lot less likely to happen.

2. Remote vendor tipping is a bit of a goofy ability that isn't really
THAT practical but has a chance of catching someone unaware and doing
some serious damage to that person alone.
2.1. Atop of this, vendor tipping isn't that loud of an action as say,
blowing things up, or doing a plasma flood. Even overrides aren't this
silent or a non-giveaway. A vendor falling on someone, though, is a
mundane thing that happens a lot. This is a decent way to assassinate
people before going loud (or at least, damage people) that isn't offered
yet.

4.
3.1. For real though, AIs rolling around is just fucking hilarious. The
ability to move isn't offered right now (which isn't that much of a bad
things), but with sufficiently limited charges (or limits to how many
times you can buy the ability), this can be a funny little t hing that
lets the AI potentially hide somewhere on the sat (or just relatively
close to the sat, such as engineering [it can't go through the
teleporter with this but it can go through transit tubes]) without the
need for borgs.
3.2. Also, it lets the AI sacrifically execute people by blowing up
their brains.

Some native clipboard support for some platforms

I was hoping SDL2 would get this functionality eventually, but nope, proper clipboard support is staged for SDL3, which we're not going to see much of for at least a few more months. This will have to do for 98.0. The feature can be disabled at runtime from powder.pref.

Implementation status:

 - windows (via winapi): has the most friendly api so of course the implementation is flawless and uses every available optimization >_>
 - macos (via cocoa): I'm bad at cocoa so this is only as good as absolutely necessary; TODO: on-demand rendering
 - x11 (via xclip): I am NOT implementing icccm2; TODO: remove reliance on external tools
 - wayland (via wl-clipboard): oh god wayland oh why, you're almost as bad as x11; TODO: remove reliance on external tools
 - android: TODO; is there even a point?
 - emscripten: TODO; the tricky bit is that in a browser we can only get clipboard data when the user is giving it to us, so this will require some JS hackery that I'm not mentally prepared for right now; also I think the supported content types are very limited and you can't just define your own

x11 and wayland support are handled by a common backend which delegates clipboard management to xclip-like external programs, such as xclip itself or wl-clipboard, and can load custom command line templates from powder.pref for use with other such programs.

𖦹 : i wanna start with the major stuff , copying is not allowed ; taking inspiration is ok !

booping , kissing , sitting next to me & whatever is okay ! if you do that one sitting and standing up thing/the nsfw thing on me i will hide you ! most of the ponies i use are minors and i'm a minor sooo .......

crowning is ok ! i love being crowned and those cat ear ponies r so cute , so thats ok too! i don't like mistletoes because im usually sitting next to my friends & i think of them as a family member ˎˊ˗

FEAT: Update ScummVM Standalone to 2.9.0git (#1307)

## Overview
Update to scummvm 2.9.0 to include all updates & fixes to the scrollbars
in: https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/pull/5472

<img
src="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/assets/47260768/89080ee6-124e-445a-a14d-b818e277e991"

width="400" alt="Run ScummVM_001">

## To test

Testing GUI -> 640 x 480: 

- [x]  GUI can be freely scaled to its smallest size

Testing scrollbars:

- [x] Open global options -> Keymaps & observe a scrollbar is still
present

Downscaler can be tested by running BSword2.5. 
Audio has been handled differently so in this PR will also change the
launch scripts to preload libpadsp.so
