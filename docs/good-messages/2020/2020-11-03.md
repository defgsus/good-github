<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/cryptape/rust-numext/blob/v0.1.6/CHANGELOG.md">rust-numext's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>

### Major Updates

- Use features to let all structs be optional.
- Should NOT consider hashes as numbers.
  - Add methods to replace numerical methods for hashes.
    - `zero() -> empty()`
    - `is_zero() -> is_empty()`
    - `is_max() -> is_full()`
  - **BREAKING CHANGE** Remove `checked_neg(..)` for hashes.
- Upgrade dependencies.
  - `quote v0.6 -> v1.0`
  - `syn v0.15 -> v1.0`
  - `proc-macro2 v0.4 -> v1.0`
  - Remove dependencies "proc-macro-hack" for crates in the workspace.
    - Update the minimum supported version of rust toolchain to `1.45.0` for the feature: [Stabilizing function-like procedural macros in expressions, patterns, and statements](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/07/16/Rust-1.45.0.html#stabilizing-function-like-procedural-macros-in-expressions-patterns-and-statements).
  - Use `thiserror` instead of `failure` since `failure` is officially deprecated.

### Fixed Bugs

- Constructors can not handle short inputs correctly ([#42]).
- `as_fixed_bytes_mut(&mut self)` return an immutable reference ([#42]).
- Avoid trigger [a rustc bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75533) which causes errors when build with target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` ([#54]).

#### Notice

**The latest rust tool chain is not friendly for old proc-macros (there are a lot of issues, for example: compile errors).**
**But after this PR, we still have few crates depend on very old proc-macros crates: `enum-display-derive` and `wasm-*`.**

Kimi wa ne tashika ni ano toki watashi no soba ni ita
Itsudatte itsudatte itsudatte sugu yoko de waratteita nakushitemo
Torimodosu kimi wo I will never leave you.

If you wanna battle, then I'll take it to the street
Where there's no rules
Take off the gloves ref, please step down
Gotta prove my skills so get down

My lyrical dempsey roll about to smack down now
Gotta shoot to kill and shoot the skill
Don't you be afraid, man's gotta do how it feels
Six to seven to eight to nine ten
I flip the script to make it to the top ten, go

Dreamless dorm, ticking clock
I walk away from the soundless room
Windless night, moonlight melts
My ghostly shadow into the lukewarm gloom

Nightly dance of bleeding swords
Reminds me that I still live

Every man's gotta fight the fear
I'm the first to admit it
Sheer thoughts provoke the new era

Become a big terror, but my only rival is my shadow
Rewind then play it back and fix my own error
Get low to the ground, it's getting better
Like I told you before, double up and take more cheddar

L to the J, say stay laced, here's my card, B
Royal flush and I'm the ace

enhancement(aws_ec2_metadata transform): Add internal events (#4480)

* enhancement(aws_ec2_metadata transform): Add internal events

This adds a few internal events to the aws_ec2_metadata transform:

* AwsEc2MetadataEventProcessed: fired any time an event flows through
  the transform. Note that the event might not be annotated with any
  fields if the EC2 metadata refresh was never successful.
* AwsEc2MetadataRefreshComplete: fired whenever the EC2 metadata refresh
  executes. Note that this just means the refresh ran, but not that it
  was able to refresh any fields. More on this below.
* AwsEc2MetadataRequestFailed: Fired any time a EC2 metadata field fails
  to be fetched.

This also makes a couple of changes to the way errors are handled and
propagated within the metadata refresh. Previously it would swallow
requests that returned with a non-200 status code, but propagate any
other errors up (like network connection errors). It felt odd to me to
treat the HTTP status code errors differently, so I modified the
functions fetching the metadata to simply propagate up errors. I then
added wrapper functions that simply emit any errors and return an
Option<Bytes> containing the value that was requested. This feels more
consistant to me.

The refresh task part of this transform is a bit different in that it
can experience partial failures that we don't want to halt the fetching
and refresh of additional fields. For this reason, I added the
AwsEc2MetadataRequestFailed event that can be used to track individual
request failures, but there is no general refresh task failure. Instead,
I just have an AwsEc2MetadataRefreshComplete event that demarks that the
refresh task ran at all.

* Switch from individual request errors to refresh errors

This changes the `aws_ec2_metadata` metadata transform to be all or
nothing as opposed to allowing partial refreshes. This results in easier
to reason about metrics and errors (in my opinion) as it is a simple
pass / fail and we avoid ending up in possibly partially updated
information.

Refresh failures are still non-fatal; simply logging rather than failing
events flowing through the transform.

#[Learning Experience](https://www.githubs.cn/)
**Personal feelings: <u>EXCITING & CHALLENGING</u>**
##Using a programme to briefly summarize it :
```python
print("To be honest, it\'s an amazing experience to learn Git and have a Github acountant of my own, alongside filled with hardships too.Nevertheless,I managed to get over all the problems by searching for information on the Internet and watching vedios at Bili Bili. For me,what matters is not to gain success,but to attain new approaches to thinking about questions.")
```
 *** 
###Expectations :
```c
 #include<stdio.h>
 int main()
 {
	int x;
	int n=0;
	printf("Please input an int at ramdom:\n");
	scanf("%d",&x);
	n++;
	x/=10;
	while(x>0){
	n++;
	x/=10;	
	}
	printf("Your int is composed of %d numbers!\n",n);
	return 0;
 }
```

I want to have the capacity of counting bank notes just like the programme above in spite of there being a **limit** for it.   
Perhaps someday I will also gain the equivalent wealth,when that girl stands by me and parents smile on me.
