Include full register state in ARM Cortex M Exception Stack Frame (ESF)

**Is your enhancement proposal related to a problem? Please describe.**

To debug hard-to-reproduce faults/panics, it's helpful to get the full
register state at the time the fault occurred. This enables recovering
full backtraces and the state of local variables at the time a fault
took place. Pretty much all OSs and even some RTOS (i.e mynewt,
esp-idf) support this in some fashion (i.e coredumps, mini-dumps,
linux kernel oops, etc) and it would be awesome if Zephyr could too!

Today this is not possible with the ARM Cortex M Zephyr port for two main reasons:

1). A [copy](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/a1b77fd589dbe7284c17b029f251426a724abd47/arch/arm/core/aarch32/cortex_m/fault.c#L961-L962)
of the original hardware exception stack frame is made before calling
k_sys_fatal_error_handler(). This means the stack pointer prior to the
exception cannot be recovered making it impossible to recover the full
backtrace.

2). Registers that are callee-saved (r4-r11 & exc_return) are not
collected in z_arm_fault() which means when k_sys_fatal_error_handler
is called the register state is not readily available. This
information is needed to accurately recover local variable state
leading up to a crash.


**Describe the solution you'd like**

To fix these issues and enable better diagnostic facilities, I'd like
to update the [`z_arch_esf_t` implementation for ARM aarch32](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/a1b77fd589dbe7284c17b029f251426a724abd47/include/arch/arm/aarch32/exc.h#L76-L92)
to pass the original hardware exception frame pointer as well as
callee-saved registers.


```c
struct __full_esf {
	struct __esf *exception_frame;
	struct __callee_saved_esf *callee_regs;
};

typedef struct __full_esf z_arch_esf_t;
```

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

I think there are several different ways the full stack frame could be
exposed from [z_arm_fault()](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/a1b77fd589dbe7284c17b029f251426a724abd47/arch/arm/core/aarch32/cortex_m/fault.c#L934-L978). I
tried to use an approach that would allow the information to be
exposed via the k_sys_fatal_error_handler API.

**Additional context**

I've been using patches to achieve this behavior on the last few
Zephyr releases but I'd love to upstream the work so it's more
accessible to others. I've put together a working implementation
[here]() against the current master branch. Happy to open a PR for
review if the idea makes sense to folks!
