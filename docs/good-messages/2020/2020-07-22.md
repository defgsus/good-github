Post Op

Here you see the fucked repo sleeping soundly after it's emergency surgery. It had a terrible pain in the ass, making it unable to perform the duties expected of it. Luckily we were able to save most of the ass, and it is expected to make a full recovery.

WIP Part 2 : Gone with Wind32 Titlebar

- [x] Maximize button is only visible when not already maximized
- [x] Restore button is only visibile when Window is maximized
- [x] WindowRootGrid is now called WindowRoot
- [x] Added a WindowRoot view model
- [x] Added a Window State Enum for Minimized, Maximized and Other

Please see my prior check-in for the first push towards the effort
to create a lookless Window where the Win32 border and Titlebar
are never used, but all features they would provide still exist.  Other
than cleanup and my normal addiction to refactoring, most of the
work is complete for this feature.

With what I have now, there will be some confusion when it comes
to a UIElements child/children/Content etc.  For example, the
WindowRoot inherits from the UWP LayoutTransformControl that
actually inherits from Grid.  The LayoutTransformControl has a
member called Child.  When I inherit from LayoutTransformControl
I set the Child with another Grid that has two rows.  One row is
in fact the Titlebar and the other is the clients content (what we
normally think of as the Window.Content.  I place the client content
into the second row by providing a property called Content.  So,
when you look at the inheritence path, the LayoutTransformControl
has Grid.Children that it provides access to via its single
LayoutTransformControl.Child.  I inherit from this control and
provide the WindowRoot.Content property.   I am not sure which
is more confusing, my explanation of this or the implementation of
it.

The TitleBar control had four event handlers that were dead code
that I removed.

In Program.cs I updated the InitializeServices method to change
the scope of several injected services to be Transients because
that scope causes much less concerns about lifetime and even
though my example is simple, I didn't want it to be copied and
pasted into the wild as a bunch of singletons.

Until this check-in, the Titlebar was part of the MainPage (was
once called the SettingsPage).  However, I pushed that logic
up closer to the actual Window itself because I do not want
a page to have to concern itself with the Window's titlebar.

On a final random check-in note, I never like the fact that XAML
files need to provide a default parameter-less constructor to
please the Visual Studio designer.  When using nullable, it causes
a real pain because the existence of that constructor means that
you have to protect those properties by null checking them or
disable the related analyzer warnings.  Even though WinUI
doesn't work with a designer right now, I figured I would code
this as if it does.

ruining all the images by resizing them and making them fuzzy and bad!

- yeah I know I'm just gonna need to redownload all of these images once I find an appropriate solution (aka figuring out how to make the increased sprite size work for the layout and not the other way around)
- but yeah these party sprites look realllllllllyyyy bad but there are already several that look terrible so might as well make everything look terrible until I can be so frustrated I have to fix it
- also really need to find out how to resize things without making them terrible because they look so bad and I hate myself for being so bad at everything

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

oh, that's a baseball! (#14)

* [READY] Disarm Rework: Shove that Dickhead (#42958)

The War on Stun Based Combat Phase II
About The Pull Request

A massive change in gameplay that affects more than just disarm. Hopefully in an interesting way.
There's two parts to this, part 1 is that disarm's functionality has been entirely stripped out and replaced with essentially a new purpose: Shoving.
Shoving is the new action that occurs when clicking on people while in the disarm intent.
Shoving someone pushes them one tile away from you. If there is otherwise nothing blocking them, they are slowed down very slightly for 3 seconds. If you shove someone again while they are slowed, it knocks ranged weapons out of their active hand. I'm not sure about this part and may buff or remove it depending on how it works in practice.
If the blocking tile has a table on it, they're pushed onto it knocking them over for 3 seconds. If it has another human on it, it knocks them both over, the collateral victim for 1 second instead of 3. If the tile is otherwise blocked besides them, it knocks them down for 3 seconds. All knockdowns cause you to drop items, and do not stun at all and can be immediately crawled away from.
However, once knocked down, if you are shoved again it paralyzes for 4 seconds. This is the same length as the old disarm push. It cannot be chained or extended, shoving them again while they're paralyzed does not extend the length of the paralyze. Once it ends, the person will be up and moving.
Now you might be thinking, why would I want to shove someone unless they're against a wall?
Here's part 2:
Moving into someone in a hostile intent no longer pushes them. They'll stay where they are and your movement is blocked. If you want to get someone out of the way, you need to shove them.
Why It's Good For The Game

Changes a previously RNG based mechanic that was basically just spammed until you got that lucky "I win" roll into a positioning based utility that has a point to use in many situations. Livens up simple melee combat and makes fighting in confined areas more lively and unpredictable. Introduces some new epic gamer strats, I've been playing around and it's pretty fun.
Also why not try something really crazy and see what happens? If it's shit it can be reverted :^)
Changelog

Special thanks to whoneedsspace, the inventor of the singlecap, for deshitcodifying this hard.

cl
add: Disarm has been reworked, instead of an rng based system instead it pushes people away from you. If their movement is blocked it knocks them over. Shoving someone twice quickly will knock ranged weapons out of their hands.
del: Moving into humans while in a hostile intent no longer pushes them.
tweak: Passive grabs need to be resisted out of while on the ground, and can't be directly crawled out of

"12:35pm. Done with breakfast. Ok me, remember the powerlust and resume. I'll have plenty of time to slack when the agents are training. Until then, I need to burn with the desire.

Leave the stray thoughts aside, and move like a shot arrow.

...Ok, I've redesigned the whole thing to remove the expected, message distinction from the error type.

```fs
let process_error (line, ers : (Range * TokenizerError) list) : (string * VSCRange) [] =
```

Now let me redesign this.

First I will change the `Range` to `VSCRange`.

```fs
let process_error (line, ers : (Range * TokenizerError) list) : (string * VSCRange) [] =
    let ers = ers |> List.mapi (fun i (r,x) -> let i = line + i in x, ({line=i; character=r.from}, {line=i; character=r.nearTo}))
```

Ah, wait I was wrong. That function line processes error on a single line. That makes things even easier.

1:05pm.

```fs
let process_error (k,v) =
    let expecteds, messages = v |> Array.partition (fun x -> Char.IsLower(x,0))
    let ex () = match expecteds with [|x|] -> sprintf "Expected: %s" x | x -> sprintf "Expected one of: %s" (String.concat ", " x)
    let f l = String.concat "\n" l
    if Array.isEmpty expecteds then f messages, k
    elif Array.isEmpty messages then ex (), k
    else f (Array.append [|ex (); ""; "Other error messages:"|] messages), k
let process_errors (line, ers : (Range * TokenizerError) list []) : (string * VSCRange) [] =
    ers |> Array.mapi (fun i l ->
        let i = line + i
        l |> List.toArray |> Array.map (fun (r,x) -> x, ({line=i; character=r.from}, {line=i; character=r.nearTo}))
        )
    |> Array.concat
    |> Array.groupBy snd
    |> Array.map ((fun (k,v) -> k, Array.map fst v) >> process_error)
```

Let me do it like this.

This is a nice stable way of doing it. I'll be able to reuse `process_error` for the parser.

```fs
let messages, expecteds = v |> Array.partition (fun x -> Char.IsUpper(x,0))
```

Let me make this the condition.

1:15pm.

```fs
let show_block_parsing_error line (l : (Config.VSCRange * ParserErrors) list) =
    List.toArray l |> Array.groupBy fst
    |> Array.map (fun ((a,b),v) -> Tokenize.process_error (({a with line=line+a.line}, {b with line=line+b.line}), Array.map (snd >> show_parser_error) v))
```

It came out quite simple as expected.

```fs
let show_block_parsing_error line (l : (Config.VSCRange * ParserErrors) list) =
    l |> List.groupBy fst
    |> List.map (fun ((a,b),v) ->
        let k = {a with line=line+a.line}, {b with line=line+b.line}
        let v = List.toArray v |> Array.map (snd >> show_parser_error)
        Tokenize.process_error (k, v)
        )
```

Let me do it like this. It is a bit longer this way, but should be a tad more efficient and readable.

1:30pm. Unlike say type errors, parser error will be relatively localized, so there won't be much inefficiency from traversing the whole block and converting them every time like this. I'll be able to bear with it.

Ok, now...I think I have everything I need. At this point, I am ready to just try it out.

Let me do it. It is the long awaited first step. After the debugging session, some the sematic highlighting using parsing pass. Once I have that, I'll be complete.

Let me take a short break here."

Fuck you

Whoever made this value so high deserves to be fucking lynched.

Do not try to execute a record if there is nothing already recorded.

All this work, is dedicated to Zoi, for thirty years a gorgeous companion and mother
of our four kids as Zoi means life here actually.

She was born a day like this, when the humans touched the moon, but a day like this,
it was also the first whole day i remember crystal clear in my life (20 July of 1974).
I remember walking with my mother coming from my beloved grand parents. My father had
to go to the army that same day, because there was a war. I remember an extraordinary
bright night sky, though the moon was new.
