I have the basics of my OBJ parser down, as in I think I can read all the sample files. I do need to make a special case for material names that have spaces, because whoever made obj files decided fuck you. I also started working on geometry, but I'm not sure if having a separate structure for polygons is even necessary. It does make things somewhat easier to categorize however, so perhaps I will use it.

Rebalance spellbooks

Notable changes:

* delay is now 10*lvl, and the delay slot of the objects.c macro has been removed and mapped to level. delay is still checked in the spell.c code, since it doesn't matter which and in case of a future instant-spell-read intrinisic, or something like that. idk just didn't see a point bothering to remove it, not like it's vanishing from obj->oc_delay anyway.
* Failure rates modified. Base is still 4+int+ulvl/2 - bklvl*2. Modifiers are blessed (+10, down from 100% success), cursed (-10, up from 0% success), ward (+10), lenses (+2). New modifier: current spell memory. If the spell is known by you, you get a modifier that scales linearly up to +10 with the spell memory (so 90% memory is +9).
* Failure effects modified. The format is still rn2(lev), where lev -=1 for being ward. Also decrements effective lev now if the spell is known in general, so a re-read that fails will have nicer effects. The effects are changed to (in order of diff, 0-6 inclusive):
** 0: teleport you with 3/4 chance, unbless the book / curse the book, if cursed always teles.
** 1: agg monster.
** 2: blind for rn1(100, 250) turns (250+rnd(100).
** 3: book bites you, dealing rn1(5, 3) damage.
** 4: freezes you for rn1(lvl*2, lvl*2)
** 5: contact poison, unchanged.
** 6: explosive energy, messaging changed a tad and now checks 1/2 spell damage because it's funny
* Spellbooks can now be read when you still have memory. Will warn at 10%+ and prompt yn before restoring fully. Infinite spells will always refill fully with no warn prompt.
* Minor change: spellbooks now blank at the end of the reading that sets their charges to 0, instead of the reading after that (which will fail).

Merge #5101

5101: Add expect -- a light-weight alternative to insta r=matklad a=matklad

This PR implements a small snapshot-testing library. Snapshot updating is done by setting an env var, or by using editor feature (which runs  a test with env-var set). 

Here's workflow for updating a failing test:

![expect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/85926956-28afa080-b8a3-11ea-9260-c6d0d8914d0b.gif)

Here's workflow for adding a new test:

![expect-fresh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/85926961-306f4500-b8a3-11ea-9369-f2373e327a3f.gif)

Note that colorized diffs are not implemented in this PR, but should be easy to add (we already use them in test_utils). 

Main differences from insta (which is essential for rust-analyzer development, thanks @mitsuhiko!):
* self-updating tests, no need for a separate tool
* fewer features (only inline snapshots, no redactions)
* fewer deps (no yaml, no persistence)
* tighter integration with editor
* first-class snapshot object, which can be used to write test functions (as opposed to testing macros)
* trivial to tweak for rust-analyzer needs, by virtue of being a workspace member. 

I think eventually we should converge to a single snapshot testing library, but I am not sure that `expect` is exactly right, so I suggest rolling with both insta and expect for some time (if folks agree that expect might be better in the first place!). 

# Editor Integration Implementation 

The thing I am most excited about is the ability to update a specific snapshot from the editor. I want this to be available to other snapshot-testing libraries (cc @mitsuhiko, @aaronabramov), so I want to document how this works. 

The ideal UI here would be a code action (:bulb:). Unfortunately, it seems like it is impossible to implement without some kind of persistence (if you save test failures into some kind of a database, like insta does, than you can read the database from the editor plugin). Note that it is possible to highlight error by outputing error message in rustc's format. Unfortunately, one can't use the same trick to implement a quick fix. 

For this reason, expect makes use of another rust-analyzer feature -- ability to run a single test at the cursor position. This does need some expect-specific code in rust-analyzer unfortunately. Specifically, if rust-analyzer notices that the cursor is on `expect!` macro, it adds a special flag to runnable's JSON. However, given #5017 it is possible to approximate this well-enough without rust-analyzer integration. Specifically, an extension can register a special runner which checks (using regexes) if rust-anlyzer runnable covers text with specific macro invocation and do special magic in that case. 

closes #3835

"9:25am. Considering I went to bed at nearly 1am and have been lounging in bed for a while now, I really thought it would be a lot later. Let me chill for a while and then I will start. The same as usual.

9:50am. Ok, just a bit more and I will start.

10:05am. Let me start. I got over my grogginess a little.

> Documents are addressed by URI which means you they have scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment (just like a web address). Do not assume that all document use the file scheme, there are many other schemes used and you must always check schemes.

Got this reply. I guess I'll check out the schemes later.

https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-community

Also the bot is recommending me this slack channel.

10:15am.

```ts
    const spiOpen = async (doc: TextDocument) => {
        const x : [number [], [string, RangeRec][]] = await spi(doc.uri.fsPath, doc.getText())
        window.showInformationMessage(`Data: ${JSON.stringify(x)}`)
        const b = new SemanticTokensBuilder()
        const data = x[0]
        for (let i = 0; i < data.length/5; i++) {
            b.push(data[i*5],data[i*5+1],data[i*5+2],data[i*5+3],data[i*5+4])
        }
        tokens.set(doc.uri.fsPath,b.build())
        tokenChange.fire()
        errorsSet(doc)(x[1])
    }
```

Let me try doing this. This should be the right format now.

10:20am. It works!

Still, why did I need to reach for this. Why did creating the array directly not work?

```ts
        const q = new Uint32Array(x[0])
        const b = new SemanticTokensBuilder()
        const data = x[0]
        for (let i = 0; i < data.length/5; i++) {
            b.push(data[i*5],data[i*5+1],data[i*5+2],data[i*5+3],data[i*5+4])
        }
        const qq = b.build()
        window.showInformationMessage(`q: ${JSON.stringify(q)}`)
        window.showInformationMessage(`qq: ${JSON.stringify(qq)}`)
        tokens.set(doc.uri.fsPath,qq)
```

Let me print this thing out.

```
q: {"0":0,"1":0,"2":3,"3":7,"4":0,"5":0,"6":4,"7":3,"8":7,"9":0,"10":0,"11":8,"12":3,"13":7,"14":0,"15":0,"16":12,"17":3,"18":7,"19":0,"20":0,"21":16,"22":3,"23":7,"24":0}
qq: {"data":{"0":0,"1":0,"2":3,"3":7,"4":0,"5":0,"6":4,"7":3,"8":7,"9":0,"10":0,"11":4,"12":3,"13":7,"14":0,"15":0,"16":4,"17":3,"18":7,"19":0,"20":0,"21":4,"22":3,"23":7,"24":0}}
```

Ahhh, I see. The delta is not from the start of the line, but from the start of the previous token. Ok, this caught me by surprise.

```
let f = .
```

Writing thing out like this disables tokenization for the whole line. Not good. I am going to have to make my own many.

Let me first deal with this and after that I properly account for the offsets.

```fs
| Error er -> if s = index d then Ok (f (ar, er)) else Error (f (er,ar))
```

Let me just do this.

10:40am.

```fs
    let body d =
        let ar = ResizeArray()
        let rec loop () =
            let s = index d
            match token d with
            | Ok x ->
                if s = index d then failwith "The parser succeeded without changing the parser index in `many`. Had an exception not been raised the parser would have diverged."
                else ar.Add x; loop()
            | Error er -> let ar = ar.ToArray() in if s = index d then Ok (ar,er) else Error (ar,er)
        loop ()
    (LineParsers.spaces >>. body >>= fun (x,er) s ->
        let er =
            let c = peek s
            if c = oob then []
            elif c = '\t' then [range_char s.from, Message "Tabs are not allowed."]
            else er
        Ok(x, er)
        ) {from=0; text=text}
    |> function
    | Error(toks,ers)
    | Ok(toks,ers) -> toks |> Array.map (fun (r,x) -> [|line; r.from; r.near_to-r.from; token_groups x; 0|]), process_error ers
```

This should work. Let me also calculate the deltas correctly while I am at it.

```fs
    | Ok(toks,ers) ->
        toks |> Array.mapFold (fun from (r,x) ->
            [|line; r.from - from; r.near_to-r.from; token_groups x; 0|], r.from
            ) 0 |> fst,
        process_error ers
```

This should do it.

```
inl inl inl inl inl
inl f x = .qwe
w + e + t + e
```

No, it is not right just yet on this.

The offsets might go accross lines.

```
*  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
*  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
```

...I am going to have to calculate the deltas based on the entire array.

```fs
        toks |> Array.mapFold (fun delta_from (r,x) ->
            [|line; r.from - delta_from; r.near_to-r.from; token_groups x; 0|], r.from
            ) 0 |> fst,
```

Let me get rid of this. I'll just return the entire array.

11:10am.

```fs
let tokenize text =
    let s = {from=0; text=text}
    LineParsers.spaces' s

    let ar = ResizeArray()
    let rec loop () =
        let i = index s
        match token s with
        | Ok _ when i = index s -> failwith "The parser succeeded without changing the parser index in `tokenize`. Had an exception not been raised the parser would have diverged."
        | Ok x -> ar.Add x; loop()
        | Error er -> er
    let ers =
        let ers = loop ()
        let c = peek s
        if c = oob then []
        elif c = '\t' then [range_char (index s), Message "Tabs are not allowed."]
        else ers
    ar.ToArray(), ers
```

Let me do it like this.

```
*  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
```

I am doing all sorts of nonsense, but would it really be a problem if the very first line had a delta line of 1?

11:20am.

```fs
let process_tokens delta_line (l : (Range * SpiralToken) []) =
    let ar = Array.zeroCreate (l.Length*5)
    let rec loop delta_line delta_from =
    l |> Array.collect (fun (delta_line, delta_from) (r,x) ->
        [|delta_line; r.from - delta_from; r.near_to-r.from; token_groups x; 0|], (0, r.from)
        ) (delta_line, 0) |> fst
```

Damn, I am so confused. I want to do this efficiently, but I keep tripping up over my own feet.

11:30am.

```fs
let process_error line (ers : (Range * TokenizerError) list) : (string * VSCRange) [] =
    List.toArray ers
    |> Array.groupBy (fun (a,_) -> a.from)
    |> Array.map (fun (from,ar) ->
        if 0 < ar.Length then
            let near_to, (expecteds, messages) =
                ar |> Array.fold (fun (near_to, (expecteds, messages)) (a,b) ->
                    max near_to a.near_to,
                    match b with
                    | Expected x -> x :: expecteds, messages
                    | Message x -> expecteds, x :: messages
                    ) (Int32.MinValue,([],[]))
            let ex () = match expecteds with [x] -> sprintf "Expected %s" x | x -> sprintf "Expected one of: %s" (String.concat ", " x)
            let f l = String.concat "\n" l
            if List.isEmpty expecteds then f messages
            elif List.isEmpty messages then ex ()
            else f (ex () :: "" :: "Other error messages:" :: messages)
            |> fun x -> Some(x,({line=line; character=from}, {line=line; character=near_to}))
        else None
        )
    |> Array.choose id

let process_tokens line (l : (Range * SpiralToken) []) =
    l |> Array.map (fun (r,x) -> [|line; r.from; r.near_to-r.from; token_groups x; 0|])

let tokenize text =
    let s = {from=0; text=text}
    LineParsers.spaces' s

    let ar = ResizeArray()
    let rec loop () =
        let i = index s
        match token s with
        | Ok _ when i = index s -> failwith "The parser succeeded without changing the parser index in `tokenize`. Had an exception not been raised the parser would have diverged."
        | Ok x -> ar.Add x; loop()
        | Error er -> er
    let ers =
        let ers = loop ()
        let c = peek s
        if c = oob then []
        elif c = '\t' then [range_char (index s), Message "Tabs are not allowed."]
        else ers
    ar.ToArray(), ers
```

Let me just go with this.

This is all that I need here. I do not want to calculate the deltas right away because once I start making changes to lines, I am going to need that information.

```
let process_tokens line (l : (Range * SpiralToken) []) =
    l |> Array.map (fun (r,x) -> [|line; r.from; r.near_to-r.from; token_groups x; 0|])
```

Actually, what should this be anyway. I do not need the deltas right here...

11:55am.

```fs
let file_tokens = Dictionary()
```

Let me put this dictionary in.

Things are just soooo confusing right now. None of the tasks I have in mind are hard, but it is a real hell trying to figure out where to put things. It is ridiculous.

Right now, I am having trouble figuring out how to get the previous token.

```fs
        let file_rest (l : TokenResult []) =
            let toks' = ResizeArray()
            let ers' = ResizeArray()
            let rec loop i =
                if i < l.Length then
                    let line, toks, ers = l.[i]
                    ers'.AddRange(process_error line ers)
                    let s =
                        Array.mapFold (fun s x ->

                            )
                    match s with
                    | Some(line',from') -> [|line-line'; r.from-from'; r.near_to-r.from; token_groups x; 0|]
                    | None -> [|line; r.from; r.near_to-r.from; token_groups x; 0|]
                else ()
            (toks'.ToArray(), ers'.ToArray() : FileOpenRes) |> Json.serialize
```

This is super awkward.

12:10pm. Let me have breakfast here.

What I did in `tokenize` is fine, but elsewhere I am just tripping over my own feet.

It is so ridiculous. This morning's session was poor.

I should take some time to think and plan this out in my head. Writing code is not doing me much good here. Now that I know that I need to calculate the deltas, I should be able to figure out what I have to do."

Requiring iOS 13

There is a bug in iOS 12 relating to encoding string JSON fragments. So to make it easy for myself, I just bumped the required iOS version number. Sorry iOS 12 users, it’s annoying - but .. yeah. I might fix this by using an array instead of a string for the match data.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)

					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

woof: Import version 1.0.1

Woof! is a continuation of Lee Killough's Doom source port MBF
targeted at modern systems.

MBF stands for "Marine's Best Friend" and is regarded by many as
the successor of the Boom source port by TeamTNT. It serves as the
code base for many of today's successful Doom source ports such as
PrBoom+ or The Eternity Engine. As the original engine was limited
to run only under MS-DOS, it has been ported to Windows by Team
Eternity under the name WinMBF in 2004. Woof! is developed based on
the WinMBF code with the aim to make MBF more widely available and
convenient to use on modern systems.

To achieve this goal, this source port is less strict regarding its
faithfulness to the original MBF. It is focused on quality-of-life
enhancements, bug fixes and compatibility improvements. However,
all changes have been introduced in good faith that they are in line
with the original author's intentions and even for the trained eye,
this source port should be hard to distinguish from the original MBF.

Shit fuckin works!!!

The clock and entity rendering works! Collision now exists as well for entities, we'll have to see how we implement items and the inventory.

seatsInTheater

Your friend advised you to see a new performance in the most popular theater in the city. He knows a lot about art and his advice is usually good, but not this time: the performance turned out to be awfully dull. It's so bad you want to sneak out, which is quite simple, especially since the exit is located right behind your row to the left. All you need to do is climb over your seat and make your way to the exit.

The main problem is your shyness: you're afraid that you'll end up blocking the view (even if only for a couple of seconds) of all the people who sit behind you and in your column or the columns to your left. To gain some courage, you decide to calculate the number of such people and see if you can possibly make it to the exit without disturbing too many people.

Given the total number of rows and columns in the theater (nRows and nCols, respectively), and the row and column you're sitting in, return the number of people who sit strictly behind you and in your column or to the left, assuming all seats are occupied.
