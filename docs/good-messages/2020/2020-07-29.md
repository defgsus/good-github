Merge pull request #293 from Ouranosinc/fix-rtd-silent-build-failure-in-autodoc-directive

Fix RtD silent build failure in autodoc directive.

This PR fixes RtD silent build failure in autodoc directive.  The process list https://pavics-sdi.readthedocs.io/projects/raven/en/latest/processes.html is currently empty and it's not supposed to be like that.  We never got alerted because it's failing silently.

Fixed RtD build: https://pavics-sdi.readthedocs.io/projects/raven/en/test-rtd-build/processes.html and matching RtD build log https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/build/11555558.txt (commit baba22fe182ca7757ae75f746d1529ff69a22586)

Changes:

* Turn RtD warnings to build failure so they do not fail silently.

* Change Travis-CI build config to also build Epub and Latex doc format to catch RtD failure on Travis-CI before PR is merged.

* Various changes to remove all warnings in doc build since warnings will now fail the doc build.

Unrelated changes part of this PR (sorry !):

* Refresh cookiecutter (first commit in this PR is technically not part of the intended fix of this PR).

* Remove Travis-CI directive to only build `master` branch so all dev branch gets build on Travis-CI.  Otherwise we either have to create a PR when branch is not even ready or hardcode branch name in `.travis.yml` and have to remember to remove it at the end, very annoying.  See comment in https://github.com/Ouranosinc/raven/pull/292#discussion_r460044455

@richardarsenault You are probably not interested in the low level details in this PR.  I just want to draw your attention to the fact that I found 2 notebooks missing in the toctree (Region_selection.ipynb, Running_models_with_multiple_timeseries_files.ipynb).  I added them to the end of the toctree, wonder if you are okay with the ordering or these 2 notebooks were intended to not appear in the doc.

Make music 'fade out previous' an effect enabled by default (#196)

Simply make the "FADE_OUT" music effect flag by default so more users experience the SMOOTH FADE OUT magic by accident and praise the based client.

Maxi Pain

I don't get why es6 doesn't support mutating things you import.
I actually do but it's still annoying and dumb. No wonder that
eslint rule exists. It's to stop me from wasting my time.
