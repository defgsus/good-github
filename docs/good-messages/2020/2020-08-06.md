Create guidebook-worksheets.md

As discussed in today's meeting #16, I have started this document with the goal of mapping the current guidebook sections to the new class outline. I realize that we only discussed mapping titles to worksheets/video/remove, but I also added a few notes about in-class demos / pre-reading materials (it felt intuitive to do this as I was reading through the guidebook); I hope this is okay! My impression is that this could be a useful outline going forward, I also thought that it may be a good place to include a "learning objectives" section within each revised class meeting?

I have tried to keep it organized, but I realize that there are some ideas that would probably better fit elsewhere (i.e. the addition of the syllabus as a part of the course structure section within the website). I will make note of these and add them into the general 2020 new outline document as well. I look forward to hearing your thoughts, and if you find that this type of document works well with our goal, and seems helpful for thinking about the classes / videos / worksheets, I am happy to continue slowly chipping away at it! Otherwise we can revisit and discuss what's best.

Thank you,
Icíar

Add a stylized medieval hut

Getting back on track here - I'm stil not a fan of how the blocky
Minecraft-esque house looks. I need to try something else...

This commit adds a new house - a polygonal hut with low walls and a
high roof. A real medieval hovel. The best impression I can get from
my incredibly shallow research is that hovels varied pretty widely in
form (most likely changing with each particular culture). And, I was
so impatient to get working on my game, I didn't bother looking into
where these types of structures were the most prevalent.

I made a lot of different model components for this house, but
ultimately settled on three components - a Foundation, the Walls, and
a Roof. Since our perspective prevents us from easily seeing what's
behind stuff, or is inside buildings, the tall pointed roof might get
in the way. By making it separate from the rest of the building, we
can easily fade the roof in-and-out at will. That way, if something's
behind the building, or in the building, we'll be able to peek at it
right quick!

I've also been testing out performance, since we'll need to have a
lot of these buildings, most likely with their own omni-lights.
Looking at the profiling tools, it looks like we're in a pretty good
place.

However, I did notice a big slow down: for some reason, when the
clowns are running into the hut (like, literally rubbing their faces
against it), the Physics process EXPLODES and the FRAMES die. I was
getting 6 frames per second! Something tells me I might have to
change out the move_and_slide method call for move_and_collide. Does
the physics engine hate the shape, or does it just hate the constant
colliding?

Speaking of colliding, I had to add a small ramp to the foundation
since there's no automatic step-up; I should really investigate a way
to fix that...

Also, I may have committed what amounts to a crime. I, for some
reason, called the new house an "octo hut" when I used a hexagon. Not
really sure why I did that. Doesn't really matter, as I'm too lazy to
change the whole asset pipeline now.

more consistent NPSGraphAtTop width

I woke up even earlier than usual. I'd wanted enough time to empty out
my backpack and replace the loose leaf paper, 0.5mm mechanical pencils,
and paperback novels with a water bottle, my wallet, and different
paperback novels. It was the first Monday of my 8th grade summer
vacation, and there was an excitement and sense of potential to the
months that stretched out in front of me.

I set out on my bicycle a few minutes before 8am. I'd biked to town
previous summers with neighborhood kids, but this was my first time
going by myself, and so early in the morning. The path that took me
across someone's back yard, through forest, across the train tracks, and
down the final embankment felt more alive than ever. Every push on my
pedals was focused on getting me out of the suburbs to State Street
where local businesses flourished. The sun was still rising and the day
beckoned.

I made it to Tudor Books for their 9am open and explored the shelves for
anything and everything that looked interesting. Maybe A Brief History
of Time? Ever since I'd read about the relativity of simultaneity and
considered light traveling across a moving train car I was intrigued and
confused and curious to learn more.

Or maybe this intricately annotated Hamlet? I knew it was the one that
featured Ophelia, whom I'd seen lifeless and drowned among the flowers
on posters in Spencer Gifts. Romeo and Juliet had been riveting and I
was eager to experience such strong emotions and beautiful words again.

After ninety minutes, I used some of my saved allowance to buy The
Chosen (it seemed like something I could finish in one sitting) and a
glass of chocolate milk (it seemed delicious).

It was so exciting to think that I'd chosen these things myself and
could spend an entire day with them. They weren't assigned or handed
out; they were things I wanted to pursue and now could. I knew that this
was my first taste of what adulthood would be: the freedom to explore
things of my own choosing.

I curled up in a big leather chair in a quiet corner and spent the rest
of the day reading.

Remove short options

I decided to remove the short options for the following reasons:

1. jmx-exploiter is not that often used during regular security
  assessments. In my opinion, short options do only benefit tools that
  are used frequently.

2. Short options are more difficult to autocomplete (yeah, I know this
  is a weak excuse because it is not that difficult. However, with point
  one in mind, I guess it is a valid point)

3. Only supporting long options mak the help of the tool more compact
  and it is probably easier to understand.

Introduce Lazyplug

Other hotplugging methods including mpdecision and intelli_plug focuses
on how should we turn off CPU cores. They hotplugs the individual CPU
cores based on the current load divided by thread capacity.
Lazyplug takes a whole new approach on how we should do hotplugging
based on the foundation of the other side of the coin;
“Linux’s hotplugging is very inefficient.”

Current hotplugging code on Linux is a total waste of CPU cycles and
delays, so rather than hotplugging and hurt performance & battery life,
just leaving the CPU cores on might be a better choice. This kind of
approach is spreading out more and more.
Samsung has been using this method for a very long time with big.LITTLE
devices and recent Nexus 6 firmware also does the similar thing.

Lazyplug just leaves them on, most of the time. It also tries to solve
some problems with the “Always on” approach. On situations such as video
playback, turning on all CPU cores is not battery friendly. So Lazyplug
*does* actually turns off CPU cores, but only when idle state is long
enough(to reduce the number of CPU core switchings) and when the device
has its screen off(determination is done via earlysuspend or
powersuspend because framebuffer API causes troubles on hotplugging CPU
cores).

Basic methodology :
Lazyplug uses majority of the codes from intelli_plug by faux123 to
determine when to turn off CPU cores. If the system has been idle for
(DEF_SAMPLING_MS * DEF_IDLE_COUNT)ms, it turns off the CPU cores. And if
the next poll determines 1 core isn’t enough, it fires up all CPU cores
(instead of selective CPU cores; which is the traditional intelli_plug’s
method).
Lazyplug also takes touch-screen input events to fire up CPU cores to
minimize noticeable performance degradation.
There’s also a “lazy mode” for *not* aggressively turning on CPU cores
on scenario such as video playback. For example, if you hook up
lazyplug_enter_lazy() to the video session open function, Lazyplug won’t
aggressively turn on CPU cores and tries to handle it with 1 CPU core.

* TODO :
* Dual-core mode : YouTube video playback is mostly single-threaded.
* It usually hovers around 10% ~ 30% of total CPU usage on quad-core
* device. That means 1 CPU core might not be enough to handle it, but
* also turning on all CPU cores is unnecessarily wasting power.

Refurbished Centcom Docking Area - The Squeakquel (#3220)

* Initializing

Haven't used the map merger yet. StrongDMM is /supposed/ to do that automatically.

Moved less shit around this time.

* Changelog

:astonished:

* Replaces broken corndogs

As hilarious as it is for the delicious phallus shaped snacks to poof into thin air when you try to eat them, I want this PR to be as snag free as possible.

* Deleting Changelog

Apparently I don't need to do this anymore and nobody told me.

* More lights, detailing, and

Sometimes the lights spawn broken and that results in dark spots. Added more light tubes to compensate.

Also added some chairs, a water cooler, and some cool detailing to the neutral hallway to make it feel less bland.

Also adding a bunch of extinguisher cabinets seemed like a good idea too, considering how often people in the safezone end up on fire.

* Polish

Placed an invisible light in the middle of the killzone so it doesn't have a dark spot in the middle.

Replaced the airhorn with some hotdogs.

Made the contents of the tables adjacent to the safezone tiles a little less memey. They now have a delicious selection of donuts as opposed to toys and salt shakers.

Add a license file

The dubious-looking "2010-2012" merits an explanation, so let's get this
pedantic bit of history cleared up: "Unitome" was a project I created in
the days before I used version control. None of the original files exist
in anything more than spirit: this project is essentially a continuation
of what I'd started and forgotten to finish - a character identification
tool which consults `UnicodeData.txt` directly. Though its original form
was that of a single-page HTML "webapp" loading a static text-file using
jQuery's `.load()` helper. More features were planned, but the project's
source-code got nuked whilst cleaning up projects I'd lost interest in.

I've no fucking idea how relevant an earlier incarnation of a project is
to a license file's attested year-range. But when each "Unitome" started
life as throwaway code that later formed the basis of a project with the
same vision, almost exactly 10 years apart... well, let's say the timing
was too perfect not to write a 72x15-size commit message documenting it.

It's The Hubris of Engineering!

I've made a silly repo for my silly tech-days project. While I
definitely intend to commit often, these commit messages are currently
for my own personal gratification, and will likely read like a
shitposting tweetstorm. I'm not sorry. This is a goofy application and I
hope if eventually saves me 10 minutes, despite the day and a half I'll
spend writing it.

This project is a love letter to the industry of Software Engineering as
also Adam Smith.

Mark Stephen Sobkow's Plan

Apologies for the currently long and rambling nature of my plans and goals in life.

I had planned on building a business out of MSS Code Factory, but as I've explained on the
project site welcome page, I don't see that as a viable option.  Nowadays businesses
ship tools for free, and make their money providing services to support those tools based on high
volume thin margins that I can't compete with.  It is time to cut my "sunk costs" loose and move on
with my life.

In the spirit of that possibility, I'm relicensing the whole of 2.13 and 3.1 under
a combination of dual Commercial/GPLv3 and dual Commercial/LGPLv3 licenses.  3.1 will take
the extreme - all 3.1 code for the back end will be GPLv3, and only the client interfaces will
be LGPLv3 so that anyone can use what I manufacture to build their projects.  I want to
enable use of the code more than I do extension of the code.

I have the background and experience to currently offer Linux/Unix C++ development
services with a strong GNU toolkit and bash script support, and a plethora of RDBMS experience.
My C++ is up to the latest GNU c++2a preview of the upcoming C++20 standard, though my
SQL coding for C++ is rusty, and I have yet to use LinuxODBC.  That wasn't planned until after
I resolve the performance issues with the C++ code I produce.

Most work is full time for the C++ market, so I'm retooling my JEE skills now to concentrate on
Spring 4/OAuth2/OData/JSON/Maven/Java11 as my deployment stack, with specific tools including
a 12 GB RAM Ubuntu 20.04 LTS amd64 VM running with PostgreSQL client and server installed,
an OAuth2 service that will be based on MIT "Ok" over MIT Kerberos 5, Spring 4 Eclipse Edition,
Java 11, and Glassfish for deployment testing instead of Tomcat (Tomcat doesn't lend itself to
running multiple WARs at the same time.)

Why Contracts Only?

My bi-polar condition is aggravated by large urban center stressors, and my family is here in
Saskatchewan, so rather than move from job-to-job, I prefer remote contracting with the occasional
bit of travel for on-site integration, testing, and rollouts.  With modern technology like webcams,
team communications services, VPN links, and high-speed internet, working remotely is
easier now than it ever was in the past when I did offsite contracts.

Key Tools and Technologies Supported

I have decades of experience working with Unix systems from virtually every manufacturer
and vendor in North America during my career, so I really do find myself completely
at home in Linux, especially Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.  I have some experience with cross-platform
toolkit support of Windows XP, C#/.Net in the Windows 7 era, but none with Windows 10.
I use a Windows 10 Pro box as my development workstation for the sake of playing video games
and running VMs, but my actual work is almost entirely done in Ubuntu, and has been
for over a decade.

I spent over 20 years of my life working and living the corporate life in North America,
on contract or employed by "small" companies like AT&amp;T, IBM, Northern Telecom, Bell Canada,
RAD (in several incarnations), J.P. Morgan-Chase, and AVCO Financial Services.  I am
very familiar with the issues involved in the nuts and bolts of low-level tuning the best
performance from big systems and distributed clusters that were the intranet datacenter precursors
to the modern cloud.  I understand what those automatic database management tools in the cloud
are trying to accomplish, and it eliminates an entire field of computing services.  This
gives me a background in large data, high-volume systems and distributed message-based
computing as well as more traditional data feed implementations.

During that 20 years I worked with the vast majority of commercial and open source relational
databases that existed in North America, including Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase ASE, PostgreSQL,
MySQL, and IBM DB/2 LUW.  I'm currently refreshing my skills with PostgreSQL.

I spent most of 2019 and early 2020 refreshing my C++ style/experience to C++20-ready previews
(GNU c++2a.)  I've worked the kinks out of what is good and bad code for modern C++ code compared
to what I used to write, though my first iteration of manufactured code takes nearly 10 times as long
to run as its Java compatriot, and shouldn't be used for anything except my own experimentation
yet.
On the JEE front, I'm focusing on Spring 4 with Maven and Java 11, with a goal of producing an OData
Registry/Repository for client applications to query, an OData server implementation extending
built on a variant of my PostgreSQL JDBC binding layer, and the JSON protocols that underly OData.

I'm configuring my test environment for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS amd64.  I'm almost done collection my package/jar
stack to be used for the implementations.  I've collected enough of it to proceed with my prototyping
efforts once I have it all configured and running.  There is a fair bit of installation to be done:

 - Base development tools Java 11, Git, Bash, Maven, Ant, Python, PostgreSQL client/server, Swing 4 Eclipse Edition, environment configuration - installed
 - bind9 DNS server - installed and configured
 - Set default domain of all clients machines to "dev.msscf.org" (my internal network) - TBD
 - MIT Kerberos 5 server
 - MIT "Ok" OAuth2 serive over Kerberos 5
 - Glassfish Open Source Edition authenticating against OAuth2 (preferred) or Kerbers 5 as appropriate
 - Create and deploy a simple test WAR implementing security pages to Tomcat (debugger) and Glassfish (production)
 - Go from there with web development and testing... someday

About Mark Stephen Sobkow

I've been programming since 1972 when I was 14 years old, starting
at the relatively local Radio Shack here in Yorkton, tying up their
TRS-80 Model I Level I for hours at a time until I was finally told
to buy one or give up programming.

It wasn't until 2-3 years later that I started doing real programming
at the University of Saskatchewan as a student in their Bachelor of Science
in Computer Science Advanced program (4 year degree, not 3, allowing for
an extra year which I chose to use to focus on tools and concepts like
compiler theory, linear algebra, set theory, graphics, and databases.)
I've never taken more than a 3-month break from coding since 1982.

My first C++ manual was the second or third edition, back when it was
a pre-processor spitting out C code.  Operations like dynamic_cast
didn't even exist yet, and STL wasn't yet a glimmer in anyone's eyes.

I have a long history with and love of Unix-based systems on the backend,
beginning with BSD Unix 2.0, and genuine AT&T SVR4.  I even used SCO on
a 80286, and Minix at home on one as well! I dabbled in Windows
and cross platform GUI toolkits, but I've always had a fondness for
the *nix server platform with its early open source support, and
nowadays I use JavaFX/11 for providing portable GUIs and application
services.

My very first "big" computer in the fall of 1982 was the terminal room for
the first year students, a PDP-11 with green screen terminals (VT100's and
workalikes) that we only used for editing our source code, shipping it to a
provincial government mainframe to build and run the code. Debuggers? Hah!
We used debug statements and printouts.  That still proves very useful for
debugging active servers in production.

Inverted the colors on the main window buttons

I originally made the buttons have the color border and the white
background when not pressed and then switched to one solid color
with white text when pressed. This diff inverts that.

If someone is colorblind then the enabled not-pressed button and
the disabled button would look basically the same. Plus this
honestly just looks better with the pressed action. In real life
you would think of a button being pushed down and this gives a
similar effect without the use of shadows.

I did modify the row/col buttons here but they don't match that
pattern. I did that for two reasons. One is that when it's a solid
background, it tends to be overpowering. Part of that I think is
that I used 1px black lines to separate the buttons so it all just
blends together and doesn't look good. The other aspect is that you
have a visual indication of the item you want to vend because you'll
see it in the machine. Eventually we'll need to check product stock
levels too and we might end up with the case that an item is visually
there in the machine but the button should be disabled. That may
prove confusing for people, but they'll probably just assume we
miscounted the items in the machine.

Updated Structure and Added Basic Functionality for Reporting Outcome

Hey! Output! Nice. Now we know that the application ran and did
something. It accepts System.out, just to future-proof us against ever
wanting to write to a stream other than System.out. I could definitely
see that happening in the distant future. I hope my successors
appreciate the great abstraction I provided.

Obviously, this application will long outlive my tenure at The Company,
as the only reliable, consistent way to secure more capital for my labor
is to regularly emotionally uproot myself from the comfort of the people
I've come to know, and venture on to the "next thing" that will continue
to extract wealth from me via my labor, but at a slightly better rate
for myself. Ah the joy of capitalism.

Remove the "scroller" and "scrollee" scroll containers

A more ambitious follow-up to my [my previous layout PR](https://github.com/mozilla/common-voice/pull/2863).

> Prompted by a surprising layout breakage on our new error pages, I found some oddities in our page layout. This is my attempt to simplify a few years of uh, iterative development.

Prior to this change, each of our pages lived within a nested `div#scroller` and `div#scrollee` container. On desktop these were inconspicuous wrapper `div`s. But on mobile, `#scroller` took on a `position: fixed` over the viewport, and `#scrollee` scrolled within it. With banners, dynamically-sized elements, and new flexbox layouts, keeping everything in a fixed panel has started to cause surprising bugs:

The solution is one part new, one part old. I've combined the simple scroll check introduced in 1c58f6df2a5c with `position: sticky` for a _waaaay_ less verbose and mobile-platform-breaking experience!

It also fixes a bunch of weird overflow bugs that were too annoying to fix individually but really piled up. For instance: banners no-longer block their underlying content!

Before:

After:

*This change should go through some heavy QA!* Things to look out for:

- Pages that now have content overflowing horizontally, including the header bar, backgrounds, and "floating" images.
- Pages with wonky scroll behaviour, especially at the top or bottom of pages.
- Banners or other fixed-position elements that now seem to be in the wrong position.
- Pages that cannot scroll at all…? Hope not!

mid refactor

So, er, I realise I'm doing a lot of `public static` like I want to be
doing FP rather than OO. That's fine for sketching out algorithms, but
I'm getting up to speed with an OO language, so let's start to actually
engage with the prevailing idioms...

Refactoring into OCR (the line) and OCRDigit classes.
Having done TDD throughout, I was unsure exactly how I wanted to
structure this, and have just hacked at the source code instead of
test-first. On reflection, this would be the ideal place to do test
first, to sketch out the interface.

Oh well, good learning experience I guess. Let's call it a "spike" this
time, and remember to do better next time.

Have taken it to a point where the obvious compiler errors are fixed in
src, and the errors are now reported from the Tests, so next I'll
rewrite those till I'm sure the structure works, and then fix remaining
issues with code.

Closed HTML Essentials AGAIN
- I really need to remember this before committing this is getting really exhausting, I hate myself
