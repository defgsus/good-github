hell yeah

I am feeling decent about the refactoring and classes and renaming and general cleanliness of the code. Let me know your thoughts.
I want to still implement manual traversal and making the view pane scale in size to the input argument.
Once I have the manual traversal down. I think it would be cool to "hide" the treasure and allow a user a finite number of "digs" to try and find the treasure which could be passed in as args.
Then the question how do we make it a game that is challening but doable but also with some level of objectives.

So like maybe a "warm" "cold" "coldest" "hot" based on the distance from the treasure so its like a metal detector? lmao so its like we give hints but its still a chance a user could lose if they don't dig right and then the difficulty gets harder if you only have like 2 digs and we will only indicate "Warm" which is if the distance is less than 2 blocks away. why the fuck am I still typing right now.

题目描述 
>His majesty chatted with Han Xin about the capabilities of the generals. Each had their shortcomings. His majesty asked, ``How >many troops could I lead?" Han Xin replied, ``Your highness should not lead more than 100000." His majesty said, ``And what >about you?" ``For your humble servant, the more the merrier!" said Han Xin.

---Records of the Grand Historian
Han Xin was a military general who served Liu Bang during the Chu-Han contention and contributed greatly to the founding of the Han dynasty. Your friend, in a strange coincidence, also named Han Xin, is a military general as well.

One day you asked him how many troops he led. He was reluctant to tell you the exact number, but he told you some clues in certain form, for example:
- if we count the troops by threes, we have two left over;
- if we count by fives, we have three left over;
- if we count by sevens, two are left over;
- ...
You wonder the number of his troops, or he was simply lying. More specifically, you would like to know the minimum possible number of troops he leads, and if the minimum number is too large, then you suspect he was lying.

输入描述:
The first line of input contains two integers n, m $(1 \leq n \leq 100, 1 \leq m \leq 10^{18})$, the number of clues he told you and the threshold that you think he was probably lying.

The remaining part of the input are n lines, specifying the clues, Each line consists of two integers a, b $(0 \leq b < a < 10^5)$, representing a clue that b troops are left over if we count them by a's.
输出描述:
If there does not exist a non-negative number of troops satisfying all clues, print \texttt{he was definitely lying}he was definitely lying; otherwise, if the minimum non-negative possible number of troops is greater than m, print \texttt{he was probably lying}he was probably lying; otherwise, print the minimum non-negative number.

fs/sync: Make sync() satisfy many requests with one invocation

Dave Jones reported RCU stalls, overly long hrtimer interrupts, and
amazingly long NMI handlers from a trinity-induced workload involving
lots of concurrent sync() calls (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/23/369).
There are any number of things that one might do to make sync() behave
better under high levels of contention, but it is also the case that
multiple concurrent sync() system calls can be satisfied by a single
sys_sync() invocation.

Given that this situation is reminiscent of rcu_barrier(), this commit
applies the rcu_barrier() approach to sys_sync().  This approach uses
a global mutex and a sequence counter.  The mutex is held across the
sync() operation, which eliminates contention between concurrent sync()
operations.  The counter is incremented at the beginning and end of
each sync() operation, so that it is odd while a sync() operation is in
progress and even otherwise, just like sequence locks.

The code that used to be in sys_sync() is now in do_sync(), and sys_sync()
now handles the concurrency.  The sys_sync() function first takes a
snapshot of the counter, then acquires the mutex, and then takes another
snapshot of the counter.  If the values of the two snapshots indicate that
a full do_sync() executed during the mutex acquisition, the sys_sync()
function releases the mutex and returns ("Our work is done!").  Otherwise,
sys_sync() increments the counter, invokes do_sync(), and increments
the counter again.

This approach allows a single call to do_sync() to satisfy an arbitrarily
large number of sync() system calls, which should eliminate issues due
to large numbers of concurrent invocations of the sync() system call.

Changes since v1 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/24/683):

o	Add a pair of memory barriers to keep the increments from
	bleeding into the do_sync() code.  (The failure probability
	is insanely low, but when you have several hundred million
	devices running Linux, you can expect several hundred instances
	of one-in-a-million failures.)

o	Actually CC some people who have experience in this area.

"9:50am. I am up and it is Monday. Tog, Dendro (I am really into it), breakfast, chores, then comes programming.

...Oh, it seems a Satanophany raw came out two days ago.

12:25pm. Finally done with vol 2. The novels were each over 300 pages long, I've been reading them like a madman.

Right now let me take a break from that, I really had enough for the time being and need some downtime. It was pretty good while it lasted, but I want to focus on programming for a bit.

12:30pm. Now before I begin, I still have chores to do, and I want to chill a bit before doing them. Let me get to it.

1:20pm. It is time to start this thing.

1:25pm. Now that I've had my fill of entertainment, and am done with the chores, I finally feel like doing some work.

1:30pm. Now the next thing on the list to do is to take care of error printing.

But I before I start that, there is something that bothers me.

```
    | RawTForall of (string * RawTypeTypeExpr) [] * RawTypeExpr
    | RawTInl of (string * RawTypeTypeExpr) [] * RawTypeExpr
```

The type level functions. There is a certain inconsistency in my thinking.

```
nominal real Tensor dim ty = tensor_init dim ty
```

Remember those nominal types whose body is a call to the real segment function?

1:35pm. Last night (like past 12am) it occurred to me that I do not have a smooth way of taking care of this.

I wanted to simplify things for myself by doing explicit substitution (as opposed to using environments) for type level functions, but this would wreck that. Also on the face of it, while `nominal real Tensor dim ty = tensor_init dim ty` seems super straightforward, I find myself confused as to what `Tensor dim ty` is supposed to be.

It is not a type level function. It is not a forall either. So what should it be then?

Back while I was thinking this through, it was super obvious to me once I had the idea what the effect of this should be. Partially evaluate `tensor_init dim ty` and strip its type. Then use that for the body of the nominal type.

1:50pm. But now that I've looked at it again and am thinking what that really entails, I am finding myself unprepared for having to do value level computation at the type level.

2:40pm. Yeah, this is difficult. I am going to have to add the equivalent of `RawType` to the type expressions. And type level functions will be just like regular functions - I am in fact going to have to give them environments and wait till they are fully applied.

```
    | RawTForall of (string * RawTypeTypeExpr) [] * RawTypeExpr
    | RawTInl of (string * RawTypeTypeExpr) [] * RawTypeExpr
```

I am going to get rid of arrays here. I'll split them up into multiple arguments.

Now, it is great that I've decided all this, but I need to think about it some more. Unification will really be a hell to deal with won't it?"

Clarify nomenclature; cause is from kernel, reason from watchdogd

Richard Alpe brought to my attention the confusing nomenclature used in
watchdogd today.  Reset *cause* and reset *reason* were sloppily, and
often interchangeably, used.  It was not clear to a user of watchdogd
what was the status from the kernel WDT, and what was the extra info
that watchdogd had added.

After a brief discussion he convinced me it was a good idea to clean
up this mess and we arreived at the following conclusion;

  - Reset cause should always be the `WDIOF_` flags returned from the
    kernel `WDIOC_GETBOOTSTATUS` ioctl.
  - Reset reason is the extra value watchdogd adds.  This, at its core,
    is a `code` that can be set by any of the supervisor or monitor
    plugins supported; e.g. a monitored process fails to meet its
    deadline, a system memory leak, or CPU overload (loadavg plugin)

95% of this patch is a search-and-replace of:

  - cause --> reason
  - cause --> code
  - etc.

The remaining 5% are adaptations, comments, and updated documentation.

The biggest implication of this change is the change in the libwdog API.
The wdog_reason_t::cause rename to ::code.  Hence the ABI version bump.
We could of course add an ugly union to support both ::cause and ::code,
but that seems silly since we might also want to add the kernel reset
cause to that struct later.  So, in the immortal words of a good friend
of mine;

>  "I'd rather be consistent than please everyone."

Also, I'd be very surpised if this really breaks anyone's code, because
that would mean someone other than Westermo actually uses libwdog ...

Adds a new Tech to the B.E.P.I.S., Specialized Engineering, and a new Minor Reward. (#48507)

About The Pull Request

Round 2.
image
Adds a new tech to be unlocked within the B.E.P.I.S.'s major techs, called "Specialized Engineering". Within that tech are 2 new items, Heat Resistant Rods, and the Tinker's Gloves, as well as a new minor tech, the Survival Pen.
Heat Resistant Rods:
Have you ever wanted to expand Lavaland Base? Build a lava fortress worthy of your magnificence? Well, now you can! Using Heat Resistant Rods, you can make a catwalk to cross lava tiles, as well as build atop lava, without messy methods like using the RCD!
Tinker's Gloves:
This just in engineers, insulated gloves have new competition in town! The Tinker's gloves are complicated, overdesigned gloves that, while not very shockproof, allow for faster wall girder construction. No longer will you need to die of old age walling off an area when you're out of RCD ammo! Warning: This product contains no likeness to clockwork gauntlets used by the extinct cult of Rat'Var, and any such similarity is by no means intentional.

Survival Pen:
Have you ever been stuck on lavaland, trapped by your survival pod with just a few chairs, some titanium walls, and walls of ash closing in on you? Well THANK GOD you have your Rockbreaker brand Survival Pen! Allows for basic mining operations, and is portable like a standard pen!
BUT WAIT!
A watcher blocks your path. Thankfully, your expensive, diamond encrusted pen isn't just good for being the world's slowest pickaxe, it's ALSO coated in the one thing watchers crave: DIAMONDS. Toss the pen to draw the watcher's attention elsewhere.
Why It's Good For The Game

Starts to fill our B.E.P.I.S. Major Reward Techs, as intended, and fills a niche that doesn't get much play nowadays: Building on Lavaland. This was something I've had in the back of my mind since we did the first tests of the Disaster gamemode a few months ago, so each item here was made with the intention of improving the mining base should the station become un-livable. Lava-Proof Rods are beneficial in that you'll be able to cross and build over lava by the mid-end of the shift. RCDs still work as usual, but this way you won't have to worry about getting specialized engineering equipment as a member of cargo or science. The tinker's gloves are basically a variant of the nitrile gloves, but they grant a speed bonus to adding plating to metal girders, so that some kind of functional alternative to giving every engineer insulated gloves.
Survival Pens are quite honestly very niche, but getting dumb pens with extra functionality is a tradition of trade shows all over the world, so it feels right at home as a minor reward.

Also, does a tiny change to the doe sprites, just to look a little bit less old.
Changelog

cl
add: A new Technology has been implemented as a major reward in the B.E.P.I.S., Specialized Engineering, to appeal to engineering utility and new construction horizons.
tweak: Watchers will now actively consume diamond ore left lying around, alongside the new survival pens.

player: make repeated hr-seeks past EOF trigger EOF as expected

If you have a normal file with audio and video, and keep "spamming"
forward hr-seeks, the player just kept showing the last video frame
instead of exiting or playing the next file. This started happening
since commit 6bcda94cb. Although not a bug per se, it was odd, and very
user-noticable.

The main problem was that the pending seek command was processed before
the EOF was "noticed". Processing the command reset everything, so the
player did not terminate playback, but repeated the seek.

This commit restores the old behavior.

For one, it makes video return the correct status (video.c). The
parameter is a bit ugly, but better than duplicating the logic or having
another MPContext field. (As a minor detail, setting r=VD_EOF makes sure
have_new_frame() returns true, rather than going through another
iteration or whatever the hell will happen instead, which would clobber
logical_eof.)

Another thing is making the seek logic actually wait until the seek
outcome has been determined if audio is also active. Audio needs to wait
for video in order to get the video seek target position. (Which in turn
is because hr-seek still "snaps" to video frames. You can't seek in
between two frames, so audio can't just use the seek target, but always
has to wait on the timestamp of the video frame. This has other
disadvantages and is a misdesign, but not something I'll fix today.)

In theory, this might make hr-seeks less responsive, because it needs to
fully decode/filter the audio too, but in practice most time is spent on
video, which had to be fully decoded before this change. (In general,
hr-seek could probably just show a random frame when a queued hr-seek
overrides the current hr-seek, which would probably lead to a better
user experience, but that's out of scope.)

Fixes: #7206
