"7:30am. I am up this early despite going to bed at 11pm yesterday. Am I looking forward to every programming day or what? May has been great, if exhausting. Today is the last day of the month so it is time to do that monthly review for the PL thread. I'll take some time to do an extended rest today.

And I'll start with my usual morning chilling. Kaiji is out.

https://mangadex.org/title/40770/shinigami-ni-sodaterareta-shoujo-wa-shikkoku-no-tsurugi-wo-mune-ni-idaku

This came out yesterday too. Let me have my fun.

9am. Ok, let me start this thing. Review time.

///

Towards the end of April I had a change of mindset - rather than trying to figure out those massively bloated LSP related projects, I should directly study the VS Code editor itself and aim to directly integrate my language with it. That went well. I spent nearly two weeks studying the various samples and [refactoring them](https://github.com/mrakgr/vscode-extension-samples#vs-code-extensions-refactor) as I went along. And this time I have it. The feedback from this experience was good. This is a sharp contrast to...for example February when I picked up an ASP.NET book and realized that no matter how much I wracked my brain that I did not understand what most of the code in the Tic Tac Toe example did. It was so deluged with crap, that for most of the lines I could only guess at what their purpose was.

Not so here. When things are simple, then not only are they easy to learn, but it is also easy to infer what the purpose of various parts should be. This is important for being able to tell when a bug is occurring in the library.

After the first week, I was done with that and I decided to start work on editor support for Spiral. As the first step, I wrote a parser for config files for it and then looked into integrating it with VS Code. I mean, at that point on paper I had everything set - I am familiar with the VS Code editor and its API on one side, and the way to design the language on the other is clear to me.

When the time came to actually transfer data from one side to the other, I realized I had a problem. If you Google something like [`node ipc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-ipc) you'll stumble upon the namesake package. It allows sending messages via IPC as one would expect. On the .NET side however, you have what? Network streams? What am I going to do with those? Surely you want to at least send messages.

I even opened a thread on the F# sub asking how to send strings across different processes, but the answer was a [dreadful resounding silence](https://www.reddit.com/r/fsharp/comments/gek8cv/what_should_i_be_using_to_do_ipc_for_a_language/).

In programming, it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that because something is simple that it is also easy.

---

The face of my next challenge having been made clear, after searching for a while I stumbled upon [ZeroMQ](http://zguide.zeromq.org/) and decided that I need to master it. And what better way to go about it than to weave all the strands I've been picking up over past few months together. I wanted to break my dependency on the command line for a long time, and given my recent successes with [reactive combinators](http://reactivex.io/) this seemed like an idea time to do some serious UI work and finally master that aspect of programming as well. I failed at this in 2016, but at this point I am too overleveled for that to happen. As a programmer, I've always had this insecurity - I've always had the raw talent, and in the past 5 years the consistent effort I've putting in has refined it into a gem, but there are still some impurities left to polish. My ability to produce good tools is still too poor for me to call myself a real expert. It is one thing to be able to produce good, efficient and readable code in some places, but it quite another to have such a broad base that one can excel regardless of the domain.

The way to break into such a level is the question, and the answer is concurrency.

The only bright spot in the past five months was when I decided to really commit to studying reactive combinators and did some [simple UIs](https://github.com/mrakgr/Lithe-POC) using them. May was just so great. It was fantastic.

It was like learning programming again - every session that I had was meaningful, and the things I've learned will not be forgotten and will serve as the core of my skill from here on out. Reactive combinators are just divine, they are as good for concurrency as parser combinators are for parsing. Master them, add agents to the mix (and [maybe channels](https://github.com/Hopac/Hopac/blob/master/Docs/Programming.md)) and things like UIs suddenly become tractable. And webdev which has been a big thing for a while now is fundamentally very similar to UI work. Though I do not plan on doing webdev, this is what one needs to know if one wants to do it. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and big frameworks on whatever platform are just distracting trivialities in the challenge of producing good abstractions for user experience. Reactive combinators are what is fundamental. Concurrency is what should be the true object of study. The impression that concurrency is about programming with [impossible to reason about](http://deadlockempire.github.io/) low level primitives needs to die.

The reason that I decided to start with frameworks in February was because I lacked the skills and the confidence to manage complexity in those domains.

I finally see the correct path now - all I need to do is keep following it. In a week or so I will be done [translating ZeroMQ examples](https://github.com/mrakgr/Lithe-POC/blob/9bd84b3b18fa0c0cc29175a1d17ba725c1b02a83/Lithe%20Avalonia%20Examples/05_ZeroMQ.fs) from the guide into NetMQ, and then I will finally be able to start work on editor support for Spiral. This time there won't be any more challenges to get in my way. As a rough guess I'd say it will take me 3 months to make v0.2 + editor support for it. Considering how much v0.09 took me and how much better v0.2 is going to be than it, I consider this a bargain.

After that it will be time to get some [new toys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhQgElvtb1s). I will resume the hunt for the AI that I left off in 2018. Sure, I might not have particularly excelled at this so far, but the cool thing about this quest is that even if you fail, as long you do not give up every 5 years you will get the chance to try again with 100x more computing power than the last time. Personally, I'll aim to top that off with broader programming skills and better tools as well.

This strategy is bound to work for me at some point.

///

10:20am. I am checking out the ZeroMQ guide as I write the above, but it seems that it is down. If this continues, I'll try to grab something off Libgen.

11:10am. I am done with the review.

11:30am. Doing some proofreading and editing. I think what I have now should be decent. It is a bit long, but it is fine if I break into story at some points.

11:40am. I've been thinking about talking about NetMQ, but who cares about those trivial details. For some people, the stories are about the characters, but for me they are about transmiting the emotional valence. They are about the world itself and power.

The above review is good. I crap on some things and praise others, all deservingly. Imagine if I had ready this a few months ago - it would have saved me quite a bit of time.

Let me commit here and then I'll have breakfast and do some chilling. After that it is review time again."

bingo bango bongo i don't wanna leave the congo oh nonononono

[Verse 1: The Andrews Sisters & Danny Kaye]
Each morning, a missionary advertises neon sign
He tells the native population that civilization is fine
And three educated savages holler from a bamboo tree (Eep! Eloki-pahee-sahana)
That civilization is a thing for me to see

[Chorus 1: Danny Kaye & The Andrews Sisters]
So, bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
Don't want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords, I make it clear
That no matter how they coax him (Yep!)
I'll stay right here

[Verse 2: Danny Kaye & The Andrews Sisters]
I looked through a magazine the missionary's wife concealed (Magazine? What happens?)
I see how people who are civilized bung you with automobile (You know you can get hurt that way, Daniel?)
At the movies, they have got to pay many coconuts to see (What do they see, Danny?)
Uncivilized pictures that the newsreel takes of me

[Chorus: Danny Kaye & The Andrews Sisters]
So, bongo, bongo, bongo, he don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, he's so happy in the jungle, he refuse to go
Don't want no penthouse, bathtub, streetcars, taxis, noise in my ear
So, no matter how they coax him (Yep!)
I'll stay right here

[Verse 3: Danny Kaye & The Andrews Sisters]
They hurry like savages to get aboard an iron train (The Tringle-lingle-hoola-humbaloo Express!)
And though it's smokey and it's crowded, they're too civilized to complain (Alokoko-hosahima-hana)
When they've got two weeks vacation, they hurry to vacation ground (What do they do, Danny?)
They swim and they fish, but that's what I do all year round

[Chorus: Danny Kaye, The Andrews Sisters, & Both]
So, bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
Don't want no jailhouse, shotgun, fish-hooks, golf clubs, I got my spears
So, no matter how they coax him (Yep!)
I'll stay right here

[Outro: Danny Kaye, The Andrews Sisters, & Both]
They have things like the atom bomb
So I think I'll stay where I am
Civilization, I'll stay right here

Creativity

This book â€” and Csikszentmihalyi's work in general â€” is as good an example as any of what I'd like to spend my life doing. Research, writing, and synthesizing how we can lead more interesting, engaged, creative lives.

I love this book. It's one I will read and re-read throughout my life. I've underlined and dog-eared it, used it as a notepad to jot down restaurants to eat at and places to see while travelling. It's been good to me.

This book is also loooooong, and as I added in my highlights and notes, I ended up inserting a number of choice highlights from some of the other reading I was doing on a rainy Saturday afternoon indoors, when the world around me was starting to fall into pieces.

That reading largely centered on a few Jenny Odell interviews and Heather Havrilesky's "Ask Polly" column, which is fucking delightful, and if you've been a dunce and haven't read it yet like me, I encourage you to stop what you're doing and remedy your situation post-hence.

Reduces overall vending machine prices

Because fuck 60 credit raisins, fuck 50 dollars soda, and fuck the baloney bullshit of wanabee economists in spess that can't be assed to do 3 minutes of work changing numbers to make people be able to afford more than 3 soda poppies or 2 bags of raisins per paycheck.

No changes to Vox or Cargo vending machines. I am retarded, not stupid.
