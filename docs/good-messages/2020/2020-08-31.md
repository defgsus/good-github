ZEN: INTERACTIVE: Set MuQSS' yield_type to 0 (don't yield)

Turns out when I investigated performance issues with RPCS3 on Linux
with MuQSS, my choice to set yield_type to 2 was flawed since I didn't
benchmark or any other applications that cared about it.

Phoronix wrote an article measure performance of Liquorix against a
stock 5.4 configuration here: https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=28750

All the benchmarks measured framerate and Liquorix for the most part got
up to 20% less FPS than stock CFS, depending on the game.  Turns out
some of it had to do with yield_type, and always yielding when requested
dropped minimum frame times quite a bit.  Disabling yield entirely
raised the average frame rate a bit and the minimum frametimes on Deus
Ex: Mankind Divided by nearly 10%.

Also, Linus Torvalds wrote in a forum about sched_yield.  He indicated
that yield used to make sense on uniprocessor configurations, but now
with multi-core being the norm, yield almost always causes performance
issues due to cache thrashing and thread/process migration on multicore
systems: https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&curpostid=189752

And finally, even if we don't yield, MuQSS will reschedule the thread
that's spinning anyway.  All setting yield_type to 2 did was reschedule
the thread sooner.  Lets let MuQSS decide when a thread needs to be
rescheduled, not the program.

Previous commit messages:

muqss, zen: Set yield_type to 2

  In my previous attempt in making games and emulators behave better, I
  found that making sched_yield a no-op by setting yield_type to 0 caused
  emulators like RPCS3 to perform far better without frame drops.
  Unfortunately, on my next boot I noticed the whole system felt less
  responsive in general.

  Fortunately, _always_ expiring the timeslice of the yielding process and
  calculating the next deadline also fixes this weird performance anomaly.
  Setting yield_type to 2 with a reduced rr_interval (2ms), should help
  offset the disadvantages of rescheduling a process that has yielded.

muqss, zen: Disable sched_yield by default

  While experimenting with audio stutter and frame drops through the RPCS3
  emulator, I found that yet again, sched_yield is the source of
  unpredictable performance drops.  Reading the original post[1] by Con
  where he outlined his last (final?) change to sched_yield, he changed
  the behavior of sched_yield in MuQSS to only yield to better priority or
  deadline tasks.

  It seems then on my system, emulators and games are yielding to some
  number of higher priority / next deadline tasks and performing much
  worse.  If you look at the comments on the blog post, however, many
  people found that setting yield_type to 0 improve performance on their
  games.

  Lets just turn sched_yield into a noop for now and see how that fairs.
  Worst case we'll receive a report about an application behaving badly,
  and best case everyone will get a net benefit in gaming and emulators.

  This reverts commit 8ec985bcd0ded1bcdd8bb999c90c094dc9536a0b.

  This change, as expected, has strange side-effects with system
  responsiveness when many applications are launching at boot.  Also at
  random times, the mouse becomes unresponsive while over saturating CPU
  bandwidth.

Add preliminary balance support for yearn yETH vault

Not 100% sure this will work, but need to make the v1.7.0 release and
would love to at least try and support the upcoming yETH vault with
it.

Hey ... testing in production is their motto so yeah ...

Create fuzzy test for Android SDK setting fetch

Summary:
As SEV follow up, we want to make sure that wrong server-side data doesn't cause SDK initialization to break.

I'm introducing new test helper class that takes JSON string and tries to replace any key with random type. SDK should never break for all of this inputs.

Due to my lack of knowledge on Android testing or/and old testing frameworks, I had to come up with pretty awful code.
- Robolectric 3 explodes when JSON(or just Object) types are being passed. Migrating to Robolectric 4 is different big thing.
- JSON package is unmocked and not allowed to be called in preparation methods, forcing me to write yet another awful code. I'm truly sorry.

But in the end it works, it generates ~100 tests with different variations of input JSON.
