[java-source-utils] Add Java source code utilities

There are two parts of the current `.jar` binding toolchain which are
painful and could be improved:

 1. Parameter names
 2. Documentation extraction

Parameter names (1) are important because they become the names of
event members as part of ["event-ification"][0].  As such they are
semantically important, and the default behavior of "p0" makes for a
terrible user experience.

*If* the `.class` files in the `.jar` file are built with
`javac -parameters` (4273e5ce), then the `.class` file will contain
parameter names and we're good.  However, this may not be the case.

If the `.class` files are built with `javac -g`, then we'll try to
deduce parameter names from debug info, but that's also problematic.

What's left?

It is not unusual for Java libraries to provide "source `.jar`" files,
e.g. Android provides `android-stubs-src.jar` files, and other
libraries may provide a `*-sources.jar` file.  The contents of these
files are *Java source code*.  These files are used by Android IDEs to
provide documentation for the Java library.  They contain classes,
methods, parameter names, and associated Javadoc documentation.

What they are *not* guaranteed to do is *compile*.  As such, we can't
compile them ourselves with `javac -parameters` and then process the
`.class` files, as they may refer to unresolvable types.

"Interestingly", we *already* have some tooling to deal with this:
`tools/param-name-importer` uses a custom Irony grammar to parse
the Android SDK `*-stubs-src.jar` files to grab parameter names.
However, this tooling is *too strict*; try to pass arbitrary Java
source code at it, and it quickly fails.

Which brings us to documentation (2): we have a [javadoc2mdoc][1] tool
which will parse Javadoc HTML documentation and convert it into
[**mdoc**(5)][2] documentation, which can be later turned into
[XML documentation comments][3] files by way of
[**mdoc export-msxdoc**(1)][4], but this tool is (1) painful to
maintain, because it processes Javadoc *HTML*, and
(2) *requires Javadoc HTML*.

Google hasn't updated their downloadable Javadoc `.zip` file since
API-24 (2016-October).  API-29 is currently stable.

If we want newer docs, we either need to scrape the
developer.android.com/reference website to use with the existing
tooling, or...  we need to be able to read the Javadoc comments within
the `*-stubs-src.jar` files provided with the Android SDK.
(Note: Android SDK docs are Apache 2; file format conversion is fine.)

We thus have two use-cases for which parsing Java source code would
provide a solution.

As luck would have it, there's a decent Apache 2-licensed Java project
which supports parsing Java source code: [JavaParser][5].

Add a new `tools/java-source-utils` program which will parse Java
source code to produce two separate artifacts: parameter names and
consolidated Javadoc documentation:

	$ java -jar java-source-utils.jar --help
	java-source-utils [<-a|--aar> AAR]* [<-j|--jar> JAR]*
		[--bootclasspath CLASSPATH]
		[<-P|--output-params> OUT.params.txt] [<-D|--output-javadocs> OUT.xml] FILES

Provide `--output-params FILE`, and the specified file will be created
which follows the file format laid out in
[`JavaParameterNamesLoader.cs`][6]:

	package java.lang
	;---------------------------------------
	  interface {interfacename}{optional_type_parameters} -or-
	  class Object
	    wait(long timeout)

Provide `--output-javadocs FILE`, and the resulting file will be a
`class-parse`-like XML file which uses `//@jni-signature` as the "key"
and a child `<javadoc/>` element to contain documentation, e.g.:

	<api api-source="java-source-utils">
	  <package name="java.lang">
	    <class name="Object" jni-signature="Ljava/lang/Object;">
	      <javadoc>…</javadoc>
	      <constructor jni-signature="()V">
	        <javadoc>…</javadoc>
	      </constructor>
	      <method name="wait" jni-signature="(J)V">
	        <javadoc>…</javadoc>
	      </method>
	    </class>
	  </package
	</api>

This should make it possible to update the Xamarin.Android API
documentation without resorting to web scraping (and updating the code
to deal with whatever new HTML dialects are now used).

TODO:

In some scenarios, types won't be resolvable.  What should output be?

We don't want to *require* that everything be resolvable -- it's painful, and
possibly impossible, e.g. w/ internal types -- so instead we should "demark"
the unresolvable types.

`.params.txt` output will use `.*` as a type prefix, e.g.

	method(.*UnresolvableType foo, int bar);

`docs.xml` will output `L.*UnresolvableType;`.

fix JavaParameterNamesLoader.cs to support the above.

Throw error if no train examples found and readme improvement (#411)

Summary:
Hello! Thank you for excellent library!

When I was running train flow for the first time according to examples from https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/blob/master/docs/train.md - everything was looking fine, everything started, in logs as well everything was good at the start - arch loaded, nothing failed. And I left it to train for a night. I was surprised in the morning when I found out (reading source code) that I failed to provide list file path and provided directory path in `--train` flag, and it was silently ignored. My model trained whole night with 0 examples; it did 20k+ epochs successfully with zero loss and everything.

I want to change README a bit and to throw an error if no examples found.

sched/tune: Switch Dynamic Schedtune Boost to a slot-based tracking system

Switch from a counter-based system to a slot-based system for managing
multiple dynamic Schedtune boost requests.

The primary limitations of the counter-based system was that it could
only keep track of two boost values at a time: the current dynamic boost
value and the default boost value. When more than one boost request is
issued, the system would only remember the highest value of them all.
Even if the task that requested the highest value had unboosted, this
value is still maintained as long as there are other active boosts that
are still running. A more ideal outcome would be for the system to
unboost to the maximum boost value of the remaining active boosts.

The slot-based system provides a solution to the problem by keeping
track of the boost values of all ongoing active boosts. It ensures that
the current boost value will be equal to the maximum boost value of
all ongoing active boosts. This is achieved with two linked lists
(active_boost_slots and available_boost_slots), which assign and keep
track of boost slot numbers for each successful boost request. The boost
value of each request is stored in an array (slot_boost[]), at an index
value equal to the assigned boost slot number.

For now we limit the number of active boost slots to 5 per Schedtune
group.

llvm-dwarfdump: Return non-zero on error

Makes it easier to test "this doesn't produce an error" (& indeed makes
that the implied default so we don't accidentally write tests that have
silent/sneaky errors as well as the positive behavior we're testing for)

Though the support for applying relocations is patchy enough that a
bunch of tests treat lack of relocation application as more of a warning
than an error - so rather than me trying to figure out how to add
support for a bunch of relocation types, let's degrade that to a warning
to match the usage (& indeed, it's sort of more of a tool warning anyway
- it's not that the DWARF is wrong, just that the tool can't fully cope
with it - and it's not like the tool won't dump the DWARF, it just won't
follow/render certain relocations - I guess in the most general case it
might try to render an unrelocated value & instead render something
bogus... but mostly seems to be about interesting relocations used in
eh_frame (& honestly it might be nice if we were lazier about doing this
relocation resolution anyway - if you're not dumping eh_frame, should we
really be erroring about the relocations in it?))

updated libraries and line endings but who cares about that amirite yknow these annoying autogenerated files nobody updates and for some god forsaked reason cant be put in git ignore cuz theyre too obnoxious to ignore just like my big sibling props to them
derederederemoved that good creamy good creamy v e r u s so now it can seek attention like the rest of random items without explicable sources like the melted cheeseball under my drawer that stinked like wet tofu but tasted like cream cheese yogurt god i wish i had more
fixed tools only working in recipes and slavgiateing cuz item ids are fickle just like my great great grandmapama's toes who could set off bear traps without getting caught god bless them
removed that god darn crafting table recipe conversion jimmy jam for stone cuz you know what it already moved to the anvil but forgot to tell me just like my ol boyboyfriend who said he would call me back but then lost his phone in the dishwasher and ran away to huckstown

Overhauled the Musicbrainz File Naming scrit. Was overcomplicating things too much. I didn't need to do all this stupid if artist contains album artist etc... I want albums grouped on the album artist, and those Album Artists to be the grouping on the file system. It doesn't impact actually tags just the filesystem layout so not sure why I tried so hard. Also added a ton of comments to make it easier to remember what the hell it's doing and what i'm trying to achieve. I also Added a couple additional files. One for other settings that aren't intuitive in musicbrainz such as the preserved tags for my english and anime series tags. I also added a file for the Auto playlist queries.

I'm not dead yet, and neither is my 3DS!
Okay well, technically as I type this, my 3DS is "dead" as it has a new battery and I decided to drain it fully to try and calibrate it.
Anyway, I'm back after flipping forever. I got bored today, remembered that my 3DS still worked (not that anything was stopping me from using Citra), and decided screw it, lets start back up on this project of mine.
I made some really good progress today. Confident enough in the code to allow the ball to move now. The chaning of the ball's angle is still a little wonky (visually) but I have an idea for how to fix that.
Also I don't technically know if this works on real hardware, as I've only tested this most recent work in Citra, but I was using my 3DS earlier and it worked then so hopefully it still does.

20.1.CSV Export{Defining the Custom Action; Adding the Custom Link (Conditionally)}
When we started this tutorial, we kept getting the same question:

  Ryan, would you rather have rollerblades for feet or chopsticks for hands for the rest of your life?

I don't know the answer, but Eddie from Southern Rail can definitely answer this.

We also got this question:

  How can I add a "CSV Export" button to my admin list pages?

And now we know why you asked this question: it's tricky! I want to add a button on top that says Export. But, when you add a custom action to the list page... those create links next to each item, not on top. That's not what we want!

Defining the Custom Action
So let's see if we can figure this out. First, in config.yml, under the global list, we are going to add a new action, called export.
Now, if we refresh... not surprisingly, this adds an "export" link next to every item. And if we click it, it tries to execute a new exportAction() method.
So this is a bit weird: we do not want this new link on each row - we'll fix that in a few minutes. But we do need the new export action. Why? Because as soon as we add this, it's now legal to create a link that executes exportAction(). And that means that we could manually add this link somewhere else... like on top of the list page.

Adding the Custom Link (Conditionally)
Open up our custom list.html.twig.
I'll also hold Command and click to open the parent list.html.twig from the bundle. If you scroll down a little bit, you'll find a block called global_actions. Ah, it looks like it's rendering the search field. The global_actions block represents this area on top.
In other words, if we want to add a new link here, global_actions is the place to do it! Copy that block name and override it inside of our template: global_actions and endlock.
Inside, we'll add the Export button.
But wait! I have an idea. What if we only want to add the export button to some entities? Sure, I added the export action in the global section... but we could still remove it from any other entity by saying -export. Basically, I want this button to be smart: I only want to show it if the export action is enabled for this entity.
How can we figure that out? In the parent template, you'll find a really cool if statement that checks to see if an action is enabled. Steal it!
In our case, change search to export. At this point, we can do whatever we want. So, very simply, let's add a new link that points to the export action. Add a button-action div for styling.
Then, inside, a link with btn btn-primary and an href. How can we point to the exportAction()? Remember, the bundle only has one route: easyadmin. For the parameters, use a special variable called _request_parameters. This is something that EasyAdminBundle gives us, and it contains all of the query parameters. You'll see why that's cool in a minute.
But the most important thing is to add another query parameter called action set to export.
Oh boy, that's ugly. But, it works great: it generates a route to easyadmin where action is set to export and all the existing query parameters are maintained.
Phew! Inside, add a download icon and say "Export".
Try it! Woh! We have an export button... but nothing else.

20.2.CSV Export{Adding the Custom Action; Adding the CSV Export Logic; Using DI in a Fake Action}

Adding the Custom Action
I love to forget the parent() call. Try it again. Beautiful!
When I click export, it of course looks for exportAction in our controller... in this case, GenusController.
Remember: we're not going to support this export action for all of our entities. And to make this error clearer, open AdminController - our base controller - and create a public function exportAction() that simply throws a new RuntimeException: "Action for exporting an entity is not defined".
If we configure everything correctly, and implement this method for all entities that need it, we should never see this error. But... just in case.
Now, to the real work. To add an export for genus, we have two options. First, in AdminController, we could create a public function exportGenusAction(). Remember, whenever EasyAdminBundle calls any of our actions - even custom actions - it always looks for that specially named method: export<EntityName>Action(). Or, we can be a bit more organized, and create a custom controller for each entity. That's what we've done already. So, in GenusController, add public function exportAction().

Adding the CSV Export Logic
To save time, we've already done most of the work for the CSV export. If you downloaded the starting code, in the Service directory, you should have a CsvExporter class.
Basically, we pass it a QueryBuilder, an array of column information, or the entity's class name - which is mapped to an array of column info thanks to this special function, and the filename we want. Then, it creates the CSV and returns it as a StreamedResponse. So all we need to do is call this method and return it from our controller!
I'll paste a little bit of code in the action to get us started.
When we created the export link, we kept the existing query parameters. That means we should have a sortDirection parameter... which is a nice way of making the export order match the list order.
To create the query builder, we can actually use a protected function on the base class called createListQueryBuilder().
Pass this the entity class, either Genus::class or $this->entity['class']... in case you want to make this method reusable across multiple entities.
Next, pass the sort direction and then the sort field: $this->request->query->get('sortField'). Finally, pass in the dql_filter option: $this->entity['list']['dql_filter'].
This is kind of cool. We're using the entity configuration array - which is always full of goodies - to actually read the list key and the dql_filter key below it. If we have a DQL filter on this entity, the CSV export will know about it!
Ok, finally, we're ready to use the CsvExporter class.

Using DI in a Fake Action
But... remember: this is not a real action. I mean, it's not called by the normal core, Symfony controller system. Nope, it's called by EasyAdminBundle... and none of the normal controller argument tricks work. You can't type-hint the Request or any services.
Because of this, we're going to use classic dependency injection. Add a __construct() function and type-hint the CsvExporter class. I'll press Alt+Enter to create a property and set it.
Back down below, just return $this->csvExporter->getResponseFromQueryBuilder() and pass it the $queryBuilder, Genus::class, and genuses.csv - the filename.
Deep breath... refresh! It downloaded! Ha! In my terminal. I'll:
cat ~/Downloads/genuses.csv
There it is!
There's just one last problem: on the list page... we still have those weird export links on each row. That's technically fine... but it's super confusing. The only reason we added this export action was so that it would be a valid action to call:

config/packages/easy_admin.yml
easy_admin:
    list:
        actions: ['show', 'export']
Unfortunately, this also gave us those links!

config: reject parsing of files over INT_MAX

While the last few commits have made it possible for the config parser
to handle config files up to the limits of size_t, the rest of the code
isn't really ready for this. In particular, we often feed the keys as
strings into printf "%s" format specifiers. And because the printf
family of functions must return an int to specify the result, they
complain. Here are two concrete examples (using glibc; we're in
uncharted territory here so results may vary):

Generate a gigantic .gitmodules file like this:

   git submodule add /some/other/repo foo
   {
           printf '[submodule "'
           perl -e 'print "a" x 2**31'
	   echo '"]path = foo'
   } >.gitmodules
   git commit -m 'huge gitmodule'

then try this:

   $ git show
   BUG: strbuf.c:397: your vsnprintf is broken (returned -1)

The problem is that we end up calling:

   strbuf_addf(&sb, "submodule.%s.ignore", submodule_name);

which relies on vsnprintf(), and that function has no way to report back
a size larger than INT_MAX.

Taking that same file, try this:

  git config --file=.gitmodules --list --name-only

On my system it produces an output with exactly 4GB of spaces. I
confirmed in a debugger that we reach the config callback with the key
intact: it's 2147483663 bytes and full of a's. But when we print it with
this call:

  printf("%s%c", key_, term);

we just get the spaces.

So given the fact that these are insane cases which we have no need to
support, the weird behavior from feeding the results to printf even if
the code is careful, and the possibility of uncareful code introducing
its own integer truncation issues, let's just declare INT_MAX as a limit
for parsing config files.

We'll enforce the limit in get_next_char(), which generalizes over all
sources (blobs, files, etc) and covers any element we're parsing
(whether section, key, value, etc). For simplicity, the limit is over
the length of the _whole_ file, so you couldn't have two 1GB values in
the same file. This should be perfectly fine, as the expected size for
config files is generally kilobytes at most.

With this patch both cases above will yield:

  fatal: bad config line 1 in file .gitmodules

That's not an amazing error message, but the parser isn't set up to
provide specific messages (it just breaks out of the parsing loop and
gives that generic error even if see a syntactic issue). And we really
wouldn't expect to see this case outside of somebody maliciously probing
the limits of the config system.

Simulation based assignment

NAME: Samarthya Jaiswal REG: 11802264 ROLL: A-19 OPERATING SYSTEM FACULTY NAME: Shivali Chopra B-TECH CSE (2ND YR) LOVELY PROFESSIONAL UNIVERSITY

Q.6 Suppose that the following processes arrive for execution at the times indicated. Each process will run for the amount of time listed. In answering the questions, use nonpreemptive scheduling, and base all decisions on the information you have at the time the decision must be made. Process Arrival Time Burst Time P1 0.0 8 P2 0.4 4 P3 1.0 1 a. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the FCFS scheduling algorithm? b. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the SJF scheduling algorithm? c. Compute what average turnaround time will be if the CPU is left idle for the first 1 unit and then SJF scheduling is used. Remember that processes P1 and P2 are waiting during this idle time, so their waiting time may increase.

Q.21 A number of cats and mice inhabit a house. The cats and mice have worked out a deal where the mice can steal pieces of the cats’ food, so long as the cats never see the mice actually doing so. If the cats see the mice, then the cats must eat the mice (or else lose face with all of their cat friends). There are NumBowls cat food dishes, NumCats cats, and NumMice mice. Your job is to synchronize the cats and mice so that the following requirements are satisfied:

No mouse should ever get eaten. You should assume that if a cat is eating at a food dish, any mouse attempting to eat from that dish or any other food dish will be seen and eaten. When cats aren’t eating, they will not see mice eating. In other words, this requirement states that if a cat is eating from any bowl, then no mouse should be eating from any bowl. Only one mouse or one cat may eat from a given dish at any one time. Neither cats nor mice should starve. A cat or mouse that wants to eat should eventually be able to eat. For example, a synchronization solution that permanently prevents all mice from eating would be unacceptable. When we actually test your solution, each simulated cat and mouse will only eat a finite number of times; however, even if the simulation were allowed to run forever, neither cats nor mice should starve.
