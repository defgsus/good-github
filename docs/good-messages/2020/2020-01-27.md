"8:45am. I am up and the poison is out of my system. Let me chill a little and then I will start.

8:55am. https://boards.4channel.org/a/thread/198439146/this-really-isnt-necessary

Maybe I'll pick this up...

9:05am. https://mangadex.org/title/17176/mahou-shoujo-tokushuusen-asuka

Ok, focus me. Let me actually read Tog and Asuka, and then I will do some work rather than just philosophize endlessly.

9:45am. Almost done chilling, I will start soon.

9:50am. Ok, programming mode on.

Yesterday it felt like I had made a discovery, but now that I am working over my memories I see that it is mostly emotion. I am not sure what to think of the two assumptions that I've decided to add to my model. It remains to be seen how they'll go.

But I will believe in them. I will believe that once the future comes, keeping the contradictions around rather than disposing them will produce a miracle.

9:55am. Why do I have to keep redesigning my entire language so much?

If v0.2 really is the last word, then it will be fine.

And it is likely that this will be the case. Dependent type theory is unfortunately not the next step in programming languages anymore that second order optimizers are in ML.

10am. Spiral will be the final word.

10:05am. A plain low-style FP language brought to perfection.

That is what I have to work on. That is what I have to do. In this era for the sake of making machines learn.

10:10am. Yesterday put me off my game. It made me determined, but it is not quite the determination I need, so I need warm up a bit.

First of all, since hardware is the catalyst for all of this - just what is coming down the pipe.

Previously, I've looked into memristors, but those are pretty dead at the moment. What exactly do I have to look forward in the near term future?

Let me look into it.

I would absolutely love to get my hands on whatever will come out. Knowing that there is something other than GPUs I can look forward to would motivate me to keep working on Spiral. GPUs really were a disappointment all things considered.

10:20am. https://www.zdnet.com/article/intels-neuro-guru-slams-deep-learning-its-not-actually-learning/

I saw this in the past.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI2DetjB-Xg
Chips for AI - UM's Memristor, Intel's Brain-like chip & Nervana NN Processor | AI Radar 42

This video has a bunch of links.

https://news.umich.edu/first-programmable-memristor-computer-aims-to-bring-ai-processing-down-from-the-cloud/
"In this experimental-scale computer, there were more than 5,800 memristors."

I guess this is promising then, but I won't expect to see this in my rig any time soon.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-019-0270-x

Let me read the study. Ugh, it is paywalled. Fuck Nature.

https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/149957
Neuromorphic Computing with Memristors: From Devices to Integrated Systems

Here is another paper by the lead. Let me just read the abstract.

10:40am. I do not why, but the stuff in his work is not as efficient as I would expect it to be.

...Ok, enough of this.

I will believe in Intel if nobody else. Intel has yet to let me down.

It is likely that the first neuromorphic chip I will get will be from there.

10:45am. Now, forget self reflection and self indulgence. Only idiots think that navel gazing can provide the answers to life and and the universe.

Where was I last time?

```
    | AnnotTest of do_boxing : bool * TExpr * bind: VarTag * on_succ: Expr * on_fail: Expr
    | ValueTest of Tokenize.Value * bind: VarTag * on_succ: Expr * on_fail: Expr
    | DefaultValueTest of string * bind: VarTag * on_succ: Expr * on_fail: Expr
```

On these 3. Let me take care of the `DefaultValueTest` in the prepass.

I'll do that little bit to warm up and then have breakfast.

First of all, let me see how TryParse works.

```
open System
Int32.Parse("123.0")
```

Good, this raises an error. That is what I wanted to check out.

10:55am.

```
        | RawDefaultValueTest (a,b,on_succ,on_fail) ->
            let on_succ x = ValueTest(x,v' b,prepass_value env on_succ,prepass_value env on_fail)
            match System.Int64.TryParse(a) with
            | true,x -> on_succ (Tokenize.LitInt64 x)
            | false,_ ->
                match System.Double.TryParse(a) with
                | true,x -> on_succ (Tokenize.LitFloat64 x)
                | false,_ -> errors.Add(ErMissingValueVar a); B
```

This should be fine.

```
UnionTest(keywords.To a,b.Length,v' c,prepass_value env on_succ,prepass_value env on_fail)
```

Did I remove UnionTest for some reason. I think I did.

```
        | RawUnionTest (a,b,c,on_succ,on_fail) ->
            let env = Array.fold (fun env x -> value_add_local x env) env b
            UnionTest(keywords.To a,b.Length,v' c,prepass_value env on_succ,prepass_value env on_fail)
```

I've put this back in. I'll just omit it in the peval later.

I've been thinking that instead of spending time doing features I won't use, like union types it would be much better to defer this until I actually need the it.

11am.

```
            | ErDefaultValueParse x ->
                show_position' b var_positions.[x]
                b.AppendFormat("Error: {0} cannot be parsed to either the i64 or f64.", x) |> ignore
```

Now, the problem here is that default stuff does not have positions. I am going to have to change it in the parser.

It is time like these that make me happy that instead of having special union types with the position I am instead passing that dictionary around. This makes it a lot easier to extend stuff with breaking existing code.

11:10am. Ok, that is done. Now I no longer have `DefaultValue` as a case in the peval stage. And Value I will just wait until I am done with the if.

```
| AnnotTest of do_boxing : bool * TExpr * bind: VarTag * on_succ: Expr * on_fail: Expr
```

The next on one the list will be this one. To make this one work, I will have to implement both the peval of type expressions and have to trawl through the types to do boxing on the individual pieces.

11:15am. I am going to start by doing the type pevaling. Forget about the case for a bit.

This is what I will be spending my today on.

11:25am. Enough wasting time on 4chan, let me get that breakfast, do the chores and then I will get this thing done."

CED terminal editor

This is the toy terminal editor written in C (C-Editor, CED) that I've
been fleshing out for my own personal use as well as a learning
experience. As of right now it just started out as a main file with
escape terminal codes all based off the `kilo` editor:

https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html

There are other inspirations at the start too, especially from Walter
Bright:
https://github.com/DigitalMars/me

The basic editor codebase is split into 3 sections:
  ced_*   - The core editor and cross platform code
  osx_*   - The OSX platform layer for the editor.
  gilesc_ - My own personal C libraries

The idea for the platform layers is to split the platform specific
code into its own layer calling into the 'core' of the editor.

Since this is just a side project for my own editor and I don't forsee
me actually using this as a day to day driver unless I really get
annoyed with my current editor options, I've put it under the MIT
license.

33.5.Free (Ice Cream) Checkout! {No Card? Webhook Problems}

No Card? Webhook Problems
Thanks to this change, it's now possible for a Customer to not have any cards attached in Stripe. And yea know what? This creates a new problem in a totally unrelated part of the process: webhooks.
But, it's no big deal. Open WebhookController and find the invoice.payment_failed section. Wait! Woh! Before that - oh geez - fix my horrible typo: invoice.payment_succeeded.
This is why you must test your webhooks!
Anyways, back to invoice.payment_failed. Our entire reason for handling this webhook is so that we can send the user an email to tell them that we're having a problem charging their card. We didn't actually do the work, but that email would probably sound like this:
  Hey friend! So, we're having a problem charging your card. If you need to update it, go to your account page and add the new details there.

But what will happen if a user checks out for free, but with a subscription? After their first month, Stripe will not be able to charge them, and it will trigger this webhook.
In those cases, the email should really have some different text, like:

  Yo amigo! I hope you enjoyed your free month. If you want to continue, you can add a credit card to your account page.
So to know which language to use, first fetch the Stripe Customer by saying $this->stripeClient->findCustomer($user). Now we can create a new variable, called $hasCardOnFile. Set that to a count of $stripeCustomer->sources->data and check if it's greater than zero. Now, you can use that variable to write the most uplifting, majestic, and encouraging payment failed emails that the world has ever seen.

"11:35am. https://boards.4channel.org/sci/thread/11330541/apparently-the-babylonians-invented-integral

Just as I said that...this is an interesting discovery.

12:10pm. Done with breakfast. Let me watch that slime ep and then I will do the chores.

1pm. Done with chores. Let me resume. Outside life is a such a distraction. I cannot let it shake my heart.

Two more years. I need to dedicate myself two more years to this.

The Spiral techniques that I've developed are definitely primitive aspects of programming and they compose so well. I cannot commit the grave sin of abandoning them.

I definitely need to keep pushing this. Presumably in the early days of math, steady promotion was needed as well before the subject took uptake. Probably part of the reason why Spiral got skipped over is the general unfamiliarity with this sphere of programming.

1:05pm. This is the last time I will do this. I am not supposed to be such a hard worker. I am supposed to be much lazier than this.

Also one more thing...

It sort of skipped my mind.

There are actually two ways of dealing with variance in returns in RL.

1) The reversibility idea I've talked about.
2) Splitting the update into multiple steps. For example 1 update for reward of 1, 100 updates for a reward of 100 and so on.

This sort of adaptation does require some communication and reflection capabilities between the layers.

So either way, I will be going in the direction of developing the architecture further. The work that has frozen at the end 2017 will resume this year.

1:10pm. I made a long list of features the new Spiral will have, but some like union types and typeclasses (and maybe row polymorhpism) can wait until I need them. So can things like documentation.

The ideal time to push Spiral will be a time a new niche opens up. And that will be when new hardware for ML comes out.

That is where the thread leads, and I will patiently wait to grasp it. It is just as well, since I need that hardware to reach my actual goals.

1:15pm. All of that lies in the future.

1:20pm. Focus me, focus. I know I'd rather just be pissed, but let me do a little bit today.

As I said, let me do the type evaluator.

```
| TRecord of Map<string,TExpr>
```

Whops left the string here.

1:25pm.

```
and partial_eval_type keywords d x =
    let ev d x = partial_eval_type keywords d x
    let inline vt x = if x < 0 then d.env_global_type.[-x-1] else d.env_stack_type.[x]
    match x with
    | TV x -> vt x
    | TPair (a,b) -> PairT(ev d a, ev d b)
    | TFun (a,b) -> RuntimeFunctionT(ev d a, ev d b)
    | TRecord l -> RecordT(Map.map (fun k -> ev d) l)
    | TKeyword (k,l) -> KeywordT(k,Array.map (ev d) l)
    | TApply of TExpr * TExpr
    | TInl of TExpr * Data
    | TUnit
    | TPrim of PrimitiveType
    | TArray of TExpr
    | TPos of Pos<TExpr>
```

This actually is not too bad. That having said...

```
    | TPair (a,b) -> PairT(ev d a, ev d b)
    | TFun (a,b) -> RuntimeFunctionT(ev d a, ev d b)
    | TRecord l -> RecordT(Map.map (fun k -> ev d) l)
```

I should make sure that these two do not evaluate into type level functions, but base types instead.

```
| TypeFunctionT of Ty * StackSize * Ty []
```

Ah, whops, rather than Ty here it should be...

```
| TypeFunctionT of TExpr * StackSize * Ty []
```

Ok...

1:55pm. Focus me. Finish this thing.

2:05pm.

```
and partial_eval_type keywords d x =
    let ev' d x = partial_eval_type keywords d x
    let ev d x =
        match ev' d x with
        | TypeFunctionT _ -> raise_type_error d "The type expression must not evaluate to a type function."
        | x -> x

    let inline vt x = if x < 0 then d.env_global_type.[-x-1] else d.env_stack_type.[x]
    match x with
    | TV x -> vt x
    | TPair (a,b) -> PairT(ev d a, ev d b)
    | TFun (a,b) -> RuntimeFunctionT(ev d a, ev d b)
    | TRecord l -> RecordT(Map.map (fun k -> ev d) l)
    | TKeyword (k,l) -> KeywordT(k,Array.map (ev d) l)
    | TApply(l,r) ->
        match ev' d l with
        | TypeFunctionT(a,b,c) ->
            let d =
                {d with
                    env_global_type=c
                    env_stack_type=Array.zeroCreate b
                    env_stack_type_ptr=0}
            ev' (push_type_var (ev' d r) d) a
        | l -> raise_type_error d <| sprintf "Expected a type level function as the first argument in type application.Got: %s" (show_ty keywords l)
    | TInl(a,b) -> TypeFunctionT(a,b.stack_size,Array.map vt b.free_vars)
    | TUnit -> BT
    | TPrim x -> PrimT x
    | TArray x -> ArrayT (ev d x)
    | TPos x -> ev {d with trace = x.Pos :: d.trace} x.Expression
```

Done with this. Now comes boxing. Agh...

2:15pm.

```
    | AnnotTest(do_boxing,a,b,on_succ,on_fail) ->
        let on_fail () = ev d on_fail
        let a = partial_eval_type keywords d a
        let b = v b
        if do_boxing = false then
            if data_to_ty b = a then ev d on_succ
            else on_fail()
        else
            let rec f = function
                | TyPair(a,b) ->
```

2:20pm.

```
...
            let rec f = function
                | TyPair(a,b), PairT(a,b) -> Ty
```

Ouf, what am I doing with this. Let me check whether the prepass is pushing the variable correctly.

```
| RawAnnotTest (a,b,c,on_succ,on_fail) -> AnnotTest(a,prepass_type env b,v' c,prepass_value env on_succ,prepass_value env on_fail)
```

Erm, yeah, I think I am missing something here.

```
| RawAnnotTest (a,b,c,on_succ,on_fail) -> AnnotTest(a,prepass_type (value_add_local c env) b,v' c,prepass_value env on_succ,prepass_value env on_fail)
```

Let me do this. Now I have to also map the type while checking it for equality.

3pm.

```
    | AnnotTest(do_boxing,ty,expr,on_succ,on_fail) ->
        let a = v expr
        let b = partial_eval_type keywords d ty
        if do_boxing = false then
            if data_to_ty a = b then ev d on_succ
            else ev d on_fail
        else
            let mutable is_succ = true
            let fail a = is_succ <- false; a
            let rec f = function
                | TyB & a, BT -> a
                | TyPair(a,b), PairT(a',b') -> TyPair(f (a, a'), f (b, b'))
                | TyKeyword(k,l), KeywordT(k',l') -> TyKeyword(k,Array.map2 (fun a b -> f (a,b)) l l')
                | TyFunction(a,b,c,d,e,is_forall), RuntimeFunctionT(a',b') -> failwith "TODO"
                | TyRecord l & a, RecordT l' ->
                    if Map.count l = Map.count l' then
                        TyRecord(Map.map (fun k v ->
                            match Map.tryFind k l' with
                            | Some v' -> f (v, v')
                            | None -> fail v
                            ) l)
                    else is_succ <- false; a
                | TyValue x & a, PrimT x' -> if value_to_primitive_type x = x' then a else fail a
                | TyV(T(_,x)) & a, x' -> if x = x' then a else fail a
                | TyR _, _ -> raise_type_error d "Compiler error: TyR should not be here."
                | a,b -> fail a
            if is_succ then ev (push_value_var (f (a,b)) d) on_succ else failwith "TODO"
```

Agh, this is most of it, but I need the closure join point to finish it properly.

3:30pm. I am not even slacking at this point. I just needed to think about this for a while. Last time I seriously thought about closure join points was quite a while ago.

I nearly forgot that I had the functionality for multiple arguments as a part of a library back in v0.09.

3:35pm. But really, really it would be better if I had that functionality built into the pevaller itself.

Then I could compile it more elegantly.

Which will be the case now.

3:35pm. Now that I am thinking things through, something is occurring to me.

I can't really skip the failed box to a runtime function. Failing it will necessary have to result in a type error.

4:30pm. I am still thinking about it.

5:10pm. I am still thinking about it...

Boxing in the new Spiral is much more complicated than before. Closures are certainly a lot more complicated than join points.

5:15pm. I think I have most of it down in my head now.

5:20pm. Ok, let me at least do some cleaning up. I do not think I will be doing more programming for the day and will leave boxing and closures for tomorrow. I'll do the regular join point while I am at it as well.

5:35pm.

```
    let function_to_runtime_function env (a : Expr, b : StackSize, c : Ty [], d : StackSize, e : Data []) (a' : Ty, b' : Ty) =
        failwith "" // TODO

    let rec box d (a,b) =
        let box (a,b) = box d (a,b)
        let fail a b = raise_type_error d <| sprintf "Cannot box %s into %s" (show_typed_data a) (show_ty b)
        match a, b with
        | TyB, BT -> a
        | TyPair(a,b), PairT(a',b') -> TyPair(box (a, a'), box (b, b'))
        | TyKeyword(k,l), KeywordT(k',l') -> TyKeyword(k,Array.map2 (fun a b -> box (a,b)) l l')
        | TyFunction(a,b,c,d,e,false), RuntimeFunctionT(a',b') -> function_to_runtime_function d (a,b,c,d,e) (a',b')
        | TyFunction(_,_,_,_,_,true), _ -> raise_type_error d <| sprintf "Cannot box foralls.\nGot: %s" (show_typed_data a)
        | TyRecord l & a, RecordT l' ->
            if Map.count l = Map.count l' then
                TyRecord(Map.map (fun k v ->
                    match Map.tryFind k l' with
                    | Some v' -> box (v, v')
                    | None -> fail a b
                    ) l)
            else fail a b
        | TyValue x & a, PrimT x' -> if value_to_primitive_type x = x' then a else fail a b
        | TyV(T(_,x)) & a, x' -> if x = x' then a else fail a b
        | TyR _, _ -> raise_type_error d "Compiler error: TyR should not be here."
        | a,b -> fail a b
```

I'll clear that thing tomorrow. First I will refresh my memory of join points and then do this thing.

5:35pm.

```
    | AnnotTest(do_boxing,ty,expr,on_succ,on_fail) ->
        let a = v expr
        let b = partial_eval_type keywords d ty
        if do_boxing = false then if data_to_ty a = b then ev d on_succ else ev d on_fail
        else ev (push_value_var (box d (a,b)) d) on_succ
```

Ah, I see. I made a mistake in the way I take care of variables...

```
        | RawAnnotTest (true,b,c,on_succ,on_fail) -> AnnotTest(true,prepass_type (value_add_local c env) b,v' c,prepass_value env on_succ,prepass_value env on_fail)
        | RawAnnotTest (false,b,c,on_succ,on_fail) -> AnnotTest(false,prepass_type env b,v' c,prepass_value env on_succ,prepass_value env on_fail)
```

Ok. This is good.

5:45pm. Yeah, let me call it a day here. I definitely do not feel like going at it anymore.

This boxing is definitely one of the hardest things in the new compiler, but it won't be too bad.

Right now my experience level is quite high so I'll deal with it.

Back in 2017, it took me retarded amounts of time just to figure out how to do the join points."

Allow installation of unstable, forked, versions

Add head and devel specs to the homebrew formula to allow installation
from the master and develop branches respectively of whichever repo is
the source of the homebrew tap. This is fugly, but it seems a necessary
evil to allow us to maintain a usable fork including new features not
yet merged upstream, without breaking upstream compatibility.

Yeah, I know, it's a horrible hack, I hate it too, but it does the job.

P.S. Yes, this will prevent the formula being accepted to Homebrew core,
but that's not going to happen anytime soon, so not worth worrying about
