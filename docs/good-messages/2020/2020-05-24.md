These changes come courtesy of Tyler, The Creator

Tyler Okonma needed so badly to have a comma right in the middle of his stage name which completely fucked up splitting the artist string by comma and ampersand. A count of artists is found so that you know the program thinks a song featuring Tyler, The Creator & Jay Prince is 3 different people, and there are options to update the artist and features manuaally before entering it into the database. Fuck you Tyler.

you can now use `unrestricted_cast` to force cast to references

 fuck your type safety

oh also i swapped to using a precompiled header, hopefully this cuts down on build time

pending Money Wealth Money How could one spend a decillion dollars? Ad by Ally What’s the best way to save more money? With smart savings tools and consistently competitive rates, Ally Bank helps you save for the future. Learn More 3 Answers  Nikkei Simmer, MA (working on Doctorate) Experiences in Life & SHTF Thesis, School of Hard Knocks (2025) Updated November 11, 2019 · Author has 709 answers and 242.5K answer views This is the point where I can cheerily say that I’d have no more money worries considering one decillion dollars is a 1 followed by 36 zeros before the decimal point.  Considering that my interest annually would be 15 Octillion, let’s just say I wouldn’t have to worry about anything any longer. I could have anything I wanted. I could bend countries to my will if I chose. World leaders. Monarchs would be knocking on my door begging for assistance for their countries.  My beloved wife would be like a reigning consort at my side; all gold-digging harlots will be ignored so if you are not my wife, I’m sorry, you are out of luck and my wife and family will each member have the same level of protection detail that I will have and that includes my mother-in-law whom I will move up to the country in which I reside . My family would be the most powerful family on the face of the entire planet but unlike the Kardashians, I have no interest in being on the news every day. My family will want privacy and they will get it as I will take every rag that writes scurrilous unfounded tabloid articles and sue the company putting them out of business.  One of the key dangers of being related in any way shape or form to the richest man on the planet means that you will be targeted whether immediate family or distantly related. That will be an ever-present danger for anyone even remotely related to me. This means I will have to develop a contingency plan to protect members of my extended family - the ultimate of preemptive bug-out plans -bringing all my relatives no matter how distantly related to a compound where they will live and work under the tightest security possible.  Thus I will develop a compound that is heavily defended and use that as my base of operations which will include an airfield that my aircraft will fly in and out of and there will be six squadrons of fighters protecting that compound. On the base there will be retail outlets; a national military exchange will be brought into effect for all military bases in the country. Each base will become a self-contained city. And my family can develop businesses to help our military personnel on the personal compound/military base The family compound will also be a fully functional national military base in operation to defend the nation so other national assets will be parked there as well as five strategic air-lifters. The fleet of C-17s for the national military will have been increased from five to sixty to take into account our increased national defense posture which I will indicate later. This will be a high security national base as command and control will operate from this base.  A hardened bunker that would withstand a direct hit from a 250MT strategic nuclear weapon would be built within the a section of the Rocky Mountains that rises within my country. In there would include the bunker containing a national command and control center to coordinate response in case of an attack on the country; a hardened airfield within the bunker itself; the airfield doors will be able to withstand over-pressures generated by a 300MT nuclear weapon. Thus my entire extended family and all the men and women serving on the base will be safe.  Oh you wonder why I said “extended family”. That is because I will also be conducting a genetic research project determining WHO my spousal relatives are and bringing all law-abiding members of our extended family up to the country in which I live to form a secure compound so that no-one can get to them. With my level of income they won’t ever have to work again. Even if each only got $40M apiece. I’m dealing in octillions of interest here. The genealogy project will determine who is legally entitled to be a part of my family. My side of the family from my mother and her brothers. Other than my dad’s side of the family, my mother’s side have made their choice and will not be helped even if they beg; they had their chance. My dad’s side of the family will be brought over once the Japanese government is given 10 more squadrons of F-35s to open up my family temple records for research over the objections of the privacy laws. You don’t stymie the genealogical research team of the most powerful man in the world. It’s just not done. It’s amazing what doors national defense help will open up.  This way I know at a glance who is a legitimate relative in need of help and who is just a grifting pretender. Ah the old “you’d better hope to hell that you are my family member whether it be my wife’s family or my father’s side of the family if you’re coming out and begging for my money. And if so, you’d better be nice.” If you are a criminal, you can pretty much rot in jail though I may be nice and hire someone to look into your case and see if you were wrongfully accused. ~evil grin~  By this time people are wondering if I will be benevolent in my dealings. Of course I would..,  unless you ticked me off or have ticked me off in the past. I am forgiving but only up to a certain point.  World leaders would do well to fear me because I could buy their entire country and remove it from the face of the earth with one phone call to the UN. If you do not do what is best for the planet and the people of the world; I will remove you with due prejudice and you will go back to private life being the insignificant little worm you are though albeit with protection as per your former status as national leader; all so that some unhinged lunatic doesn’t go and bump you off to make a name for him/herself. I don’t need that bad publicity and headache and you; incompetent worm, do not deserve to become your national martyr.  My interest from my investments would be several septillion times more than the GDP of the entire globe. I could buy the world more times than anyone could ever fathom. I could make everybody a millionaire (if I wanted to and have more money than anyone could ever hope to spend in a lifetime many times over. But I would use some of that money to make life better in key places.  i’d take at least 27B and develop a trust to help underprivileged youth get a post-secondary education and get them ready to make a contribution to society.  I’d end world hunger by helping Africans to try to get themselves in a state where they are able to nurture the land and grow their own food. Develop irrigation and agriculture.  At home and abroad i would donate to legitimate causes to reduce poverty. And I wouldn’t havegone through 10 Trillion yet.  I’d invest in green technologies aiming to help startups pursue ways of making the earth cleaner. And hey, I’d help out Elon Musk by ensuring that he can innovate and invent newer and cleaner  i’d encourage innovation by funding companies that will look at improving not polluting the earth. I want to see companies that will invent a way to clean up our water sources. .  I’d fund medical research so that we can find:  a cure for cancer (all types of cancer to the point where we can cure Stage IV metastatic cancer a cure for heart and lung disease a cure for AIDS a cure for all the hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Marburg, and others) medical research to continually develop new forms of antibiotics and antivirals to keep resistant bacteria from developing. There will be a charity totalling $2.6T for hospitals around the world to receive state of the art medical diagnostic equipment. No hospital anywhere around the world should be without the necessary equipment to diagnose any patient. A further $5.6T charity will go towards scholarships for aspiring medical students and for further training in their field.  Nationally in the country I live in: Health care; what the Americans love to trash as “socialist health” care will continue and be strengthened including presciption glasses, prescription medications and dental care in the basic health coverage. And I will add an infusion of $14T annually to healthcare to ensure that all are covered including the homeless so that no-one has to make the choice of putting food on the table or getting medical help.  Furthermore $10.6T will go towards developing a infectious diseases research hospital that would treat those who have Class IV pathogens in a safe hygienically contained medical units under negative pressure which will keep pathogens from escaping their unit Also research so that fifty medical pressurised transport units (contagious diseases ambulances) will be designed and developed. The first hospital will go in Africa. Other hospitals will go in a central location on each continent treating all this will take over $165T. Each plague will be contained and systematically eliminated.  Fund research on developing an interstellar spacecraft and propulsion source that will allow us to go explore space and solve our world’s over-population problem. It is time for humanity to start looking towards the stars for exploration and colonizing the solar system and beyond. NASA’s $21.7B budget just got doubled to $45B along with a request to start working on getting part of humanity off the planet to colonize Mars.  Start a program to replenish the rainforests for evert tree cut down in the rainforest three are replanted.  Invest into research to find a suitable replacement for carbon based fuels that provides the same energy output as fossil fuels and kill that industry.  And provide retraining in the green sector or a generous severance package for those that want to leave the industry and retire.  On a national level political agendas involving social assistance and government reform  In my country welfare will be eliminated and the following program instituted; $500B will go to the creation of a Basic Livable Income irrespective of earnings. To make it fair to everybody. No-one should have to go without the basic necessities of life and will be increased to cover the immigrants to this country due to our burgeoning economy. “Come to our country, we’ll take care of you”. disabled get more as their care expenses have to be taken into account.  Internal political corruption will be eliminated and government excesses will be cut. Each politician will receive their $26K basic income plus a $65K national service income and a $100K expense account that is assessed annually for discrepancies in their spending. The $100K is a hard cap (no going over) and any unused portion from the previous year’s expense account will not roll-over to the next year. It’s straight $100K each year; no exceptions. The expense account covers travel and maintenance This-will eliminate excessive budget spending and force politicians to be accountable for their spending habits.  I will sit the leaders down and essentially tell them I want the planet carbon neutral by 2030 -they get 10 years or I buy their country’s debt and hold is as a liability payable in $10M installments until they get their act together.  Make no mistake: I live in the country next door to what WAS the most powerful country in the world. And with the country I reside in now being the most powerful country in the world due to my taxes fueling my country to unprecedented financial levels, it will turn the country into the most technologically advanced nation in the world. Most world corporations would seek to move to this country in order to take advantage of the fact that I will be fueling a spending budget in the octillions. And thus thry will flee their respective countries bringing their workers with them thus sending the population of my country skyrocketing. This would mean that aircraft and tech companies will be exiting their respective countries seeking to build a better financial base and open up new markets. This will be a time of great upheaval within any other country than the one the richest person in the world is living in.  If companies like Boeing, Mikoyan Guerivich and others leave to go to my country. Those countries are done like over-cooked steak. Essentially I have won the financial war.  I will be working WITH the Prime Minister of my country to make our country the strongest country in the world and this country will now become the world leader in freedom, a true bastion of freedom. But make no mistake it would be MY country and my decisions fronted by the PM. What I say will come to pass as far as national defense. When you have that kind of money, you pretty much call the shots.  Gun licensing will remain in force. But there will no longer be any restrictions. No more prohibited or restricted classes. They are gone. If you have a PPL/FAC You can own any weapon you wish within reason. You won't get to play with explosives without a demolitions license and you would have to have a legal reason for doing so such as being the owner of a currently established blasting company. You can own a howitzer if you want but you are going to have to shoot it at a government licensed “artillery range” that would be open to the public. Considering the range of those things you won’t be allowed to shoot it at home. Sorry.  I’m sure that there will be attempts to silence me from certain factions including several corrupt industry leaders who would like nothing more than to silence me due to the fact that I am pushing research on green tech. That faction would probably include several national leaders as well who would be incensed that I’m telling them what to do. Let’s just say that attempting to eliminate me would be unwise at the very least. Do not mistake magnanimity for weakness because the strength in military power that I wield would be immense far greater than the sum of the two major nuclear powers combined. Protection so that I can continue to do good deeds without interference from those seeking power.  Such wealth and power must be wielded by those who are not vulnerable to outside influence and corruption.  Money will get me and my family protection who will be ex JTF2, Ex-Navy SEAL, Mossad, and Spetznaz as well ex-Japanese Tokushusakusengun. All capable of handling any attack; in fact I will have ex-operatives from every single special forces in the world who can also function as interpreters. This way I am aware of every single word spoken during negotiations. And they will be armed with the best weapons money can buy.  With nonillions of dollars one could actually wield the most powerful military force the world has ever seen. I could snap my fingers and have enough soldiers to rival even the United States of America and all equipped with the highest tech weapons as I would be able to hire the brightest minds to develop high technology 6th Generation fighters and weapons as well as hire those who would train them to the cutting edge of advanced readiness. And I would ensure that their families were protected and the men and women paid well thus making them loyal. Air Force; Army, Navy, Special Ops. All affordable to a nonillionaire because even the richesr country in the world would be unable to compete without putting themselves into debt. Any nation thinking they were facing an ill-trained fighting force would be overwhelmingly decimated considering my special forces protection detail would be what they encountered, any specops force sent to capture me would not come home to whichever country they originated from….alive.  MAD would not be on the table and it would be unwise for any nation to threaten me with use of nuclear weapons. Ever heard the saying: don’t ever threaten someone with money, they have ways of removing you. And a nation would not be wise to threaten someone with money far

Golden Gauntlets of Power

+1d20 to hit, +1d10 to damage

Grants drain resistance when worn.

When blessed, deals +3d7 + 1d20 (due to gold material) to holy-hating foes

When cursed, deals +3d9 + 1d20 (due to gold material) to unholy-hating foes

Maxes dexterity when worn.

Premium heart nerf: Premium heart adds its enchantment to dexterity, rather than maxing it

Bugfix: gauntlets of dex probably shouldn't add their full enchantment to damage when using rapiers.  Should probably be 1/2 spe.

Bugfix: Rod of seven parts should also change the die size for holy damage (symmetrical with unholy damage)

"8:10pm. I want to study the Hopac API just to alleviate my doubts, but this is really not the time for it. Let me slack for a bit and then I will go to bed.

8:45pm. https://github.com/Hopac/Hopac/blob/master/Examples/ToDo/ToDo.fs

```
// The main problem with this example is that this doesn't really contain
// anything where choice streams work significantly better than Rx, such as
// asynchronous http requests, polling, streams requiring backpressure, or
// initialization of streams that would require hacks like `Publish-Connect` in
// Rx.  Although it doesn't really make any difference in this example, the
// `keepPreceding1` combinator is an example of something that is not supported
// by .Net Rx.  See comment below.
```

5/24/2020

7:55am. I am up. Yesterday I praised the reactive combinators to death, but it is not a given that I will pick them over Hopac. As I said, UIs are one thing, but I want something that will give me the most power and flexibility when it comes to doing the language support.

I have in my mind chains of modules. And I want to do this efficiently - I want to make it so that when the user moves from file to file, that the attention being put is being used effectively.

8:10am. Though I could move to the next example, today I want to do more experimentation. I do want to look into how pull streams work. I also want to investigate `AutoConnect`. Does that thing only manage connections? If so, how would I dispose of the whole chain?

I won't hurry this. I know that I have a lot to learn before I am ready to start.

Now, let me slack for a while and then I'll get on with it.

8:20am. Agh, I cannot wait.

```
    let a = Subject.broadcast
    let a' = a.Select((*) 2).Publish().AutoConnect()
```

...No, this won't work. But I am wondering what that second optional argument is.

http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Observable.html#cache--

This is RxJava.

8:25am. http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/observables/ConnectableObservable.html#autoConnect--

For what I want, I do need a persistent connection. Still, the observable chain might have resources I want to dispose when it is entirely done.

8:30am. I need to play a bit. Let me see if autoconnects manages connections at least. Regarding the disposable, I have an idea.

```
    let s = Subject.broadcast
    let a = s.Publish().AutoConnect().Do(printfn "a got %A")
    let b = a.Publish().AutoConnect().Do(printfn "b got %A")
    let c = b.Publish().AutoConnect().Do(printfn "c got %A")
    let _ =
        use __ = c.Subscribe()
        s.OnNext(22)
    let _ =
        use __ = a.Subscribe()
        s.OnNext(11)
    0
```
```
a got 22
b got 22
c got 22
a got 11
b got 11
a got 11
```

This is completely useless.

I get that you won't manage the inner subscription, but at least get rid of the connection when there are no subscribers.

8:55am. At this point though, I am getting too deeply involved with managing subscriptions.

Had to take a short break. I am wracking my brain over this, and I can't escape the sense that I am on the wrong path.

...Decided to go look at the extension options and I see that there is a recheck entire document on save option. That needs to be off.

...

Now, Hopac. Rx is good for UIs, but it is not going to get me all the way to the end after all. Past a certain point, the subscription burden becomes a weakness.

I am going to have to look into Hopac after all.

As time consuming as this will be, I am going to have to try doing UIs pull based fashion just to see where that gets me.

9am. I just can't do this quickly. I can't master concurrency just like that.

https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/

Hmmm, this is interesting.

9:30am. https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/

I'll read this later. Forget about this for now.

9:55am. Ok, focus me. Leave that Shuten thread from two days ago alone.

It is time for Hopac. I need practice, practice, practice. I need hard training to break through this current hurdle.

Right now, I feel like my reactive (push) combinator skills are pretty good. But I need to master the other side as well. Only at that point will I be complete.

10am. Maybe there is way to do it using Rx, but it is not as straightforward as I would prefer it to be.

```
        Disposable.Create(fun () ->
            let pollers, tasks = Array.unzip l
            pollers |> Array.iter (fun (x : NetMQPoller) -> x.Stop())
            Task.WaitAll(tasks)
            tasks |> Array.iter (fun x -> x.Dispose())
            pollers |> Array.iter (fun (x : NetMQPoller) -> x.Dispose())
            )
```

Let me dispose of the pollers as well.

10:05am. Actually, I can in fact see the way to do it using Rx. Instead of the usual chaining, I would have to pass the observable in as the scan's argument.

Which is convoluted. It is no wonder I want to try the pull version.

Let me do it. Let's see where it gets me.

I need to make up my mind and just do it. It is finally time to get some Hopac experience.

This will no doubt take me a few days. Maybe an entire week, but it will be worth it.

How about I aim for the button stacking example first and then make my way from there?

10:35am. Uah...

I have no idea, where to even start with this. I can see how doing that file chain would be easier using the pull model, but here I am trying to do an UI library.

10:45am. I am really drawing a blank here.

10:55am. Shit.

Instead of getting ideas about how to do this with Hopac, I am pitting the two in my head and Rx is coming on top. I am figuring out how to do the observable chain in a natural and efficient manner. It is all coming together to me.

11:05am. No wait, no shit. I want servers to have persistent state even when they are unsubscribed to.

The key factor here seems to be whether I should use disposable on GC'd state. If I have...

```
                    num_buttons.SelectMany(fun x ->
                        stack_panel [
                            do' <| fun pan -> pan.Background <- Brushes.Red; pan.Margin <- Thickness 20.0
                            children <| create_buttons x
                            ]
                        )
```

Oh, this might be bad.

I do not think this will really unsubscribe from the old one.

```
                    num_buttons |> Observable.switchMap(fun x ->
                        stack_panel [
                            do' <| fun pan -> pan.Background <- Brushes.Red; pan.Margin <- Thickness 20.0
                            children <| create_buttons x
                            ]
                        )
```

Let me try this.

11:10am. Yeah, it works.

11:20am. Let me take a short break.

11:45am. I'll segue that into a big break."

Instruction Rig

Here we setup the foundation for how the Butler would carry out the
instructions to fulfil intent. This revision sees the butler acting on
every instruction as they are given from the command. It needs not
buffer; it needs not remember. Every intent the user has, gets passed on
as an instruction which the Butler acts on.

My original thoughts here are detailed in the Dispatcher. I wanted
something which incorporated event sourcing. I think event sourcing is a
better argument here because we would like to know how a project
progressed through time. Without event sourcing, we would only have the
snapshot of the project in time. This would mean, however, that I need
to setup the event sourcing rig... ain't nobody got time for that; at
least not right now. But if I had all the time in the world to design
this before first launch, definitely event sourcing. Decoupling reasons.

The sequence I settled for, in this revision, looks something like this

+-----------+      +------------+      +-------------+
| CLI Input |----->| Dispatcher |----->| Instruction |
+--+--------+      +------------+      +-------------+
   | Intent |             |                    |
   +--------+             |    +-----------+   |
                          +--->| Exception |<--+
                               +-----------+

The Dispatcher serves as a router for the Butler. Since my mind wouldn't
shut up, it's claiming that this could be some sort of broker service at
scale; but we aren't at scale yet.

The Instruction is the quintessential command. This is what the Butler
must do. At the moment. This action is mapped to the intent which comes
from the CLI Input.

Exceptions are how the Butler flips the table and goes "ain't nobidy got
time for this". But of course, in a polite way. A Butler must be polite
afterall.

#### Sunday 2020-05-24 16:26:54 by Marko Grdinić

"1:30pm. Let me resume. I've been thinking about it while in bed, and I do not see how the ...

```
  /// Represents a point in a non-deterministic stream of values.
  type Cons<'x> =
    /// Communicates a value and the remainder of the stream.
    | Cons of Value: 'x * Next: Promise<Cons<'x>>
    /// Communicates the end of the stream.
    | Nil
```

Can really be used to convert events.

I need to figure this out.

There are some examples in that file, so I need to start going through them. For simplicity, I should just convert an observable to a stream.

1:50pm.

```
 <PropertyGroup>
  <ServerGarbageCollection>true</ServerGarbageCollection>
 </PropertyGroup>
```

What the hell? Why am I getting the warning even if I put this in?

2:05pm. Had to take a short break. Let me get back to this issue. It is extremely confusing.

2:10pm.

```
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>preview</LangVersion>
    <RootNamespace>Lithe_Avalonia_Examples__Hopac_</RootNamespace>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <ServerGarbageCollection>true</ServerGarbageCollection>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

It seems .NET 5.0 does not work with the latest VS, only the preview version.

Agh, what the hell? So do I need to use the latest, or is there a way to turn it on even with 3.1?

Oh it works now. It seems it did not register the changes to the `.fsproj` at first. That is why it failed. Piece of crap IDE.

...Now instead of getting upset at this, let me get back on track. I need to test those streams.

2:15pm.

```
open Hopac
open System
open FSharp.Control.Reactive

let s = Observable.ofSeq [1;2;3;4]
let x = Stream.ofObservable s
x |> Stream.mapFun (fun x -> printfn "%A" x; x) |> Stream.consume

Console.ReadKey()
```

Finally it works.

Now, can I do something like get the last element of the stream?

2:20pm.

```
open Hopac

open System

open FSharp.Control.Reactive

let s = Observable.ofSeq [1;2;3;4]
let x = Stream.ofObservable s
//x |> Stream.mapFun (fun x -> printfn "%A" x; x) |> Stream.consume

x |> Stream.last |> Stream.mapFun (fun x -> printfn "%A" x; x) |> Stream.consume

Console.ReadKey()
```

Ok, but what if it is not closed?

```
open Hopac

open System

open FSharp.Control.Reactive

let s = Subject.broadcast
s.OnNext(1)
s.OnNext(2)
s.OnNext(3)
let x = Stream.ofObservable s
//x |> Stream.mapFun (fun x -> printfn "%A" x; x) |> Stream.consume

x |> Stream.last |> Stream.mapFun (fun x -> printfn "%A" x; x) |> Stream.consume

Console.ReadKey()
```

Then this does nothing.

2:20pm. This is not going well. I am starting to see it, but really just what am I going to do?

2:35pm. Ah, I got it. I know how to avoid propagating lazy values in the compilation pipeline!

Unfortunately, lazy streams are useless for what I want. Now that I've had some time to think about it, I see that they are not that I want. The author makes a big deal of them, but putting a callback on an event loop somewhere and they are not that different.

Instead, I get what I need to do.

Here is how I've been envisioning the compilation pipeline.

```
1    2    3
|    |    |
P1   P2   P3
|    |    |
T1---T2---T3---->result.
```

Here `P1` to `P3` refer to parse nodes and `T1` to `T3` are typechecking nodes.

The real problem I've had is not how to constuct this chain, but how to make it efficient.

For example, if the user is using file `2` I do not want the compiler to typecheck everything that comes after it right away as it would slow things down significantly. But I've had a difficult time thinking this through - if I use ref counting tricks, then the work that has been done will be lost when the focus changes.

I do not want the user to go from file 3 to 1 and that causing all the typechecking work to be lost due to the unsubscription.

The same goes for parsing information if the project files get added or reordered. I do not want adding files at the end to trigger a whole compilation run from the start.

I now see the solution. Keep the `P` and the `T` nodes connected and live at all times regardless of the focus. Usually that would cause the entire chain to be active (which I've been thinking of making things lazy) but suppose I add a bunch of intermediate nodes...

```
1       2       3
|       |       |
P1      P2      P3
|       |       |
T1--N1--T2--N2--T3--N3-->result.
```

What should the `N` nodes be - they should be simple identity nodes that use reference counting with a limit of 2.

With that kind of construction the chain won't...

...well, it might be troublesome if the files change outside the editor. Sure there is that.

3pm. The reason why streams are a dead end is because I want switching behavior...I want the work to be get rid of quickly and move to the latest thing when a subscriber comes in.

3:10pm. No, this is too complicated. Was creating a chain that propagates lazy values such a bad idea?

But rather than lazy values, now it occurs to me that that `Task`s might be a better choice instead. They are somewhat like lazy values, but I could use them to parallelize parsing. This was my intention with regular values, but I'd lose control over that if I started propagating them lazily.

3:20pm. Ok, according to the .NET documentation, lazy is thread safe. There is even an option to turn it on and off.

3:25pm. One thing that is confusing me is why is the `TaskScheduler` so bereft of anything.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler?view=netcore-3.1

Maybe the interesting methods are all internal?

3:35pm. Ah, I see it.

Basically using tasks and lazy values is not a bad solution, but it is not what I am trying to get at either. I do not want the chain to be semi-active.

I see now what the right way is...

```
1       2       3
|       |       |
M1      M2      M3
|       |       |
P1      P2      P3
|       |       |
T1--N1--T2--N2--T3--N3-->result.
```

Yeah this is it. If I make M1 to M3 the `.RefCount(2)` nodes then everything falls into place.

3:50pm. No, wait, wait. This is all wrong. If T is fully connected, then it will block the incoming subscriptions. Those inner nodes are completely meaningless as the only they will do is completely disconnect the chain.

4pm. Ah, I am just being a stubborn here. There is nothing wrong with going with the lazy values idea. I could do something more elaborate, but everything I can think of would significantly complicate things.

4:05pm. I am going into absurdities. I am not trying to solve the problem of constructing a chain for a realistic project, but I am going into absurdities where the number of nodes would be extremely large.

And I am assuming many vertical phases in addition to this.

I might have drawn those diagrams above, but in my mind I am also thinking how I would do something much bigger.

4:05pm. Suppose you have a very large Spiral project of 100 files. Even if you are editing the very first file, it is not like it is a huge expense to propagate 100 lazy values through the observable chain on every save. Even if they end up being unused, it is not going to be a big deal.

In the first place, in the real world, the hierarchies are not so long and shallow, but go in depth instead.

So realistic max number of values propagated is no more than a few dozen. This goes the same for F# which like flat and linear structures. At certain point you'd separate the files into different projects to encourage reuse. This would happen even if the express purpose is not to speed up the compiler.

4:20pm. Today things are not really going for me. I feel that usually I would be faster to recognize the value of the lazy values idea. But for a while I've been feeling down, so every idea looks poor. I am not as decisive as I should be. I have to put in extra effort to push through my internal state.

Well, I'll get over it before long. And eventually I will master concurrency and this fear and insecurity will be a thing of the past.

I'd honestly just call it a day, but I can still go on.

Let me play around a bit with tasks.

4:25pm.

```
let main argv =
    //Avalonia.ZeroMQ.Main.main argv
    let t = Task(fun () -> printfn "Hello")
    t.Start()
    t.Start()
    0
```

This will throw an exception. Good.

What if you try to wait on a task that has not been started?

4:25pm. The thread blocks forever. Ok.

4:30pm. And I know that tasks are hot, unlike F#'s `async`.

```
let main argv =
    //Avalonia.ZeroMQ.Main.main argv
    let t = Task<int>(fun () -> printfn "Hello"; 1)
    t.ContinueWith(fun (x : Task<int>) ->
        printf "%A" x.Status
        2
        )
    t.Start()
    t.Status |> printfn "%A"
    t.Result |> printfn "%i"
    t.Status |> printfn "%A"
    0
```

Ah, crap. See what this prints me.

```
Hello
WaitingToRun
RanToCompletion1
RanToCompletion
```

`ContinueWith` adds a continuation to the task mutably. Now that is shit.

4:50pm. It really bothers me how `ContinueWith` is co-monadic. Rather than being `f a -> (a -> f b) -> f b`, it is `f a -> (f a -> b) -> f b`. I honestly have no idea what the .NET guys were thinking when they made this. They had like 15 years to get the design right and they blew it. Even JS of all things got this right.

4:55pm. Ok, I am done with Hopac. Today I got nowhere with it.

Let me get rid of the project.

5:05pm. Ok...

All in all, today's session was poor. I wasn't into it at all, though I did some quality thinking.

I just did not feel like doing the examples.

5:10pm. I am going to do that tomorrow. Forget pull concurrency. The way things are going, I am going to find a way to obsolete Hopac across the board.

I really am quite good at composing disposables of all things. Maybe my FP skills are too strong at this juncture. My intrinsic style mixes imperative and functional in just the right amounts and what reactive combinators give me is just so right. I got a lot of practice doing that stuff by programming in Spiral.

Are there any particularly compelling examples of streams in use?

5:25pm. No, it does not seem so.

```
  /// On the other hand, choice streams offer several advantages over observable
  /// sequences:
```

Let me go through this again.

```
  /// - Basically all operations on ordinary lazy streams can be implemented on
  /// and are meaningful on choice streams.  The same is not true of observable
  /// sequences, because they do not compose the same way.  Many trivial choice
  /// stream combinators, such as `foldBack` and `tails`, can be either
  /// impossible or very challenging to specify and implement meaningfully for
  /// observable sequences.
```

`tails` is some weird thing. Does it give all the tail combinations?

```
  /// - Choice streams allow for the use of asynchronous programming at any
  /// point.  Most higher-order choice stream combinators have both an
  /// asynchronous `Job` and a synchronous `Fun` form.  For example, `iterJob`
  /// waits for the asynchronous job to finish before consuming the next value
  /// from the stream.  The `Subscribe` operation of observables cannot support
  /// such behavior, because `OnNext` calls are synchronous.
```

The counterpoint to this is that you can in fact propagate lazy values. You can't do things like selection on this though. But to do selection you'd need to eval the lazy streams as well.

```
  /// - Choice streams are consistent in that every consumer of a stream gets
  /// the exact same sequence of values unlike with observable sequences.  In
  /// other words, choice streams are immutable and elements are not discarded
  /// implicitly.  There is no need for `Connect` and `Publish` or `Replay` like
  /// with observable sequences.
```

But I can't have the switching behavior. Maybe I should ask about this? Also before you tout the above as an advantage you should say what would prevent streams from being overwhelmed much like observables. Rich Hickey when he introduced channels made sure to say a few words against unbounded buffers.

```
  /// - The asynchronous one element at a time model of choice streams allows
  /// for a basic form of backpressure or the flow of synchronization from
  /// consumers to producers.  This allows for many new operations to be
  /// expressed.  For example, `keepPreceding1` and `keepFollowing1` cannot be
  /// implemented for observable sequences.  Operations such as `afterEach` and
  /// `beforeEach` have semantics that are pull based and lazy and cannot be
  /// implemented for observable sequences.  Operations such as `pullOn`, or
  /// `zip` in disguise, have new uses.
```

What `afterEach` does is invoke a delay after each job.

I mean sure you can have this behavior if you wrap the result in a lazy value that does the delay.

A lot of these arguments sound the same like Haskell's arguments in favor of laziness. Great composability advantages that I never seem to see in practice, but I sure see space leaks in its tooling and in the programs I actually made.

5:40pm. As much as it hurts me, I am going to turn against this stuff from here on out and see where it gets me. There was that brief moment where I thought that I would need agents and channels after that, but then I leveled up my Rx skills and that became completely unnecessary.

It might be irrational to hate, but much like I could not programming in F# if I thought Haskell was better, so I cannot go forward with Rx if I keep having Hopac at the back of my mind.

5:45pm. Decisiveness is what I need here. Wasn't my goal to crush the outside world through sheer programming skill?

Until I get to that point, I need to go forward believing in my own path. What I do here each day is very little, but it will build up eventually. The time when I will be done with this is getting nearer.

Reactive push combinators are not a joke. They are probably the cultimation of the functional/imperative hybrid style of programming.

5:50pm. Pushing them (pun intended) might make me wrong in some contexts, but I can be sure that it won't be particularly wrong if it comes to that.

I need to find out just how good I really am.

I need to finish the rest of the examples, just like I have planned. I need to get fully familiar with ZeroMQ.

Once I am done with studying ZeroMQ, all the pieces will be set.

6:10pm. Damn it, I am so depressed right now, but doing GUIs was a neverending parade of joy up to this point. I should get back to that. What did I do to deserve this?

Though I got better at using reactive combinators, this is probably not all there is to them.

6:20pm. Let me close here for the day. Even though this will be the last journal entry no doubt I will be simmering for the rest of the day. Based on previous experience, tomorrow I should bounce back and start getting things done."

Refactor docs / Maintenance of docs (#1456)

* Split code style and components documentation

Splits 'the_black_code_style', 'pragmatism', 'blackd',and 'black_primer'
into their own files. The exception being 'the_black_code_style' and
'pragmatism'. They have been merged into one 'the_black_code_style_and_pragmatism'
file.

These changes are being made because the README is becoming very long. And
a README isn't great if it dissuades its reader because of its length.

* Update the doc generation logic and configuration

With the moving of several sections in the README and the renaming of a
few files, 'conf.py' needs to be able to support custom sections.

This commit introduces DocSection which can be used to specify custom
sections of documentation. The information stored in DocSection will be
used by the process_sections function to read, process, and write the section
to CURRENT_DIR.

A large change has been made to the how the docs are prepared to be built.
Instead of just generating the files needed by reading the README, this
has a full chain of operations so custom sections are supported. First,
it reads the README and spits out a list of DocSection objects representing
the sections to be generated by process_sections. This is done since most
of the docs still live in README. Then along with the defined custom_sections
, the process_sections will be begin to process the DocSection objects.
It reads the information it needs to generate the section. Then fetches
the section's contents, calls processors required by the section to process
the section's contents, and finally writes the section to CURRENT_DIR.

This large change is so processing of the documentation can be done just
for the versions hosted on ReadTheDocs.org. An example processor using this
feature is a 'replace_links' processor. It will replace documentation
links that point to the docs hosted on GitHub with links that point to the
version hosted on ReadTheDocs.org. (I won't be coding that ATM)

This also means that files will be overwritten or created once the docs
have been built. It is annoying, since you have to 'git reset --hard'
and 'git clean -f -d' after each build, but there's nothing better. The old
system had the same side effects, so yeah :(

* Update filenames and delete unnecessary files

Update the filenames since 'the_black_code_style' and 'pragmatism' were
merged and 'contributing' was deleted in favor of 'contributing_to_black'.

All symlinks were deleted since their home (_build/generated) is no longer
used.

* Fix broken links and a few redirections

* Merge master into refactor_docs (manually done)

* Add my and most of @hugovk suggestions

Co-Authored-By: Hugo van Kemenade <hugovk@users.noreply.github.com>

* Add logging and improve configurability

Just some cleaning up up of the DocSection dataclass and added logging
support so you know what's going on.

* Rename a section and please the grammar gods of Black

Thanks @hugovk for the suggestion!

* Fix Markdown comments

* Add myself as an author :P

Seems like the right time.

The rule of law

I was born in the city of Georgia, Tbilisi, and the reason I wan't to mention that is, because I used play a lot at internet cafe's back in a day, when nobody had computers in my country. Not only that, but on top of that electricity came on only for 2 hours a day. A lot of people I was friends with used to go to the same internet cafe as me and living in the city made that 10 times better. We used to have a blast, going out to play LAN almost every day. What I want to say is that, I lived in such a small country with no possibility of playing a game on international servers. Everybody we used to play with literally lived in a same city 10-15 minutes away,, so we had a lot of respect for each other. I was lucky to be in that situation, because, unfortunately, some people don't think what their words might do to somebody emotionally. Everybody has to remember that people are different, we got to understand that literally there is no duplicate personalities, and if there is it's probably just a 1% in the whole world. That means everybody's views, ideas, and thoughts, are different right?.  We have to accept everybody as they are. Maybe you are getting annoyed? Okay there is nobody invading your space right? There is nobody yelling at your face, so just be a decent human being and move on, it's as simple as that. So if you are the type of individual, to mock on people and intentionally try to make their day miserable in this day and age? You do not deserve to access internet, and should be removed ASAP.

Added GCloud Function

It works. The latency is surprisingly low. I guess my past experience
with functions may not be representative.

Decided to use GCloud functions as connecting to the database was a bit
easier than if using firebase.

At this point, the cloud resources for this project are getting kinda
messy and hard to keep track of.

There is a firebase project with firestore and analytics. There's a
surge hosting static files. There's a modeanalytics thing for dashboards
. There's a Cloud SQL database for ETLing data for analysis and storing
event data and there's a Cloud Function to get event data into the
database.

The firebase stuff lives in its own world, the mode stuff isn't worth
serializing. Maybe use terraform to deploy Cloud Functions and configure
Cloud SQL database?

Terraform is kinda annoying to setup and keep updated. Google's other
IAC suggestions kinda suck (fucking chef).

Let's just leave it as is. If I come back and forget how this whole
thing works, it is too complicated and I'll figure out how to
simplify/document it then.

Use attrgetter instead of reduce

from operator import attrgetter
class A(object): pass
class B(A): pass
a = A()
a.b = B()
a.b.c = 'hello'
print(attrgetter(u'b.c'))(a)
hello

In theory faster too

More attrgetter - drop overrides in importers!

cint reduce XXX

Wip _AttrGettersCache(dict)

actor_importer_attrs -> never a tuple in there?

Note that

{}[[]]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

so the isinstance(attr, (list, tuple, set)): make not sense, only tuple
should be accepted

DestructiblePatcher -> never has a 'model' attr ? TTT

Infernio:
You should be able to drop the _inner_loop here. destructible is only
ever a MelDestructible instance, so can't be a string, which should
make the behavior of this loop identical to its parent.

Same NB as with the other one though [WeaponMods] - this doesn't do
anything right now, but may have been intended to handle
case-insensitive comparisons of destructible.stages[i].model.

WeaponModsPatcher -> again no model? XXX

Infernio
You should be able to drop the string comparison logic here. The
'splitting by dots' logic is still required, but none of these attrs
can be strings at runtime:

modelWithMods - MelObject
firstPersonModelWithMods - MelObject
weaponMods - MelObject
soundMod1Shoot3Ds - list of fids
soundMod1Shoot2D - fid
effectMod1 - int
effectMod2 - int
effectMod3 - int
valueAMod1 - float
valueAMod2 - float
valueAMod3 - float
valueBMod1 - float
valueBMod2 - float
valueBMod3 - float
reloadAnimationMod - int
vatsModReqiured - int
scopeModel - MelObject
dnamFlags1.hasScope - bool, but special case because of dot
dnamFlags2.scopeFromMod - bool, but special case because of dot

That said, my guess is that the string comparison logic was meant to
apply to modelWithMods, firstPersonModelWithMods and weaponMods, and
the model comparison logic to scopeModel. So maybe we should keep it
and fix it up to use those instead?

Upon thinking on this further, maybe the right place to handle this
case insensitivity isn't in the patchers, but in the records. We
could make a MelCIString that turns the read string into a CIStr.
That way all this patcher-specific logic could disappear.

Utumno:
> this case insensitivity isn't in the patchers, but in the records.

Aaahhh - yes - but I want to get rid of the decoding/encoding on
loadData and dumpData. I guess - cause it is difficult to trace what
attribute of the records is used where, especially if it's called eid
- that most of the time those are decoded and then are unused and
then encoded - and apart from the performance that this costs, it
might lead to mangled up strings if that decoding/encoding messes up
(falling back to mbcs) - and we won't even know.

We really have to go through what encodings are really accepted (by
the game) in the string fields - possibly only cp1252?[1] This
started cause some mods encode some fields differently - but maybe it
will turn out that anyway apart from, say, 'description' nothing else
can be in Unicode, so we will compare byte-strings as byte-strings
for a lot of performance (and simpler code). Or not...

Case insensitivity is another fruit - but then to me the basic issue
is finding a way of doing the decoding/encoding/case-normalizing JIT.
I thought of dynamically adding properties to the records that wrap
the (now renamed to _eid say) string fields but this is getting messy
and complex. I thought about metaclasses (god forbid) or patching the
getSlotsUsed or... - but nothing yet as I just now start to grok the
records (thanks to your rewrite), and the dynamical nature of records
code does not help to trace what is used where.

> That said, my guess is that the string comparison logic was meant to
apply to modelWithMods

The special treatment of model is another oops - if we want to test
model.modPath then we should have in our arrays model.modPath and
hand along to the attrgetter (neat eh?) like the rest. Special cases
is what one wants to eliminate

For now, I will go ahead and rip those overrides off as you
commented, so we can revisit the long ids thing - although what I
would hope to get into nightly is prefixing, I regret adding dirs
prefixes as the right way is those unicode literals, as then we test
on py2 already (and convert all pickled strings to unicode for users
to have in their settings before py3)

And when the dust settles time for a simple_importers.py I think

Ref # 480, # 232

[1] we might then as well say str.dedode(u'cp1252') except
UnicodeDecodeError -> warn user that field X in record Y seems not
game readable.

lojack5:
I think from Skyrim on it's ok to always assume cp1252, some they
added translation strings.

On Oblivion for sure (and maybe Fallout 3 / NV?), Things are a mess
though. Both Chinese and Japanese are not supported by the game.
Either one or both of the languages (ive forgotten which) modders
have gotten to work by monkey patching the engine with a plug-in
(OBSE I think). I'd have to see if I ha e any of my correspondence
with valda to check though, at one point he sent me whatever they use
so I could test.

I'm not sure what Russian and other Cyrillic languages do though,
they may have a plug-in as well. The other big western European
languages have their own official game exe, I'm not sure if those use
a codepage but they might.

All of which to say, might need to implement it on a per game basis.
Not decoding would of course be an easy fix as well, although things
like importing/exporting npc names to/from csv and similar things
would have to have their encoding/decoding checked to work with that.

sway: Use pacwall background

The path for the background image is the one my timer sets. Also set the
terminals to be transparent so that the image is always at least
slightly visible. It's kinda cheesy in an "OMG LEET HAXORZ" way, but boy
does it look nice, especially in combination with the gaps.

<center><h1>My Favourite Book Is Sherlock Holmes</h1></center>
<p><b>Sherlock Holmes</b>n the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go
through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.</p>

<p>The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster.
 I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand.
 There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery.
 I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by 
 Murray,my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.</p>

 <p>Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed,with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day
should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes,and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.</p>

<h3><b>Fictional Character Biography:</b></h3>
<p>Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who first appeared in publication in 1887. He was devised by British author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. A brilliant London-based detective, Holmes is famous for his prowess at using logic and astute observation to solve cases.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short-stories featuring his creation. Almost all were narrated by Holmes' friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson, with the exception of two narrated by Holmes himself and two more written in the third person. The stories first appeared in magazine serialization, notably in The Strand Magazine, over a period of forty years. This was a common form of publication at the time: Charles Dickens' works were issued in a similar fashion. The stories cover a period from around 1878 up to 1903, with a final case in 1914. They are read as much for their characterization and the stylised late-Victorian era in which they take place as for the mysteries themselves.</p>

<h3><b>Inspitation For the Character:</b></h3>
<p>Little is known of Holmes' early life or his family background, save that he is the grand nephew of the French artist Emile Jean Horace Vernet.[citation needed] An estimate of Holmes's age in "His Last Bow" places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as 60 years of age. It is also known that in his younger years, Holmes attended at least one of the country's leading universities ... though it cannot be ascertained whether he was an alumnus of Oxford, Cambridge, or both. Sherlock has an older brother, Mycroft, whom the younger Holmes considered to be more intellectually gifted than himself. Mycroft spent much of his life in Her Majesty's Secret Service. In "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter", Sherlock refers to Mycroft as being "[s]even years [his] senior". If Sherlock date of birth of 1854 is correct, that places Mycroft's date of birth as 1847.</p>

<h3><b>Dr Watson makes an evaluation of Sherlock's skills:</b></h3>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge of Literature – Nil.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of Astronomy – Nil.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of Politics – Feeble.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of Botany – Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of Geology – Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks, has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of Chemistry – Profound.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of Anatomy – Accurate, but unsystematic.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of Sensationalism – Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century.</li>
	<li>Plays the violin well.</li>
	<li>Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman</li>
	<li>Has a good practical knowledge of British law</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Later stories make clear, however, that the above list is misleading, and that Holmes, who has just met Watson, is pulling Watson's leg. Two examples: despite Holmes' supposed ignorance of politics, in "A Scandal in Bohemia" he immediately recognises the true identity of the supposed Count von Kramm as Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Feldstein and hereditary King of Bohemia. Regarding non-sensational literature, his speech is replete with references to the Bible, Shakespeare, and even Goethe. This is somewhat inconsistent with his scolding Watson for telling him about how the Earth revolved around the Sun, instead of the other way around, given that Holmes tried to avoid having his memory cluttered with information that is of no use to him in detective work.</p>

<p>Holmes is also a competent cryptanalyst. He relates to Watson, "I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writing, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyse one hundred and sixty separate ciphers". One such scheme is solved in "The Adventure of the Dancing Men", which uses a series of stick figures.</p>

Remove ancient unused "wear_id" var on xenos (#51236)

Come, let me tell you a story of the old days----of SHITCODE.

AGhhhhh.

Once upon a time, SS13 code was terrible (who are we joking, it still 
is, but that's a story for another day), and when any carbon subtype, 
minus humans, talked over radio, it would runtime.

Of course, coders set about fixing this problem---can't have nonsense 
like that, so...of course, the most logical thing was done.

Instead of solving the awfulness that was not only using the wrong 
istype check and a wonderful colon override as well: 
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/9eb0e80ae7f57040b9178c637efb4bac33ce3d16/code/game/objects/radio/radio.dm#L148

A "Fix" was applied instead: 
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/9eb0e80ae7f57040b9178c637efb4bac33ce3d16#diff-b5f801c8078b7d8dd9f0661b359dfa9e

Whereby `var/obj/item/card/id/wear_id = null` was added to monkeys and 
aliens to "fix" them having an ID holder and not throwing a 
runtime.........Thus ensuring:

Fox would find it one day and call this utterly moronic and while also 
ensuring that all future carbon mobs created without implementing this 
same "fix" would have the same exact problem.

Then radio code got rewritten to be non-stupid and this still hung 
around until today.

The End

audio: merge pull/push ring buffer glue code

This is preparation to further cleanups (and eventually actual
improvements) of the audio output code.

AOs are split into two classes: pull and push. Pull AOs let an audio
callback of the native audio API read from a ring buffer. Push AOs
expose a function that works similar to write(), and for which we start
a "feeder" thread. It seems making this split was beneficial, because of
the different data flow, and emulating the one or other in the AOs
directly would have created code duplication (all the "pull" AOs had
their own ring buffer implementation before it was cleaned up).
Unfortunately, both types had completely separate implementations (in
pull.c and push.c). The idea was that little can be shared anyway. But
that's very annoying now, because I want to change the API between AO
and player.

This commit attempts to merge them. I've moved everything from push.c to
pull.c, the trivial entrypoints from ao.c to pull.c, and attempted to
reconcile the differences. It's a mess, but at least there's only one
ring buffer within the AO code now. Everything should work mostly the
same. Pull AOs now always copy the audio data under a lock; before this
commit, all ring buffer access was lock-free (except for the decoder
wakeup callback, which acquired a mutex). In theory, this is "bad", and
people obsessed with lock-free stuff will hate me, but in practice
probably won't matter. The planned change will probably remove this
copying-under-lock again, but who knows when this will happen.

One change for the push AOs now makes it drop audio, where before only a
warning was logged. This is only in case of AOs or drivers which exhibit
unexpected (and now unsupported) behavior.

This is a risky change. Although it's completely trivial conceptually,
there are too many special cases. In addition, I barely tested it, and
I've messed with it in a half-motivated state over a longer time, barely
making any progress, and finishing it under a rush when I already should
have been asleep. Most things seem to work, and I made superficial tests
with alsa, sdl, and encode mode. This should cover most things, but
there are a lot of tricky things that received no coverage. All this
text means you should be prepared to roll back to an older commit and
report your problem.
