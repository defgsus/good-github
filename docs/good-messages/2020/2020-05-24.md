Remove ancient unused "wear_id" var on xenos (#51236)

Come, let me tell you a story of the old days----of SHITCODE.

AGhhhhh.

Once upon a time, SS13 code was terrible (who are we joking, it still 
is, but that's a story for another day), and when any carbon subtype, 
minus humans, talked over radio, it would runtime.

Of course, coders set about fixing this problem---can't have nonsense 
like that, so...of course, the most logical thing was done.

Instead of solving the awfulness that was not only using the wrong 
istype check and a wonderful colon override as well: 
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/9eb0e80ae7f57040b9178c637efb4bac33ce3d16/code/game/objects/radio/radio.dm#L148

A "Fix" was applied instead: 
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/9eb0e80ae7f57040b9178c637efb4bac33ce3d16#diff-b5f801c8078b7d8dd9f0661b359dfa9e

Whereby `var/obj/item/card/id/wear_id = null` was added to monkeys and 
aliens to "fix" them having an ID holder and not throwing a 
runtime.........Thus ensuring:

Fox would find it one day and call this utterly moronic and while also 
ensuring that all future carbon mobs created without implementing this 
same "fix" would have the same exact problem.

Then radio code got rewritten to be non-stupid and this still hung 
around until today.

The End

Refactor docs / Maintenance of docs (#1456)

* Split code style and components documentation

Splits 'the_black_code_style', 'pragmatism', 'blackd',and 'black_primer'
into their own files. The exception being 'the_black_code_style' and
'pragmatism'. They have been merged into one 'the_black_code_style_and_pragmatism'
file.

These changes are being made because the README is becoming very long. And
a README isn't great if it dissuades its reader because of its length.

* Update the doc generation logic and configuration

With the moving of several sections in the README and the renaming of a
few files, 'conf.py' needs to be able to support custom sections.

This commit introduces DocSection which can be used to specify custom
sections of documentation. The information stored in DocSection will be
used by the process_sections function to read, process, and write the section
to CURRENT_DIR.

A large change has been made to the how the docs are prepared to be built.
Instead of just generating the files needed by reading the README, this
has a full chain of operations so custom sections are supported. First,
it reads the README and spits out a list of DocSection objects representing
the sections to be generated by process_sections. This is done since most
of the docs still live in README. Then along with the defined custom_sections
, the process_sections will be begin to process the DocSection objects.
It reads the information it needs to generate the section. Then fetches
the section's contents, calls processors required by the section to process
the section's contents, and finally writes the section to CURRENT_DIR.

This large change is so processing of the documentation can be done just
for the versions hosted on ReadTheDocs.org. An example processor using this
feature is a 'replace_links' processor. It will replace documentation
links that point to the docs hosted on GitHub with links that point to the
version hosted on ReadTheDocs.org. (I won't be coding that ATM)

This also means that files will be overwritten or created once the docs
have been built. It is annoying, since you have to 'git reset --hard'
and 'git clean -f -d' after each build, but there's nothing better. The old
system had the same side effects, so yeah :(

* Update filenames and delete unnecessary files

Update the filenames since 'the_black_code_style' and 'pragmatism' were
merged and 'contributing' was deleted in favor of 'contributing_to_black'.

All symlinks were deleted since their home (_build/generated) is no longer
used.

* Fix broken links and a few redirections

* Merge master into refactor_docs (manually done)

* Add my and most of @hugovk suggestions

Co-Authored-By: Hugo van Kemenade <hugovk@users.noreply.github.com>

* Add logging and improve configurability

Just some cleaning up up of the DocSection dataclass and added logging
support so you know what's going on.

* Rename a section and please the grammar gods of Black

Thanks @hugovk for the suggestion!

* Fix Markdown comments

* Add myself as an author :P

Seems like the right time.

audio: merge pull/push ring buffer glue code

This is preparation to further cleanups (and eventually actual
improvements) of the audio output code.

AOs are split into two classes: pull and push. Pull AOs let an audio
callback of the native audio API read from a ring buffer. Push AOs
expose a function that works similar to write(), and for which we start
a "feeder" thread. It seems making this split was beneficial, because of
the different data flow, and emulating the one or other in the AOs
directly would have created code duplication (all the "pull" AOs had
their own ring buffer implementation before it was cleaned up).
Unfortunately, both types had completely separate implementations (in
pull.c and push.c). The idea was that little can be shared anyway. But
that's very annoying now, because I want to change the API between AO
and player.

This commit attempts to merge them. I've moved everything from push.c to
pull.c, the trivial entrypoints from ao.c to pull.c, and attempted to
reconcile the differences. It's a mess, but at least there's only one
ring buffer within the AO code now. Everything should work mostly the
same. Pull AOs now always copy the audio data under a lock; before this
commit, all ring buffer access was lock-free (except for the decoder
wakeup callback, which acquired a mutex). In theory, this is "bad", and
people obsessed with lock-free stuff will hate me, but in practice
probably won't matter. The planned change will probably remove this
copying-under-lock again, but who knows when this will happen.

One change for the push AOs now makes it drop audio, where before only a
warning was logged. This is only in case of AOs or drivers which exhibit
unexpected (and now unsupported) behavior.

This is a risky change. Although it's completely trivial conceptually,
there are too many special cases. In addition, I barely tested it, and
I've messed with it in a half-motivated state over a longer time, barely
making any progress, and finishing it under a rush when I already should
have been asleep. Most things seem to work, and I made superficial tests
with alsa, sdl, and encode mode. This should cover most things, but
there are a lot of tricky things that received no coverage. All this
text means you should be prepared to roll back to an older commit and
report your problem.
