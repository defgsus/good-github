add reason hello world fetching

- Great being forced to decode the api response
- Variants are a very expressive, love the exhaustive checks
- Reason's modules design is a blessing, wonder how private functions work.
- Don't like using callbacks nor promises. Should look for an effects
  library with the Task monad.
- Pattern matching is life, should probably implement this commit with
  typescript and then compare both
