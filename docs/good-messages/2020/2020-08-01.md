Add Pokémon moves from Red/Blue to Sword/Shield 1.0.

Once again, this isn't perfect but I'm leaving it here and moving
onward, lol.

Weird edge cases:

- I gave Draco Meteor specifically to Dragon-Type Arceus in Gen 4, and
  to all forms of Arceus in Gen 5+.  I'm *guessing* this is right, but
  haven't fully tested it myself.

  Bulbapedia says that Arceus and Silvally need to be Dragon-type when
  they learn Draco Meteor.  However, I tested it with Arceus in Alpha
  Sapphire and with Silvally in Ultra Moon and Sword, and in all those
  cases, its current type doesn't matter.  I think it may have been true
  originally, though — in Gen 4 the tutor NPC's script literally checks
  the Pokémon's types (from what I remember digging into it in like
  2013), whereas in Gen 5+, there's just a flag in the stat struct.

  I don't have an Arceus in Gen 4-5 though, so I'd need to get set up on
  an emulator and cheat one up to finish testing it.  Which I'll do...
  at some point.

- In B/W 2, I couldn't find the tutor lists for the life of me.  The
  tutor *flags* are right there in the stat structs, but I had to match
  them up with moves manually by making a list of which Pokémon have
  each flag and then matching that up with Bulbapedia's info.  So it's
  possible that two moves' entire lists are swapped, or something.

- In Gen 7, I gave all of Pikachu's forms the Volt Tackle tutor.  I
  tested this in US/UM with regular Pikachu and Partner Cap Pikachu, but
  I don't have any other caps so I can't say for sure that Pikachu in a
  Cap gets it in S/M.  For now I'm just going to assume they all get it,
  though.

- I left some technically-impossible moves in — e.g. egg moves with no
  suitable parent, or Melmetal having an evo move despite only evolving
  in Pokémon GO.  I might remove them at some point, but filtering the
  egg moves in particular would be pretty complicated so I'm leaving it
  for now.

- Silvally is flagged as learning all three Pledge tutors in US/UM and
  Sw/Sh, but the actual tutor NPC isn't set up to offer a move selection
  menu, since everything else learns one Pledge at most, so they just
  offer to teach it Grass Pledge.

  In this case, I *did* actually remove the impossible moves.  Like, I
  figure that in the other cases, at least you can't definitively say
  that e.g. Melmetal *won't* learn Thunder Punch after evolving —
  there's just no way to try it.  But on the other hand, you *can* in
  fact take Silvally to the tutor in hopes of learning Water Pledge and
  wind up disappointed.

- I don't have G-Max moves in the move table yet, which obviously means
  I can't associate them to Pokémon.  I'll sort that out later.
