Tweak our Copy until it's _just_ right

Let's take an interesting idea, and do it in least surprising way that
we can.

Storing translations outside of `config/locales/en.yml`
---

Under the hood, Rails relies on the [`ruby-i18n/i18n`
gem][ruby-i18n/i18n] for determining translations' text. Without any
additional configuration, Rails employs an instance of
`I18n::Backends::SimpleBackend`. In this case, <q>simple</q> is
analogous for reading from the filesystem. The definitions we've
declared thus far have been made in our project's
`config/locales/en.yml`. During the application's boot process, the
`SimpleBackend` reads the contents of that file, parses the YAML into an
instance of a [`Hash`][Hash], and stores it in-memory.

Let's imagine that we'd like to change a key's translation.

> No problem! Let's write a new value to that key in the `Hash`.

This seems appealing at first, but there are some unfortunate quirks to
consider. Since the value is store in-memory, modifications to that
value would be lost on server restarts, and would be inaccessible from
_other_ server processes.

In the world of [horizontally scalable
infrastructure][horizontal-scalability] and [load balancing][], servers
are restarted constantly, and there are no guarantees that subsequent
requests are served by the same [application process][process].

> If the value is stored on the filesystem, let's change the
> contents of the file.

Unfortunately, the `I18n::Backends::SimpleBackend` eager-loads the
contents of the translation file once (and only once) during the
application's boot process, so subsequent changes to the file go
un-read.

Calling `I18n::Backend::SimpleBackend#reload!` re-parses the YAML file,
but any changes would be local to that server process, which runs afoul
of horizontal scalability and load balancing.

> This sounds like a problem for some sort of data persistence layerâ€¦

Fortunately, the [ruby-i18n/i18n][] project provides integrations for
alternate backends. [I18n::PostgresJson][] is an `I18n::Backend`
implementation that reads from and writes to [Postgres JSON and JSONB
columns][]:

> [PostgreSQL's][pg] support for storing objects as [JSON and JSONB
> columns][pg-json], integrated with `ActiveRecord` column-aware
> models makes it an ideal candidate to store dynamic, editable
> application translation text.

Within the [`config/initializers/i18n.rb`](#config/initializers/i18n.rb)
initializer, establish an order of precedence for resolving a
translation key.

Combine the two backends via a [`I18n::Backends::Chain`
instance][i18n-chain]. The `I18n::PostgresJson` backend serves as an
editable data source layered on top of the foundational
`I18::Backends::Simple` defaults:

Outside of configuring the `I18n.backend` and declaring a correctly
structured database table (included as a `I18n::PostgresJson`-generated
database migration), there are no additional requirements. We can
continue to transparently call `translate` in our views, oblivious to
the translations source of data.

The `Translation` model
---

The `I18n::Backend::Chain` adheres to the same interface as other
`I18n::Backend` classes. Its `store_translations(locale, data,
**options)` implementation adheres to the same order of precedence as
when writing values as its `#translate` method does when reading values.
In our case, a call to `I18n.backend.store_translation` will write to
the `I18n::PostgresJson::Backend` first.

Reading and writing values to and from a database (SQL or otherwise) is
something that Rails (`ActiveModel` and `ActiveRecord`, specifically)
excels at.

This commit introduces the `Translation` class. It's a model class that
_is not_ backed by `ActiveRecord::Base`. The `I18n.backend` instance
provides a means of writing to the correct data source with the exact
structure needed. With this access to this method, there's no value in
interfacing directly with PostgreSQL via `ActiveRecord`. However, there
is value in an `ActiveRecord`-like interface for reading, writing, and
validating attributes. To get the best of both worlds, the `Translation`
class mixes in the [`ActiveModel::Model`][am-model] and
[`ActiveModel::Attributes`][am-attributes] modules.

The data integrity of our translations is crucial. To preserve that
integrity, the `Translation` model declares several `ActiveModel`
validations.

For example, reject `nil` or empty values. Since the PostgresSQL-backed
translations are layer _on top of_ the translations declared in the YAML
file, reject any `Translation#key` value that _does not already exist_
in our set of resolvable keys.

Once deemed valid, calls to `Translation#save` will persist the changes
by invoking `I18n.backend.store_translations` &emdash; with one final
quirk. To keep the scope of our first foray into copyediting tight and
to limit exposure to various Cross-Site Scripting (<abrr
title="Cross-Site Scripting">XSS</abbr>) vulnerabilities, limit the
translations to _plain text only_ by wrapping calls to
`Translation#value` with calls to  `ActionText::Content#to_plain_text`
to **strip out any HTML**:

```ruby
def value
  content = ActionText::Content.new(super)

  content.to_plain_text
end
```

The `TranslationsController` class
---

Backed by our `I18n::Backends::Chain`, our `Translation` class serves as
a Model  (the <abbr title="Model>M</abbr> in Rails'
Model-View-Controller <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>)
paradigm. The remaining two-thirds of the work will be done in our
application's View (the <abbr title="View">V</abbr>) and Controller (the
<abbr title="Controller">C</abbr>) layers.

We'll be managing changes to our Model by responding to HTTP requests
that are routed to our Controllers.

The new `TranslationsController` class draws inspiration from an example
in the [i18n-postgres_json README file][i18n-edit-example] and
transforms `locale`, `key`, and `value` parameters into `Translation`
instances. Once the model instance is constructed, the controller
attempts to update the translation by calling `Translation#save`.

[i18n-edit-example]: https://github.com/seanpdoyle/i18n-postgres_json#writing-to-the-tables

The [`translations/form`](#app/views/translations/_form.html.erb) View partial
---

The final missing piece of the puzzle is our View layer (the <abbr
title="View">V</abbr> of <abbr
title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>). The `<form>` element that we
construct submits a `POST /translations` request with all the
constituent parts of a `Translation`: its `locale`, `key`, and `value`.

When passed a block, Rails' `translate` helper [yields the translation
_and_ the fully qualified translation key][translate] as [block
arguments][].

For example, when calling `translate(".hero.title")` with a block from
the `marketings#index` template, the value of the `key` block parameter
is `marketings.index.hero.title`. When we render our translations using
the "lazy" keys, we can access their fully-qualified counterparts
through block arguments.

For calls to `translate` that we want to be able to edit, invoke them as
a call to `editable.translate`. The `editable.translate` helper
delegates to an instance of the `Editable` class, which decorates calls
to `#translate` so that they accept a block.

Within the block, use the fully qualified translation key to construct a
`<form action="/translations" method="post">` element that contains the
`key` encoded as an [`<input type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden].

The submission's `locale` value can be inferred from the [current
request-local value of `I18n.locale`][i18n-locale], and is also encoded
as an [`<input type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden], invisible to
the user.

Ideally, the `<form>` elements for `value` would serve double duty:
presenting an field to edit the translation text when in focus, and
rendering the contents of the translation text otherwise.

Visual parity between those two modes is achievable, but due to the
subtle differences in how CSS rules are applied to certain [Flow Content
elements][flow-content] and [Form-associated Content
elements][form-associated-content], it could become tedious to do so.

Luckily, browser support for the [`[contenteditable]`
attribute][contenteditable] renders controls for editing content in the
same context and styles it's rendered within normally.

Trix-powered Rich Text
---

[Trix is <q cite="https://github.com/basecamp/trix#trix">a Rich Text
Editor for Everyday Writing</q>][trix]. It serves as a progressive
enhancement to `[contenteditable]`, and is a tool under the Ruby on
Rails umbrella [since the introduction of the ActionText portion of the
framework][action-text].

While Trix is a fully-featured, HTML-capable <dfn id="wysiwyg">What you
See is What you Get (<abbr title="What you See is What you
Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>) editor</dfn>, it's utility comes in the form its
ability to edit already styled content in-context.

Under the hood, [calls to `rich_text_area_tag`][rich_text_area_tag]
produce a `<trix-editor>` element along with a corresponding [`<input
type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden] that serves as its form-local
value storage.

On initialization, `<trix-editor>` elements construct their own
`<trix-toolbar>` elements to wrap a collection of `<button>` elements
that are wired-up to modify the `<trix-editor>` selected contents.

In our use case, we _don't_ want to support anything more sophisticated
than plain text, so we add `trix-toolbar`-specific CSS rules to style
those elements with `display: none;`.

It's important that we don't _entirely_ disable the `<trix-toolbar>`
element, since there are two custom actions we'd like to support:
canceling an edit and saving an edit. To implement these actions, we'll
declare the `<button>` elements in the [`translations/form` partial's
HTML](#app/views/translations/_form.html.erb) as descendants of the
`<trix-toolbar>` element, and ensure that the `<trix-editor
toolbar="...">` attribute references the `<trix-toolbar id="...">`
attribute. On the initial page load, ensure the toolbar is hidden by
declaring it with the [`[hidden]` attribute][hidden].

To handle interactions withing the `<trix-editor>` element and its
`<trix-toolbar>`, declare the [`trix-form` Stimulus
Controller](#app/javascript/controllers/trix_form_controller.js), and
ensure that our [`<form>` element declares it as part of its
`[data-controller="trix-form"]` attribute][data-controller].

When [the controller attaches behavior to the `<form>`
element][connect], ensure that the `<trix-toolbar>` is visually hidden
by ensuring it declares [`hidden = true`][hidden-property].

To declare the rest of its behavior, build the `<form>` element with
various [Stimulus-specific `data-action` values][data-action]:

```diff
--- /dev/null
+++ b/app/views/translations/_form.html.erb
@@ -0,0 +1,44 @@
+<%= form_with model: translation, class: "relative", data: {
+  controller: "trix-form",
+  action: "
+    trix-file-accept->trix-form#reject
+    trix-focus@document->trix-form#dismissDismissUnlessFocused
+    click@document->trix-form#dismissUnlessContained
+    focusout->trix-form#dismissUnlessContained
+    reset->trix-form#dismiss
+  "
+} do |form| %>
```

Each line routes a DOM event to an action declared in the `trix-form`
controller:

```diff
+    trix-focus@document->trix-form#dismissDismissUnlessFocused
```

The `@document` portion of the action routing declaration declares a
[`trix-focus` event listener][trix-focus] on the `document`, instead of
the `<form>` element. This means that whenever any of the
`<trix-editor>` elements receive focus, _all_ of the `trix-form`
controllers will respond to the event. This means that we can hide all
the `trix-toolbar` elements _except for the editor with focus_ within a
single action declaration.

```diff
+    trix-file-accept->trix-form#reject
```

This `trix-file-accept` event listener routes events to an action that
invokes [`event.preventDefault()`][preventDefault], effectively
cancelling any file attachment attempts.

The other routing declarations will dismiss the toolbar when the
`<form>` element is reset (via the `reset` event), focus
leaves the editor (via the `focusout` event), or a mouse `click` event
fires anywhere outside of the `<trix-editor>` or `<trix-toolbar>`
element.

Testing the interactions
---

For each concept introduced here (i.e. the `Translation` class, the
`TranslationsController` class, the `translations/form` view partial,
and the Trix editor integration) is tested in turn at its corresponding
layer of the [Testing Pyramid][]:

![The Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/testPyramid.png)

The `Translation` model is covered by a unit test, the
`TranslationsController` is covered by a [service-level integration
test][ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest], and the `translations/form` view
partial and the rest of the Trix behavior is covered by an [end-to-end
System Test][System Test].

In order to ensure that each test is run with test-specific data, the
`#with_translations` test helper accepts a set of translations and a
block, and ensures that those translations are only available _within
the block's scope of execution_.

Our progress so far

I wonder, what would it take to edit HTML translations?
