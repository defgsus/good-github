#### Sunday 2020-03-08 03:08:27 by Sébastien Loisel

This started out as a super minor tweak to the documentation but snowballed into a monumental
investigation into the lugubrious depths of pdf files.

I don't remember the documentation tweak. I think it's just to add an image link or something.

Every time I commit something, all the example PDFs get rebuilt and recommited even though nothing
of value has changed in them, and eventually this is going to become large. So, I said to myself,
"seb, why don't you make sure that if you run pdflatex example.tex twice in a row, you get exactly
the same pdf both times." Ooooh boy.

I tried to strip the metadata. I tried exif, qpdf --linearize, bunch of other stuff, none of that works.
There's something in the PDF, hundreds of bytes that almost look random, and I'll bet you, you can
track/identify anyone in the world with that stuff. I've also tried mat2, but I'll get back to that
later.

Having miserably failed at stripping metadata, I decided to try a second tack: why don't I make sure
that the metadata is verbatim the same every time I run pdflatex? But where does this metadata come from?
One sure source must be the various timestamps in the source tex file. stat reports 4 timestamps,
but only 2 of them can be reliably modified by the user. OK but that won't matter if I repeatedly
pdflatex the same file...? Oh, I guess pdflatex reads the current time and does something with it.
Hm, can we fake the time maybe? So then I got libfaketime to work on my Mac, which was harder than you
would think. It turns out that faketime works or doesn't work, depending on the path of the executable,
because Apple disables certain shenanigans when binaries in certain paths are involved. After many
struggles, it turns out that pdflatex is not in a forbidden path, and I was able to produce pdf
documents with a faked date in the \maketitle, yay. So we should be good now?

Well not quite, OK it makes sense. If you run it twice, pdflatex sucks up the aux file, maybe some
other files? Delete these files between each build.

At some point, I thought I had it working but maybe I had accidentally fooled myself.

I don't know how pdflatex manages it but it really marks each PDF file it produces with some sort of
unique undeletable, unrepeatable fingerprint. If you're hiding from Mexican drug lords, don't use PDF
files or LaTeX, they probably know your every move.

So I gave up on all that and simplified my problem. If the intermediary example.pyptex is identical to
a previously known good golden value, don't regenerate the PDF file. I'm hoping this is the last time
these example PDFs are committed. I hope my documentation tweak is really awesome.

I deserve a chocolate milk.

"9:15am. I've been up for a bit. Let me continue chilling and then I will start.

I've decided to ditch row polymorphism after all. I just realized that the use case I wanted it for - adding record fields at compile time is not applicable using just the subtyping operators. This is something that should have been obvious, but I had not thought it through until now.

9:20am. Whatever the case, Spiral v0.2 will have to spend some time in the design stage. There are various things I want it to have, but I am not sure how the features will feel until I give it a try.

9:25am. Now, since yesterday was so laborious let me spend some time resting.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00532
High Performance Code Generation in MLIR: An Early Case Study with GEMM

I also want to read this paper.

9:30am. Let me start wasting time.

https://mangadex.org/title/44146/eiyu-oh-bu-wo-kiwameru-tame-tensei-su-soshite-sekai-saikyou-no-minarai-kisi

More of this guilty pleasure is out, and if there is something I like, it is guilt with my pleasure.

10am. Ok, enough. Time for the paper.

After that comes playing with servers. One the first thing I need to figure out how to target the client to an executable. In the sample the server is a `.js` file so I am not sure if simply passing the path to an `.exe` will work. Still, this challenge should not be too difficult. I should be able to surmount it with some study.

10:15am. Oh yes. I just realizing one thing - there is no need for me to get rid of the regular keyword arg patterns. I can compile `a: int b: int` so it matches on `.a_b_, int, int`. This will make things less efficient than having keyword args directly, but it is fine as it will simplify things across the board. I will have to hack the printer so it makes an attempt at printing `.a_b_, int, int` as `a: int b: int`.

10:25am. In the absence of row polymorphism, one thing I could do is add more record syntax. For example `{r with_only a b}` which would return a record with just those fields. I suppose I could use type level magic for the same thing. If I am applying a record to some function then I know what I need to pare down, so I could let the constraint solver tell me the input and the return type and do the operations that I need in bottom-up mode.

10:50am. I skimmed that paper. Mhhh...I really have been slacking this morning. Do I really start programming now, or should I segue straight to breakfast?

11am. https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsp/overview/

This stuff makes a lot more sense to me now.

11:05am. Let me stop here. Yeah, I know I hadn't exactly excelled this morning - yesterday I was tired and I did so much more, but I need some time to acclimate myself.

When it is time to start, I will focus on one thing only - starting a server and getting some communication going with the client.

I'll start with the server itself and move from there.

Yesterday I did a lot of studying of the source code for the sample server (and a bit of the client.) Today, I will really have to make the first step in mastering them. There is no more looking around for a way to bypass this hurdle. Until it is done, I need to give it my all at scaling the wall directly."

"1:20pm. Done with chores, breakfast and everything else.

Ah, damn it. I wish there was something interesting to hold my attention, but in the absence of that let me finally play with those servers.

My thinking on this is split.

Right now I have the fundamental knowledge that I need for doing interprocess communication (IPC), so I should be able to start right away, but just the thought of having to potentially spend weeks studying the server and client in depth is making me groan in frustration.

Working on language features is what I should be doing, but instead I will be doing what is essentially a subset of webdev and spending my time essentially trying to cut through the bureaucracy imposed on me by VS Code.

1:30pm. Let me gather my thoughts.

Over since I finished the first half of v0.2, for the first two weeks I was looking for shortcuts. Then I made up my mind to study up on webdev.

And now that is done. My plan was to start working on the language server after that.

I am at this point now.

It is true - I understand much more compared to two weeks ago. Understand how servers work.

But I do not quite understand the VS Code related stuff.

Give how huge the LSP related codebases are, it won't be easy at all to build up a mental model of them.

1:40pm. Before I start work on anything, I need to dwell on this just for a bit.

Right now I have a block.

I absolutely want editor support more than anything else for Spiral v0.2. At the end of 2018 I strongly desired this. Every serious language must do this in order to graduate from a plaything to an actual tool.

1:45pm. Yet, I really hate that what I have to do now is trawl through that OO crapbase written in Typescript.

If I hadn't hated OO before, I sure do now.

This interprocess communication thing should be modeled with a bunch of union types being serialized and passed around. This is the only thing I should really have to know, and yet because they did such a shoddy job, now I have to understand this in its entirety.

1:50pm. It is only really at a time like this that I can start to appreciate Haskell's desire to have everything be immutable.

1:55pm. In my own programming I can arrange everything to be like I want, but having to deal with other people's stuff like this..

2pm. I need to make up my mind, right now I am not really dwelling on this thing and am just getting distracted.

Without a doubt, I need to do this.

Though it will be an inefficient way of doing things, and might eat up a month extra than it should, I need to go this extra mile that I resent.

Once I've done this and understand it, only then will I know how to optimize the stuff on the TS side.

2:05pm. Ah, future me. You really owe me one. The things I do for you.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/f68u50/d_how_to_do_a_language_plugin/fjx7fo9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x

rlp:

```
Hey, it's been a while since you posted this, but in case you are still looking, there's a C# library that does this: https://github.com/OmniSharp/csharp-language-server-protocol

Take a look at the SampleServer, it's pretty simple to get started. You just need to handle various events in the TextDocumentHandler.

The nuget package is https://www.nuget.org/packages/OmniSharp.Extensions.LanguageServer/

I'm not exactly sure how it works from the VS Code side, but I imagine you just start the language server and somehow hook it in to VS Code's language server support.
```

I got this on that thread I posted. I actually had no known about this. It seems this has both a server and a client implementation.

2:10pm. This is worth looking into.

2:15pm. Ok, let me take a break here and I will start work in earnest.

I will make up my mind to cut through the bureaucracy. I will learn what is needed. I won't regret spending my time on this. I will leave the dream of working on the typechecker for the future, and dedicate myself to grinding my way through this.

I admire elegant code, but a real programmer has to hack his way through other people's stuff at some point.

Even if it takes me a month to make the next step, I will do this. There is no way, but to spend my life here."

In a low-pop case (one fertile mom), avoid getting born to mothers that you have cursed, and don't go to d-town if that lone mother has you cursed.  Spawn as a normal Eve instead.  This makes the 1-v-1 situation on a low-pop server more sane, in the case where both people have each other cursed, and prevents a lone griefer from monopolizing the whole server by killing or cursing all incoming babies.  However, in the N=3 case, where two mothers agree about one griefer, that griefer will still go two d-town.  Also, in all cases, if we have a choice between mothers, avoid those that we have curse-blocked, if possible.  The 'if possible' part prevents us from cursing everyone in hopes of being Eve.  Fixes #529.

dns/opendnssec: adding EOL message to opendnssec-1.4.14

The upstream has declared this soon to be EOL. The port is now updated accordingly.

End-of-life announcement: https://www.opendnssec.org/2019/10/

OpenDNSSEC 2.1 was released in February 2017, and in the past
two-and-half year it has proven itself to be stable and viable
upgrade of 1.4, and has additional features and improvements.

Therefore we announce end-of-life of OpenDNSSEC 1.4. One of the steps
towards future releases with better experience and shorter cycles.

Starting today, October 8, 2019, in accordance with our policies,
we will only provide essential fixes and support until 9 October 2020,
after which support will no longer be available. We feel confident
that existing installations can upgrade without much hassle and offer
support to our customers in doing so.

OpenDNSSEC 2.1.4 [1] serves as the replacement for the 1.4 LTS.
The current version is 2.1.6. There is a migration step necessary,
for which you can find a good breakdown at the migration page. [2]

Tested and approved...

I still won't use such services, mind you. The fact that joining a
single big room listed by another server, from your own can just
down your own server is INSANE !

Even if there's 40K individuals in the other room, it's INSANE !
The whole thing ate 2 Gigs of ram like it was nothing, just to
retrieve users avatars !

No thank you.

Still, this was tested, VOIP included, it works but it's still
a pain to put in place.

The whole "string replacements" parts could be automated, the
SSL generation too, but I am DONE with this project !

Maybe, if I'm REALLY bored someday, or if there's a real
attraction to this project, I might try to continue it.
But, at the moment, I feel that the whole "Matrix" and "Synapse"
things are too disconnected from the real world, IMHO.

You won't replace Discord by Synapse. Mastodon with hashtags
can easily emulate a chat channel so... yeah...

No thank you. I almost went insane preparing this Docker
setup.

Add Pokémon's stats and effort yields.

A handful of stuff changed effort yield from Gen 3-4.  I started ripping
with Gen 8 and worked my way back, so for a while I was thinking, like,
if effort has never changed then should I make a separate table for it?
What a pain???  But thankfully there is that tiny bit of data to justify
having effort differ by gen as well.

I'm not sure what to do with Deoxys in Gen 3.  The stat table in Emerald
just has Normal Deoxys's stats; I searched the ROM for the six bytes I'd
expect Speed Forme's base stats to be (and I remembered to put Speed in
the middle), but it's not in there.  Same with Attack Forme's stats in
FireRed.  I copied the stats over from Gen 4, but I'm not sure what to
do with the effort yield.

Bulbapedia says that Deoxys is in Normal Forme in all games in Gen 3
when you battle it in the wild and when trading.  I suspect this also
applies to link battles, record mixing secret base battles, and any
hacked-in wild or trained Deoxyses.  So it may not even be meaningful to
ask what the other Formes' effort yield is in Gen 3.

"5:10pm. Let me gather my thoughts once again.

For the first two weeks of this, I was studying random stuff without success, and in the last two weeks I've acquired the fundamentals that I need.

Now I am looking which way to go.

I've been thinking about it during the break.

I do not know how many lines the VS Code server and client examples have, probably at least 10k, but even so they are the mountain that I need to scale. During the first two weeks I was just too fresh to get anything out of reading the plugin code, but now if I keep at it I should make progress.

I've been thinking about it and I've concluded that if I did what I did during the first two weeks, and combine that with debugging and experimentation I should be able to figure out what that code does.

5:15pm. Even though I made no headway doing that the first two weeks, the way I am now I should be able to attain skill with focused study.

5:20pm. So it is decided - I am going to make the `lsp-sample` and `vscode-languageserver-node` my main goals.

I've never attempted to study something of this scale. 10k lines or more is no joke. You'd imagine there is a better way, but no - this is something I should tackle head one.

To the enterprise guys producing this stuff, 10k lines is like a Hello World program. Restraint when it comes to code size is definitely something that does not enter their considerations.

5:25pm. Very well.

Now before I call it a day, let me just pass in that string and I will debug it for a bit when it inevitably fails.

5:30pm.

```
export declare type ServerOptions = Executable | {
    run: Executable;
    debug: Executable;
} | {
    run: NodeModule;
    debug: NodeModule;
} | NodeModule | (() => Thenable<ChildProcess | StreamInfo | MessageTransports | ChildProcessInfo>);
```

Oh, there is a `Executable` type. Wonderful.

```
export interface Executable {
    command: string;
    args?: string[];
    options?: ExecutableOptions;
}
```

Ok, TS is being nice now. This would be much more of a pain in the ass in raw JS.

5:35pm. Ok, instead of just standing around here, how about I do this?

5:40pm. Success! Though the extension host gets nothing back, I can confirm in the browser that as long as the extension host is running that the server is active.

So that means I got the server to run, just as I said I would.

Let me stop here for the day. Time for lunch."

Remove exe / com wrapper around openrct2.dll for Windows (#10727)

We get repeated reports of people saying the game is incorrectly reported as a virus. It is becoming more inconvenient for players and even myself, because when we attempt to download a build, it is immediately deleted by scanners (including the default for Windows: Windows Defender).

One scanner is not too much of an issue, but the game is flagged by almost half of available scanners as reported by VirusTotal.

So why is it being flagged?

Windows has a very annoying concept, the subsystem for a binary. The console subsystem allows stdin / stdout as you would expect, just like posix. Unfortunately if a user runs a console subsystem binary from the desktop or explorer, the game will be opened under conhost and thus you get a console showing alongside the game window. This is not a good user experience for most players. To resolve this, you can use the windows subsystem, but this will detach stdin and stdout immediately on launch. There are hacks that can be done in code to allocate a new console but I found this to not work very well with stdin or other terminal emulators.

My solution to the problem was to have two binaries: openrct2.exe and openrct2.com. Both are executable but openrct2.exe is windows subsystem, openrct2.com is console subsystem. The desktop shortcut opens openrct2.exe with no console window showing. Typing openrct2 on the command line will execute openrct2.com (as .com has higher PATH precedence than .exe by default) with working stdin and stdout. In order to reduce the size, I have the entire game inside openrct2.dll and then supply two tiny wrapper EXEs that simply route main(...) into the DLL.

These wrapper EXEs are the problem, they are very small and do nothing but call into a DLL, this must match virus signatures too closely and their size probably reduces the data available for the scanner to analyse.

So as I can not find any other way of achieving my goal of a cli and gui version of OpenRCT2, this changes the build to publish openrct2 as a single executable (rather than a DLL + wrapper EXE), and then duplicate the entire ~10MB exe again and flip the subsystem flag. The installer and zip size won't be affected as this extra size will be completely compressed out, but when unpacked will lead to an extra ~10MB on disc. But I think it is a fair compromise.

VirusTotal now reports all artefacts as safe, for now anyway.

Introduce proof-of-concept requirement pre-computation code (#73)

* Strictify type annotation for requirement function

### Summary

Thanks to Will's effort in #71, we are only a few steps away from making the requirement function in TypeScript. The first step is to enable type checking based on JSDoc annotation, which is implemented in this diff. Previously this is impossible due to other non-strict functions in `Requirements.vue` file.

Now with a stronger type definition of requirements established in #68, TypeScript is able to find more type errors due to incorrect type definition setup in #44. I fixed these errors.

I have to create a separate `typed-requirement-json.ts` that basically just re-exported the json with a type assersion, and make `reqs-functions.js` import this file instead. This hack is necessary because TypeScript widens the `fulfillBy` enum to string when it's inferring the type of json (more background in #68).

### Test Plan

`yarn tsc` still type checks, but now we have more type coverage!

### Notes

In the future, we can

- Convert `reqs-functions.js` to TypeScript simply by changing the file extension and moving jsdoc type annotations to function parameters
- Strictify the types of these functions even more. e.g. Replace all `any`s with actual type definitions.
- Make `iterateThroughRequirements` non-async. It's probably async due to some legacy code.

* Introduce proof-of-concept requirement pre-computation code

### Summary

According to our discussion in the work session today, pre-computation can help to eliminate the invocations of Cornell's course API on frontend, as well as automatically get a satisfiable course list.

Creating a diff that directly changes everything is hard. Therefore, I decide to create a proof-of-concept implementation. More specifically, this diff does the following stuff:

- [x] Fetch all classes from all semesters, drop unnecessary fields, and store them in a json.
- [x] Setup Infrastructure to compute and store a "decorated" requirement json, where the each requirement is decorated with a list of class names that can satisfy it.

What's not implemented is the function that computes whether a course can satisfy the requirement. I stubbed it with a function that returns true with 1% probability. I mostly want to use it to estimate the size of the generated json. I will talk about the json size later. The idea is that implementing these checks are not hard: we can just call the existing functions in `src/requirement/req-functions.js`. However, making it work will involving moving some files around, which don't plan to touch in this diff.

Now we get to the size of the json. The `fetcher.ts` script generates all courses and its size is 2.0M (with current configuration with a lot of fields filtered away). This size actually does not matter, because it is never served to the end user. What's more important is `decorated-requirements.json`, which is less than 800K. This is a very promising result, if you look at it: each requirement is attached 100+ courses with the current randomized setup. Real requirements that we plan to deal with might only have 10 courses that are associated with it, so the real generated `decorated-requirements.json` might be less than 200K, which can be served to end user easily. What's even more amazing is that running `requirement-satisfiable-course-generator.ts` finishes almost instantly, so we can experiment with the script very fast!

Hence, according to the analysis above, I believe it's a good idea to continue along the path of requirement pre-computation, and this diff is a significant first step.

### Test Plan

To reproduce my finding, do the following:

1. Run `npm run build:req-gen` to compile all TS files in `requirement-generator`.
2. Run `node requirement-generator/dist/requirement-generator/fetcher.js` to fetch all classes (this may take 20 minutes)
3. run `node requirement-generator/dist/requirement-generator/requirement-satisfiable-course-generator.js` to generate the decorated requirement json.

vo_gpu: avoid error spam when ra_fbo fmt is non-storable

This simply makes the "is the destination FBO format bad?" check a tiny
bit less awful, by making sure we prefer storable FBO formats over
non-storable FBO formats. I'd love to make this also conditional on
whether or not we actually *need* a storable FBO format, but that logic
is decided later, in `pass_draw_to_screen`, and I don't want to
replicate the logic.

Fixes #7017.

Bubble Sort Visualization (#114)

A visualization of the Bubble Sorting Algorithm, arguably the least efficient method of sorting (going through the set by pairs over and over again, moving smaller numbers before larger ones). Once the initial lines show up, you'll experience a decent wait time, as the BubbleSorter() function has, in my experience, need anywhere from ~37 to 50 iterations to properly sort them. Seriously. Bubble sorting sucks. I initially hoped i could simply use the builtin sort() function, however it uses a sorting method called "Timsort," so no dice there.

PS, I made the dimensions slightly smaller than the ones he used, but that's just my personal preference, its aspect ratio is the same.

Difficulty - 3 / 10
