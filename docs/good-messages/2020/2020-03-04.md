Update

- All catalysts now only cast 1 school.
- All catalysts follow the same rules for spell buff. No more 'alt' scaling, like INT boosting miracle damage, LCK boosting magic damage, etc.
- Pyromancy catalysts now give spell buff independant of stats for Fire damage. (Meaning normal pyromancers do not need INT or FTH)
- Dark catalysts now all have both INT/FTH scaling. The total is higher than the normal catalysts, to account for the 2 stats required for max damage.
- Added some innate effects to a few of the catalysts.
- Spell buff (within a school and type) is now the same across most catalysts, except the 'starting' catalysts, which are slightly lower. This means you can pick from the catalysts without one being immediately.
- All Dark spells now scale from INT/FTH. Reverted the HUM change.
- Brightbug now lasts 30 seconds and only boosts by 10%. Limited to 10 held.
- Removed Darkmoon Ritual Staff
- Removed Logan's Staff
- Removed Holy Flame
- Removed Sorcerous Flame
- Removed Fool's Flame
- Insanity Catalyst no longer removes HP on cast. This only occurs during the WA, which is now 50% damage boost, and removes 5% per cast.

Classifier: remove invariant columns

It is common for the mlbackend to receive training data with columns
that do not vary across the rows. Usually they are all zero, in which
case they have no effect on training, but they could be (say) all one,
in which case the column becomes a duplicate bias vector.

In training this is a waste of resources, but the real trouble comes
with prediction. If a row has a different value in that column, its
effect is entirely random because the column is entirely untrained.

How can this happen? Well suppose the column is called 'course_X' and
the training data is from last year. Course X was not offered last
year for reasons, but this year it is.

The solution is to ignore all columns with no variation, and remember
which columns they were. This makes training faster and prediction
better.

To save the variable columns we need to transfer the indexes to and
from the TF object, because that is what we save. Other than the minor
hackiness involved there, it is all quite simple.

"8:35am. I am up. Let me chill for a while.

9:15am. Let me start. I want to get things going.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side

Right now I feel like studying server side programming. It is time to move away from the client side stuff and to the web APIs and this. I'll leave the gRPC stuff for later.

9:20am. I have so much to learn and I want to get started. I had a lot of time to think about my plans during the night.

With knowledge of basic HTML/CSS/JS + Svelte as a high level language for integrating all of that together, the front end is essentially solved. My principles on how I would approach the front end are fully established.

Now that just leaves the backend. As usual, I am approaching things from the wrong end with it.

For the morning, I think I will just read. After noon I will consider watching Nodejs video by Brad.

9:35am. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Upload_files_to_a_web_server

I am reading this and thinking how hard would it be to set up the .NET stuff. Would a JS script activate the runtime and such? I'll assume that.

Let me move to the next thing.

10:05am. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview

I am getting distracted easily with this. The Internet is working like crap for me today too.

10:20am. Focus me, focus. Stop reading HN threads.

10:50am. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview

My focus is low, but those Django examples towards the end are starting to stir my interest.

Like this is not like the front end code exactly. This is a bit lower level.

10:55am. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Web_frameworks

I am really going through this stuff at a leisurely pace aren't I?

11:15am. Focus me, focus. Stop looking at the stock market.

I am really distracted right now.

Let me just go through this thing. Then I'll take a look at Brad's Nodejs video.

11:30am. I am in the middle of this and I see this.

```
#best/templates/best/index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>

 {% if youngest_teams %}
    <ul>
    {% for team in youngest_teams %}
        <li>{{ team.team_name }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% else %}
    <p>No teams are available.</p>
{% endif %}

</body>
</html>
```

I guess Svelte is not the first one to come up with the templating idea. If something this elegant existed in Python, what is even the point of the complications with Reach and such?

11:40am. The docs recommend Django (Python) and Express (Node/JavaScript) based on ease of learning.

11:55am. I've gone through MDN docs. Let me stop here for the time being.

Rather than really focusing on learning this, I've been thinking about random things instead.

12:05pm. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework

I'll leave this for later. I am really not getting my fill of learning like this. At best I am collecting information and triangulating it, but I do not have the feeling of acquiring actual skill. I do not want to be in this state for too long.

When I resume I will go through the Node.js video by Brad."

Allow `rails new —master` to point to master branch

Currently the `rails new` generator supports options `—dev` and `—edge`.

`—dev` points to one’s local rails setup and `--edge` points to the latest stable Rails branch.

However, in the Rails community we often think of the ‘edge’ as the latest merged master. We can see as much in Shopify’s fantastic article showing how they point to the latest master version of Rails: https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/living-on-the-edge-of-rails

I would originally have recommended changing ‘edge’ to point to master, as it has tripped me up on numerous occasions now.

However I would rather add the desired functionality then change the current edge functionality.

Therefore this PR adds the `—master` flag.

It is intended to do exactly as `edge` does, simply with the changethat it points to Rails’ master branch instead of latest stable (i.e. 6_0_stable)

Whenever developers see a new feature in Rails, such as the recently committed horizontal sharding (which prompted my PR), we would love to spin up a new Rails App to try out these new features.

This command would allow us to jump right in with no configuration and offer our testing of the features, even those of us who aren’t able to spend a lot of time on OSS support.

mame: update to 0.219.

MAME 0.219 arrives today, just in time for the end of February!
This month we’ve got another piece of Nintendo Game & Watch history
– Pinball – as well as a quite a few TV games, including Dream Life
Superstar, Designer’s World, Jenna Jameson’s Strip Poker, and
Champiyon Pinball. The previously-added Care Bears and Piglet’s
Special Day TV games are now working, as well as the big-endian
version of the MIPS Magnum R4000. As always, the TV games vary
enormously in quality, from enjoyable titles, to low-effort games
based on licensed intellectual properties, to horrible bootlegs
using blatantly copied assets. If music/rhythm misery is your thing,
there’s even a particularly bad dance mat game in there.

On the arcade side, there are fixes for a minor but long-standing
graphical issue in Capcom’s genre-defining 1942, and also a fairly
significant graphical regression in Seibu Kaihatsu’s Raiden Fighters.
Speaking of Seibu Kaihatsu, our very own Angelo Salese significantly
improved the experience in Good E-Jan, and speaking of graphics
fixes, cam900 fixed some corner cases in Data East’s innovative,
but little-known, shoot-’em-up Boogie Wings. Software list additions
include the Commodore 64 INPUT 64 collection (courtesy of FakeShemp)
and the Spanish ZX Spectrum Load’N’Run collection (added by
ICEknight). New preliminary CPU cores and disassemblers include
IBM ROMP, the NEC 78K family, Samsung KS0164 and SSD Corp’s Xavix
2.

mm: ratelimit PFNs busy info message

commit 75dddef32514f7aa58930bde6a1263253bc3d4ba upstream.

The RDMA subsystem can generate several thousand of these messages per
second eventually leading to a kernel crash.  Ratelimit these messages
to prevent this crash.

Doug said:
 "I've been carrying a version of this for several kernel versions. I
  don't remember when they started, but we have one (and only one) class
  of machines: Dell PE R730xd, that generate these errors. When it
  happens, without a rate limit, we get rcu timeouts and kernel oopses.
  With the rate limit, we just get a lot of annoying kernel messages but
  the machine continues on, recovers, and eventually the memory
  operations all succeed"

And:
 "> Well... why are all these EBUSY's occurring? It sounds inefficient
  > (at least) but if it is expected, normal and unavoidable then
  > perhaps we should just remove that message altogether?

  I don't have an answer to that question. To be honest, I haven't
  looked real hard. We never had this at all, then it started out of the
  blue, but only on our Dell 730xd machines (and it hits all of them),
  but no other classes or brands of machines. And we have our 730xd
  machines loaded up with different brands and models of cards (for
  instance one dedicated to mlx4 hardware, one for qib, one for mlx5, an
  ocrdma/cxgb4 combo, etc), so the fact that it hit all of the machines
  meant it wasn't tied to any particular brand/model of RDMA hardware.
  To me, it always smelled of a hardware oddity specific to maybe the
  CPUs or mainboard chipsets in these machines, so given that I'm not an
  mm expert anyway, I never chased it down.

  A few other relevant details: it showed up somewhere around 4.8/4.9 or
  thereabouts. It never happened before, but the prinkt has been there
  since the 3.18 days, so possibly the test to trigger this message was
  changed, or something else in the allocator changed such that the
  situation started happening on these machines?

  And, like I said, it is specific to our 730xd machines (but they are
  all identical, so that could mean it's something like their specific
  ram configuration is causing the allocator to hit this on these
  machine but not on other machines in the cluster, I don't want to say
  it's necessarily the model of chipset or CPU, there are other bits of
  identicalness between these machines)"

Added Lead Ball ammo type to Spreadgun.
Partial implementation of Fuck Your Shit rounds, currently in progress.
Added various shader effects to some powerups, and to player damage.
Added custom view effects to player death, disabled "face attacker" because it looks weird with model-based players.
Added "untouchable" spree tracking to the Stats tab.
Implemented "emergency reboot system" for people who want a less shameful form of the Resurrect cheat. Cooldown for consecutive reboots can be configured.
Rebalanced armors.
Small language string corrections.
Adjusted pickup model sizes of some weapons.
Fixed missing punch sound (damn typos).
Fix targetter always displaying voodoo dolls.
Fix uptime breaking when loading saves, now based on total playtime rather than gametic.
Readjusted Spreadgun ammo availability.
Flush HUD interpolators alongside messages, fixes things such as the score VERY slowly counting up when loading a save.
Spare armors now only get auto-used on pickup if there is NO armor available of that type.
Added some extra visual effects to punching walls and non-bleeding actors.
Slightly altered the melee range so it's not as awkward.
Fixed punching not using flesh sounds for bleeding actors.
Pusher primary now drags the player towards their target, like the Chainsaw.
Fixed the player having no pain sounds whatsoever.
Fixed stair step anchoring not working.
The damage dealt when walljumping on a monster now also gets boosted by the Ragekit.

#### Wednesday 2020-03-04 16:11:03 by Clifford T. Matthews

Includes today's 1/2 distance speed run.

17 seconds per mile slower than last year, however at 2 bpm HR slower,
too.  My Ambit claims that it was warmer this year (49.5-77.2, avg
54.7) than last year (47.1-76.1, avg 53.8), although log.txt claims it
was cooler last year to start, but warmer at the end.  It's quite
possible that last year I simply didn't check the end temperature
until significantly after I finished, even though there's no note
saying so.

Last year I stopped at a traffic light for 32 seconds.  This year I
stopped twice, for a total of 17 seconds.  However, I *think* the most
telling statistic is that last year my first mile was 7:28.2 @ an 89
(178ffm) cadence and this year it was 7:54.5 @ 91 (182ffm) cadence
which shows that I had a shorter stride this year, probably due to a
combination of many factors, but my suspicion is that my neuroma (or
whatever it is that's going on in my right foot) has contributed.

I don't have a good feel for how my eating the day prior affects
things.  Yesterday I had a big lunch due to an opportunity to have
lunch with a couple fellow programmers.  At Taco Tuesday I had two
beers and no food.  Last year I had a normal lunch but had three beers
at Taco Tuesday and also scarfed up a bunch of other people's fries,
then had a big date snack after getting back.  My *guess* is last
year's eating actually was better for my run due to having more fuel
to top up my glycogen stores.  Yesterday night, it seemed to me that
my legs were asking for more food, but I deliberately chose to not
have any solid calories after 5pm.

Bottom line: I think 15 seconds/mile slower than last year is a pretty
good approximation of where my *overall* fitness is, although I'm
hoping that my weakest links (e.g., my stride length) will be less
important at BMDM than my stronger links (FWIW, I did 50,50 SU,
39,39,22 PU, 100 SQ yesterday compared to 50 SU, 14,14,14 PU, 50 SQ a
year ago; some of that is due to me *not* tapering my core exercise
this year, but even w/o the taper, my push-ups are higher)

"1:10pm. Done with breakfast, but I do not feel very inspired right now. Let me slack for a bit more, then come chores. Then I'll go through the Node.js video.

1:40pm. Chores, let me do them. I had enough of slacking. I want to go through that Node.js video. I had just about charged enough motivation. Really, ASP.NET has only itself to blame for having such shitty documentation.

2:35pm. Done with chores. Let me go through a that vid.

This time is strange. I feel so restless, but I can't seem to find an outlet for this energy. I can only hope that I will be able to get through this block. Hopefully learning more backend stuff will inspire me.

There isn't too much of this left to go. I just have to keep plugging away at it.

2:40pm. On thing that I am surprised is that even though I used to like IDEs so much, I really like the plug'n play approach to compilation that JS introduced me to. With ASP.NET I really hate how everything is under the hood and non-obvious in its functionality.

Quite remarkable. I never thought a day would come where I'd prefer config files over anything else.

https://youtu.be/fBNz5xF-Kx4
Node.js Crash Course

Right at the start he says he will just build a web server using Node.js without using Express. This is really wonderful, it is exactly what I want.

2:50pm. Hmmm...

https://youtu.be/iYM2zFP3Zn0
HTTP Crash Course & Exploration

I think I should go through this one first.

...Ok, here is what I will do. I'll just go through the slides for the Node.js course, pause it, and then go through this one. I saw some new error codes in the MDN docs, but I want to see what I am missing.

3pm. Done with slides. Let me go through the HTTP Crash Course.

3:55pm. https://youtu.be/iYM2zFP3Zn0?t=1900

He mentions the MERN stack course. Since it is about having a different frontend than the backend, that sounds like something I would be interested in.

In fact, having VS Code as my language frontend, and my own Spiral backend sounds like quite a similar task doesn't it?

I am definitely getting closer to what I want.

The stuff he showed me in this video is sufficiently low level for me to be satisfied with it.

I kind of want to still go even a bit deeper - right now I am still not sure what exactly ports are or how they are mapped, or by what they are mapped. I am not going to be doing low level programming on the stage of messing with ports, but I want to get a sense for what kinds of abstractions are being used here.

Let me resume. I only have a little bit left to go.

4:10pm. Finally done. This is boring, but at the same time quite educational. This is really the kind of fundamental knowledge that I need.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE
Learn The MERN Stack

Let me just watch the intro to this and then I will go back to the Node.js video.

4:25pm. Done. I am not interested in this. I think once I learn the backend stuff I will know enough to wing it on my own.

Finally, let me start the Node.js course. I am not sure whether I'll feel like going through all of it, but I'll aim for at least half.

4:45pm. https://youtu.be/fBNz5xF-Kx4?t=1061

So this is how JS modules work without having to resort to outside packages or experimental features.

I see.

4:55pm. https://youtu.be/fBNz5xF-Kx4?t=1433

This is tedious. I'd rather take a nap and leave this for later, but that is the wrong path to take.

Since I do not feel like writing raw JS, let me see whether I can get his examples to work in TS.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node

Uh, how do I use the base node types?

5:15pm. It won't recognize the type definitions if I install them globally. At any rate, I can finally use `path`.

5:25pm. https://youtu.be/fBNz5xF-Kx4?t=1734

Let me stop here for just a bit, I need a little break. So far this stuff has been more basic than I expected.

5:45pm. Let me resume. I'll do it for 20 more minutes and then call it a day. I feel like I am starting to get back on the track.

Tomorrow, after I finish the Nodejs video, I'll go through the Express one. After that, I am not sure.

It would be good if I could do something basic in Svelte, and then set up a server on my own, first using Node.js and then ASP.NET without using Blazor.

But I might want to watch more of his tutorials before that. I definitely want to be thorough with my study of the fundamentals. All of this won't take me too long. At the rate things are going I should be able to start work on the language server before the month is up.

6:25pm. https://youtu.be/fBNz5xF-Kx4?t=2938

I'll close it soon. Let me just note that event emitters and listeners is something I am quite familiar with from my .NET GUI days. Not to mention the Scala Reactive course. Based on the way things are going, I can roughly guess how the HTTP server is going to come out.

https://youtu.be/fBNz5xF-Kx4?t=3000

Let me stop here, I had enough. I am both tired and hungry at this point.

6:30pm. Let me review a bit.

By all means, I should have gone through the entirety of this video today, but I ended up taking too much time on those MDN docs in the morning. Had I known the course would be like this, I would have done it straight away and ignored the docs.

I mean, this is so basic - it is no trouble at all.

Inevitably the HTTP server is going to be a basic async pattern matcher on requests. I can deal with that.

I just need Brad to initiate me into this thing. So far, his lectures have been very good. I do not have a single complaint with them.

6:35pm. Just a bit more and I will have it. After I have the HTTP server, all I will need to do is lookup interprocess communication and see where that leads me. The actual language server will not be that much different than the web ones.

It really has taken me a retarded amount of time to get to this point, but one way in which understanding differs from knowledge is that it is built bottom up. Since I keep doing it the wrong way around, it is inevitable that I would end up in trouble."

New funny

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
