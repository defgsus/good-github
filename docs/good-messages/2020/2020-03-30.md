Change the API and do not use linked lists for arrays/objects

Using linked lists was rather awkward. It wasn't particularly a problem
(usually), because most user code would iterate linearly over arrays and
objects anyway. Random access was probably a rare requirement. But it
was quite awkward. In theory it also wasted some memory.

Linked lists were used because they had a rather nice property: you
didn't need a real memory manager, and could still allocate straight-
forward by bumping a pointer. You could support arbitrary size
and depth of the data structures, limited only by the provided memory
chunk (the depth is also by the CPU stack and the max. depth parameter).

Fortunately, there is a simple trick to represent JSON arrays as C
arrays: put all array items on a "stack", and only move them to the heap
only after the array is fully parsed. This stack is a separate memory
area, that is only used to store array items during parsing. Since
"finished" arrays are moved to the heap, the stack will contain the
array items in a packed way, without anything in-between.

The stack memory is put at the end of the heap, and grows downward. Just
like with traditional stack/heap layouts, this provides maximal
utilization of all memory. In addition, we can easily move array items
from the stack to the heap without increasing memory usage: we can
simply use memmove(). A disadvantage of this arrangement is that the
stack arrays are stored in reversed order, so CPU cycles need to be
wasted for reversing them.

(In theory, reversal and copying could be done at the some time if there
is no overlap, but that seems annoying and probably not worth the
trouble.)

Just making the stack memory completely separate (e.g. by reserving 50%
of the user provided memory or so) would avoid the need for reversal,
but memory utilization would be worse.

Same Game Now Object Oriented

Had problems with Hard Drive and some other crap with my PC. I didn't work on anything I thought was worth uploading. So I already Missed a day, also had a migrane for over the last 72 hours, however I just updated this little soon to be game, now it is object oriented, or uses a class at least. Needed to make the change as I see this getting a bit larger, who knows maybe I will need to make the change to several files, I hope that is the case, it would be good practice and mean I have a pretty hefty amount of code.

To play you will need python 3.x and to download the .PNG images I have uploaded, they may be in a separate file in this repo, or you can use your own images. Just make sure the background is about 800x800 if you want the screen covered, find a smaller sprite for the player and there is 5 or 6 frames a walk cycle. Match the frame names to the image names in the py file, or just get all the posted images, and play as Sailor Mercury all you want (she is the sprite I think, otherwise known as the Blue one)..

I will be making my own sprites, not sure if I will edit existing sprites or make them from scratch. Same goes for the map, and everything else. I may find a tileset to use, was thinking about Zelda Oracle of Ages/Seasons tile sets. Even remaking a game, just like them, however putting both games on one map. That would be a crazy project. Just making the over world would be good enough, forget the dungeons. If I can and once I have enemies I may do that, then be done, except when I get the urge to work on it, then I can work on a dungeon little by little or something, maybe. Although if I take on something of that magnitude I want to be using Unity, Unreal or something. Even if it's unreal 2004, I have that on an Unreal Tournament game I found, wonder if it's easier than the current version. Without as much things to worry about. Doing this sure makes me want to learn C# and C++, also LUA. In fact i'm sure once I get OOP down in Python, i'll run out of things to do in it and switch.

Re-engineer the binder-swap transformation

The binder-swap transformation is implemented by the occurrence
analyser -- see Note [Binder swap] in OccurAnal. However it had
a very nasty corner in it, for the case where the case scrutinee
was a GlobalId.  This led to trouble and hacks, and ultimately
to #16296.

This patch re-engineers how the occurrence analyser implements
the binder-swap, by actually carrying out a substitution rather
than by adding a let-binding.  It's all described in
Note [The binder-swap substitution].

I did a few other things along the way

* Fix a bug in StgCse, which could allow a loop breaker to be CSE'd
  away.  See Note [Care with loop breakers] in StgCse.  I think it can
  only show up if occurrence analyser sets up bad loop breakers, but
  still.

* Better commenting in SimplUtils.prepareAlts

* A little refactoring in CoreUnfold; nothing significant
  e.g. rename CoreUnfold.mkTopUnfolding to mkFinalUnfolding

* Renamed CoreSyn.isFragileUnfolding to hasCoreUnfolding

* Move mkRuleInfo to CoreFVs

We observed respectively 4.6% and 5.9% allocation decreases for the following
tests:

Metric Decrease:
    T9961
    haddock.base

"8:45am. I somehow managed to pull my calf muscle during the night so I'll be confined to this chair for the next few days...

Much like with the recent Corona events, this will not noticeably impact my lifestyle.

Yesterday I got Doom Eternal and it is very fun. I am so bad at it, and I am still making good progress on Nightmare. The sheer amount of combos in this edition is somewhat bewildering, and I am yet to get a grasp on it.

8:50am. Well, let me do my morning reading and then I will start.

9:25am. Ok, let me just read the latest Astrid chapter (it is really taking too long to get to the genocide) and then I will start.

9:35am. Let me finally start.

What I will do first is go through the examples for chapter 5.

9:55am. Had to take a break.

I came to a realization. If I hurry I could do it in 2 days, but I want to take my sweet time with this in order to study the examples properly. 2 days is just not enough time. I feel too much rushed right now.

Forget my plan of delaying the review tomorrow. I will do it normally, and then give the book the respect it deserves after that.

10:05am. Focus me, focus. Study the examples, not /pol/ threads.

```
    class VariableTimePrimeCheckService : PrimeCheckService
    {
        private readonly int _numberToDelay;

        public VariableTimePrimeCheckService(int numberToDelay)
        {
            _numberToDelay = numberToDelay;
        }
```

I always taken aback at how poorly the mainstream OO languages are designed. Here is the F# version.

```
type VariableTimePrimeCheckService(numberToDelay : int) = ...
```

All they had to do was put the fucking argument at the top, and yet they could not do that much. It is amazing. It is like zero thought went into the ergonomics of the language. This is what happen when you let NPCs do the design.

10:25am.

```
        [<CompiledName("ZeroCreate")>]
        let zeroCreate count =
            if count < 0 then invalidArgInputMustBeNonNegative "count" count
            Microsoft.FSharp.Primitives.Basics.Array.zeroCreateUnchecked count

        [<CompiledName("Create")>]
        let create (count: int) (value: 'T) =
            if count < 0 then invalidArgInputMustBeNonNegative "count" count
            let array: 'T[] = Microsoft.FSharp.Primitives.Basics.Array.zeroCreateUnchecked count
            for i = 0 to Operators.Checked.(-) array.Length 1 do // use checked arithmetic here to satisfy FxCop
                array.[i] <- value
            array
```

I know that I should be studying RP, but I am thinking of the issue of serializing types in Spiral. Remember that union type to dense vector translation. That kind of thing.

Trying to figure out the right way to design `tensor_init` has been giving me trouble because init requires a size and a function to go along. All this time I've been thinking that just the type would not be enough because in .NET arrays are always zeroed out - so by that logic if I go with `init` I'd get an efficiency gain. But no, creating them raw is what happens in the F# standard library. As one might expect.

Well, it is one of the issues that was concerning me. For real nominal types, I need to take some special care to make sure that one can go from types to values for the sake of closure conversion.

I'll make the syntax something like...

```
real nominal Tensor l a : (i : l) = tensor_create `a i
```

With this, the partial evaluator will have enough information to make both the type and provide its constructor arguments. I've been looking for ways to avoid having to make separate constructor and type provider code and this will do the trick.

Yes, I know that having the constructor be a part of the type was my plan from the start, but I've also been considering other doing the type provider separately.

Incidentally, having to do write separate type inference code in Spiral by hand is why I am putting global type inference in v0.2. This is something to be avoid if at all possible.

10:50am. I am thinking of how record application could be done in the typed segment.

I need that to do tensors with named dimensions.

10:55am. Ah, enough of this. I will find a way to do record application with the power of constraints. It will definitely be possible.

Let me get back to studying the examples.

This is what I meant by needing to take my time. I really do need time to think in order to establish the foundations.

11am. Oh, there is a `CreatingPeriodicUpdatableView` WPF project in chapter 5. It had not been mentioned in the book. It is really quite nice of the author to this. If I was writing a review I'd give it an extra point just for this.

11:15am. I really wonder how the C# compiler knows to go after `app.xaml`. Where is this set? At some point I am going to have to ask around, but nevermind that for now. XAML is decently readable.

11:25am.

```
            foreach (var prime in await generator.GenerateAsync(5))
            {
                Console.Write("{0}, ", prime);
            }
```

Hmmm, you can put `await` inside `foreach`? This is interesting. C# is neat in weird places.

11:45am.

```
        private static void UsingThreadPool()
        {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Demo.DisplayHeader("Using the ThreadPool");

            Console.WriteLine("Starting the long work");
            ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem((_) =>
            {
                //simulating a long work of five secnods
                Thread.Sleep(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

                Console.WriteLine("Long work is done");
            });

            Console.WriteLine("Waiting for long work to finish, but you can press <Enter> any time to continue");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
```

So you can use the thread pool like this.

I am really taking my sweet time here, but studying should be done at a comfortable pace as it is a creative endeavor.

11:50am. Let me finally start chapter 6. I'll read just a few pages and then stop for breakfast. This book has been pretty good to me so far.

12:15pm. "To capture and handle all the unhandled exceptions thrown from tasks, you can use the TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException event that will be triggered when a task is disposed of because its exception wasn’t observed. You can also change the default behavior so that the process will terminate by setting a configuration in your app.config\web.config file."

I don't understand how this works.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler.unobservedtaskexception?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netframework-4.8

"This application domain-wide event provides a mechanism to prevent exception escalation policy (which, by default, terminates the process) from triggering.

To make it easier for developers to write asynchronous code based on tasks, the .NET Framework 4.5 changes the default exception behavior for unobserved exceptions. Although unobserved exceptions still raise the UnobservedTaskException exception, the process does not terminate by default. "

Ah, I think I see it in terms of individual tasks at least. I am not sure how the observable would know whether the exception is unobserved...though it would be implementable by letting the exception flow to the end and reraising that event.

I am just guessing here.

12:25pm. 155/337. Let me stop here."

"1:05pm. I am back. Let me resume. I do not feel like slacking today.

Let me see if I can finish a few more chapters today.

1:20pm. Focus me, focus. Stop thinking about Doom.

1:55pm. 169/337. It should be possible to replace this mutable thing with `Generate`. I'll try it once I am done reading the chapter.

2:05pm. 171/337. Done with the chapter. Before I move on to number 7, I am going to look at the examples.

2:15pm.

```
                .SkipUntil(
                    mouseDowns.Do(_ =>
                    {
                        line = new Polyline() { Stroke = Brushes.Black, StrokeThickness = 3 };
                        canvas.Children.Add(line);
                    }))
```

This feels wildly inefficient. Does the Children collection get filter out duplicates automatically?

```
            Polyline line = null;
           _subscription =
                movements
                .SkipUntil(
                    mouseDowns.Do(_ =>
                    {
                        line = new Polyline() { Stroke = Brushes.Black, StrokeThickness = 3 };
                        canvas.Children.Add(line);
                        textblock.Text = canvas.Children.Count.ToString();
                    }))
                .TakeUntil(mouseUp)
                .Select(m => m.EventArgs.GetPosition(this))
                .Repeat()
                .Subscribe(pos => line.Points.Add(pos));
```

It seems it only adds a new line once the mouse gets clicked. Annoyingly I pretty much forgotten everything about various control properties, but I managed to add a `TextBlock` control.

2:45pm. Had to take a break. Let me resume.

Ah yes, now I remember where I was.

2:50pm. Hmmm, working is XAML is not too bad, but let me see if I can finally do this thing using Generate.

2:55pm.

```
                    mouseDowns.SelectMany(x =>
                    {

                    })
                    Observable.Generate(
                    )
```

No this is not working.

3:10pm. Hrmmm...I am thinking, but I can't figure it out. The problem in fold is that it accepts the seed directly, rather than generates it. I think I am going to have to use SelectMany somewhere.

3:25pm.

```
                .SelectMany(_ =>
                {
                    mouseDowns
                    .SelectMany(m => {
                        var line = new Polyline() { Stroke = Brushes.Black, StrokeThickness = 3 };
                        canvas.Children.Add(line);
                        mouseUp
                        .SelectMany(_ =>
                        {
                            line.Points.Add(m.EventArgs.GetPosition(canvas));

                        })
                    })
                    .TakeUntil(mouseUp)
                    //.Do(m => line.Points.Add(m.EventArgs.GetPosition(canvas)))
                    //.Repeat()

                })
```

It is not coming to me as it usually would. As expected, I will need practice in this. I am not going to give up yet though.

3:30pm. Maybe I am doing it the wrong way around. My intuition is starting to come online.

3:35pm.

```
            _subscription =
                 mouseDowns
                 .SelectMany(_ =>
                 {
                     line = new Polyline() { Stroke = Brushes.Black, StrokeThickness = 3 };
                     canvas.Children.Add(line);
                     movements
                     .TakeUntil(mouseUp)
                     .Do(m => line.Points.Add(m.EventArgs.GetPosition(canvas)));
                 })
                 .Repeat()
                 .Subscribe();
```

I think this should do it, except it can't find the right overload (out of 18).

3:40pm.

```
            var f = _ =>
            {
                line = new Polyline() { Stroke = Brushes.Black, StrokeThickness = 3 };
                canvas.Children.Add(line);
                movements
                .TakeUntil(mouseUp)
                .Do(m => line.Points.Add(m.EventArgs.GetPosition(canvas)));
            }
```

This is a type error as well. I had not counted on C# being so much worse at inference.

3:50pm.

```
            _subscription =
                 mouseDowns
                 .SelectMany<EventPattern<MouseButtonEventArgs>,Unit>(_ => {
                     var line = new Polyline() { Stroke = Brushes.Black, StrokeThickness = 3 };
                     canvas.Children.Add(line);
                     movements
                     .TakeUntil(mouseUp)
                     .Select(m => { line.Points.Add(m.EventArgs.GetPosition(canvas)); return Unit.Default; });
                 })
                 .Repeat()
                 .Subscribe();
```

I am still messing with this. C# is so bad at type inference.

```
            _subscription =
                 mouseDowns
                 .SelectMany(_ => {
                     var line = new Polyline() { Stroke = Brushes.Black, StrokeThickness = 3 };
                     canvas.Children.Add(line);
                     return
                         movements
                         .TakeUntil(mouseUp)
                         .Select(m => { line.Points.Add(m.EventArgs.GetPosition(canvas)); return Unit.Default; });
                 })
                 .Repeat()
                 .Subscribe();
```

Ah, I forgot the damn return.

How annoying.

Let me give it a try.

It works.

```
            _subscription =
                 mouseDowns
                 .SelectMany(_ => {
                     var line = new Polyline() { Stroke = Brushes.Black, StrokeThickness = 3 };
                     canvas.Children.Add(line);
                     return
                         movements
                         .TakeUntil(mouseUp)
                         .Do(m => line.Points.Add(m.EventArgs.GetPosition(canvas)));
                 })
                 .Repeat()
                 .Subscribe();
```

Slimmed it down a little.

Yeah, this is the right way to go about this. This solution is definitely better than the book author's.

3:55pm. I got some good exp here. Let me continue on to chapter 7.

4:10pm. Focus me, focus.

"A type that implements the IObservable<T> interface and IObserver<M> interface is called a subject. This type acts as both an observer and an observable, as shown in figure 7.1. It allows you to create an object that becomes a hub, which is able to intercept notifications it receives as an observer and push them to its observers. This, for example, can be used inside a shopping-cart class to notify various observers (such as the relevant UI component) about items added or removed from the cart. The cart exposes Subject as an observable, and the cart Add and Remove methods call the subject’s OnNext method to notify about the change. "

Focus. Just 2 more hours of this.

Let me get back on track. I actually hadn't considered using `Subject` like this. This book definitely is proving its value.

4:40pm. 179/337. I did not catch in the other book that the `AsyncSubject` only triggers on completion.

I have to admit, at this point I really am fatigued.

How much till the end of the chapter? 19 more pages.

Ok, I can bear with it.

4:45pm. 180/337. What is Microsoft Band?

"Microsoft Band was a smart band with smartwatch and activity tracker/fitness tracker features, created and developed by Microsoft. It was announced on October 29, 2014. The Microsoft Band incorporated fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities and integrated with Windows Phone, iOS, and Android smartphones through a Bluetooth connection. On October 3, 2016, Microsoft stopped sales and development of the line of devices.[1] On May 31, 2019, the Band's companion app was decommissioned, and Microsoft offered a refund for customers who were lifelong active platform users.[2]"

From Wikipedia. I see.

Let me move on.

4:50pm. 181/337.

---

Although you expose the IObservable type only, the encapsulation can still be broken. That’s because it’s possible for a hostile or inexperienced developer to cast the observable back to a subject, as in this example:

```
var acct = new BankAccount();
acct.MoneyTransactions.SubscribeConsole("Transferring");

var hackedSubject = acct.MoneyTransactions as Subject<int>;
hackedSubject.OnNext(-9999);
```

---

Things like these is why I am not going to put any kind of inheritance into Spiral. Extensibility is not worth it.

5:30pm. 190/337. My focus is really slipping right now.

No, I had enough. I am done for the day here. Phew.

5:35pm. Today I had a very short break, but as a result it seems I did not manage to go as long as I usually would.

It seem my creative budget per day is the same as usual.

I admit though, that I want the extra time so I can play Doom. Yesterday I started only at 8:30pm so I could not get much game time in.

5:40pm. I really do want to get better at functional reactive programming. Much better. It is definitely the next step forward. Frameworks can't be the answer, neither can limited DSLs like Svelte. Trying to do it on my own failed, and studying other people's code was a waste of time.

So the only answer is to figure out what the fundamentals are and practice that.

Skills at FRP will give me the abilities to do my own UIs succinctly. They will also allow me to do editor support for Spiral.

Skills at this will give me the power to do Real Programs.

From a perspective of a professional programmer, I am too half baked. I always was. I've always admired professionally done tools, and felt inferior for not being able to produce them. It is not that I really couldn't monkey through them, but a real pro would do this with grace. He would make the difficult seem easy.

5:45pm. Just till 2022. If I can keep it up till then, I will have all the skills that I need to do whatever I want.

Pretty soon, I will start to branch out. Eventually, I will be done with the books, and the studies and will be able to do my own thing. I fill finish Spiral and get my hands on those neurochips one way or the other.

If my position deteriorates, I can always make money the regular way - and these skills will allow me to deliver the highest possible quality of work. This will give me the confidence to tackle the programming world at large. Though I have no intention of ever getting a job, the knowledge that I can do so whenever I want would be its own gold."

Update 1167C_Codeforces_using_DFS.cpp

In some social network, there are n users communicating with each other in m groups of friends. Let's analyze the process of distributing some news between users.

Initially, some user x receives the news from some source. Then he or she sends the news to his or her friends (two users are friends if there is at least one group such that both of them belong to this group). Friends continue sending the news to their friends, and so on. The process ends when there is no pair of friends such that one of them knows the news, and another one doesn't know.

For each user x you have to determine what is the number of users that will know the news if initially only user x starts distributing it.

Input
The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤n,m≤5⋅105) — the number of users and the number of groups of friends, respectively.

Then m lines follow, each describing a group of friends. The i-th line begins with integer ki (0≤ki≤n) — the number of users in the i-th group. Then ki distinct integers follow, denoting the users belonging to the i-th group.

It is guaranteed that ∑i=1mki≤5⋅105.

Output
Print n integers. The i-th integer should be equal to the number of users that will know the news if user i starts distributing it.

Tones down Mekanism (#22)

* Update Mekanism.cfg

why the FUCK did the maker of mekanism make a goddamn bronze, BRONZE sword better than diamond.

WHY DOES ADDING TWO BLACK ROCKS MAKE IT DOUBLE DAMAGE?!?!?

WHAT THE FUCK REEEEEE

This brings everything closer to vanilla, and nerfs the shit out of the armour spawnrate on zombies/skeletons etc because it's a massive pain in the dickhole.

* Update Mekanism.cfg

this is why you don't assume no config changes were madebefore deleting the file.

remove StomperZ mode

StomperZ mode was added with FA+ and Casual back in late 2016 as part of
the Simply Love v3.0 release.  At that time, "StomperZ" was intended to
help a few players qualify/practice for Bearpocalypse 6.  I had not
intended for it to ever be a Long-Term Thing, but hey, four years later
we are.

This commit removes all in-theme support for StomperZ game mode.  I've
tested this to the best of my ability and didn't see anything broken,
but let me know.

If you'd had your DefaultGameMode in ThemePrefs.ini set to StomperZ, it
will be reset to ITG.  If your profile last used a judgment graphic from
StomperZ that no longer exists, ScreenSelectProfile will show an empty
space until your profile chooses some new judgment graphic.

Simply Love now has three game modes: Casual, ITG, and FA+.  It's
possible a future release of Simply Love (post-4.8.7) will incorporate
a 4th game mode again, but I'll need to think about that and reach out
to some people that have been Experimenting with such things.  I do not
think that adding a "DDR" mode is a good idea at this time.

If you enjoyed playing StomperZ mode in previous Simply Love releases, I
encourage you to support the official Rhythm Horizon project as my
efforts here will forever be deeply indebted to it.
