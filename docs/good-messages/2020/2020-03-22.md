Rename `near` to `zNear`

`near` is an illegal variable name on Windows (if `windef.h` is included),
because a macro with the same name is defined.

Someone else already put your rage into words, see

Implements Cull card Gathering Evil (#467)

* Implements Cull card Gathering Evil
1: Gain 1 Strength and 1 Vulnerable for every curse played this fight. Exhaust.
Upgrade: Entomb: When deck shuffles

Added an OnShuffle subscriber. Currently, onShuffle is only called for cards in the Exhaust pile, since this is the only card that currently requires this subscriber, and only when it is exhausted. I'm not sure if this is wise, or if it is better to call it for each card anywhere.
Also, I interpreted this upgrade to mean: Exhume when your deck shuffles. It doesn't also entomb the card, since that seems like even more of a change from the unupgraded card.

* Added check on magicNumber > 0, to prevent applying 0 stacks of two powers.

library: add item origin (as comments) to header files

A lack of documentation seems to be the major obstacle
to releasing this new library. So, in an effort to get
the ball rolling again, this patch adds the origins of
each item as a comment to six of the new header files.

However, before reviewing how such changes may benefit
that documentation objective, it seemed appropriate to
first reflect on newlib's background & current status.

___________________________________________ BACKGROUND
Discussions about and work on a new library began back
in July 2012 but quickly died. After a lull of 2 years
those discussions were resumed in August 2014 but soon
died also (and no code survived the gitorious demise).

With those early discussions, the recommended approach
was to encapsulate all of the libprocps data offerings
in individual functions. When it came to extensibility
it was suggested we should rely on symbols versioning.

Unfortunately that approach would have made for a huge
Application Programming Interface virtually impossible
to master or even document. And, runtime call overhead
would have been substantial for ps and especially top.

So, an alternative design was sought but there were no
new suggestions/contributions via freelists or gitlab.
Thus, in spite of a lack of library design experience,
the procps-ng team (Craig & Jim) set out to develop an
alternative API, more concise and with lower overhead.

https://www.freelists.org/post/procps/Old-library-calls
. 08/12/2014, revival of library design discussion
https://www.freelists.org/post/procps/libprocs-redesign

_____________________________________ DESIGN EVOLUTION
Our newlib branch first appeared on June 14, 2015. And
our current API actually represents the 4th generation
during the past 3 years of evolution. First, there was
a basic 'new', 'get' and 'unref' approach, using enums
to minimize the proliferation of 'get' function calls.

Then, in anticipation of other programs like ps, where
multiple fields times multiple processes would greatly
increase the number of 'get' function calls, a concept
of 'chains' was introduced. This became generation #2.

Such 'chains' proved unnecessarily complex so 'stacks'
replaced them. This was considered the 3rd generation,
but too many implementation details were still exposed
requiring those users to 'alloc', 'read', 'fill', etc.

Finally, a 4th generation emerged representing several
refinements to standardize and minimize those exported
functions, thus hiding all implementation details from
the users. Lastly, handling of 'errno' was normalized.

https://www.freelists.org/post/procps/some-more-master-newlib-stuff

_______________________________________ CURRENT DESIGN
Central to this new design is a simple 'result' struct
reflecting an item plus its value (thanks to a union).
As a user option, these item structures can be grouped
into 'stacks', yielding many results with just 1 call.
Such a 'stack' can be seen as a variable length record
whose content/order is determined solely by the users.

Within that 'result' structure, the union has standard
C language types so there is never a doubt how a value
should be used in a printf statement. Given that linux
requires a least a 32-bit platform the only difference
in capacity surrounds 'long' integers. And, where such
types might be used, the 32-bit maximums are adequate.

The items themselves are simply enumerators defined in
the respective header files. A user can name any items
of interest then the library magically provides result
structure(s). The approach was proven to be extensible
without breaking the ABI (in commit referenced below).

The 6 major APIs each provide for the following calls:
. 'new' ---------> always required as the first call .
. 'ref' -------------------------> strictly optional .
. 'unref' --------> optional, if ill-behaved program .
. 'get' --------------------> retrieve a single item .
. 'select' ----------------> retrieve multiple items .

And the 'get' and 'select' functions provide for delta
results representing the difference between successive
get/select calls (or a 'new' then  'get/select' call).

For the <diskstats>, <pids>, <slabinfo> & <stat> APIs,
where results are unpredictable, a 'reap' function can
return multiple result structures for multiple stacks.

The <pids> API differs from others in that those items
of interest must be provided at 'new' or 'reset' time,
a function unique to this API. And the <pids> 'select'
function requires PIDs or UIDs which are to be fetched
which then operates as a subset of 'reap'. Lastly, the
'get' function is an iterator for successive PIDs/TIDs
returning items previously identified via 'new/reset'.

To provide assistance to users during development, the
special header 'proc/xtra-procps-debug.h' is available
to check type usage against library expectations. That
check is activated by including this header explicitly
or via build using: ./configure '-DXTRA_PROCPS_DEBUG'.

commit 09e1886c9e731f8b8c89a55d11f72f53f030b2de

_________________________ INITIAL DOCUMENTATION EFFORT
The initial attempt, referenced below, dealt primarily
with the <pids> interface. Separate man pages for each
exported function were created. Plus there was another
document describing the items, among other miscellany.

Adopting such an approach encounters several problems:

1. In order to use these man pages, users are required
to already know how to use the library. Or alternately
one could randomly search each of them while trying to
ascertain which function call satisfies their need and
what exactly was the proper compliment/order required.

2. While we can explain what all of those <pids> items
represent, that certainly isn't true for all the APIs.
See the gaps in kernel documentation for <meminfo> and
complete lack of documentation with that <vmstat> API.

3. Our documentation effort should take pains to avoid
unnecessary implementation details. Here's an example:
. "The pointer to info will have memory"
. "allocated and a structure created."

Alternatively, the following conveys user requirements
while not offering any internal implementation detail:
. "You must provide the address of a NULL"
. "info structure pointer."

Reference(s):
. 01/04/2017, initial documentation offering
https://www.freelists.org/post/procps/Using-reap-and-get
commit 2598e9f2ce39c93ebf55f664454d3bea919ed4e0

___________________ RECOMMENDED DOCUMENTATION APPROACH
I recommend that the newlib documentation consist of 3
man pages only. The first would cover the 5 major APIs
and their common functions. The second would deal with
the <pids> API exclusively, explaining how it differs.
Any remaining exported libproc functions which are yet
to be included could be represented in a 3rd document.

For these new documents the following are are assumed:

1. Since we will not be able to document all items, we
shouldn't try to document any items. We should instead
rely on proc(5) or Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt.

2. Program development often involves referencing some
header file(s). So, make that an absolute requirement.

3. With the addition of item origins, represented with
this commit, and considering that 'types' were already
present, the header file might be all some users need.

4. And who knows, when a user of our libproc complains
about gaps in their documentation, it might prompt the
kernel folks to correct those long standing omissions.

To summarize, I suggest that we replace that libproc.3
document with a more general one explaining the basics
of accessing this new library and the common calls for
most of the major interfaces. We can then create a new
document (libproc-pids.3?), which explains differences
in using the <PIDS> application programming interface.
A final document (libproc-misc.3?) covers what's left.

nixos/acme: change default keyType to ec256

Previously, the NixOS ACME module defaulted to using P-384 for
TLS certificates. I believe that this is a mistake, and that we
should use P-256 instead, despite it being theoretically
cryptographically weaker.

The security margin of a 256-bit elliptic curve cipher is substantial;
beyond a certain level, more bits in the key serve more to slow things
down than add meaningful protection. It's much more likely that ECDSA
will be broken entirely, or some fatal flaw will be found in the NIST
curves that makes them all insecure, than that the security margin
will be reduced enough to put P-256 at risk but not P-384. It's also
inconsistent to target a curve with a 192-bit security margin when our
recommended nginx TLS configuration allows 128-bit AES. [This Stack
Exchange answer][pornin] by cryptographer Thomas Pornin conveys the
general attitude among experts:

> Use P-256 to minimize trouble. If you feel that your manhood is
> threatened by using a 256-bit curve where a 384-bit curve is
> available, then use P-384: it will increases your computational and
> network costs (a factor of about 3 for CPU, a few extra dozen bytes
> on the network) but this is likely to be negligible in practice (in a
> SSL-powered Web server, the heavy cost is in "Web", not "SSL").

[pornin]: https://security.stackexchange.com/a/78624

While the NIST curves have many flaws (see [SafeCurves][safecurves]),
P-256 and P-384 are no different in this respect; SafeCurves gives
them the same rating. The only NIST curve Bernstein [thinks better of,
P-521][bernstein] (see "Other standard primes"), isn't usable for Web
PKI (it's [not supported by BoringSSL by default][boringssl] and hence
[doesn't work in Chromium/Chrome][chromium], and Let's Encrypt [don't
support it either][letsencrypt]).

[chromium]: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=478225
[letsencrypt]: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/#supported-key-algorithms

So there's no real benefit to using P-384; what's the cost? In the
Stack Exchange answer I linked, Pornin estimates a factor of 3×
CPU usage, which wouldn't be so bad; unfortunately, this is wildly
optimistic in practice, as P-256 is much more common and therefore
much better optimized. [This GitHub comment][openssl] measures
the performance differential for raw Diffie-Hellman operations with
OpenSSL 1.1.1 at a whopping 14× (even P-521 fares better!), and [Caddy
disables P-384 by default]() due to Go's [lack of accelerated assembly
implementations][crypto/elliptic] for it, and the difference there seems
even more extreme: [this golang-nuts post][golang-nuts] measures the key
generation performance differential at 275×. It's unlikely to be the
bottleneck for anyone, but I still feel kind of bad for anyone having
lego generate hundreds of certificates and sign challenges with them
with performance like that...

[golang-nuts]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/nlnJkBMMyzk

In conclusion, there's no real reason to use P-384 in general: if you
don't care about Web PKI compatibility and want to use a nicer curve,
then Ed25519 or P-521 are better options; if you're a NIST-fearing
paranoiac, you should use good old RSA; but if you're a normal person
running a web server, then you're best served by just using P-256. Right
now, NixOS makes an arbitrary decision between two equally-mediocre
curves that just so happens to slow down ECDH key agreement for every
TLS connection by over a magnitude; this commit fixes that.

Unfortunately, it seems like existing P-384 certificates won't get
migrated automatically on renewal without manual intervention, but
that's a more general problem with the existing ACME module (see #81634;
I know @yegortimoshenko is working on this). To migrate your
certificates manually, run:

  $ sudo find /var/lib/acme/.lego/certificates -type f -delete
  $ sudo find /var/lib/acme -name '*.pem' -delete
  $ sudo systemctl restart 'acme-*.service' nginx.service

(No warranty. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces. But it worked
for me.)

genirq: Allow the irqchip state of an IRQ to be save/restored

There is a number of cases where a kernel subsystem may want to
introspect the state of an interrupt at the irqchip level:

- When a peripheral is shared between virtual machines,
  its interrupt state becomes part of the guest's state,
  and must be switched accordingly. KVM on arm/arm64 requires
  this for its guest-visible timer
- Some GPIO controllers seem to require peeking into the
  interrupt controller they are connected to to report
  their internal state

This seem to be a pattern that is common enough for the core code
to try and support this without too many horrible hacks. Introduce
a pair of accessors (irq_get_irqchip_state/irq_set_irqchip_state)
to retrieve the bits that can be of interest to another subsystem:
pending, active, and masked.

- irq_get_irqchip_state returns the state of the interrupt according
  to a parameter set to IRQCHIP_STATE_PENDING, IRQCHIP_STATE_ACTIVE,
  IRQCHIP_STATE_MASKED or IRQCHIP_STATE_LINE_LEVEL.
- irq_set_irqchip_state similarly sets the state of the interrupt.

travis: shut the fuck up

Travis is currently having "problems" and is spamming IRC all the time
with pointless failure notifications. Make it so that it hopefully sends
a message only when it goes from success to failure, which should
exclude these cases.

While I'm at it, I'd like to complain how idiotic it is to store CI
configuration in a project's source repository. Such a repository should
only contain things that are inherently part of the code's function, not
part of the organization. You don't store bug reports, build results,
the website, developer access controls, etc. in this repository either.
But for CI it's supposed to be OK? I'm all for this "configuration as
code" thing, but what it should mean is that you store configuration
files in some git managed repository, NOT necessarily that you dump them
into the main source code repo. There are many arguments why it should
not be there, such as this very commit. I have a feeling this is mostly
just because all these idiotic web services just want to advertise their
shit and bind customers by not giving easy ways to treat source code and
CI service configuration orthogonal. And so, the source code repo gets
clobbered with stupid shit (both in the set of files and the commit
history). It's fairly idiotic and my tolerance for it is waning. (Oh, of
course you could probably jump through hoops to make it a separate repo,
but I bet that is complicated and has all kinds of downsides because it
won't be the way "it's meant to be used".)

"9:15am. I've been chilling for half an hour now. I'll start soon.

As can be expected, I am still thinking about typeclasses.

9:30am. And...I am still thinking about them.

9:40am. Agh, forget the editor support for a while. I am having waves of inspiration and I want to work this out completely in my mind.

11:05am. I am still deep in thought. Typeclass inference is wrecking my shit. The same goes for interfaces.

...The thing is, I do not want typeclasses. I do not want to literally pass around extra dictionaries. The way I've imagined it, the search would always be done in place.

But that sort of arrangement would be slow as molasses. I'd have to do a linear search over the whole list in the order they've been added.

If it is just one type argument, interfaces are definitely better.

12:20pm. It has really been a while since I've been possessed like this.

I know how to do the interfaces now. In the top-down segment I am going to have to introduce a subtyping rule. No way around it.

Let me go through my thinking for a bit on the subtyping rules for interfaces.

```
a :> b // valid
```

And from that it can be inferred that `a = b`

```
q w :> b // valid
```

And from that it can be inferred that `q w = b`

```
q w e :> b // valid
```

From that...`q w e = b`.

```
q w e :> z x // valid
```

From that...`e = x` and `q w = z`. Let me do some more.

```
q w e r :> z x // valid
```

...`r = x` and `q w e = z`.

```
q w e r :> z x c
```

...`r = c`, `e = x`, `q w = z`.

The pattern should be clear. Of course

```
q w e :> z x c
```

...`e = c`, `w = x`, `q = z`.

```
q :> z x // invalid
```

If `q` is type without any type args to it, then it cannot be unified here.

12:30pm. What I am doing here is essentially determining how interfaces types can be applied.

That means that if you have something like an interface with 3 type arguments - a monad transformer for instance, that means that you cannot implement a monad transformer interface for Array or List for example.

But you can implement an equality interface for Array or List even though equality would have only one type argument, and Array and List have two (the class type counts as 1 type arg implicitly.)

12:35pm. This kind of arrangement would not be as good as typeclasses for monadic computation as there is no good way to get `pure` automatically, but it would give me a decent bit of power with low implementation effort. A lot of checks that I would have to do for typeclasses become unnecessary with this. Linear search can be replaced with a very fast dictionary lookup.

Also, I've been intending to disallow orphan instances, but with this I can allow them without much issue.

...Hmmm...not quite.

But I think I can introduce two rules:

1) Interface instances can be defined during the definition of the nominal type.
2) Interface instances can be defined in the same module as the interface type.

Since duplicates will be forbidden, these two rules will ensure that if one package is defining an interface for a type that some other package won't be defining another instance for it.

I do not want a situation where orphan instances turn into collisions.

In fact, an important consideration why I am even going the OO route is so I can easily tell where collisions occur without having to go down a rabbit hole of unification.

12:50pm. Unlike in Haskell which uses monads for everything, in Spiral like in other impure MLs, they won't be used nearly as often so it is fine. And if they are used, I doubt I'll be using monadic bind on the objects themselves.

1pm. I am spending so much of my brainpower on this, but I won't ever need the more advanced functionality. Haskell has such an advanced type system, but it is amazing how much of that becomes unneeded once you add just a bit mutation.

Partial application is what is really divine about functional programming.

1:05pm. I am obsessed. Let me see if I can wind down for a bit, so I can at least eat."

"2:25pm. Done with breakfast. Even though it got colder, it seems today the rain did not come as expected so I'll be outside doing the chores for a while longer again.

Let me chill for a bit first.

2:30pm. Today is strange. I never really know when I'll go into thinking mode. But that I have the leisure to seriously think about extensibility means that I am getting closer to finishing the phase I am currently on even if it does not seem like it. My subconscious would not have guided me in this direction if it did not have the mental resources to do this.

3pm. Oh yeah, this idea occurred to me earlier. Before I leave for the chores, let me just take a look at how Scala does monads.

The way Spiral works is well suited to OO after all.

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/demystifying-the-monad-in-scala-cc716bb6f534

```
trait M[A] {
  def flatMap[B](f: A => M[B]): M[B]
}

def unit[A](x: A): M[A]
```

So something like...

```
interface type bind m a : m a -> forall b. (a -> m b) -> m b
```

I am still not decided on syntax, but the idea I had is quite similar to scala isn't it?

It might be a good idea to look into how Scala does it before I decide.

```
def unit[A](x: A): M[A]
```

The thing I am most unsure is this. This is not like Haskell so I can't do a typeclass search. Just how does Scala do it?

3:10pm. I want to do the chores so let me take off here. I still do not know the semantics of how Scala does it, but I will leave that for later.

Hopefully tomorrow I will get an answer from `reason-vscode` author so I can start studying it. If I don't I am going to have to figure out how to deal with the issue on my own. I am not sure if I'll be to do that. I'll see how things go.

Either way, I'll finish the interface design for Spiral soon and get a move on with that."

Fix chaining tagged and untagged ptrs in compacting GC

Currently compacting GC has the invariant that in a chain all fields are tagged
the same. However this does not really hold: root pointers are not tagged, so
when we thread a root we initialize a chain without a tag. When the pointed
objects is evaluated and we have more pointers to it from the heap, we then add
*tagged* fields to the chain (because pointers to it from the heap are tagged),
ending up chaining fields with different tags (pointers from roots are NOT
tagged, pointers from heap are). This breaks the invariant and as a result
compacting GC turns tagged pointers into non-tagged.

This later causes problem in the generated code where we do reads assuming that
the pointer is aligned, e.g.

    0x7(%rax) -- assumes that pointer is tagged 1

which causes misaligned reads. This caused #17088.

We fix this using the "pointer tagging for large families" patch (#14373,
!1742):

- With the pointer tagging patch the GC can know what the tagged pointer to a
  CONSTR should be (previously we'd need to know the family size -- large
  families are always tagged 1, small families are tagged depending on the
  constructor).

- Since we now know what the tags should be we no longer need to store the
  pointer tag in the info table pointers when forming chains in the compacting
  GC.

As a result we no longer need to tag pointers in chains with 1/2 depending on
whether the field points to an info table pointer, or to another field: an info
table pointer is always tagged 0, everything else in the chain is tagged 1. The
lost tags in pointers can be retrieved by looking at the info table.

Finally, instead of using tag 1 for fields and tag 0 for info table pointers, we
use two different tags for fields:

- 1 for fields that have untagged pointers
- 2 for fields that have tagged pointers

When unchaining we then look at the pointer to a field, and depending on its tag
we either leave a tagged pointer or an untagged pointer in the field.

This allows chaining untagged and tagged fields together in compacting GC.

Fixes #17088

x86/pkeys: Do not special case protection key 0

mm_pkey_is_allocated() treats pkey 0 as unallocated.  That is
inconsistent with the manpages, and also inconsistent with
mm->context.pkey_allocation_map.  Stop special casing it and only
disallow values that are actually bad (< 0).

The end-user visible effect of this is that you can now use
mprotect_pkey() to set pkey=0.

This is a bit nicer than what Ram proposed[1] because it is simpler
and removes special-casing for pkey 0.  On the other hand, it does
allow applications to pkey_free() pkey-0, but that's just a silly
thing to do, so we are not going to protect against it.

The scenario that could happen is similar to what happens if you free
any other pkey that is in use: it might get reallocated later and used
to protect some other data.  The most likely scenario is that pkey-0
comes back from pkey_alloc(), an access-disable or write-disable bit
is set in PKRU for it, and the next stack access will SIGSEGV.  It's
not horribly different from if you mprotect()'d your stack or heap to
be unreadable or unwritable, which is generally very foolish, but also
not explicitly prevented by the kernel.

Make percent-encoding the default output format

It makes the output more deterministic --- there is no need to check if
the preceding line shows an error about not being able to print a given
file name in a single line.

For scripting purposes I added NUL-terminated output (enabled with the
--null option). This way scripts will not need to implement
percent-decoding, it should be faster and it already is a common unix
CLI idiom (see find(1), xargs(1), grep(1)).

Windows support is abandoned. The main reason for that is that on
Windows filenames are case-insensitive and I couldn't find any docs on
what Windows considers to be the correct uppercase->lowercase mapping.
Without applying any kind of case-normalization, durduff would be buggy
on Windows. It seems that there is a function that can be called from
C#, but native languages are out of luck. On top of that, Microsoft
added to Windows a thing called "Per-directory case sensitivity"[1] and
at this point any sanity that was left is thrown out the window. All in
all, Windows isn't a very friendly platform to develop for when you're
dealing with files *facepalm*.

At this point, NUL-terminated output isn't covered in the functional
tests. This is because entering NUL-terminated text into the input
(func.test file) of shelltestrunner isn't all that easy and future
modifications would be even more tricky. I could probably rewrite the
tests as classic Rust tests, but the result would look pretty ugly and
I'm lazy. I may end up filing a bug report to shelltestrunner about
that, so they implement escaped input (so I can just write '\0' for the
NUL character) and maybe I'll even implement that myself. We'll see. For
now this output format isn't tested. Let's hope everything works.

This is it. I'm not in the zone!!
Got news that my sister positive for COVID-19. I just can't concentrate enough.

Anyway Here goes nothing! To the team at TLab, I know this is far for good. But, at least the codes are there, the logic are there, I'm just not in my head the pas couple of days to sort the puzzle of the app yet.

Lastly, thank you for the opportunity, I don't expect much, but honestly I am really interested to join your team. If I got to choose, here or the other firm in sg, I rather choose home. But, well, things just don't get along preety good.

But, i will keep finishing this project. Well, again thank you and have a nice day.

Sincerely, Gabriel

I added this folder so we could run this app... I did wright a whole paragraph on what I did but I fucked up the forking thing so kill me but we need home and I added a little index.html and a main.css so we can do this thing. If someone suggest adding bootstrap then we can do that but I suck at design and yeah..
