Weekly hacks/modifications

In vim I tried to get true color working with simple terminal, fixed up
the comment boilerplate bind to insert the actual date, along with
changing my habit of using jk for insert->normal mode switching to using
the more sane <ctrl>-[

Pretty sure that we are only using .Xmodmap at this point and any
changes from console-keys+ can be ignored.

zathurarc had nothing in it before. Now i added an example exec command
for future reference.

xmonad is going through rapid changes, so expect it.

For the other changes you can go check it out yourself (sorry future
grayson).

refactor #230 Support Sylius 1.7 again (Zales0123)

This PR was merged into the 1.0-dev branch.

Discussion
----------

With the latest `v1.0.0-RC.4`, we've introduced support for Doctrine Migrations 3.0. However, it required from us also to support only Sylius ^1.8... with the support for Sylius ^1.5 in the previous tag.

I believe it was a mistake. Doing such a big and work-demanding change as migrations version switch together with bumping Sylius requirement by 3 versions can be a pain in the back for a lot of developers using `RefundPlugin` already.

I think that doing a step backward can improve the developer experience for those, who already use this plugin. Definitely, the next release (hopefully the stable one already ðŸ¤ž) would support Sylius 1.8 only, so this one is just an intermediate stage. The implementation is not perfect as well but allows us to test 2 versions of Sylius along with 2 versions of PHP and MySQL ðŸ’ƒ 

I would love to see your opinion ðŸ––

Restart with change only on exit

This change allow the user to change everything they have to inside the
homescreen activity and only restart on exit. Previously this was a pain
in the fucking ass because you had to go in and set each option one by one
with a restart inbetween. At least now is not that big of a pain.

- Restart on destroy (hitting the back button, actionbar arrow)
- Restart when a chance is made and the home button is pressed

** Thanks "Jack" for code to detect home button
https://stackoverflow.com/a/27956263

- Cleaned up restart code

#### Monday 2020-11-30 10:44:22 by Marko GrdiniÄ‡

"10:20am. I am up. I could have gotten out of bed an hour ago, but that I did not just goes to show how much I am enjoying myself this month. Programming wise, I feel like my achievements have been mediocre. Well, I did get the cross module and cross package editor support to work, but I am still stuck on the compilation pipeline and making slow progress.

Gaming wise, my life has been a dream. I don't remember the last time I had such an unbroken gaming session after session.

10:25am. Let me try to do some programming.

```fs
type PackageStream = EditorStream<Map<PackageName,InferResult Stream * ValidatedFileHierarchy> * PackageName seq,unit>
```

Yeah, this can't be right. I need a result stream for every file.

```fs
type TargetPackage = string
type PackageName = string
type PackageStream = EditorStream<Map<PackageName,DiffableFileHierarchy> * PackageName seq,unit>
```

Let me just go with this. I'll think about how to create the initial hierarchy separately from the package stream. What is important right now is that I do the package stream logic.

Ah, right, I can't forget the input. Let me just return the map that I am accumulating.

```fs
type PackageName = string
type ModulePath = string
type PackageStream = EditorStream<Map<PackageName,DiffableFileHierarchy> * PackageName seq,Map<ModulePath, PrepassTopEnv Promise>>
```

Let me go down this path.

11am. I've hit a bit of snag and I am trying to resolve it before I start.

```fs
let multi_file package_id top_env =
    let rec create files' =
        {new MultiFileStream with
            member _.Run files =
                let files = diff_order_changed files' files
                let x, l = multi_file_run top_env_empty prepass id Prepass.union Prepass.in_module package_id top_env files
                (Map.isEmpty (fst x), snd x), create l
            }
    create []
```

The issue is that the multi file stream does not give me individual module results. `multi_file_run` gives me the modules that have changed along with the package end result. So I could do a bit of magic to keep the changes around in the package server, but that would result in garbage being kept around.

So what can I do?

```fs
let multi_file_run top_env_empty create_stream post_process_result union in_module package_id top_env files =
    let mutable changed_files = Map.empty
    let rec changed (module_id,top_env as i) x =
        match x with
        | File(_,_,(Some o,_,_)) -> x, o
        | File(path,name,(None,res,tc)) ->
            let tc : EditorStream<_,_> = match tc with Some tc -> tc | None -> create_stream package_id module_id top_env
            let r,tc = tc.Run res
            changed_files <- Map.add path r changed_files
```

I could hack this so that in addition to changed files, it also returns the unchanged ones. I could also give a target to this and have it return the relevant module if it matches.

```fs
| File(_,_,(Some o,_,_)) -> x, o
```

Ah, crap this part does not even include the data that I need if I want to do that last one.

11:10am. How complicated, I am still thinking about it. You'd think that just gettign the module based on the path would be the easiest thing in the world, but I am having unexpected difficulty.

11:20am.

```fs
let inline multi_file_run on_unchanged_file on_changed_file top_env_empty create_stream post_process_result union in_module package_id top_env files =
    let rec changed (module_id,top_env as i) x =
        match x with
        | File(path,_,(Some (r,o),_,_)) ->
            on_unchanged_file path r
            x, o
        | File(path,name,(None,res,tc)) ->
            let tc : EditorStream<_,_> = match tc with Some tc -> tc | None -> create_stream package_id module_id top_env
            let r,tc = tc.Run res
            on_changed_file path r
            let top_env_additions =
                let adds = post_process_result r
                match name with
                | Some name -> adds >>-* in_module name
                | None -> adds
            let o = module_id+1, top_env_additions
            File(path,name,(Some (r,o),res,Some tc)),o
        | Directory(name,l) ->
            let l,(module_id,top_env_adds) = changed_list i l
            let o = module_id, top_env_adds >>-* in_module name
            Directory(name,l),o
    and changed_list (module_id,top_env) l =
        let o = module_id, Promise.Now.withValue(top_env_empty)
        let l,(_,o) =
            List.mapFold (fun (top_env, (module_id, top_env_adds as o)) x ->
                let i = module_id, top_env
                let x,(module_id,top_env_adds') = changed i x
                let union a b = a >>=* fun a -> b >>- fun b -> union a b
                let top_env = union top_env_adds' top_env
                let o = module_id, union top_env_adds' top_env_adds
                x,(top_env,o)
                ) (top_env,o) l
        l,o
    let i = 0, top_env
    let l,(_,top_env_adds) = changed_list i files
    top_env_adds, l
```

Let me go with this. I've realized that the reason why I am having difficulty is because I abstracted this function, and I can't change it without making the implementations diverge. If I have two different copies of this, then changing this so that I get the functionality that I want would be no problem, but because it is like this it took me a while to realize what the problem is.

I really do not want two different copies of this, I made the right choice by doing it like this. Let me adjust the various places.

```fs
let multi_file package_id top_env =
    let rec create files' =
        {new MultiFileStream with
            member _.Run files =
                let files = diff_order_changed files' files
                let mutable changed_files = Map.empty
                let on_unchanged _ _ = ()
                let on_changed path r = changed_files <- Map.add path r changed_files
                let x, l = multi_file_run on_unchanged on_changed top_env_empty typechecker union_adds Infer.union Infer.in_module package_id top_env files
                (changed_files, x), create l
            }
    create []
```

Now the `multi_file` is a bit complex, but `multi_file_run` itself is fairly clean and generic. I have everything I need to implement the targetting.

11:40am.

```fs
type ModuleId = int
type DiffableFileHierarchy = DiffableFileHierarchyT<(PrepassTopEnv Promise * (ModuleId * PrepassTopEnv Promise)) option * InferResult Stream * FileStream option>
type ModuleTarget = string
type MultiFileStream = EditorStream<DiffableFileHierarchy list * ModuleTarget,PrepassTopEnv Promise option * PrepassTopEnv Promise>

let multi_file package_id top_env =
    let rec create files' =
        {new MultiFileStream with
            member _.Run((files,target)) =
                let files = diff_order_changed files' files
                let mutable res = None
                let on_res path r = if path = target then res <- Some r
                let x, l = multi_file_run on_res on_res top_env_empty prepass id Prepass.union Prepass.in_module package_id top_env files
                (res, x), create l
            }
    create []

open Spiral.ServerUtils

type PackageName = string
type ModulePath = string
type PackageStream = EditorStream<Map<PackageName,DiffableFileHierarchy> * PackageName seq * ModuleTarget, PrepassTopEnv Promise option>
```

This typechecks.

Now the package stream should be a piece of cake. I just have to fold over all the elements in the sequence in turn and release the end result. Everything is set right now, but I think I'll leave the actual implementation for later.

Let me chill for a bit. Though it was not long, the morning session was good."

Update minikube dev tooling (#1906)

Needed to update minikube to Kubernetes 1.17.x and I figured I would
also go through the minikube dev experience and update it.

This includes:

* Switch to default to the Docker driver, since everyone should have
  Docker installed.
* Removing the Windows hacks, because they were awful and I feel bad I
  even wrote them in the first place.
* Migrate tooling to use new minikube functionality
* Update minikube commands to up to date release conformity.
* Updated the documentation

Work on #1824
