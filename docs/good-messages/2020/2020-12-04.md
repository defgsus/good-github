Added upcming events

Ran into some trouble where I almost deleted a whole 12 hours of work. My recovery might have messed somethings up, so if we see any weird issues, taht might be the cause. Sorry in advance!

(UPDATED: 11/13) When a user is not logged in and `auth` flag is `true`, they see "Log In" button:
<img width="1462" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-13 at 11 20 42 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6309723/99112404-7868dd00-25a2-11eb-9a14-cabe28b1203d.png">

QA Steps:
1. Pull this branch: `thuang-517-AuthN`
1. Run `npm start`
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/?auth=true&cc=true` to enable both flags
1. You should now see "Log In" and "Sign Up" buttons, and if you click on "Create Collection" button, you'll get the CTA
1. Now to simulate a logged in user's experience, I use [Requestly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly-redirect-url-mo/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa?hl=en) to modify the request header's `Cookie` to include my `dev` env cookies. Essentially you log in on dev cellxgene (https://api.cellxgene.dev.single-cell.czi.technology/dp/v1/login), and then inspect a request we send to BE, so you can cookie the request header `Cookie` field and paste that into Requestly rule, with `contains URL: api.cellxgene.dev.single-cell.czi.technology`. Press "Save"

    E.g., 

    **NOTE: Please check your `frontend/src/configs/configs.js` uses `API_URL: "https://api.cellxgene.dev.single-cell.czi.technology"` instead of the old `corpora` namespace**

1. Now activate Requestly like so:
    
    <img width="683" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-12 at 2 34 30 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6309723/99004597-3c773e80-24f4-11eb-92b6-e3f7436ec27e.png">

1. Refresh the page, and you should see all the logged in features!

1. Alternatively, you can also run local BE with `DEPLOYMENT_STAGE=test`! 

PTAL thanks all!

resolves #571

More useModels factoring. (#644)

This PR commits additional factoring the `useModels()` API to encapsulate more functionality. After this change we also capture code related to requesting predictions from the currently selected model.

This took a bit to put together due to the nuance of `React.useReducer()`.  There's a lot of glue here, the ultimate goal of which is to make the API provided by `useModels()` as easy for the end user to use.  While I don't love all the complexity behind the scenes, I do like the resulting API that the user interacts with.  All of the logic related to handling race conditions created by asynchronous behavior are taken care of transparently, so the user has a simple interface for display purposes.

I snuck in a few extra things too, sorry for the scope creep:

1. I added a top-level `<ErrorBoundary />`. When things `throw` in the actual model code things are caught an ok error message is displayed. It's better than the prior treatment -- a blank page.
2. I added a `<ModelSelect />` control to `tugboat`.

HOLY FUCK I FIGURED OUT THIS RIDICULOUS BUG FINALLY. The text blocks were jumping by just a bit every time you open the map text component, and it took me forever to figure out that on init the getRectBounds of the boundary element im doing the view child with does not initially return the right value because the entire page has not been rendered therefore for a split second the size of the boundary is a bit smaller causing the origin of the text to change. of course once the page renders the correcty value is calcluated and the block was jumping to the right origin. I figured out that instead of calling boundingRect on the viewchild reference, I could just directly reference the element style width and it will initially be the correct value. its a bit hacky to cut off the px and type cast to a number, but considering this is a multi day bug finally solved (havent even been able to reimplement alignment since the refactor) it is for sure okay. Oward with hooking up text size again
