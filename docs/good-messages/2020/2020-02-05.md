i forgot the carrot satchel

Oh I know Jeremy Harrington well, too well sadly He lived in a richer area of New York at one point. I bumped into him in a sandwich shop. He was shooting the shit with the sandwich maker when I came up to give my order. I got a standard turkey on wheat with mayo and pepper jack. It was something very simple. All the while Jerma was laughing to himself and pointing at me occasionally mumbling, "Is this guy serious?"

I wasn't sure why I guess he was displeased about me ordering or what I ordered. After I got my sandwich I sat down and ate while he just leaved back into the windowed meat display and watched me. When I got up to throw the trash away he stopped me and offered his hand. I was shy because I knew who he was but he introduced himself anyways. When I shook his hand the other hand came out of his pocket holding a tazer which he used on my neck. When I fell to the ground tense I soiled myself. He laughed, "This guy." And started kicking me in the face quoting videos over and over, "DON'T SAY SWEARS, DON'T SAY SWEARS."

I woke up in the hospital next to a vase of broccoli labeled, "From Jerma."

Now every year he shows up to my families Thanksgiving dinner, uninvited, unannounced, and just eats, laughs to himself, and then leaves. Last year he murdered my mother. I fear what hurricane Jerma will bring this year...

lua: fix highly security relevant arbitrary code execution bug

It appears Lua's package paths try to load .lua files from the current
working directory. Not only that, but also shared libraries.

  WHAT THE FUCK IS WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FUCKING DOING?

mpv isn't setting this package path; currently it's only extending it.
In any sane world, this wouldn't be a default. Most programs use
essentially random working directories and don't change it.

I cannot comprehend what bullshit about "convenience" or whatever made
them do something this broken and dangerous. Thousands of programs using
Lua out there will try to randomly load random code from random
directories.

In mpv's case, this is so security relevant, because mpv is normally
used from the command line, and you will most likely actually change
into your media directory or whatever with the shell, and play a file
from there. No, you don't want to load a (probably downloaded) shared
library from this directory if a script try to load a system lib with
the same name or so.

I'm not sure why LUA_PATH_DEFAULT in luaconf.h (both upstream and the
Debian version) put "./?.lua" at the end, but in any case, trying to
load a module that doesn't exist nicely lists all package paths in
order, and confirms it tries to load files from the working directory
first (anyone can try this). Even if it didn't, this would be
problematic at best.

Note that scripts are _not_ sandboxed. They're allowed to load system
libraries, which is also why we want to keep the non-idiotic parts of
the package paths.

Attempt to fix this by filtering out relative paths. This is a bit
fragile and not very great for something security related, but probably
the best we can do without having to make assumptions about the target
system file system layout. Also, someone else can fix this for Windows.

mpv in default configuration (i.e. no external scripts) is probably not
affected. All builtin scripts only "require" preloaded modules, which,
in a stroke of genius by the Lua developers, are highest priority in the
load order. Otherwise, enjoy your semi-remote code execution bug.

Completely unrelated this, I'm open for scripting languages and
especially implementations which are all around better than Lua, and are
suited for low footprint embedding.

"5:20pm. I had my ten minutes of fun.

Let me see what I can do about the parsing. After that no doubt I will have to debug the prepass and the partial evaluation after that. I probably won't manage it all today.

5:30pm.

```
let process_parser_exprs (exprs, in') (d : ParserEnv) =
    let f x s = match x with ParserExpr a -> l "" (unop ErrorNonUnit a) s | ParserStatement a -> a s
    match in' with
    | Some in' -> Ok(List.foldBack f exprs in')
    | None ->
        match List.rev exprs with
        | ParserStatement _ :: _ -> d.FailWith StatementLastInBlock
        | ParserExpr x :: xs -> Ok(List.fold (fun a b -> f b a) x xs)
        | [] -> failwith "impossible"

let rec indentations expr d =
    let i = col d
    let inline if_ op tr s = expr_indent i op tr s

    (many1 (if_ (=) expr) .>>. opt (if_ (<=) in_ >>. if_ (<=) (indentations expr)) >>= process_parser_exprs) d
```

Agh, I have no idea. For the time being, how about I just put `()` at the end? I will definitely come back to this as I will have to figure out why errors are not being propagated properly.

I want to see what errors are there in prepass and peval. If I am lucky maybe I will manage to get get the test to work in the next 30m. I doubt it though.

```
Error trace on line: 3, column: 1 in module test1.

Finally a sensible error.

5:30pm.

```

  prepass = 00:00:00.0009204
  peval = 00:00:00

Is it not present?

```
        match env.values.[x.name] with

```

Hmmm, it is empty?

```
{ keywords = Spiral.Prepass+KeywordEnv
  types = map [("test1", TModule (map []))]
  values = map [("test1", Module (map []))] }
```

What the hell? There is literally nothing in it.

```
let rec prepass_top (t_glob : Map<string,TExpr>) (v_glob : Map<string,Expr>) x =

Ah, it does not seem that I am actually using this function anywhere in the prepass.

        | RawB -> ()
        | _ -> failwith "Compiler error in prepass_top."
```

Ok, so what is it getting here?

```
Unhandled exception. System.Exception: Compiler error in prepass_top.

```

Ah, for fuck's sake.

```

                b.AppendFormat("Error: Local variable {0} shadows the global of the same name.", x) |> ignore
```

That would be this. And indeed I am using `to` in the core library.

Why are var positions not...

Ah, yes. I am only adding the vars to the dictionary. Not the bindings - because how could those ever raise an error. Like this apparently.

I am going to have to rename `to` to something else, as `to` is too frequently used in ranges.

```
    let pat_var = small_var' |>> fun x -> if is_box then PatBoxVar x else PatVar x
    let pat_active pattern = exclamation >>. ((small_var' |>> v) <|> rounds expr) .>>. pattern |>> PatActive
    let pat_union pattern = pipe2 big_var' (many ((small_var' |>> PatVar) <|> rounds pattern)) (fun a b -> PatUnion(a,b))
    let pat_value = (value_ |>> PatValue) <|> (def_value_ |>> PatDefaultValue)
    let pat_record_item pattern =
        let inline templ var k = pipe2 var (opt (eq' >>. pattern)) (fun a -> function Some b -> k(a,b) | None -> k(a,PatVar a))
        templ small_var' (fun (str,name) -> PatRecordMembersKeyword(str,name)) <|> templ (dollar >>. small_var') PatRecordMembersInjectVar
```

I should be using `small_var` instead of `small_var'` in quite a few places it seems.

```
    let pat_keyword_fun l = concat_keyword (fun str -> function Some pat -> pat | None -> PatVar str) l
    let pat_keyword pattern = many1 (keyword' .>>. opt pattern) |>> (pat_keyword_fun >> PatKeyword) <|> pattern
```

Right, I forgot about this. I really should be adding positional information everywhere.

5:50pm.

```

```

And I broke everything.

```
let expressions s = (expressions (raw_expr false) |> operators_unary |> application_tight |> application |> operators) s
```

Let me swap the precedence of unary operators and tight application.

In fact, maybe it would be good to just put unary operators into the expressions themselves.

6pm.

```
let inbuilt_op expr =
    (exclamationx4 >>. big_var) .>>. (rounds (sepBy1 (expr <|> (type' |>> RawType)) comma))
    >>= fun (a, b) d ->

let operators_unary expr =

        pipe2 (opt unary_op) expr (fun op e -> match op with Some op -> ap (v op) e | None -> e)
        |]

Would something like this be fine.

Now I am getting the prepass errors properly. Nice.

6:05pm.

What is this?

```
let def_value' x = ap (v "default_value") (lit_string x)
```

Hmmm, this is strange.

```
let def_value' x = RawDefaultValue x
```

Ok...let me add `RawDefaultValue`.

6:15pm. Done with that part. Now I am debugging partial eval errors.

```
    | UnitTest(a,on_succ,on_fail)->
        match v a with
        | TyB -> ev d on_succ
        | _ -> ev d on_fail
```

Here it is trying to access a null reference.

6:20pm. Ah, I get it. Shit. What is going on here is that it is expecting the unit to be in the first place, and is testing for it.

I'll fix this right away.

```
| Some (Inl(a,b)) ->
```

Rather than diving into this right away, what I should do is evaluate the application of this.

```
                let d : LangEnv = {
                    trace = []
                    seq = seq
                    cse = [Dictionary(HashIdentity.Structural)]
                    i = ref 0
                    env_global_type = [||]
                    env_global_value = [||]

                    env_stack_type_ptr = 0
                    env_stack_value = [||]
                    env_stack_value_ptr = 0
                    }

                let _ : Data = timeit timings.peval <| fun _ -> partial_eval_value dex d (Op(Apply,[|a;B|]))
```

Let me try doing it like this.

```

```

Wooooooooooooooo!!!

It finally works!!!

6:25pm. This is nice. Not only did I finish the core library, but I also got the first example to run.

Tomorrow I am going to see whether I can get rid of the need to append () at the end of every module, and after that I will continue with the further examples.

6:35pm. I've already wound down and am wondering whether I should put a few words in.

I've been thinking about math lately. I told myself never again, and indeed I am never touching pure math again.

When I am done with this whole Spiral thing in a year or two, what I should do is study physics. If I am going to break the backprop induced stalemate, I am going to need some inspiration, and what better way to get it than to study actual physical systems.

At this point I have programming mostly wrapped up.

Only ML is really giving me trouble and this whole thing is going to come to a head eventually.

Spiking NNs will be a battering ram once I get access to them, so I should make sure to aim it properly. This time. No more of the same embarrassing bullshit like in 2018 where I have enormous inspiration that just dies every time. Also no more schizophrenic pestering of various authors. I got my fill of that to last me a lifetime. I definitely regret that one.

6:40pm. For the next year or so, I'll aim to rescue Intel/some other random startup from having to write their libraries all in C.

For once I am going to have to get a job, no way around it, so the ideal outcome would be to get early access to these neurochips after Spiral is in a decent state. This would get me funds that I could not get through RL, the opportunity to upgrade my rig in addition to the those chips that I need, and would place the in the very near vicinity of where all this is going to blow up.

Fundamentally, since GPUs are a bust, these chips are what I should be playing with.

I need to absolutely aim for this.

Spiral v0.2 is what is going to get me through the door, so I should not hesitate to complete it."
