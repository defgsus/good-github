Remove Xcode project & Drop Carthage Support

Xcode has supported Swift Package Manager projects natively since Xcode
11, which has been out for over a year, where you can use Xcode by
having it open the `Package.swift` manifest rather than a `.xcodeproj`
or `.xcworkspace`.

I've been primarily developing SwiftLint in Xcode using this approach
for over a year, and despite a few nitpicks I have, it's been a joy to
use.

So I'd like to completely remove the Xcode project along with things
that support it:

* `SwiftLint.xcworkspace`/`SwiftLint.xcodeproj`: Neither of these are
  needed if we use `xed .` or `xed Package.swift` to develop SwiftLint
  in Xcode.
* `Cartfile`/`Cartfile.private`/`Cartfile.resolved`/`.gitmodules`/`Carthage/`:
  These were used to manage dependencies as git submodules for use in
  the Xcode workspace, but that's no longer necessary if Xcode delegates
  to SwiftPM to manage dependencies for us.
* Some scripts can be simplified, cleaned up or even completely removed.

* **Reduce duplication:** Rather than update dependencies or files in
  multiples places, there will only be the package manifest and the
  Podfile
* **Reduce merge conflicts:** This hasn't been too bad, but it's
  occasionally a pain when trying to land old PRs
* **Reduce development overhead:** No need to manually make sure that
  files in the Xcode project are sorted alphabetically
* **Reduce clone time:** No need to run
  `git submodules update --init --recursive` anymore

I think this breaks Carthage users that pull in SwiftLintFramework as a
dependency in a Cartfile.

However I can't find any references to [`SwiftLintFramework` in any
`Cartfile` files on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=swiftlintframework+filename%3ACartfile&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=)
so this doesn't appear to be worth continuing to maintain.

imgact_binmisc: limit the extent of match on incoming entries

imgact_binmisc matches magic/mask from imgp->image_header, which is only a
single page in size mapped from the first page of an image. One can specify
an interpreter that matches on, e.g., --offset 4096 --size 256 to read up to
256 bytes past the mapped first page.

The limitation is that we cannot specify a magic string that exceeds a
single page, and we can't allow offset + size to exceed a single page
either.  A static assert has been added in case someone finds it useful to
try and expand the size, but it does seem a little unlikely.

While this looks kind of exploitable at a sideways squinty-glance, there are
a couple of mitigating factors:

1.) imgact_binmisc is not enabled by default,
2.) entries may only be added by the superuser,
3.) trying to exploit this information to read what's mapped past the end
  would be worse than a root canal or some other relatably painful
  experience, and
4.) there's no way one could pull this off without it being completely
  obvious.

The first page is mapped out of an sf_buf, the implementation of which (or
lack thereof) depends on your platform.

ws error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8900

The Rust version requires access to port 8900. You'll get the error: "ws error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8900" if you run the rust version and the port forwarding is not set up. For completeness and to make the helloworld experience as error-free and troubleshoot-free as possible, I think we should add the port forwarding command to the installation instructions.
