Honestly should have commit more often because the amount of changes to the website are quite drastic.
Luckily the website is still pretty basic and not really a "for-production" codebase. In summary, I've been trying to update the site to be a fully fledged home page for Atheos and provide everything I feel users of Atheos would deserver. I've turned the website into more of a PHP router with markdown files and some probably stupid complex PHP action in the background. Hopefully this is a good direction, if not, I just wasted my time; no big deal. It's not a hard site to code for or make changes to. I'm sorry about not committing more often for each individual change.

locking/rwsem: Fix down_write_killable()

The new signal_pending exit path in __rwsem_down_write_failed_common()
was fingered as breaking his kernel by Tetsuo Handa.

Upon inspection it was found that there are two things wrong with it;

 - it forgets to remove WAITING_BIAS if it leaves the list empty, or
 - it forgets to wake further waiters that were blocked on the now
   removed waiter.

Especially the first issue causes new lock attempts to block and stall
indefinitely, as the code assumes that pending waiters mean there is
an owner that will wake when it releases the lock.

Complete more of the Half Dragon Fem quest.

Implement Candle Trees
-Plant type
-Humanoid torsos and heads
-Create swarms of flaming spheres to blow you up

Implement Switch Traps
-Monsters don't trigger them.
-Should difficult to impossible to destroy.
-Have case-specific effects.
--The only implemented case is oppening any artifact doors on a level for fem half dragon nobles.

Implement Painting Fragment entry method
-Invoke outside the quest to enter the quest.
-The quest departure portal will try to return you to the level you left from.
--I forsee no balance problems with this at all.
-Created instead of a portal when the branch placement function is called.

Implement magic breath/resistance for half dragons.
-Handling is complete but only female half dragon nobles can actually roll it.

Upper quest levels spawn wolves, candle trees, and dogs instead of normal monsters.

Male half dragons get human/vampire quest
