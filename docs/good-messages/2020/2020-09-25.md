c++: DECL_BUILTIN_P for builtins

We currently detect builtin decls via DECL_ARTIFICIAL &&
!DECL_HIDDEN_FUNCTION_P, which, besides being clunky, is a problem as
hiddenness is a property of the symbol table -- not the decl being
hidden.  This adds DECL_BUILTIN_P, which just looks at the
SOURCE_LOCATION -- we have a magic one for builtins.

One of the consequential changes is to make function-scope omp udrs
have function context (needed because otherwise duplicate-decls thinks
the types don't match at the point we check).  This is also morally
better, because that's what they are -- nested functions, stop lying.

(That's actually my plan for all DECL_LOCAL_DECL_P decls, as they are
distinct decls to the namespace-scope decl they alias.)

	gcc/cp/
	* cp-tree.h (DECL_BUILTIN_P): New.
	* decl.c (duplicate_decls): Use it.  Do not treat omp-udr as a
	builtin.
	* name-lookup.c (anticipated_builtin): Use it.
	(set_decl_context_in_fn): Function-scope OMP UDRs have function context.
	(do_nonmember_using_decl): Use DECL_BUILTIN_P.
	* parser.c (cp_parser_omp_declare_reduction): Function-scope OMP
	UDRs have function context.  Assert we never find a valid duplicate.
	* pt.c (tsubst_expr): Function-scope OMP UDRs have function context.
	libcc1/
	* libcp1plugin.cc (supplement_binding): Use DECL_BULTIN_P.

Fixes Sagaru

Ports the T language key from Virgo. I tried a few times to do a bigger refactor of saycode to bring it up to date but holy shit I'm not ready lmao.

say ",T Gold Ring for life."

Merge: Performance improvements.

This patchset brings some performance improvements and the addition of the LZO-RLE
algorithm to the kernel, also usable in zram (yup, tested, works but LZ4 is still ok for us).

The main performance improvement is for SWAP space: the locking has changed and
the swap cache is now split in 64MB trunks.
This gives us a reduction of the median page fault latency of 375%, from 15uS to 4uS,
and an improvement of 192% on the swap throughput (this includes "virtual" swap
devices, like zRAM!). The real world user experience improvement of this on a mobile
device is seen after a day or two of usage, where it usually starts losing just a little
performance due to the large amount of apps kept open in background: now I cannot
notice any more performance loss and the user experience is now basically the same as
if the phone was in its first 2 hours of boot life.

Other performance improvements include, in short:

    UDP v4/v6: 10% more performance on single RX queue
    Userspace applications will be faster when checking running time of threads
    2-5% improvements on heavy multipliers (yeah, not a lot, but was totally free...)
    Improvements on rare conditions during sparsetruncate of about 0.3% to a
    way more rare around 20% improvement (that's never gonna happen, but there
    is no performance drop anywhere).

Tested on SoMC Tama Akatsuki RoW
