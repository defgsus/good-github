Double checked that everything works. Deleted Kartik's additional surface coefficient block. This should be implemented in the class def/build script (using different coefficient values). I will finish this tomorrow evening. I will also be creating a test script that anyone who is about to push, needs to run before pushing to verify they didn't break shit. Have a good night fam :) JB

Grabbing Yourself + Wound Fixes: Take 2 (+Minor Scar Changes) (#52951)

By clicking yourself with grab intent while targeting a limb of yours that's bleeding, you'll "grab" onto it with your free hand to apply pressure. This takes 1.5 seconds to do, takes up a hand while you do so, and applies a slowdown while you're holding it. In return, that limb will bleed 30% less while you're holding it (though it won't clot any faster). This stacks with the 25% reduction in bleeding you get from being horizontal, so laying down clutching your gushing gut while waiting for help is now both thematic and viable!
Other fixes and changes

I also made some other changes to wounds of various importance. Here's a quick list

-Most wound treatments now respect thick clothing/materials, so you can no longer suture slashes through spacesuits.
-Using sutures on slashes and pierces now actually use up sutures, and regen mesh must be opened to treat wounds with
-Infectious zombies (romerol) can now be wounded as intended
-Coagulant has been nerfed again to reduce bleeding less for every wound it's reducing bleeding on. This'll still need more love and attention later, but I need to find a good middle point where medipens are good for bleeding in an emergency without being a way to sidestep any and all bleeding wounds in one go.
-I added a recipe for improvised coagulant in the Wounds 2 PR using baked pulped banana peels and salglu, but then realized that recipe sucked and was overly complicated. You can now drink straight up ground/juiced banana peels to help close up slashes and piercings. Yuckm!
-You can no longer repeatedly disembowel people who have already lost their internal organs
-Whetstones now make things edged sharp rather than pointy sharp, fixing a carryover from when sharpness = 2 used to be accurate sharpness. This'll have the effect of making sharpened weapons less sucky at chopping people apart since slashing is usually more devastating than piercing

I've also made a few tweaks to scars, mostly making them a bit smaller. It now takes twice as much scar severity to reach "absolutely fucked up" when examined, and the other steps have been raised a few points as well. Minor scar examine text is a tad smaller text-wise, and the precise locations for the scars are a bit more procedural as well (more location modifiers like upper/lower/inner/outer wrist/whatever). These changes will hopefully add a bit more variety to the scarring you see on random crew members, since it's pretty easy to hit max examine severity as is.
