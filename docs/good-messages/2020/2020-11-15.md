Million Mask March to take place on the day national lockdown rules come into force



Million Mask March to take place on the day national lockdown rules come into force

George MartinYahoo News UK1 November 2020
LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 5: Hundreds of demonstrators wearing Guy Fawkes masks gather on Bonfire Night in London's Trafalgar Square to take part in the annual 'Million Mask March'. The event is a part of a global anti-establishment and anti-capitalist protest against issues such as austerity, infringement of human rights, surveillance, politics and economics.

The Million Mask March is set to take place on the same day national lockdown rules come into force next week.

The annual event is described as a march “against austerity, the infringement of rights, war crimes, corrupt politicians and to reinstate liberty”, according to the Heart of London Business Alliance.

Last year’s march drew a crowd of around 2,500 people who walked from Trafalgar Square in the heart of London through central Westminster to the Houses of Parliament.

Crowds of protesters, wearing iconic “V for Vendetta” masks depicting Guy Fawkes, let of flares during last years event - with a number of police officers targeted with the pyrotechnics.

A post on the Heart of London Business Alliance’s website reads: “It is likely that smaller groups may try and splinter from the main march and cause disruption in various areas across central London.”

The march is expected to take place despite a nationwide lockdown coming into effect from Thurday 5 November onwards following Boris Johnson’s announcement yesterday.

Under the lockdown, people will be allowed to exercise and socialise in public spaces outside with their household or one other person.

But they will not be allowed to meet indoors or in private gardens, and they will only be allowed to travel to work if they cannot work from home.

The prime minister said the restrictions would end on December 2, when the Government would reintroduce local restrictions based on the latest data and trends.

Sage member Sir Jeremy Farrar suggested on Sunday that restrictions could be extended beyond the government's projected end date.

Major Change of 2.0.0B Handlers.

It is latest Handlers(requiring obfuscate). There I added crawl-on-button support , nicer and separate animation for crawling , deleted old hitbox code and introduced new ones(now, when sneaking, hitbox height decreases to 1.5 block and may not decrease if SNEAKING_TOGGLE is false; when swimming or crawling, hibox decreases to 0.6 height and player may not be shot easily while crawling behind 1 block wall or swimming. Though, there still are troubles with speed(player like soldier crawls faster when not under block, looks funny) and networking. Networking issue is that when one player at server presses crawl button, others get hitbox and animation of crawling at button pressor's client , but other player's gameplay is not affected, thus it is only cosmetic issue and looks very funny(imagine crawling player jumping parkour or digging 1x2 tunnel). However, when one player has real reason to crawl - e.g. block over him/her, his hitbox and animation are shown correctly. Anyways, thanks to Kaydax and bagu_chan for such a great job.

Solution for problem Boy or Girl Codeforces

Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

Input
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

Output
If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).

Examples
input
wjmzbmr
output
CHAT WITH HER!
input
xiaodao
output
IGNORE HIM!
input
sevenkplus
output
CHAT WITH HER!
Note
For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in "wjmzbmr". These characters are: "w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r". So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print "CHAT WITH HER!".

[MIRROR] Market crash and inflation works on prices uniformly. (#1698)

* Market crash and inflation works uniformly. (#54966)

The market crash event, and by proxy just regular inflation values were being applied to objects with custom prices and custom premium prices. Makes sense, this was a pain in the ass to get working originally across the top of the base prices.
...However, it seems that I forgot to apply that to the uh... base prices of vending, meaning that you had hilariously overpriced vendors on top of completely base prices.

* Market crash and inflation works on prices uniformly.
