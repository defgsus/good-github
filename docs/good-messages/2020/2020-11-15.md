Fix 2tap2wake after Ambient Pulsing on some devices

like taimen and walleye, instead sunfish (and probably newer pixels)
doesn't need this

To apply, override the config_has_weird_dt_sensor bool in the device tree

----
TL;DR
for some reason, on taimen and walleye, after ambient pulsing
gets triggered by adb with the official "com.android.systemui.doze.pulse"
intent or by our custom "wake to ambient" features, the double tap
sensor dies if you follow this steps:
- screen is OFF
- trigger ambient pulsing with a double tap to wake (if custom wake to
  ambient feature is enabled), or the official intent by adb, or with
  music ticker or any other event
- after ambient display shows up, don't touch anything and wait till the
  screen goes OFF again
- double tap to wake, again
- the double tap sensor doesn't work at all and device doesn't wake up

Now, funny thing, after the steps above, if you cover then uncover the
proximity/brightness sensor with the hand, then double tap to wake
again, the wake gesture works as expected.

When covering/uncovering the proximity/brightness sensor, this happens:
11-10 22:02:00.916   967   998 I ASH     : @ 1993.460: ftm4_disable_sensor: disabling sensor [double-tap]
11-10 22:02:02.013   967   998 I ASH     : @ 1994.556: ftm4_enable_sensor: enabling sensor [double-tap]

When you switch screen ON with power button, the doze screen states do
the same: the sensor gets disabled then enabled again if device goes
to DOZE idle state.

Instead, after Ambient pulsing, when the pulsing finishes, the sensor
is still enabled, so the disable/enable event doesn't happen this
time. And that's why, for some reason, it doesn't respond anymore.
----

So, in a nutshell: i've no idea why this sh#t happens lol,
but with a super lazy hacky tricky dirty bloody nooby line change,
we can force the sensor disable/enable event when the device goes
to DOZE state.
