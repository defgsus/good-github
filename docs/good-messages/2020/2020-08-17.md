Data::Dumper (XS): use mortals to prevent leaks if magic throws

For example:

  use Tie::Scalar;
  use Data::Dumper;
  sub T::TIESCALAR { bless {}, shift}
  sub T::FETCH { die }
  my $x;
  tie $x, "T" or die;
  while(1) {
      eval { () = Dumper( [ \$x ] ) };
  }

would leak various work SVs.

I start a new scope (ENTER/LEAVE) for most recursive DD_dump() calls
so that the work SVs don't accumulate on the temps stack, for example
if we're dumping a large array we'd end up with several SVs on the
temp stack for each member of the array.

The exceptions are where I don't expect a large number of unreleased
temps to accumulate, as with scalar or glob refs.

fix Eval Pane2 arrow spacing for dance solo

She seemed painfully sober. I observed quietly from my seat a few rows
back.

Her stable gait and shoulder propped up the visibly shaky lurch of her
painfully drunk friend as they slowly climbed into the midnight R-Route
taking us off-campus. She helped her sit down and asked if she thought
she'd be able to make it home?

Her friend groaned insensibly, head in hands.

They couldn't have appeared more different. She was dressed for the 20F
chill, bundled in a long coat and scarf. Her friend was dressed for a
night of clubbing, more skin exposed than covered. "Do you think you'll
be able to make it home?" she asked again. Her friend, slumped in the
seat, suddenly lurched forward, heaving, and she grabbed the nearby
waste bin for her just in time.

"That's disgusting," the bus driver growled. "No one wants to see that."

"I'm sorry, sir," she quivered, keeping her eyes on her still-vomiting
friend. "I'm just trying to get my friend home safely for the night."

"You're not sorry, otherwise you wouldn't have let her do that."

"I'm sorry, sir." she repeated, still focused intently on her friend. I
tried to not stare, to focus my attention out the window, but I felt
strongly drawn their interactions. It seemed as though some unit of
humanity was unfolding before me.

How did they know each other? I wasn't used to seeing pairs on buses so
unequally intoxicated. Everything about them seemed so wildly different.
Maybe it was only the one's altered state.

And I knew, very suddenly, that I was watching my own friends take care
of me, watch over me, carry me through my sadness.

For a moment I understood both their struggles, wants, frustrations, and
raw tenderness from my seat, a few rows back.

"9:45am. I am up. Let me chill for a while and I will start. I keep going to bed really late, as if I am not happy to end the day at 9-10pm. At least I am sleeping well.

9:55am. Let me waste some time.

10:10am. Ok, focus. I just need to finish the typechecker. Let me go through this last case and then I am done with the tedious stuff. It will be time for the next phase after that.

```fs
if has_forall then
```

Finishing this case will give me strength. I will no longer have to dwell on the typechecker core. After I deal with this, it is time for the editor support parts.

10:20am. I am still groggy, but I've pried myself off from distractions. Let me dwell on it just a bit.

It is so harsh. It is so tedious. So I need to really bring out the feeling of wanting to deal with typechecking.

10:30am. I am just sitting here listening to music and thinking. Right now I still haven't overcome my feeling of sleepiness.

10:35am. Do I finish it right here?

This last case is what divides the really hard parts from the smooth sailing up ahead. Do I want to break free of the storm and take the seas that rightfully belong to me?

10:45am. Let me do it. I will just focus on this and only this until it is done. Forget the later parts. They are just a burden. The future me can tackle that.

Spiral v0.2 will be something that I will be using for the remainder of my time as human. I won't get anywhere with any other language. Spiral is my current burden and my future power.

After I finish it I will get my hands on those chips and draw out their true power. This is something no other person will be able to do at my level. I will have the advantage that I seek in such a context.

11:30am.

```fs
        | RawMatch(_,(RawForall _ | RawFun _) & body,[PatVar(_,name), on_succ]) ->
            incr scope
            let vars,body = foralls_get body
            let vars = List.map typevar_to_var vars
            let body_var = fresh_var()
            term {env with ty = List.fold (fun s x -> Map.add x.name (TyVar x) s) env.ty vars} body_var body
            let env = {env with term = Map.add name (generalize vars body_var) env.term }
            decr scope
            term env s on_succ
```

I made a mistake here. Generalize should be done in the raised scope.

```fs
                match annotations_get l with
                | Ok (l' : (string * Var list * T) list) ->
                    let env =
                        List.fold (fun s (a,vars,b) ->
                            let b = List.foldBack (fun a b -> TyForall(a,b)) vars b
                            Map.add a b s
                            ) env.term l'
                        |> fun term -> { env with term = term }
                    List.iter2 (fun (_,_,body) (_,_,s) -> term env s body) l l'
                    env
                | Error er -> errors.AddRange er; env
```

This seems decent enough for this.

Now I just need to implement `annotations_get`.

...Let me do it. I will do this and then I will be done.

```fs
let rec let_join_point = function
    | RawFun(r,l) -> RawFun(r,List.map (fun (a,b) -> a, let_join_point b) l)
    | x -> RawJoinPoint(range_of_expr x, x)
```

Oh yeah, let me also fold the join points inside annotations.

```fs
let rec let_join_point = function
    | RawFun(r,l) -> RawFun(r,List.map (fun (a,b) -> a, let_join_point b) l)
    | RawAnnot(r,a,b) -> RawAnnot(r,let_join_point a,b)
    | x -> RawJoinPoint(range_of_expr x, x)
```

12pm.

```fs
                let l' =
                    let errors = ResizeArray()
                    let rec get s = function
                        | RawFun(_,[(PatAnnot(_,_,t) | PatDyn(_,PatAnnot(_,_,t))),body]) -> get (t :: s) body
                        | RawFun(_,[pat,body]) -> errors.Add(range_of_pattern pat, ExpectedAnnotation); get s body
                        | RawFun(r,_) -> errors.Add(r, ExpectedSinglePattern); s
                        | RawAnnot(_,_,t) -> t :: s
                        | x -> errors.Add(range_of_expr x,ExpectedAnnotation)
                    let annots = List.map (fun (_,_,body) -> get [] body) l
```

I am doing it inline.

12:15pm.

```fs
                    let annots : T list =
                        List.map (fun (_,vars,body) ->
                            let vars = vars |> List.map (fun (r,(name,kind)) -> {scope= !scope; } )
                            get [] body |> eval_annot) l
```

Ah, goddamit. Didn't I make a function to convert `TypeVars` to `Vars` somewhere?

```fs
let var_of (name,kind) = {scope=0; constraints=Set.empty; kind=kind; name=name}
```

Ah, yes this. Right now I am having great difficulty with this particular case, and the season for that is because I am hacking things up.

I feel like I am on the wrong path.

```fs
                let l' =
                    let errors = ResizeArray()
                    let rec get s = function
                        | RawFun(_,[(PatAnnot(_,_,t) | PatDyn(_,PatAnnot(_,_,t))),body]) -> get (t :: s) body
                        | RawFun(_,[pat,body]) -> errors.Add(range_of_pattern pat, ExpectedAnnotation); get s body
                        | RawFun(r,_) -> errors.Add(r, ExpectedSinglePattern); s
                        | RawAnnot(_,_,t) -> t :: s
                        | x -> errors.Add(range_of_expr x,ExpectedAnnotation); s
                    let eval_annot = failwith ""
                    let annots : T list =
                        List.map (fun (_,vars,body) ->
                            let vars = vars |> List.map (fun (r,(name,kind)) -> {scope= !scope; } )
                            get [] body |> eval_annot) l
                    failwith ""

                match l' with
                | Ok (l' : (string * Var list * T) list) ->
                    let env =
                        List.fold (fun s (a,vars,b) ->
                            let b = List.foldBack (fun a b -> TyForall(a,b)) vars b
                            Map.add a b s
                            ) env.term l'
                        |> fun term -> { env with term = term }
                    List.iter2 (fun (_,_,body) (_,_,s) -> term env s body) l l'
                    env
                | Error er -> errors.AddRange er; env
```

Let me back this up here.

```fs
            let l, has_forall =
                List.mapFold (fun has_forall ((_,a),b) ->
                    let vars, body = foralls_get b
                    (a, vars, body), has_forall || (List.isEmpty vars = false)
                    ) false l
```

Let me do this differently.

12:20pm. No actually, let me just take a break here."

Another Card Game Problem 

Chef is playing a card game with his friend Rick Sanchez. He recently won against Rick's grandson Morty; however, Rick is not as easy to beat. The rules of this game are as follows:
     1. The power of a positive integer is the sum of digits of that integer. For example, the power of 13 is 1+3=4.
     2. Chef and Rick receive randomly generated positive integers. For each player, let's call the integer he received final power.
     3. The goal of each player is to generate a positive integer such that its power (defined above) is equal to his final power.
     4. The player who generated the integer with fewer digits wins the game. If both have the same number of digits, then Rick cheats and wins the game.
You are given the final power of Chef PC and the final power of Rick PR. Assuming that both players play optimally, find the winner of the game and the number of digits of the integer he generates.

Update to v084r01 release.

I rewrote the S-SMP processor core (implementation of the 256 opcodes),
utilizing my new 6502-like syntax. It matches what bass v05r01 uses.
Took 10 hours.
Due to being able to group the "mov reg,mem" opcodes together with
"adc/sbc/ora/and/eor/cmp" sets, the total code size was reduced from
55.7KB to 42.5KB for identical accuracy and speed.
I also dropped the trick I was using to pass register variables as
template arguments, and instead just use a switch table to pass them as
function arguments. Makes the table a lot easier to read.

Passes all of my S-SMP tests, and all of blargg's
arithmetic/cycle-timing S-SMP tests. Runs Zelda 3 great as well. Didn't
test further.
This does have the potential to cause some regressions if I've messed
anything up, and none of the above tests caught it, so as always,
testing would be appreciated.

Anyway, yeah. By writing the actual processor with this new mnemonic
set, it confirms the parallels I've made.
My guess is that Sony really did clone the 6502, but was worried about
legal implications or something and changed the mnemonics last-minute.

(Note to self: need to re-enable snes.random before v085 official.)

EDIT: oh yeah, I also commented out the ALSA snd_pcm_drain() inside
term(). Without it, there is a tiny pop when the driver is
re-initialized. But with it, the entire emulator would lock up for five
whole seconds waiting on that call to complete. I'll take the pop any
day over that.

Update to v084r07 release.

byuu says:

Added the new super-fast XML parser. So far, the shaders, cheat files,
and cheat database have been updated to allow XML mode once again. Which
is sure to please Screwtape =)
So it's down to just the cartridge mapping files now, which are always
a major pain.

I still think BML is better for parsing simplicity, memory usage, disk
size, lack of red tape and speed (but horrendously bad for ease of
creating files manually), but since the base API is identical, there's
no reason not to support both. Especially since the pixel shaders have
kind of taken on a life of their own.

Update to v085r04 release.

byuu says:

Changelog:
- added base/ folder
- base/base.hpp defines the version number for all UI targets, all the
  varint-types, and a hook() class for debugger functions (see below)
- fixed compatibility profile compilation
- removed within<> template from the SNES target
- the SNES core can be built without Game Boy support now, if you so
  choose (my SNES debugger is not going to support debugging the GBZ80,
  sorry.)
- added ui-debugger; not at all useful right now, will be a long while
  to get something usable ready

So hook is a class wrapper around nall::function. It allows you to
invoke potentially empty functions (and as such, the return type must
have a trivial constructor.)
It also doesn't actually perform the test+invocation when DEBUGGER
(options=debugger) is not defined. So you should have no overhead in
regular builds.
The core classes now have a subclass with all the debugging hooks, so
you'll see eg:

    void CPU::op_step() {
      debugger.op_exec(regs.pc);
      (this->*opcode_table[op_read()])();
    }

Clear what it's doing, clear what it's for. A whole lot less work than
inheriting the whole CPU core and virtualizing the functions we want to
hook.
All the logic for what to do inside these callbacks will be handled by
individual debuggers, so they can have all the functionality they want.

buffers: urgent quality switch don't interrupt pushing operations

-- Overview --

There was a sort of race condition in the code which could lead to
downloaded segments being immediately replaced once the adaptative
logic decided to urgently switch the current quality.

That problem is a little hard to explain as it necessitates a lot of
context.
I will try to be as descriptive as possible in the next lines.

-- Source of the problem: Low-latency support --

Since we added low-latency content support, we updated the behavior of a
module called the `SegmentInventory` (which stores information about the
currently loaded segments). This module allows to let the rest of the
code know which segments has currently been pushed to a SourceBuffer.

Low-latency contents often rely on segment being subdivided into
multiple chunks.
For this reason, most of the RxPlayer's code now consider that one
segment may contain multiple chunks - even if we're not playing a
low-latency content.

Because a segment which has not been completely loaded (e.g. it's
associated HTTP request has been interrupted before it completed) might
need to be re-loaded from scratch once we encounter it again, the
`SegmentInventory` makes a difference between a "partially-loaded"
segment and a "complete" segment (i.e. a segment for which all chunks
have been loaded).

When the `RepresentationBuffer` - the module deciding which segments to
download - asks which segments have already been loaded, it filters out
partially-loaded segments to load them again if they are needed again.

It is also the `RepresentationBuffer` which indicates to the
`SegmentInventory` (indirectly) when a segment has been completely
loaded.
It does so by calling a specific method, `endOfSegment` once the
segment has been completely loaded. That method does not mark the
corresponding segment as complete in the `SegmentInventory` right
away: It waits until all the corresponding chunks have been pushed to
the SourceBuffer.
This way, if any push order for chunks of that segment is interrupted,
the segment will not be marked as a complete segment.

-- ABRManager's urgent quality switch --

For now, all is well, but there is another element in the mix: the
`ABRManager`.

The `ABRManager` decides which quality should be downloaded.
When a segment request ends, network metrics are emitted.
Based on those, the `ABRManager` gives recommendations through events
indicating, between other things, the `Representation` we should switch
to and an associated "urgency" with which the player should switch to
it.

There's two urgency level, the rest of the RxPlayer's logic handles
each one of them in a different way:

  1. _non-urgent_: the RxPlayer will wait until the current
     `RepresentationBuffer` has finished pending request(s) and pushed
     the corresponding chunks before creating a new
     `RepresentationBuffer` linked to the new `Representation`.

  2. _urgent_: here the RxPlayer will stop directly the
     `RepresentationBuffer` from what it was doing, and directly replace
     it by a new one linked to the new `Representation`.

-- The problem --

The problem become apparent once we resume everything that is going on
once a segment's request is finished:

  1. The `RepresentationBuffer` calls the `endOfSegment` method, which
     will mark the corresponding segment as "complete" once every push
     operations for chunk(s) of that segment (operations which might
     still be pending) are finished.

  2. Network metrics are sent to the ABRManager, which may now decides
     that the RxPlayer should switch to another Representation urgently.

  3. When an "urgent" switch happens the RxPlayer interrupts everything
     the `RepresentationBuffer` was doing and create a new one.

     Every operations scheduled by the previous RepresentationBuffer
     (such as pushing chunks or even an `endOfSegment` call is
     interrupted).

  4. The new RepresentationBuffer will look at currently loaded segments
     and decide that those not marked as "complete" should be
     re-downloaded.

Here, an urgent `Representation` switch can happen really close to the
time at which a segment is marked as "complete".

If we're not lucky (and most of the time, we're not), the previous
`RepresentationBuffer` will be killed before the last loaded segment has
been marked as "complete", even if all the corresponding chunks have
already been loaded, or even if the last chunk is being pushed (which is
a shame, considering the short amount of time it takes to push a
segment).

Because of that, it might be re-loaded by the new
`RepresentationBuffer`, which might lead to a waste of bandwidth and of
time.

-- The solution brought here --

This is a first solution to that problem, albeit not the most performant
one.

Where before an "urgent" `Representation` switch just directly
interrupted (or as we wrote, "killed") the current
`RepresentationBuffer`, now it ""gently"" indicates to it that it should
terminate what it does as soon as possible.

This is basically not too different to a non-urgent switch where the
`RepresentationBuffer` also decides when to finish. The only difference
is that an urgent switch will lead the `RepresentationBuffer` to
interrupts pending HTTP requests (but not other pending operations).

Both type of urgency are communicated to the `RepresentationBuffer`
through the same Observable, `terminate$` (exact same that is used
previously for non-urgent switched), which now emits a boolean property,
`urgent`:

  - if set to `true`, the `RepresentationBuffer` will interrupt the
    current HTTP requests, but will not interrupt the current push
    operations, nor the awaiting `endOfSegment` operations.

  - if set to `false`, we're in a non-urgent case. Here, the
    `RepresentationBuffer` keep the same behavior as before: it waits
    until the current segment request finishes and until it has
    completely pushed the corresponding segment.

-- The problem with that solution --

However, this solution has a minor problem.

In the RxPlayer, we try to optimize the time at which segment requests
are done.

With this fix, we might have a small time where no segment is being
downloaded (despite being needed) because we are waiting on previous
push/`endOfSegment` operations from the previous `RepresentationBuffer`.

A more performant operation would begin the new segment requests right
away, while still pushing the segments from the previous
`RepresentationBuffer`.

However this has not been done yet as:

  1. This would be much harder to implement on the current code:

       - When killing a `RepresentationBuffer`, we should not interrupt
         its current SourceBuffer operations.

       - The new `RepresentationBuffer` would need a way to tell that
         chunks from the old `RepresentationBuffer` are being pushed, so
         that it avoids loading them again.

   2. A push operation only takes around 15ms maximum on my computer,
      which is not that long (even if we might have different results on
      other devices) to wait before switching the
      `RepresentationBuffer`.

loop: destructuring: replace MAPCAR with a DO* loop

Simple MAPCAR must be replaced by a slightly more complicated DO, because the
list may not be a proper list. I want to dedicate this ballad to myself.

    This is a tale of a sorry quest
    To master pure code at the T guru's behest
    I enrolled in a class that appealing did seem
    For it promised to teach fine things like T3 and Scheme

    The first day went fine; we learned of cells
    And symbols and lists and functions as well
    Lisp I had mastered and excited was I
    For to master T3 my hackstincts did cry

    I sailed through the first week with no problems at all
    And I even said "closure" instead of "function call"
    Then said the master that ready were we
    To start real hacking instead of simple theory

    Will you, said he, write me a function please
    That in lists would associate values with keys
    I went home and turned on my trusty Apollo
    And wrote a function whose definition follows:

        (cdr (assq key a-list))

    A one-liner I thought, fool that I was
    Just two simple calls without a COND clause
    But when I tried this function to run
    CDR didn't think that NIL was much fun

    So I tried again like the good King of yore
    And of code I easily generated some more:

        (cond ((assq key a-list) => cdr))

    It got longer but purer, and it wasn't too bad
    But then COND ran out and that was quite sad

    Well, that isn't hard to fix, I was told
    Just write some more code, my son, be bold
    Being young, not even a moment did I pause
    I stifled my instincts and added a clause

        (cond ((assq key a-list) => cdr)
              (else nil))

    Sometimes this worked and sometimes it broke
    I debugged and prayed and even had a stroke
    Many a guru tried valiantly to help
    But undefined datums their efforts did squelch.

    I returneth once more to the great sage of T
    For no way out of the dilemma I could see
    He said it was easy -- more lines must I fill
    with code, for FALSE was no longer NIL.

        (let ((val (assq key a-list)))
           (cond (val (cdr val))
                 (else nil)))

    You'd think by now I might be nearing the end
    Of my ballad which seems bad things to portend
    You'd think that we could all go home scot-free
    But COND eschewed VAL; it wanted #T

    So I went back to the master and appealed once again
    I said, pardon me, but now I'm really insane
    He said, no you're not really going out of your head
    Instead of just VAL, you must use NOT NULL instead

        (let ((val (assq key a-list)))
           (cond ((not (null? val)) (cdr val))
                 (else nil)))

    My song is over and I'm going home to bed
    With this ineffable feeling that I've been misled
    And just in case my point you have missed
    Somehow I preferred (CDR (ASSQ KEY A-LIST))
