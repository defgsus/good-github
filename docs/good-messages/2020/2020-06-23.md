ARROW-8993: [Rust] support reading non-seekable sources

A proposal of an implementation to read `json.gz` files. The idea is to along `.json` files, support gziped ones.

The implementation of `json::ReadBuilder` heavily rely on `File`. My first approach would have been to make another version of the builder that would rely on a `BufReader<Box<dyn Read>>` and have the original one delegate to this the final build.

I went with another approach, in this case I've added an option to specify if the file is gziped or not. In this case, the original implementation works as defined, however requires a switch of type as per https://github.com/apache/arrow/compare/master...zeapo:feature/json-gzip?expand=1#diff-3fa6fc3c0ee201f5a3a1a5d25d0062ffR966-R967

I've got no religion on this. Suggestions are welcome, to be honest, I would love that the `infer_json_schema` be public , which would make all of this code unnecessary as it would delegate the builder process to the users who care about these features.

3 options :)

Closes #7309 from zeapo/feature/json-gzip

Revert "kernel/printk: add kmsg SEEK_CUR handling"

This reverts commit 8ece3b3eb576a78d2e67ad4c3a80a39fa6708809.

This commit broke userspace. Bash uses ESPIPE to determine whether or
not the file should be read using "unbuffered I/O", which means reading
1 byte at a time instead of 128 bytes at a time. I used to use bash to
read through kmsg in a really quite nasty way:

    while read -t 0.1 -r line 2>/dev/null || [[ $? -ne 142 ]]; do
       echo "SARU $line"
    done < /dev/kmsg

This will show all lines that can fit into the 128 byte buffer, and skip
lines that don't. That's pretty awful, but at least it worked.

With this change, bash now tries to do 1-byte reads, which means it
skips all the lines, which is worse than before.

Now, I don't really care very much about this, and I'm already look for
a workaround. But I did just spend an hour trying to figure out why my
scripts were broken. Either way, it makes no difference to me personally
whether this is reverted, but it might be something to consider. If you
declare that "trying to read /dev/kmsg with bash is terminally stupid
anyway," I might be inclined to agree with you. But do note that bash
uses lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR)==>ESPIPE to determine whether or not it's
reading from a pipe.
