Entities, Projectiles, and the crushing weight of mortality

Vox
Some basic ISS like station modules have been constructed, so that I can start making some basic prototype environments in the expMechanics scene.

Entity Modules
Moved from Controller/Scripts/Modules to Players/Scripts/Modules.

EntitySpawner
Spawner for entities, currently not built as an abstract base for a variety of different spawners (which it will become). Spawns entities over time, with increasing rapidity as more entities are spawned.

PointVolume
Abstract structure (to be renamed with the appropriate A____ nomenclature, sorry) for returning a point / direction, currently used for spawners.

PointCircle
Returns points within a circle, inside an outer radius, and outside an inner radius, with no safety checks for making sure the inner radius is validly less than the outer radius.
The direction always points towards the middle of the volume.

PRRandomisePlanet
Implemented the new (way old by now) prepass shader structure for final planet material, and all the complicated parameterisation that was necessary to capture and correctly implement that behaviour, including the atmosphere, which is not modular in the PR version.

FactionDef
Now has helpers for determining hostility between factions.

Entity
Exposes its faction def, and has more smarts when retrieving its ship or faction def.

AI
AIFighter -> Very silly, very basic AI for fighter style ai.
AITurret -> Very simple AI for turret style ai.
AITargetting -> Manages synchronising targets and locking on, such that in the event no faction targets exist entities will search for nearby targets, updating the faction targets as they do so (This is papered in for now, will have significantly more sophisticated algorithms for synchronising local to factional targets).

AimModule
Stores lock ons for entities.

HeatInstance
Like DamageInstance this stores the data for a particular instance of heat damage.

StructuralModule
Tracks heat, deals damage based on it, and correctly determines when an entity should die.

ShipDef
Now supports an OnDeath event, including the ability to spawn projectiles on death.
IsTurret flag for turrets, which are not playable (sadness), but are still ships from the games perspective.

BeamModule
Properly determines impacts, cutting the beam short, and allowing for impact based game objects to be enabled and placed at the target position.

ExplosionModule
Like PlasmaModule this manages the specifics of an explosion.

Modules in General
Better support for initialisation of state correctly, still has some problems (first projectiles are almost always instantiated incorrectly).

ProximityModule
Looks for proximity based on hostility conditions and search range. (Only supports one per projectile for now, should support multiple eventually).

ProjectileDef
OnHit -> ProjectileEventHitDef
OnProximity -> ProjectileEventProximityDef
OnDeath -> ProjectileEventDef

ProjectileEventDef
Basic definition of an event that can occur on projectiles, namely the instantiate of projectiles, entities, and the destruction of the original projectile.
Has specialisations for hits and for proximity.

ProjectileEventHitDef
Adds support for applying HeatInstnce/DamageInstance to entities based on how they determine impacts (either collision by default, or via special definition BEAMS).

AimUtilities
Functions for determining aim based on the kind of movement being used for an object to determine how best to aim to hit another object (simple for now).

ShipEventDef
Refer to ProjectileEventDef.

SkillSequenceItem
Supports aiming projectiles at the parent entities targets, sorted by proximity.

"In 'the old days' (before computers with almost unlimited computational power were available), the statistical analysis of data was typically restricted to hypothesis tests... The advent of powerful computers has changed the game. Nowadays, the analysis of statistical data is (or at least should be) a highly interactive process: you look at the data, and generate models which may explain your data. Then you determine the best fit parameters for these models, and check these models, typically by looking at the residuals. If you are not happy with the results, you modify the model to improve the correspondence between models and data." p.121 - An Introduction to Statistics with Python With Applications in the Life Sciences by Thomas Haslwanter

Why Python?
From: https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/intro.html#why-python

Get data (simulation, experiment control),
Manipulate and process data,
Visualize results, quickly to understand, but also with high quality figures, for reports or publications.
Python’s strengths

Batteries included - Rich collection of already existing bricks of classic numerical methods, plotting or data processing tools. We don’t want to re-program the plotting of a curve, a Fourier transform or a fitting algorithm. Don’t reinvent the wheel!
Easy to learn - Most scientists are not payed as programmers, neither have they been trained so. They need to be able to draw a curve, smooth a signal, do a Fourier transform in a few minutes.
Easy communication - To keep code alive within a lab or a company it should be as readable as a book by collaborators, students, or maybe customers. Python syntax is simple, avoiding strange symbols or lengthy routine specifications that would divert the reader from mathematical or scientific understanding of the code.
Efficient code - Python numerical modules are computationally efficient. But needless to say that a very fast code becomes useless if too much time is spent writing it. Python aims for quick development times and quick execution times.
Universal - Python is a language used for many different problems. Learning Python avoids learning a new software for each new problem.
Please read Python Notes 1 and the first two pages of Python Notes 2. Prepare a new Colab Notebook and copy all of the relevant material from the python notes files to your new Colab notebook. Think of the notebook as a quick access cheat sheet / recipe guide.
