summary of sofia the first

"Sofia the First" is set in the storybook world of Enchancia and tells the story of Princess Sofia, an adventurous little girl who is learning how to adjust to royal life after her mom marries the king and she becomes a princess overnight. Upon moving into the castle to live with her new family including her step-father, King Roland II, and step-siblings, Amber and James, Sofia quickly discovers that looking like a princess isn't all that difficult, but possessing the characteristics of a true princess - honesty, loyalty, courage, independence, compassion and grace - is what makes one truly royal. Helping her in her journey are the three headmistresses of Royal Prep Academy - Fauna, Flora and Merryweather (the beloved fairies seen in Disney's classic "Sleeping Beauty"); the royal steward, Baileywick; and a group of cute woodland creatures led by a wise-talking rabbit named Clover. Classic Disney Princesses make special appearances in event episodes to offer Sofia words of wisdom - princess to princess.

almost there

I am almost there. I am able to get an answer so far. The logic that I written seems sound enough to me. I need to review my new way of finding the extra bit of segment to add or remove. Also need to figure out how to get the stupid 0,0 coordinate out of the points on interest. That shit is annoying.

"9am. So yesterday was as usual till 9pm, but then I started stuying stock charts for the next 2.5 hours again.

There are some things that will remain etched in my memory. Russia, emerging markets and China in the 00s. Short volatility after the 2008 crash. The IBB move in the 10s. US tech stocks after the crash in general. That last one is still ongoing.

I mean, just how stupid I am? Put up a monthly chart of the things I've talked about and you will see huge, persistent upward trends. Even child could have bought and held this. Yet, I could not. When I tried it with real money for two years between 2012-2014 I did jack despite studying it for 4 years before that. I learned jack.

The reason I could not win in the market was purely because of my lackluster character. My desire pushed me towards seeking an perfect system, so I ignored all the good ideas during that time. That was my undoing. I let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

9:10am. Take any of those charts, look at the dailies and you will see large moves against the trend. Because I sought perfection, and because I sought to protect my own time, I lived day to day instead of month to month. Because of that whenever there was danger I ran, and wasted my energy.

9:15am. Take a look at IBB during the period of 8-5 years ago. I was there, and I observed how resilient it acted during downturns past its breakout points. I conjectured it would be a good buy, but something like buying and holding an ETF position of 3 years - I never could have made such a move.

Imagine if I was present during the early 00s bear market. I could have observed the Russian market's incredible resilience during that period, but even if its behavior in September 2001 was a screaming buy, I could never have held on.

9:20am. Past 2014, I did not need any great insight on how to get better as a trader. I only had to reflect on my behavior for a while.

Right now, what are the huge points of interest? In one of the previous entries I mentioned long `QQQ`, but now that I've actually studied the market for a while, I'd definitely leave those aside and focus on more niche areas. `ARKK` is a definite interest of mine.

The power move though, would be to buy into `TAN` or `ICLN`.

Right now, the market has risen for a long while. For all I know it might top and start a new bear market. Buying right now would definitely be buying closer towards the end of the move than towards the beginning. It would be coming in late.

But even if `TAN` does not keep going up like crazy, it might flatline here and just whip around for the next 3-12 month, it won't just turn around and reverse its gains. That sort of thing - of powerful moves being reversed simply does not happen in the stock market. The same goes for `ARKK` here.

9:30am. My experience buying in situations like this is that I get a lot of volatility and not much gains, but if it were me right now, I'd buy `TAN` or `ICLN` - just to prove that I can hold for months now. That I can sit out of the volatility if there aren't obvious signs that I should get out of the market like in 2008 (finance stocks were getting crushed quarter to quarter in that period.)

9:35am. If the market really looks scary, I'd sell and wait a month or two. If things look fine, I'd buy back in, even if - in fact especially if, the vehicle I am interested has move higher than where I sold.

I just desire it. I just desire it so much. I have everything I need to make solid gains in the market. I have a system that finally makes sense to me. Long term, there are piles of money to be made from this.

I just do not have the money to participate in it right now.

But I do not regret that. Me not being able to trade are just the vagaries of life.

I do regret my weak character that lead me to wasting so much time since high school fruitlessly chasing the wrong ideas for over half a decade.

But ultimately character is not something that you can train. If you get hurt - if you just stand and take punches, you character will weaken. The way to strenghten it is to go on the offensive.

The way to train character is to make the right moves. You train it by winning, and by holding the right views and ideas.

9:45am. You do train it as well, by shrugging off damage. But you need to be on the right path to do that.

...

Stocks are just so great. Compare stocks to currencies and commodities on the monthly timescales and you get the feeling how powerful their upward bias is. Stock traders aren't morons for buying and holding something that persistently goes up instead of wasting their time and money on instruments that seesaw.

I recognize this. I recognize their power.

I really doubt I'll get a chance to redeem myself in this arena.

Once I get sponsors for Spiral, things will move quickly and I will be busy. If I make my riches through RL agents, by that point I will already be at the entry point to the Singularity. As great at stocks are, the benefits of being able to trade them are nowhere as great as the benefit of becoming a post human existence. It is farcial to compare them in the same breath.

9:50am. Trading thought me how to speculate. Even though my character and inexperience prevented me from making gains, they did not prevent my imagination from producing ideas. It is this effort that made me look upwards from the ground in all earnesty. My character might have been too weak to win, but if it had been too weak to even try to challenge the markets, Simulacrum would never have been written. And I would never have returned to programming.

9:55am. The best revenge against my past failures is to take the long term view and just put in effort every day towards my stated goal. I trully get a good feeling now when I think about the market, like when I finish planning out a tough part of the compiler and it all sets in.

This desire will have to be satisfied not through trading, but through programming somehow.

I'll win either way. Humans live till 80 these days. That is a long time to be able to work, and that is just if present day conditions hold. If technology development goes as planned and the Singularity happens, my expected lifespan will become indefinite. I wasted so much of my life, but what are a few decades to somebody who might live forever?

Without a doubt, I will find a way during this long life to take advantage of my experience.

10am. Let me chill. When it is time to start, I'll do so by studying those strongly connected components algorithms. I won't focus on programming today. Today studying is on the menu."

[IMP] core: introduce `api.ondelete` decorator

With this commit, a new ORM api decorator is introduced:
`api.ondelete(*, at_uninstall)`.

This decorator is to be applied to Model methods that check for specific
business conditions when attempting to unlink a record via the
interface.

E.g. trying to unlink a validated journal entry

This decorator allows this logic to exist outside the `BaseModel.unlink`
method and is automatically bypassed when in uninstall mode, this means
that during an uninstall any and all data related to a module can and
will be removed easily and cleanly while still being able to apply
business logic to manual deletion of records.

This feature opens the gates to solving a very big problem with
uninstalls: records and tables that remain in a database despite the
relevant module being uninstalled, because if an override to unlink
raises an error, the data will never be deleted from the database.

Henceforth, overrides of unlink shall solely be used for data-cleaning
purposes, i.e. deletion or modification of data that is related to the
one currently being deleted but cannot be automatically deleted because
there are no proper SQL relations.

In certain very specific, low-level scenarios an unlink may be
overridden to raise an error, but this should only be done if you know
what the fuck you're doing, most of the time you'll want to resort to
`@api.ondelete`.

Note that this new decorator includes a keyword-only, required argument
called `at_uninstall`, in most business cases this argument shall be
False as this argument dictates whether or not this method should be
executed in the `unlink` call during uninstall. It should only be set to
True if you are certain of all the implications which most likely means
that the records of the model in which this ondelete function is defined
will NOT be removed during uninstall, they will forever linger in the DB
until manual intervention, this in turn can mean a wide range of
undefined problems due to crap left on the database.

Following commits will replace any `unlink` overrides that raise
business errors by methods decorated with `api.ondelete`, another commit
will introduce a pylint checker that will raise a warning any time that
an unlink override raises an error.

TES3: Define FACT, GLOB, GMST, INFO and INGR

TES3: Define FACT

Ugh, just look at that FADT subrecord. Why...

TES3: Define GLOB

Took this opportunity to finally create MelFixedString. Still need a
better solution for fixed-length strings in the middle of structs.

Note also the renames on MreGlob - scary, but much better names (unique,
for a start).

Interlude: Rewrite fixed-length string handling

Completely untested, of course, but should be much better. No idea how
this intersects/conflicts with 480-pt3 yet.

Still, takes the awful MelTes3Hedr hack with it.

TES3: Define GMST

Note I also dropped the useless decode() calls in MreGmst - EDIDs are
decoded no matter what, so no point in these. Plus rename from eid -> e
for these temp vars, eid should be reserved for the actual EDID
subrecord, thanks.

TES3: Define INFO

This won't be fun to handle when we get to writing - it has the same
PNAM bullshit, but now it's a full doubly-linked leveled list. Except
not really of course, since mods can and will violate the LL structure.
So sorting will get even more complicated now. Yay.

TES3: Define INGR

Add emmet-vim, but only for HTML/CSS this time

The options for enabling emmet-vim are copypasta'd from emmet-vim's
README.

...

I have a love-hate relationship with this plugin; in one hand, I like
the concept of emmets, OTOH I think this plugin feels like it does much
more than I need it to do.

Why is an emmet plugin concerned about prettyfying my code? Why should I
install an unrelated plugin to customize its snippets? How do I remove
its mappings? I might end up making my own fork of this plugin to fix
these issues once I have enough time to do so but until then I'll have
to suck it up until then...

Apologies for the rant above.

"10:40am. Enough chilling. I've ranted a bit and did my morning reading, now it is time to do some work. I want to dedicate today to studying graph algorithms.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component

Hmmm, I do not remember anything in the course by Sedgewick on SCCs, but maybe there is something in the book. Let me take a look.

Ah, there is a chapter on graphs in the Algorithms book. As expected there is more stuff here than in the course. I guess I'll spend my time studying it.

10:50am. I feel like going through the chapter from the beginning even if I do not need to do. Going through 200 pages will take me some time. After that I will translate the Java algorithms to F#. That will get me a feel for them. After that I'll be ready to put them into the compiler.

11am. Even though I've only started let me have breakfast since it is in front of me.

11:30am. Let me resume. Focus on those graph chapters.

12:10pm. 550/969. I am roughly 50 pages in. Let me just keep going. This early stuff describes the basics and I am feeling quite bored. I'll pick up the pace. When I get to actual implementations of the things I am interested in things will pick up.

12:35pm. Had to take a short break.

I meant to say in that last entry, after I get to the implementations of things I am interested in, I will be traslating them to F#. I won't aim to finish this all today. Instead I will study it properly.

12:40pm. 554/969. I could do BFS much more elegantly in a functional language like F#, than this Java crud.

1:20pm. Had to take a short break again. Resuming.

1:45pm. 580/969. Finally here are directed graphs. This is the part I am interested in. I'll read the section and then move to programming after that.

2pm. 588/969.
> Directed cycles are of particular importance in applications that involve processing digraphs. Identifying directed cycles in a typical digraph can be a challenge without the help of a computer, as shown at right. In principle, a digraph might have a huge number of cycles; in practice, we typically focus on a small number of them, or simply are interested in knowing that none are present.

Ok, I am paying attention here. The book I am reading is Algorithms 4th edition by Sedgewick & Wayne.

2:20pm. 591/969. This is a bit tough to grasp, but I think I roughly get it.

I think this adds every vertex to the stack, much like the ideas I thought up yesterday rather than just the strongly connected compontents of it.

...No actually it would not...

...Ah, it would return just the cycle vertices, but if there are multiple cycle paths it would miss them. I think I see it.

2:40pm. 600/969. Here the book covers Kosaraju's algorithm.

> We saw in CC (Algorithm 4.3 on page 544) that computing connected components in undirected graphs is a simple application of depth-first search. How can we efficiently compute strong components in digraphs? Remarkably, the implementation KosarajuSCC on the facing page does the job with just a few lines of code added to CC, as follows

Must like I could not figure out the topological sort without refreshing my memory while working on the codegen, I could not figure out Kosaraju's algorithm on my own. In fact I still do not understand it. In order to get that understanding I am going to have to implement and play with it a little.

2:50pm. 601/969. This thing is magical.

2:55pm.
> Kosaraju’s algorithm is an extreme example of a method that is easy to code but difficult to understand. Despite its mysterious nature, if you follow the proof of the following proposition step by step, with reference to the diagram on page 586, you can be convinced that the algorithm is correct:

3pm. 602/969.

These textual proofs do nothing for me. Ultimately, they are just piles of words, and there isn't some direct way of translating what they are saying to a mental model. But the general flow of the program is simple enough, and I can see that it would work just by simulating things in my head. So I guess I am proving things mentally via monte carlo sampling my subconcious model.

3:05pm. I should do the chores here. As elegant as Kosaraju's algorithm is, I am curious how it would be possible to do this without having to reverse the graph. That would be expensive...

Or would it? I would not be too hard to maintain a mirror image along with the original.

3:10pm. Let me do the chores.

3:50pm. Let me resume. Actually, I do not understand why the reverse post order of the reverse graph is necessary. I do not understand why the post order of the regular graph would not suffice.

4pm. 604/969. It seems reachability is different from strong connectedness. If there is an efficient algorithm for reachability, I could check that for cycles. I understand why the reverse of the original is necessary as I found a counter example. But I am not at all sure how I could adapt Kosaraju's algorithm so I can check only parts of the graph. With the way things are now, I'd need to recalculate everything on every change. This does not sit well with me.

4:40pm. I am done with the section and am taking the time to think. I am having a lot of inspiration.

I thought that Kosaraju might not be what I need, but now that I am seeing it more clearly, it is in fact exactly what I need. In fact, I understand how to make the recalculation optimal. The fact I need the reverse graph will make that much easier.

Like, the DFS needs to be done from scrach on every change, but the graph and its reverse can have their edges be added and removed perfectly incrementally.

The way to do this efficiently is as follows - run the Kosaraju from the vertex being changes and only that. Use the reversePost order of the mirror graph from that vertex to calculate the strong components.

That means that if a package being modified has many outgoing links, but not many incoming links that kind of evaluation will be efficient. If it has no incoming links, that would be best.

When it comes to detecting cycles, you can do it in two ways - in forward and reverse mode. I want to be doing it in reverse mode. It is really a great coincidence that this is also the right way to calculate strong components!

This will make error messages really good. I am glad I too the time to think about this.

4:50pm. Let me go a bit further into the book.

4:55pm. The fact that the book use a queue to illustrate the reverse post order is trully illuminating. Unlike, a stack, that has other good properties. I can use it to iterate between the forward and reverse.

Right now the book is talking about minimum spanning trees. I am not really interested in that...

5:25pm. Damn it, what I have in mind would work, but trying to fit Kosaraju's algorithm in my head is impossible. It does not make sense.

I have an example in mind, but it is not working out. Although I am really having difficulty fitting all of the stuff in. I am thinking about the reverse of the reverse of the reverse.

There is no way around it. I am going to have to code some things up.

6:10pm. Damn it, I knew something did not make sense. The reverse post order requires a stack!

I knew I had some kind of mental error.

6:15pm. Ok, I have it. Reasoning about graph traversal requires exercise. I can't just do it right off the bat.

6:25pm. I see. If I sort the reverse of the graph, and then do DFS based on that, for efficiency one thing I will have to make sure that the DFS is not exploring the parts of the reverse graph that are not related to the changed node. That means that the reverse post order of the reverse graph is also the area that exploration should be limited to in addition to being the order taken by the forward graph DFS.

6:35pm. Let me stop here, there is no point in continuing this today. It is time to rest. That is another day down.

I have a plan how to deal with packages now. It makes sense, even though I do not entirely understand Kosaraju's algorithm yet. Still, how much I do understand is entirely enough for me to fully utilize it. I can even adapt it to the situation much like now.

I won't bother translating the example in the book, though I will study the proof in it more. Right now I do not have the energy.

6:45pm. 602/969

> Proposition H. In a DFS of a digraph G where marked vertices are considered in reverse postorder given by a DFS of the digraph’s reverse G R (Kosaraju’s algorithm), the vertices reached in each call of the recursive method from the constructor are in a strong component.

> Proof: First, we prove by contradiction that every vertex v that is strongly connected to s is reached by the call dfs(G, s) in the constructor. Suppose a vertex v that is strongly connected to s is not reached by dfs(G, s). Since there is a path from s to v, v must have been previously marked. But then, since there is a path from v to s, s would have been marked during the call dfs(G, v) and the constructor would not call dfs(G, s), a contradiction. Second, we prove that every vertex v reached by the call dfs(G, s) in the constructor is strongly connected to s. Let v be a vertex reached by the call dfs(G, s). Then, there is a path from s to v in G, so it remains only to prove that there is a path from v to s in G. This statement is equivalent to saying that there is a path from s to v in GR, so it remains only to prove that there is a path from s to v in GR. The crux of the proof is that the reverse postorder construction implies that dfs(G, v) must have been done before dfs(G, s) during the DFS of GR, leaving just two cases to consider for dfs(G, v): it might have been called

* before dfs(G, s) was called (and also done before dfs(G, s) was called)

* after dfs(G, s) was called (and done before dfs(G, s) was done)

> The first of these is not possible because there is a path from v to s in GR; the second implies that there is a path from s to v in GR, completing the proof.

I really can't go from this to understanding.

7pm. My brain is broken. I am trying to reason out the case and it just keep slipping. Forget it. This glass of wine I am having is not helping me any either.

I really should just take some time to code up Kosaraju in isolation and clear up my confusion once and for all. Once I have the code down, that will make it easier for me to trace it in my head. That is what I will do tomorrow. I wanted to skip coding it entirely, since I have more than enough to code it up in the server directly, but I should take this opporunity to deepen my attainment in graph algorithms. Since it will be such an important part of Spiral, I should at least do that much for it.

I am some monkey that will be satisfied with just having the solution. I want to understand why the algorithm works as well.

Forget Spiral. Understanding is more important. I am not on such a strict deadline that I have to skip studies important pieces I am implementing. I'll take it as vacation.

I will make it an ongoing effort to understand this algorithm thoroughly even if I do not manage it tomorrow."

better logging to remember what the fuck am I doing. Shame on me for poor comments and 0 logging on this one.

Clean up partitions UI and improve backfill usability

Summary:
Hey folks! I've made a few high level changes to the partition UI. I think there are more to come, but I'd love to get everyone's thoughts. This diff:

- Compacts the partition headers and options to match my earlier mockups:

    - Makes the partition picker more identical to the one on the Runs tab
    - Moves the 7, 30, 120 day options up to make it clear they're page-wide settings
    - Moves Launch Partition Backfill to a standard looking button

- Reworks the partition backfill UI to reflect our recent conversations:

    - You can now specify partitions by typing into a freeform text box. I tried a couple different UIs that let you put in an A-B range OR select items individually and it all felt painful. I think that letting people type (and copy/paste) in addition to using the preview to make their selections might be ideal.
        - `2020-04-*` to specify all matching partitions
        - `[2020-01-01...2020-04-04]` to specify ranges
        - If you select in the UI we generate this compact representation for you

    - I moved the step subset up out of the visualization into the "backfill setup form" so that it's more clear that the filter is actually a piece of the configuration.

    - Instead of hiding options that aren't available they're disabled so you know Dagster has cool features you aren't using!

    - There's now a tooltip explaining the drag-to-select behavior

Thoughts:

I would really like to make the Launch Backfill button jump you to a new page, or open a modal, but I feel like the current approach (outlined form) might be more usable because it allows you to work with the context / data on the page while you configure your backfill? Would be interested to know what everyone thinks.

It appears that the partition backfill UI does allow you to use partitions with no previous runs, as long as you don't select "from last run" and don't need step subsets. I think we can enable the step subset box without being in re-execution mode?
