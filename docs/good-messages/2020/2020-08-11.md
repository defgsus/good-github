Implement Scroll of Recall. Can warp monsters across levels depending on BUC

Cursed: Works like a magic whistle, except it warps hostiles, not pets
Uncursed: Exactly like an uncursed magic whistle
Blessed: Warps all pets owned by you in the whole dungeon next to you

If confused, the warping is reversed -- it warps the reader to the 1st
matching hostile (cursed), pet (uncursed) or inter-level pet (blessed).

Base price: 200zm

[WIP] rfc: Consistent Read Replicas

Consistent Read Replicas provide a mechanism through which follower replicas in
a Range can be used to serve reads for **non-stale** read-only and read-write
transactions.

The ability to serve reads from follower replicas is beneficial both because it
can reduce wide-area network jumps in geo-distributed deployments and because it
can serve as a form of load-balancing for concentrated read traffic. It may also
provide an avenue to reduce tail latencies in read-heavy workloads, although
such a benefit is not a focus of this RFC.

_The purpose of this RFC is to introduce an approach to consistent read replicas
that I think could be implemented in CockroachDB in the medium-term future. It
takes inspiration from Andy Kimball and the AcidLib project. I'm hoping for
this to spur a discussion about potential solutions to the problem and also
generally about our ambitions in this area going forward.

The most salient design decision from this proposal is that it remains
completely separate from the Raft consensus protocol. It does not interact with
Raft, instead operating in the lease index domain. This is similar in spirit to
our approach to implementing closed timestamps.

The RFC includes three alternative approaches that each address part of these
issues, but come with their own challenges and costs. Unlike with most RFCs, I
think it's very possible that we end up preferring one of these alternatives
over the main proposal in the RFC._

Release note: None
