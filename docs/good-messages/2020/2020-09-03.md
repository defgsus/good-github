StaffPortal (I named it NeonPort) is a powerful staff management system designed for business owners to manage without any hassle their employees data. Featuring an amazing ui powered by the famous material design for bootstrap. The backend is powered by the very popular and secure laravel framework, so you have no reason whatsoever to worry about hackers gaining entry into your website and stealing valuable data. The frontend is handled by another hugely popular library designed by the facebook team. The result is a single page application (the client side) which loads with the speed of light and also comes with a smooth and fantastic user experience.

Add new unique - Vaud, the Cursed Lightbringer

In-game description:
A cowardly ghoul once unfortunate enough to murder the only living
priest of a now forgotten deity of light. In its final words, the dying
god cursed Vaud to take up the priest's clothes and holy lantern and rid
the dungeon of all things unclean. Unfortunately, Vaud thinks your
cleanliness is lacking.

You will be burned each turn his holy lantern's light falls upon you.
This will be extra effective against the undead, whilst followers of
Elyvilon, The Shining One, and Zin will be protected.

Flavour vision:
Vaud is a reluctant actor for the holy powers, having been cursed into
such servitude. He's not very happy about that, but appears to at least
enjoy using the searing light from his holy lantern to burn
those in his way. Vaud is seen charging after the player, attempting to
bask them in purifying light, all whilst telling them how UNCLEAN they
are, and how they need to be purged.

Design vision:
Persistent, area-based effects which are centred and flavoured upon
mosters is, perhaps, an area of design space that could be explored
further. Vaud's design pushes into this design space in a simple and
intuitive way - the halo of his lantern providing easy visual feedback
for the area which will hurt. And so in the same vein as a torpor snail,
or a panlord with cloud rings, we present the player with an adjustment
to the usual melee monster engagement profile. Namely, that engaging at
melee distance will be worse than usual. More specifically to Vaud, the
decision to engage him in melee will commit to low, but consistent,
damage over multiple turns, since attempting to run from Vaud when
beginning at melee range will expose the player to many turns of Vaud's
lantern. Vaud is slow, however, to both further encourage ranged
engagement, and also to ensure melee engagement followed by fleeing is
in many cases a 'punishing' rather than 'fatal' mistake. That said, the
damage from the lantern is low, and so powerful melee characters should
still be able to 'power through', although weaker melee characters who
are for some reason relying on a melee strategy will rightly struggle.

Vaud is intended to be a scary unique to encounter should the player be
undead. He is slow, which should allow for an undead character to
adequately avoid him if they have no ranged damage/hex/evokables to rely
on.

Please let me know your thoughts or any tweaks you'd like to see! Always
happy to take feedback, make changes.

Cobbduceus: (Baby) C2 Additions (Rhig,Troph) and Changes (Helbital) (#49356)

It's the year of the rat sisters, and now it's time to cut out those pesky C3s in your life!

Why It's Good For The Game

Rhig and Troph are no brainers considering they're on the same level of ease2make as the C2s and have no downside. They will still be good but they have some C2 component now. Kinda minor compared to the others but I'll see how it plays out.
Changelog

ðŸ†‘
balance: Helbital now is more simple to use and is based off not crit/softcrit/hardcrit. You want to be in hardcrit for the best brute healing.
tweak: Troph has now been converted into a C2 with tweaks, now named Probital. Same recipe. Downside is stamina damage
tweak: Rhig has now been converted into a C2 with tweaks, now named Hercuri. Same Recipe. Downside is it can cool to dangerous levels.

Cobbduceus 1.1/X, Base(d) Healers (THIS KILLS TACTICAL KILLING AND CLONING???) (#46219)

About The Pull Request
Buffs C2 Healing

I should have leaned to more healing initially, especially since they're damaging. Goal here is to make them more enticing.
Dilutes Starting Meds / Borg Hydro Microdosing

Perhaps this was the biggest issue in that your DEFAULTS carried way too much of the chem specifically designed for lower dosages so people were getting smacked with needless damage consistently.

You can still make your own "pure" samples I guess, but I think you'll like the current values.

Borgs can now switch between 5u/2u with altclick.
Adds a C3 Diluent Specifically for Minor Brute/Burn

Wouldn't make much sense to dilute it with air! Granibitaluri is a new C3 that slowly tops off your damage by order of brute then burn. The catch is you must be at 10 damage or less for the healing to apply. ODs at 50.

This is the reagent all C2s are diluted with regardless of what they heal (meaning brute/burn chems will heal a tad better but only when you're about healed anyways).
Why It's Good For The Game

Buffed C2s to make them more viable as contenders to some of the more oddity avenues you guys were using.

Dilutes C2s to make the roundstart items viable on their own without chemistry (or at least a chem master). Same with Borg Microdosing option.

Added the C3 since it was suggested by zxaber to have a form of healing more minor damage without going through the lengths of surgery.

Sorry in advance silicon players, the solutions are still pure in your hypo!
Changelog

cl Anarcho-Capitalistabital-by
add: In General, Buffs healing thoroughput of C2s. You can stop paying your cloners overtime now!
tweak: The roundstart C2 methods are now diluted with a new reagent, Granibitaluri.
tweak: The borghypo now can switch to "microdosing", which is 2u transfer via AltClick
add: Granibitaluri is a C3 (no downside!!!) that tops off your brute THEN burn damage if they are at or below 10 damage.
/cl

Thank you guys for being so patient and providing constructive feedback! G-g-g-good thing coders "play" haha!

remove question mark from filename (for Windows)

I remember that Fox News was on 24/7.

We were sitting in that darkened room, passing the time silently
together, when he said, "don't go."

I remember one segment was a half-hour special on Norman Rockwell
paintings. I think the segment involved interviewing different people
vying to purchase an original, or something like that.

I replied that I intended to stay until visiting hours ended and the
nurses kicked me out.

Gushy praise for a lost way of life was basically the theme from what I
gathered. I didn't really pay attention. I was mostly focused on him,
and our time together.

He repeated softly, "don't go."

And, to be honest, I'd pushed it out of my memory already. I think I had
forgotten that Fox News was airing a half-hour segment on Norman
Rockwell paintings before the half hour was even up.

So I smiled and said, "okay, I'll barricade the door now and get the
supplies ready. It'll be like a zombie apocalypse movie. The nurses will
come in droves, but I'll fight them off in order to stay longer."

But it came back just now as I read this article about a Swiss
photographer who journeyed across America in the 1950s to capture what
he saw as the American reality.

And he laughed. It was a wheezing, gasping sort of laugh that sounded
only slightly less awful than he looked.

I hadn't heard of Robert Frank or the resulting book, The Americans,
before, but it seems his work was roundly rejected at the time for
presenting an anti-American view of America. As I read the article, the
sound of the Fox News segment and its forceful reminiscing on Rockwell's
America came back.

When he got his breathing back under control, we resumed sitting
together quietly in that darkened room, and I saw him smile.

The contrast felt sharp and present-tense.

audio: fix stream-silence with push AOs (somewhat)

--audio-stream-silence is a shitty feature compensating for awful
consumer garbage, that mutes PCM at first to check whether it's
compressed audio, using formats advocated and owned by malicious patent
troll companies (who spend more money on their lawyers than paying any
technicians), wrapped in a wasteful way to make it constant bitrate
using a standard whose text is not freely available, and only rude users
want it. This feature has been carelessly broken, because it's
complicated and stupid. What would Jesus do? If not getting an aneurysm,
or pushing over tables with expensive A/V receivers on top of them, he'd
probably fix the feature. So let's take inspiration from Jesus Christ
himself, and do something as dumb as wasting some of our limited
lifetime on this incredibly stupid fucking shit.

This is tricky, because state changes like end-of-audio are supposed to
be driven by the AO driver, while playing silence precludes this. But it
seems code paths for "untimed" AOs can be reused.

But there are still problems. For example, underruns will just happen
normally (and stop audio streaming), because we don't have a separate
heuristic to check whether the buffer is "low enough" (as a consequence
of a network stall, but before the audio output itself underruns).
