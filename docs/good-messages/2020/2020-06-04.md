vfs: add restrictions to read(2) of a directory [1/2]

Historically, we've allowed read() of a directory and some filesystems will
accommodate (e.g. ufs/ffs, msdosfs). From the history department staffed by
Warner: <<EOF

pdp-7 unix seemed to allow reading directories, but they were weird, special
things there so I'm unsure (my pdp-7 assembler sucks).

1st Edition's sources are lost, mostly. The kernel allows it. The
reconstructed sources from 2nd or 3rd edition read it though.

V6 to V7 changed the filesystem format, and should have been a warning, but
reading directories weren't materially changed.

4.1b BSD introduced readdir because of UFS. UFS broke all directory reading
programs in 1983. ls, du, find, etc all had to be rewritten. readdir() and
friends were introduced here.

SysVr3 picked up readdir() in 1987 for the AT&T fork of Unix. SysVr4 updated
all the directory reading programs in 1988 because different filesystem
types were introduced.

In the 90s, these interfaces became completely ubiquitous as PDP-11s running
V7 faded from view and all the folks that initially started on V7 upgraded
to SysV. Linux never supported this (though I've not done the software
archeology to check) because it has always had a pathological diversity of
filesystems.
EOF

Disallowing read(2) on a directory has the side-effect of masking
application bugs from relying on other implementation's behavior
(e.g. Linux) of rejecting these with EISDIR across the board, but allowing
it has been a vector for at least one stack disclosure bug in the past[0].

By POSIX, this is implementation-defined whether read() handles directories
or not. Popular implementations have chosen to reject them, and this seems
sensible: the data you're reading from a directory is not structured in some
unified way across filesystem implementations like with readdir(2), so it is
impossible for applications to portably rely on this.

With this patch, we will reject most read(2) of a dirfd with EISDIR. Users
that know what they're doing can conscientiously set
bsd.security.allow_read_dir=1 to allow read(2) of directories, as it has
proven useful for debugging or recovery. A future commit will further limit
the sysctl to allow only the system root to read(2) directories, to make it
at least relatively safe to leave on for longer periods of time.

While we're adding logic pertaining to directory vnodes to vn_io_fault, an
additional assertion has also been added to ensure that we're not reaching
vn_io_fault with any write request on a directory vnode. Such request would
be a logical error in the kernel, and must be debugged rather than allowing
it to potentially silently error out.

Commented out shell aliases have been placed in root's chsrc/shrc to promote
awareness that grep may become noisy after this change, depending on your
usage.

A tentative MFC plan has been put together to try and make it as trivial as
possible to identify issues and collect reports; note that this will be
strongly re-evaluated. Tentatively, I will MFC this knob with the default as
it is in HEAD to improve our odds of actually getting reports. The future
priv(9) to further restrict the sysctl WILL NOT BE MERGED BACK, so the knob
will be a faithful reversion on stable/12. We will go into the merge
acknowledging that the sysctl default may be flipped back to restore
historical behavior at *any* point if it's warranted.

the big update

- updated the models of most of classic enemies to feature rigging. added in a new head for the classic FBI Veteran (and swapped the classic HRT and Veteran models around, don't tell Finale), and added in a classic variation of the FBI rookie (thanks Rino)!
- gage pickups and white house presidential pardons are now press to pickup. enjoy!
- classic cloakers' lights now turn off properly upon death. (thanks baddy)
- added in new face textures for classic beatcops (Thanks Baddy and Wekk... probably rino too!)
- removed unused files in classic faction. removed blue balaclavas on classic units cause we probably fixed that contour disappearing issue .
- fixed broken normalmaps on Classic faction and copied over resmod's textures (which have no difference other than having mipmaps and probably other minor improvements)
- fixed unarmored classic heavies spawning on the wrong difficulty.
- fixed unarmored classic heavies crashing the game (this may or may not have fixed that shitty holdout crash by extension, TEST please).
- fixed mod being annoying and trying to hook things that don't exist. files does not exist warnings have also fucked off to another dimension. they shouldn't be there. fuck em'.
- updated dense unit list in coplogicattack. will do.. something. probably.
- fixed classic shield having wrong weapon on lower difficulties. (thanks person who coded the copbase weapon swap code originally in Hyper Heisting)
- resolved most cases of corrupted normalmaps. things will finally no longer look like dung!
- added gangster chatter (thanks fuglore.. rino too.. grngh...)
- fixed classic dozer faceplate lods so they don't break at a distance.
- fixed normalmap on npc assault rifle. the sg553 or whatever... look, the one used by light SWATS

Fix Marrow-Gnawer sacrifice cost

Hello,
At the moment, Marrow-Gnawer is unable to sacrifice itself. Marrow-Gnawer's text, as printed on the card, is:
> Tap, Sacrifice a Rat: Create X 1/1 black Rat creature tokens, where X is the number of Rats you control.

However, on XMage, Marrow-Gnawer's text currently is:
> Sacrifice a Rat, Tap: Create X 1/1 black Rat creature tokens, where X is the number of Rats you control.

XMage doesn't let Marrow-Gnawer sacrifice itself because "Sacrifice a Rat" is put before the tap (contrary to the original text).

I have never touched XMage code, so this is only an attempt to solve the issue. I took inspiration from Bloodshot Cyclops, which has a similar ability. I am unable to test this fix, I am sorry about that.

Cheers

Another bunch of massive cleanups and improvements.

* There are currently three test suites:
  - WorkingTests: these are expected to all pass
  - NetCoreTests: same but running with the net5 preview.
  - SimpleTest: this is essentially my personal playground, expect breakage here.

* To allow sharing code as much as possible, there are two new directories:
  - Tests/TestSuite/SharedTests: for shared test suite code.
  - Tests/TestSuite/SharedTests/SharedSampe: for shared test sample code.
  These are setup via some magic (which is a bit of an ugly hack) to work around
  OmniSharp's limitations with multiple workspace directories.
  See Tests/TestSuite/SharedTests/README.me for details.

* Cleaned up the test sample; we can actually share the index.html between all
  test suites by using a tiny setup.js that stores the name of the current assembly.

* We can call `Environment.Version` via an accessory function in the browser to
  distinguish between netcoreapp3 and net5 - added a test for that.

* The exception tests will now fail (and not hang) if the runtime doesn't support
  the feature.  We now also correctly detect errors from commands (such as for
  instance sending "Debugger.setPauseOnExceptions" on net5 where we don't support
  that yet).

* Fixed the bootstrap task to actually build things in the correct order.

* All `Mono.WasmPackager.TestSuite.Messaging` classes now derive from a common
  `ProtocolObject` base class (containing a `JToken OriginalToken` property).

* Added some custom JSon serialization magic to check that checks that field on
  serialiaztion.  This allows us to properly round-trip a JObject that contains
  any values that are not in the C# classes.

* As part of that magic, we no longer need to pass any custom flags when serializing /
  deserializing.

[2650] Improved image shrinking, part three

We currently constrain the size of images in entry and comment content. But the
REASON we do this is so that people can casually post medium-sized images
and not stress about annoying their friends and readers; the beginning and end
of it is to make it easier to post on DW.

There's another set of user behaviors that's basically the OPPOSITE of casually
posting a medium image, where people express themselves by doing weird intricate
HTML shit no modern site would allow. It's part of DW's fandom-centric culture,
so we'd rather not interfere with it or make it harder.

This commit uses some extra javascript to try and guess which images are part of
a complex hunk of decorative / narrative markup, and changes the CSS to leave
said images alone (under the assumption that the author knows what they're
trying to accomplish and doesn't need any "help").

And while I'm at it, it also removes the "zoom in" cursor from images that are
already actual size and thus don't need to zoom. (That part uses an ultra-modern
API with stringent browser requirements, because 1. it's kind of just a vanity
thing, and 2. it has to update on window resize, but any tangible performance
cost is unacceptable, so if we can't do it for nearly-free then we shouldn't do
it at all. Native ResizeObserver is nearly-free, polyfills ain't.)
