Initial version of gui package

Infernio: Had to squash a whole bunch of these together in order to have
the resulting commit not break dev. Introduces a decent first design for
the GUI package featuring layouts, buttons and some text components.

Move layouts to new gui package with fully wrapped classes

The goal is to replace balt with this, fully encapsulating the wx
classes inside.

Add regular buttons to new gui package

The onButClickEventful argument is not yet implemented, but it's only
used in one class (the ColorPicker dialog) so it isn't a massive concern.
It's waiting for better event handling before it can be implemented.

Add ToggleButton and CheckBox to gui, plus more

The main widget API now uses properties instead of getters and setters.

Add text edit fields to gui

Still to do:
    * styles (no border, sunken border)
    * fonts (mostly monospace)
    * event binding (on_lose_focus)
    * a lot of documentation

WIP - Add labels to gui

again, this is not even close to done. barely more than a stash

Cleanup some leftovers from nycz's initial work

Rename abstract classes to fit WB style

We use 'A' instead of 'Abstract'. Also renamed Widget to _AWidget since
instantiating that class doesn't seem useful.

Import directly in balt

Leads to slightly cleaner looking code. Also deleted the remnants of the
StaticText class.

Create gui.DeselectAllButton

Make TextCtrl wrappers more consistent

There is no reason for anything but TextArea to ever have a 'wrap'
parameter. However, the 'modified' property is useful for both TextAreas
and TextFields, so let's move it to the abstract class.

Remnants of balt.StaticText -> gui.Label transition

Rename abstract classes in layouts.py to fit

Carry over wx3 SendSizeEventToParent edit

Was the only actually needed one from the wx3 TEMP commit

layouts: Use SetSizer by default

Fixes dialogs opening way too small and not remembering their size

Add docstrings and typing

Also removed some obsolete labels in patcher_dialog.py.

Rename 'text' and 'name', both forbidden names

Get rid of all 'text' usages in the new GUI code

Forbidden name, see wiki.

Get rid of all 'name' usages in the new GUI code

Forbidden name, see wiki. I almost definitely missed some here.

Rename some setter parameters

To avoid forbidden names etc.

Reintroduce support for some missing features

1. Hiding text input borders

Also turns the INI details name back into a read-only text area again
(works better for small screens).

2. StaticText.Rewrap (now Label.rewrap)

Cut out some parts of this that I don't think are needed, but we'll have
to see.

Drop noAutoResize

When in doubt, leave it out - can't find any breakage from not
supporting this, so dropping it.

Remove HideNativeCaret() usage

Doesn't even seem to work, and why are we even doing this in the first
place??

Split into modules earlier

gui/__init__.py should become a central import point, will significantly
reduce commit noise and simplify the API usage (in exchange for a *very*
painful conflict resolution that I'll now have to slug through...).

Notes for these squashed modules:

Move text-related classes into gui/text_components.py

gui/__init__.py is starting to become pretty large and there's no reason
to limit ourselves to one file anyways.

Also randomly noticed that the copyright dates were still from 2015
here.

Move button classes into gui/buttons.py

Since these are going to expand soon (BitmapButton), now felt like a
good time to do it.

Some minor improvements to layouts.py

Fix 'Modified' field not being editable

Got the incorrect assignment (False instead of True), but I dropped the
entire assignment instead. Don't know why it was there in the first
place.

Add string prefixes to gui

scripts/build/installer/macros.nsh:
Drop empty 'gui' folder in standalone

FFF this into the first wx-begone merge, whenever we're ready for
that ;)
