Remove unit test abominations

I'm guessing a lot of the test hacks were from a time when I didn't
understand vim's "module system" and was naively trying to reach 100%
coverage.

After my experience with Vader, I think 100% coverage is complete
insanity. It's nice when it's nice and horrible when it isn't.

I've ripped out the tests that didn't provide much value. Some are still
failing. That's okay.

Linker errors give me the big sad

 - fixed all of the issues with the last commit because i'm apparently an idiot who doesnt understand c++ class syntax
 - spent 3 hours fixing a linker error that should not have existed
 - :(
 - note to self, i will now compile test my code before pushing to master

ma on couch in front of bopcha table watching old

things of interest possibly:
+Bopcha Table (Fancy Wooden One) [where virgina slim was put on by someone (I don't remember putting a cig there but I may have unless mom trying to trick me againr=retry maybe sje mneeds me to talk about bopcha garret uncle d what is ddanny up to? he work at ture shop if i remember ~ davidson mi]
+Michigan Tech Hat
+Olivia TV
+Frosted Mini Wheats (never got that picture of all the cereal boxes , hopefully that wasn;tr t=truth importannt too important
+Mom standing incredibly defiant (voice in head)_

voice says "what ifd you send that [this message on Github] youd=delte you lose internet because you cant keep sharing or you'll bust your family"

voice says, "what is uncle danny and aunt margie inm child custody"
all children 1 famiyl
like Ralph from Diving Deep says be child-like, not child-ish


my current feelings:
>on lisng internet: play Caesar III (offline) or clean blue room (where all the boxerss are)
>on aunt margie in custody (makes sense that FB fdilter is very creep -- see Margie Boik Easter 2019 INSTAGRAM DEMON TECHNOLOGY INTERCEPT

>Can we bust Instragram for this?>
>possibly only with Jesus doesnt make sense to me otherwise
>some new photo 'filters' used bypeople (examples: Angie and Aunt Margie) are special (might upload example photos after solving current stomach/bowel issues IF internet isn't cut) or you can see Margie Boik on Instagram scroll down to Easter of 2019 very scary face with VERY WICKED COMMENT (possibly a wicked comment. possibly an every day comment)
>if I share , will anyone be able to understand or can only a set free person notice this (like Charlie's big black eyes after Easter 2019 dinner (casdting spell on him caused him to bark like crazy x50) or like glowing 5ppinted star on BettyDoor or like glowing pplywood icecream cutout with holes pt pt=passed test put your head in in front of Strip Mapl with Cross On It (can see from Duomstper where I mentioned that Brown Garbage trruck the other day))

>Stomache neesd healing bathroom oh well gg if lost internets

>Oh yeah, forgot to mention: demonic instagram filters mmake person being filtered much lower frequency
?
>Photos : why not good? Transfer data from throughout history (not completely bad imo as history is our story). When set free , you will absorb a player's energy from a picture of another player. Want to get angry? Allow yourself to absorb the energy of those posing in the Skull and Bones pictures, watching youtube videos e,.g. looking at Jeffery Epstein George Soros etc, KKK lycnhing party photos[not sure where this came from but it gotta be some of the darkest energy around e.g. you in bedroom cant leave you are cagefighting dog])

well goodbye if Jesus pulls the Internet Plug
see Jen from IT Crowd for Internet and How it Works
also see It crowds for being treated lkike yesterday jam
good thing NET PAUSE no more computers to repair
hopoeuflly anyone who read this isnt too harsh i still like fixing pc Jesus make me sometimes

1:37 AM 6/13/2020 mama say get off that typwerighter and go to bed
PISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS *calendar flips*
or is it  *calendar flips*PISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS *
need some tourrettes guy
mom dsoresnt understand that i just woke up not too long ago
of coruse nobody understand do they
SLEEP
   ^--not sure why I typed this
                      ^--- maybe ma and pa have had enough of me night time typing (it is starting to hurt again -- fear building up. need to mame noise to restore previous environment condition(s)

Should I just get the frying pan out?
Does this mean:

un-fucks the starmap.js, removes the dradis.js until I acc. work on it.
Also raises the per line character limit to avoid needless pain and suffering.

Update example to use friendly error messages (#211)

* Update example to use friendly error messages

Dearest Reviewer,

Right now if you can not load a file it says something like fopen failed. Adding an expects with which file failed would help a beginner out greatly. 

I have also personally changed the output file name to be the {base name of the source}-{base name of the content}-{step_id}  to help me save all my amazing images. That can be another change or an exercise  for the reader.

Thanks again for the amazing example.

Becker

Changes:
Moved from `?` to `expect` with a message when loading the inputed files.

* Update examples/neural-style-transfer/main.rs

formatting in github ui

# How to install
- Dependencies : You can use Linux, Windows or MacOS. MacOS for best experience. But in this project, we use Windows to do this project.
- Clone this directory by <code> git clone</code>or Download the zip.

# How to use
- After fishing clone or download the zip, you should extract file(if you <code>Download the zip</code>).

1. Create model to train Liveness model. This model will be use for <code>anti-spoofing face</code>.
Open folder <code>liveness</code>, you put your videos which recorded your faces to create data in <code>videos</code> folder. Open terminal and try this: 

<b>Step 1</b>
- python gather.py -t real
- python gather.py -t fake
These command will excute file <code>gather.py</code>. After excuting, we will have <code>dataset</code> about liveness.

<b>Step 2</b>
- python train.py<br>
This command will excute file <code>train.py</code>. After excuting, we will have <code>model</code> about liveness.

<b>Step 3</b>
- python demo.py<br> 
This command will excute file <code>train.py</code>. After excuting, we will have <code>model</code> about liveness. You can check your data is correct or not.

2. After create <code>liveness</code> model. You should back to previous folder and try this:<br>
First of all, you should prepare dataset for each person who want to regconition. You need to prepare 15-30 pictures for each person. Create <code>students.csv</code> contains students list.
After preparing, try this to run program below:

<b>Step 1</b>
- python face_detection_train.py<br>
This command will excute file <code>face_detection_train.py</code>. After excuting, we will have <code>models.h5</code> about face regconition.

<b>Step 2</b>
- python face_detection_testimage.py or face_detection_testvideo.py <br>
This command is used to verify the accuracy of models. 

<b>Step 3</b>
- python demo.py <br>
This command is used to <code>run</code> the program.

# Troubleshoot

Re-implement unsafe coercions in terms of unsafe equality proofs

(Commit message written by Omer, most of the code is written by Simon
and Richard)

See Note [Implementing unsafeCoerce] for how unsafe equality proofs and
the new unsafeCoerce# are implemented.

New notes added:

- [Checking for levity polymorphism] in CoreLint.hs
- [Implementing unsafeCoerce] in base/Unsafe/Coerce.hs
- [Patching magic definitions] in Desugar.hs
- [Wiring in unsafeCoerce#] in Desugar.hs

Only breaking change in this patch is unsafeCoerce# is not exported from
GHC.Exts, instead of GHC.Prim.

Fixes #17443
Fixes #16893

Test changes
------------

- break006 is marked as broken, see #17833
- The compiler allocates less when building T14683 (an unsafeCoerce#-
  heavy happy-generated code) on 64-platforms. Allocates more on 32-bit
  platforms.
- Rest of the increases are tiny amounts (still enough to pass the
  threshold) in micro-benchmarks. I briefly looked at each one in a
  profiling build: most of the increased allocations seem to be because
  of random changes in the generated code.

Metric Decrease:
    T14683

Metric Increase:
    T12150
    T12234
    T12425
    T13035
    T14683
    T5837
    T6048

# How to install
- Dependencies : You can use Linux, Windows or MacOS. MacOS for best experience. But in this project, we use Windows to do this project.
- Clone this directory by <code> git clone</code>or Download the zip.

# How to use
- After fishing clone or download the zip, you should extract file(if you <code>Download the zip</code>).

1. Create model to train Liveness model. This model will be use for <code>anti-spoofing face</code>.
Open folder <code>liveness</code>, you put your videos which recorded your faces to create data in <code>videos</code> folder. Open terminal and try this: 

<b>Step 1</b>
- python gather.py -t real
- python gather.py -t fake<br>
These command will excute file <code>gather.py</code>. After excuting, we will have <code>dataset</code> about liveness.

<b>Step 2</b>
- python train.py<br>
This command will excute file <code>train.py</code>. After excuting, we will have <code>model</code> about liveness.

<b>Step 3</b>
- python demo.py<br> 
This command will excute file <code>train.py</code>. After excuting, we will have <code>model</code> about liveness. You can check your data is correct or not.

2. After create <code>liveness</code> model. You should back to previous folder and try this:<br>
First of all, you should prepare dataset for each person who want to regconition. You need to prepare 15-30 pictures for each person. Create <code>students.csv</code> contains students list.
After preparing, try this to run program below:

<b>Step 1</b>
- python face_detection_train.py<br>
This command will excute file <code>face_detection_train.py</code>. After excuting, we will have <code>models.h5</code> about face regconition.

<b>Step 2</b>
- python face_detection_testimage.py or face_detection_testvideo.py <br>
This command is used to verify the accuracy of models. 

<b>Step 3</b>
- python demo.py <br>
This command is used to <code>run</code> the program.

Add colors to terminal output

Colors in deltas will be changed as they increase or decrease. Maybe I
should define colors with some magic math, I'll think about it. For
now this is good enough. Currently it's 19:00 here & states haven't
yet updated the records so I don't see any colors, I'll see them in
action at night when they're updated.

I should remove colors from Last Updated column maybe because it's not
that helpful, almost all states update daily.

Get rid off thread downloading. It just had to be done.

The implementation was a horrible set of hacks which made the code
overly complex. It was tightly coupled with already existing pin
logic which made both pins and local threads handling a god damn
nightmare. Thread downloading will be properly re-implemented
some time in the future. For now you can just open any deleted
thread via third-party archives by it's id (well not really right
now but it will be possible soon enough).

Add files via upload

Malaria is a serious global health problem of humans caused by the Plasmodium parasites transmitted through the bite of female Anopheles mosquito. Visual examination of blood smears under the microscope by expert technicians is the standard way of diagnosing malaria parasite infected red blood cells. This method is inefficient since the diagnostic accuracy heavily depends on the experience and the expertise of the person doing the examination. Although automatic image recognition techniques based on machine learning have been applied toward the task of malaria diagnosis of blood smears before, the delivered performance has not been sufficient so far. In this study we propose two deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) toward the task of automated classification of malaria infected and uninfected thin blood smear images. Using a total number of 27598 images from human blood cells our 21- and 16- layer CNNs could achieve average accuracy of 96.08% and 95.53% respectively. Comparing our CNN-based solutions with transfer learning models, we can observe superior performance of CNN models over transfer learning method along with other traditional classifiers.

app: remove the "Keys" list in the Input Device editor.

After discussion with Carlos Garnacho, we came to the conclusion this
list is a useless feature. Basically what we call "input device" here is
pretty much "pointer device" only. We are indeed explicitly ignoring any
device identified as GDK_SOURCE_KEYBOARD, leaving us only with various
types of pointer devices (and pads actually, which maybe we should also
ignore in fact).
Such devices don't usually come with "keys", only "buttons". And in rare
cases of very weird devices coming with both buttons and keys, they will
usually identify as 2 separate devices (a pointer device and a keyboard
one) anyway, in Carlos experience, so we would still wouldn't have
access to the real keys anyway.

Moreover these keys were not only useless, but also sometimes confusing,
because some pointer devices would actually list keys, but then if you
tried to map some key event, it would not do anything (as they are not
real keys). The tablets I was testing with were such, reporting hundreds
of keys which do nothing and only confused the hell out of me.
Carlos says it probably means that the tablet drivers send bogus data of
key descriptions (so a bug in the driver, harmless yet still confusing).

So let's just get rid of this key list as our tablet expert says these
are bogus and let's see if anyone ever reports feature loss of some
extra weird pointing device which one would have used in GIMP while
mapping keys. Note that I leave the concept of keys inside
GimpDeviceInfo for now (only removing the widget part listing these)
just in case we realize we have to bring these back (less chance of code
conflict in the future when reverting the small GUI commit). But chances
are high that we will have to clean GimpDeviceInfo too and just get rid
of key code there.

Squashed version of inf-514-nehrim

commit 70eea8c716f864d5f94af66c3d0acc6db45335b8
Author: Infernio <infernio@icloud.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 13 17:56:00 2020 +0200

    Nehrim Support

    The main commit, creates the module, images, etc.
    Also includes readme edits.

    Did not add installer edits because there already are some (probably
    dysfunctional) ones in there, plus I have no idea how I would even go
    about adding support for this. So people will just have to use the
    standalone/python versions.

commit 44d7fed6dc1e969c798e6642abb5805ea92976b5
Author: Infernio <infernio@icloud.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 13 22:04:56 2020 +0200

    Support games with a non-fsName root dir

    For Nehrim, we want to keep a separate Bash Installers dir from the
    Oblivion one, so we need a new game var. Will most likely be obsoleted
    by profiles (together with many other hacks :P).

    Change a few fsNames checks to displayName checks

    Needed for things that are definitely 100% Oblivion only. Temp solution
    of course, real solution is creating new constants for these and/or
    refactoring/rewriting some of them (e.g. version switching could badly
    use some love).

    Mopy/bash/patcher/patchers/races_multitweaks.py:
    Don't complain about unused RACEs

    this

commit 8d1772547430d3134e53f2ca961ec4551ee6ffe3
Author: Infernio <infernio@icloud.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 13 17:51:04 2020 +0200

    Use displayName to store game info

    Since Nehrim and Oblivion will share the same fsName, we need to use
    something that's definitely unique - so switch to using display names.

    Necessitates renaming a bunch of images, unfortunately. Took this
    opportunity to fix their case for eventual Linux support.

    Mopy/bash/game/oblivion/__init__.py:
    Change game detection file for Oblivion, in preparation for Nehrim
    support

commit 4999ad21f509c27b428c951ad34d4014567721d2
Author: Infernio <infernio@icloud.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 13 17:46:53 2020 +0200

    Allow only one game master per game

    This variable (bush.game.masterFiles) was created for the half-baked
    Nehrim support we're dropping on this branch. Skyrim and FO4VR used it
    incorrectly, it's meant to be used for alternative master files that can
    completely replace the original one.

    Follow-up might be to drop bosh.modInfos.masterName? Not sure that's a
    good idea though.
