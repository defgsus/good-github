[Fix] Did a lot in the textures and models folder [READ DESCRIPTION]

Y'all ready for this

This shit is gonna require a lot of fixing in the code, and I'm very sorry, but this makes life easier, trust. 

Basically what I did was adding folders to sort all the textures that I have, renaming them in the process to keep the names consistent with PBR naming standards. Along with this, I renamed the semi-auto rifle to the marksman rifle, just to make it sound a bit better. Oh, and it includes the new fixed textures for the chests, the last push had the lights on the back.

[MIRROR] [READY] Adds pineapple juice, creme de coconut, Pina Colada; adds Painkiller drink; adjusts Bahama Mama and pineapple snowcone (#1247)

* [READY] Adds pineapple juice, creme de coconut, Pina Colada; adds Painkiller drink; adjusts Bahama Mama and pineapple snowcone (#48783)

This adds two drink ingredients: creme de coconut (a coconut liqueur obtainable in the booze dispenser) and pineapple juice (obtainable in the soda dispenser or via juicing pineapples). It further adds the Pina Colada and Painkiller cocktails & corresponding sprites, and it adjusts the recipe for Bahama Mama. The recipe for pineapple snowcones was also adjusted to require pineapple juice rather than pineapple slices.

Finally, pineapple juice can be found in a carton or craftable juice box, and I've added sprites for this.
Why It's Good For The Game

First off, more drink ingredients equal more realistic drink mixes and more variety, which means more fun for bartenders.

Pineapple snowcones are better off using pineapple juice as opposed to pineapple slices. Previously the recipe called for two pineapple slices; you can now juice those two pineapple slices to produce pineapple juice sufficient for the snowcone.

Regarding the changes to the Bahama Mama recipe: With these changes, the recipe now more closely represents the classic Bahama Mama, which involves coconut, coffee, rum, and pineapple juice as its base ingredients. I removed orange juice to prevent conflict with the Painkiller recipe, but also feel justified in doing so because orange juice is not an essential ingredient of a Bahama Mama, nor is lime.
Changelog

🆑
add: pineapple juice, creme de coconut
add: Pina Colada cocktail
add: Painkiller cocktail
add: pineapples and pineapple slices can be juiced
tweak: Bahama Mama recipe, pineapple snowcone recipe
imageadd: pineapple juicebox sprite, pineapple juice carton sprite, Painkiller sprite, Pina Colada sprite

stop worrying and love global macros

I was afraid of global namespace pollutions but later, it turned out
that we define __has_attribute in intern.h anyways.  Let's stop
worrying.  Just make these macros public.

Doing so, however, is not as easy as simple copy & paste business.
There are several reasons why:

 - In contrast to private headers, public ones might be included from
   other language than what we write Ruby itself; namely C++.  We have
   to make it sure that our headers are valid for all possible
   situations.

 - Public headers might be included from extension libraries, and their
   compiler options might vary.  We have to brace the differences, by
   carefully insering pragmas to suppress warnings.

cool & good update

- Bosses don't show 2 healthbars
- part 1 of making sure all mob variants get Roughmobs raw stat attributes (follow range, knockback resistance for zombs, etc.)
Next up: skeletons and creepers
- spiders are 10% faster
- all wolves are beefier and faster so they don't die in 1 hit and make you sad
- all bears are tougher. have you ever knocked back a bear with a punch? I don't think so
- removed dungeon tactics rings and magic tether (it was just a more OP and cheaper recall potion)
- removed sausage-in-bread, beef wellington, and mob foods from harvestcraft (first two had way few ingredients and were the 2nd best level of food in the game. rest removed for balance/not infinite food from monster hordes. there's already so much fun food in this pack. mob soup will be added back later with a new ingredient)
- haha funny chef rat recipes

Push farther on the K2 demo (which uses structs).

I ran into one significantly different requirement that structs surface
which maps and other basic Data Model stuff didn't: in order to track
"doneness" invariants across a whole structure, we need the final
interation on the child NodeAssembler (meaning the call to either
the "Assign*" or the "Done" methods, depending on whether *that*
system was used recursively) to update the parent's state machine and
let it know it's now correct for it to progress.  (So far so good;
*that* part is the same for basic maps and lists.)  The trouble is...
with maps, we could easily do this with one wrapper type; for structs,
which may have different types per field, this is a lot less trivial!

There's now a commentstorm in the 'map_K2_T2.go' file exploring
alternatives for solving this.  As usual, there are tradeoffs, and
no single obviously correct choice.
(E.g., the fastest, most inliner-friendly choice involves significant
bloat to the generated code size and binary, so that one's certainly
not a slam dunk.)
Building a large enough prototype to disambiguate which of identified
solution paths for this will perform best is of course a nice idea,
but the volume of code that has to manifest to provide a sufficiently
realistic benchmarkable prototype is... well, not looking feasible;
we'll be better off doing a first draft of all codegen with a randomly
chosen solution, and then trying variations from there.

(Amusingly/headdeskingly, at some point I had it in my head that this
call-up'ing situation was going to be one of the downsides unique to
the alternate plans that kept the old builder interface plus "freezing"
marks, and that this redesign jumped over it; alas, no, that was silly:
both designs need this for similar reasons.  (This design is still
lighter in other ways, though.))

But!  None of this is looking like show-stoppers, just Hard Choices.
So, I'm going to table this -- and instead switch back to filling out
the rest of the "ipldfree" next gen node kinds, and then, combined
with the confidence we already have from those benchmarks in the
previous few commits... start porting interface changes into core!

(And just... assume everything will go according to plan when it's
time to come back to this codegen stuff we're tabling here.
If it doesn't... that'll be fun.)

Oh!  Also seen here: a slight improvement to the map assembler
state machine tracking, now using an enum rather than bool.
This is definitely a good idea and I'm going to lift it back to the
other map implementations immediately, even if much of the rest of
the poor 'map_K2_T2.go' file is sadly being left in a storm of todo's.

"9:45am. I am up. This time my sleep was better, but I am still quite stressed.

Yesterday, I suggested Deep CFR, but my contrary desires are at full force here. I do not trust deep anything when it comes to RL. And even if I make that agent, then come the interfaces.

Done properly, those interfaces could be the most interesting part of the whole journey, and I would be stuck doing nasty hacks instead.

Basically, Deep CFR is an invitation for doing sloppy work everywhere. Tabular RL is great, but that is as far as my trust goes.

9:50am. Last year, that whole theorem proving adventure was started by the my mistrust of real numbers in some way.

The most sensible continuation would be to go to spikes.

"> This is similar to how deep neural networks were before LeCunn applied backpropagation for their training.

Maybe SNNs having the restriction of not being able to use backprop directly will be an advantage in the long run. Backprop is like a black hole of understanding - it is a tiny piece of learning that prevents one from seeing the full picture. Being forced not to rely on differentiability might lead to fundamentally new insights of what learning really is."

I wrote this as a reply in that thread I posted yesterday.

I really do not feel motivated to work when I am full of doubt like now. What I really feel like doing is going down the path I believe in.

Spikes aren't necessary the higher data structures that would make ML makes sense. If I wanted to understand ML, it certainly would not occur to me use them personally.

But nature could do it. And rather than trying to figure this out ourselves, it might be better to swallow the ego and just learn this by imitating somebody smarter.

9:55am. Forget RL. Eventually the path will be there and one will be able to race continually closer to goal.

What I need to do is thus - let me start the review here. I might as well do that now that I am undecided.

"Last month was unusual for me as for the first time in the last 5 years I decided to do some vacationing. Back in December I was so disgusted at math that I decided to start work on [Spiral v0.2](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language/tree/v0.2), but more like an reaction that planned move forward. For the first time, I was completely aimless and unsure how to make progress on my various goals.

I was really rough towards classical logic and its offspring like set theory, but in review, even if finitists had won the math foundation war of the early 20th century would I really have what I wanted right now? I was mad enough to blame all my ills on infinitists, but...the reality of the situation is that regardless of mathematical talent or aptitude nobody could have anticipated the progress in deep learning in the last decade. There are very many smart people who can write proofs about this or that thing, but the reality is that even for some very simple ML algorithms, nobody can really say that they understand them.

Last year, I just jumped to a conclusion that I need more math skill - because what else could I do at that point? It was the only thing left, so obviously learning type theory and how to hack Coq and Agda has to be the answer, right?

But now that this effort has been done, one thing I can really appreciate is just how little far logical thinking can get one. Logic is weak. And proofs aren't really understanding. The reality is that you need understanding to do a proof, but if you do not have understanding then type theory will not help you get it. And if you understand something, then the harsh reality is that you do not need to do a proof.

In this quest for AI, I can't trust myself and I can't trust others. That leaves only [nature](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ev5p1m/d_spiking_neural_networks_a_primer_with_dr/) left.

Back in 2016 when I was working on my ML library in F# back which would eventually lead to Spiral, Theano was still a thing, Tensorflow had just come out and was Linux only, and neuromorphic chips were far off future that I did not need to think about. What used to be fiction in the past is getting closer to being reality by the day. And right now is the time when I should seriously start thinking about making the neuromorphic backend for Spiral.

My theorem proving adventure of 2019 was from the start spurned by wanting to look into how differentiability and floats interface with each other. Things like stability problems in RL and GAN training, and long term credit assignment issues cannot be solved from within the current framework of deep learning. I always had the opinion that it should be possible to add more structure that would reveal what learning is in starker contrast, but this basic research question is something I have no idea how to do.

And admittedly, back when I was forming those views it completely slipped my mind to consider the fact that actual brains use spikes for communication. So rather than elaborating the floats, the way to go forward might be to get rid of differentiability altogether. Haskell as a language is rather inspiring in this regard - it being pure is a large restriction that spurned a lot of innovation in programming technique. Spiking NNs should have the same effect on ML research.

To me the question is less about the spikes, and more about getting out of the dead end that is deep learning. Once learning without differentiability is understood, that will feedback into doing ML properly on regular architectures that use floats for communication between layers.

Looking back at the last 5 years, my stated goal was always to make a poker agent. But I am glad I took the long way around and tempered my enthusiasm with skepticism even if it was misdirected. And even though it was a huge drain on time, I did have fun discovering new programming techniques and getting better as I worked on Spiral. Pretty much everything I know about ML is of low value, but the actual programming that I've learned is definitely something that I hold in high regard. It would just be too bad to stop here before I've managed to share any of my insights about programming with the world.

I need to try again. I have too much experience to leave this work unfinished.

This time I can do Spiral properly. Neuromorphic chips are the proper target. Spiking NNs are the proper substrate for lifelike agents.

Once the pieces are in place, I will be able to do what I really wanted which is practical ML in the real world as opposed to this meme thing that exists right now."

11:10am. I am not done yet.

"Let me talk a bit about the future.

There is an enormous power waiting to be unleashed in ML. For me poker is merely the most sensible starting point. Supposing I had the agent, the next challenge after that is interesting in its own right.

I am talking about interfacing with the online gaming sites - since money is at stake, those sites are at this moment the most sophisticated Turing tests one can imagine..."

...Ah, no. Forget it. I do not feel like it. I am just bullshitting at this point. I thought I would talk about the Singularity for a bit, but it is not coming to me. I said all that I wanted to.

11:30am. Yeah, the reason why I failed is that I did not have the pieces ready. Somebody else might have been able to hack things through from what exists, but there are all sorts of programmers and I am not the one who can stand sloppy work.

11:35am. Maybe an artist is what you are rather than what you become?

Or maybe there is a reason why I decided not to become a programmer after high school. I really want to just be a specific kind of programmer. Doing it any other way does not hold my interest.

Now...let me take a break here.

I've been thinking about those closures a lot and I think I'll leave doing this for later. This piece is rather complex and I am not confident that I want to be doing it now before I have the language up and running.

Once I do the basic tests, it will be the first thing on the list.

Today I'll just do the basic join points and then move on to the rest after that.

I thought I would be done with the partial evaluator before the end of the month. I am certainly behind schedule.

11:40am. Tsk. Forget that hard stuff. I am really going to do it this time.

Without a doubt, I will get my hands on those chips and then wait with my net spread out."

#### Wednesday 2020-01-29 14:37:37 by Marko Grdinić

"1:10pm. Done with breakfast. Next are chores and chilling.

2:05pm. Done with that.

2:10pm. Now it is time to start, but let me focus inwardly for a bit.

I am thinking how I would talk the guy into hiring me 1-2 years from now, but that is the wrong mindset to be in.

It does not really matter what happens to Spiral. What matters is that I use my full power to reach my goals.

2:15pm. I am so rattled. I really do not feel like programming.

I said that thing about wanting to try evolagos, and now I am aiming for neuromorphic chips.

Yeah, there is definitely pain of not being able to aim towards my goals directly.

But it just goes to show how weak the trust in my ideas were that once I saw something even remotely realistic, I immediately ditch them.

2:20pm. Instead of working today, why don't I turn off and step away from the screen for a while?

Yeah, that is what I will do.

I just came up with the neurochip goal yesterday and presented it today here.

But as a result, now I am changing my direction again. Yesterday I said I would do Deep CFR, and now I suddenly do not feel like it because it would be sloppy work.

2:25pm. I really, really wanted to figure it out, but I knew that it would be unrealistic from the start. Even though I knew, it does not stop it from hurting. I just had to show my determination. I just had to test myself at how far I can go. I just had to take the responsibility for doing it myself.

Patience - a viable strategy, but a painful word for me.

I feel like I have a responsibility to make the Singularity come as soon as possible. I took it upon myself.

But now that I know the task of understanding learning is beyond the capacity of humans, the smart thing to do would be to change strategies and just like I am letting the work of creating hardware to others, to let the neuroscientists figure out the secrets of spiking NNs.

2:30pm. I am absolutely sure. I've tried my best during 2018-2019 and I know for certain that I cannot beat nature's design. I am supposedly a good programmer, but I am nothing much when the big picture is considered. Those lofty heights of programming skill are surely reserved for the post-human entities of the future who I want to be one of.

2:35pm. It is ironic that human technology compared to nature is more primal. It is one that taps into the core virtues of reality. Maybe that is because humans are weak, so they have to do it properly in order to ensure that it works.

Two years...

Two years...

Two years...

What will happen in two years? These chips will be out...and there should be something to make good use of them. Yesterday in one of the videos the speaker said that bee brains were realistic and that human brains are too complex, but he is not being realistic.

If bee brains are here, then human brains won't be too far behind.

2:40pm. The truth is at this point the Singularity is making me sick. Here I am trying to squeeze some kind of a plan here into a timeframe where the long term does not give me a risk of death - nor do I want my family members to just slip through the cracks of time, but the real world is going at its own pace.

2:45pm. Just where are neuromorphic chips now?

Where will they be in 2030 for example?

Pretty much all ML advancements are just buzzing around the hardware. Hardware is what acts as a catalyst to everything else.

2:55pm. https://www.extremetech.com/computing/295043-intels-neuromorphic-loihi-processor-scales-to-8m-neurons-64-cores

8m neurons compared to the brains 100b. Also Loihi has 1k synapses for every neuron so I'll assume this applies here as well.

"“With the Loihi chip we’ve been able to demonstrate 109 times lower power consumption running a real-time deep learning benchmark compared to a GPU, and 5 times lower power consumption compared to specialized IoT inference hardware,” said Chris Eliasmith, co-CEO of Applied Brain Research and professor at University of Waterloo. “Even better, as we scale the network up by 50 times, Loihi maintains real-time performance results and uses only 30 percent more power, whereas the IoT hardware uses 500 percent more power and is no longer real-time.”"

109 times lower power consumption than a GPU.

Upgrade the process a little, figure out the memristors, and 100b neurons on a chip sounds doable. Of course the brain will have a lot more complex architecture, is analog, so it might be much more powerful pound for pound.

But still...

Let me just update the review. A bit. I need to highlight just how humiliated I am at not being able to take advantage of the great programmability advantages on present hardware.

3:10pm. "I feel shame very strongly over this state of affairs.

I've lost, but it is not to other programmers or mathematicians. Rather if I have lost to somebody, it would be nature. I have such strong beliefs and conviction and yet despite the huge advantages that being able to program the hardware directly provides I am not able to convert that potential into actual power. But that does not change that the potential is still there waiting to be tapped."

Yeah, I am mad at the mathematicians as well, but being mad at nature is where the benefits will be.

"If I am to be mad or to hate the lack of progress, the place I should direct that effort is definitely nature. It is there that this sort of dedication will have merit."

3:20pm. I definitely felt the hate when I wrote this.

3:25pm. Let me go back to what I was writing.

I need to focus on this vision. In 2030 and most likely even sooner, the bee brain tier of power and skill should definitely be here. This is the worst case scenario, and even in it I should have enough leeway to move properly with the insights derived from brain research initiatives.

3:30pm. This was actually my mindset back before 2014 when I was having fun with futurism.

I need to get back to it. Forget about causing the Singularity by some fixed date. The self improvement loop will swallow me when the time comes.

I do not owe it to anybody to do it in 2022 or whatever.

If it happens by 2030 then that is fine. If it happens by 2040 then that is fine too. I will do my utmost - not to hold out that long, but to have fun in the interim.

That is what matters the most.

3:30pm. I need to regain the spark towards the future. I need to have joy in making Spiral.

I need to feel like I am making real progress, not just so I can make some agent or whatever, but for its own sake.

3:35pm. Now as I said, I would let me step away from the screen and I will just take a nap for a few hours.

I want to dwell on this feeling. When it bursts, I will come back and resume work on the language.

I vow one thing no matter what. I will never again clown around by saying I want some agent, or get frustrated when results inevitably do not arrive at the schedule I would like. I am absolutely through with that.

There is only one reason to make Spiral - because I am the only one who can.

And because I am the best."

cake
My best friend Ben and I have known each other for two and a half years.
To put that in perspective, Romeo and Juliet only knew each other for less than four days.
So, we're closer than those two ever were.
Ben and I used to hang out at least three times a week.
We would grab dinner, see movies, and watch hockey games together.
We had what some people call a 'bromance'.
At time passed, we slowly drifted apart.
Life became busy.
Free time became scarce.
Laughter became a memory.

StrongPassword

Louise joined a social networking site to stay in touch with her friends. The signup page required her to input a name and a password. However, the password must be strong. The website considers a password to be strong if it satisfies the following criteria:

Its length is at least .
It contains at least one digit.
It contains at least one lowercase English character.
It contains at least one uppercase English character.
It contains at least one special character. The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()-+
She typed a random string of length  in the password field but wasn't sure if it was strong. Given the string she typed, can you find the minimum number of characters she must add to make her password strong?

Abundance / In The Reeds · Kennebec

Form is everything. It is the secret of life. Find expression for a sorrow, and it will become dear to you. Find expression for a joy, and you intensify its ecstasy. Do you wish to love? Use Love's Litany, and the words will create the yerning from which the world fancies that they spring. Have you a grief that corrodes your heart? Steep yourself in the language of grief, learn its utterance from Prince Hamlet and Queen Constance, and ou will find that mere expression is a mode of consolation and that Form, which is the birth of passion, is also the death of pain.

Pre-update alpha publishing

Almost completed the chapter on distributions (on complete there will be a dev. diary, the third so far).
Added some subsectioning on that chapter following the same approach on the chapter on series representation. Planning to do so for all the chapters.
Probably going to update the chapter on series either before or after dev. diary 3, depends on how many days I have left before the exam and how deep I can go down the rabbit hole while exercising on virtually everything written up there.

## Major coming updates
As I'll exercise on the arguments I'll start adding some solved and unsolved exercises taken from various sources (they'll be cited in the proper exercise).
Solved exercises will be listed as examples, others will probably will be put in a final section of every chapter. 
For inquiries and doubts don't wait a second and write me a mail here: cheri.1686219@studenti.uniroma1.it.
Thanks again for following this, it's indescribable how this work is interesting more people other than me, I hope that you'll feel the same as I felt while writing this. A huge thanks to every single one of you that'll read this, when I finish everything I'll also write some intro. Love ya ~Matt

"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/the-red-hot-ai-chip-space-gets-even-hotter-with-56m-for-a-startup-called-sambanova/

Rather than stepping away I am reading some of these articles. Yeah, that space really is hot.

5:50pm. I am back. I did some thinking.

I am not going to give up. The brain is a very specific data structure with its own laws. Once I know what they are I will be able to do the kind of programming that I want. Without a doubt. I will never stop believing this. It is not some continuous function with nonlinearities inbetween but something else.

It will definitely be found. Absolutely.

SNNs are the only answer answer.

5:55pm. Just as that article says, there are a lot of players in the SNN space. Rather thinking of just Intel, with Spiral I should be targeting every one of them.

I need to start thinking about advertising myself and Spiral in this space.

Right now I do not have much to show, but I really should finish v0.2 in the next year and then start hunting for sponsors.

6pm. I will absolutely resume work tomorrow.

Work hard and then play hard, that is the way to live. I need to start making progress rather than just lying in bed.

That having said, I did have some insight.

```
            | TyPair(a,b) -> memo <| TyPair(f a, f b)
            | TyKeyword(a,b) -> memo <| TyKeyword(a, Array.map f b)
```

I need to stop memoizing pairs, keywords and records. Why?

```
inl q = a,b
inl w = a,b
join f q w
```

I would prefer if this got specialized the same way as...

```
inl q = a,b
join f q q
```

But because I am memoizing by reference here it won't.

What I need to do is memoize only the vars and the functions.

Also the vars are a problem.

```
| TyV of TyV
```

Ugh, note that they are only compared by their tag. Do not want to do that in the join points.

```
    // For use in join points, layout types and macros
    | TyRV of Ty
    | TyRR of int
```

Let me break everything like this. I'll fix this tomorrow.

6:05pm. Well, rather than not memoizing pairs and such outright, what I should do is not turn them into `TyRRs`. I just have to do that. But using reference memoization to just speed things up is fine for all of them.

6:10pm. So with this, I did do a bit of work today.

In the end I've resolved to make SNNs a channel for my ML urges and hopes, and decided to make Spiral a product viable for widespread consumption. When I have that, I am going to be an entrepreneur and get paying work for the first time in my life. One of those startups will bite. Spiral will definitely have a market, I just need to push it a bit.

6:15pm. Until then, all I need to do is keep a steady pace and do a bit of work every day. V0.2 will get finished, I will be better than ever having both perfected Spiral and mastered unification via constraint solving, neurochips will arrive and SNNs will bloom.

Everything will be hunky dory.

6:20pm. I need to give it my best. I can't just assume that I will have v0.2. The only way that will happen is if I do not take it for granted and actually put in the effort every day.

I am going to start this tomorrow.

First I will redo the renaming function from scratch and then do the join points. Then I'll aim to do the rest. I'll leave the closures for part two after I can see what is going on with them in the generated code.

I am not going to leave myself room to get stressed. Instead I am going to reduce everything to their limits and then strike.

One piece at a time, I will get v0.2 done, just like I had the previous version."

Drop Fedora support. I'm fully on macos currently

My biggest issues with Fedora:
- Area screenshots often contain a highlighted overlay, which is definitely
  a GNOME bug, but it hasn't been fixed yet in over 2 years.
- Some of my GNOME extensions have broken over time, and I'm
  too lazy to search for alternatives (which I guess would break
  as well).
- Tilix at some point removed ability to make terminal tabs narrow,
  so navigating through them has become a fucking madness.
- There're no as good and convenient picture editing software
  on Linux as the bundled macos's Preview.
- Sublime Merge sucks ass to Fork.
- Linux doesn't have AirPlay, whilst apple tvs are everywhere around.
- AirDrop is very convenient too.

Do CafInfo/SRT analysis in Cmm

This patch removes all CafInfo predictions and various hacks to preserve
predicted CafInfos from the compiler and assigns final CafInfos to
interface Ids after code generation. SRT analysis is extended to support
static data, and Cmm generator is modified to allow generating
static_link fields after SRT analysis.

This also fixes `-fcatch-bottoms`, which introduces error calls in case
expressions in CorePrep, which runs *after* CoreTidy (which is where we
decide on CafInfos) and turns previously non-CAFFY things into CAFFY.

Fixes #17648
Fixes #9718

Manual inspection of programs in testsuite/tests/programs
---------------------------------------------------------

I built these programs with a bunch of dump flags and `-O` and compared
STG, Cmm, and Asm dumps and file sizes.

(Below the numbers in parenthesis show number of modules in the program)

These programs have identical compiler (same .hi and .o sizes, STG, and
Cmm and Asm dumps):

- Queens (1), andre_monad (1), cholewo-eval (2), cvh_unboxing (3),
  andy_cherry (7), fun_insts (1), hs-boot (4), fast2haskell (2),
  jl_defaults (1), jq_readsPrec (1), jules_xref (1), jtod_circint (4),
  jules_xref2 (1), lennart_range (1), lex (1), life_space_leak (1),
  bargon-mangler-bug (7), record_upd (1), rittri (1), sanders_array (1),
  strict_anns (1), thurston-module-arith (2), okeefe_neural (1),
  joao-circular (6), 10queens (1)

Programs with different compiler outputs:

- jl_defaults (1): For some reason GHC HEAD marks a lot of top-level
  `[Int]` closures as CAFFY for no reason. With this patch we no longer
  make them CAFFY and generate less SRT entries. For some reason Main.o
  is slightly larger with this patch (1.3%) and the executable sizes are
  the same. (I'd expect both to be smaller)

- launchbury (1): Same as jl_defaults: top-level `[Int]` closures marked
  as CAFFY for no reason. Similarly `Main.o` is 1.4% larger but the
  executable sizes are the same.

- galois_raytrace (13): Differences are in the Parse module. There are a
  lot, but some of the changes are caused by the fact that for some
  reason (I think a bug) GHC HEAD marks the dictionary for `Functor
  Identity` as CAFFY. Parse.o is 0.4% larger, the executable size is the
  same.

- north_array: We now generate less SRT entries because some of array
  primops used in this program like `NewArrayOp` get eliminated during
  Stg-to-Cmm and turn some CAFFY things into non-CAFFY. Main.o gets 24%
  larger (9224 bytes from 9000 bytes), executable sizes are the same.

- seward-space-leak: Difference in this program is better shown by this
  smaller example:

      module Lib where

      data CDS
        = Case [CDS] [(Int, CDS)]
        | Call CDS CDS

      instance Eq CDS where
        Case sels1 rets1 == Case sels2 rets2 =
            sels1 == sels2 && rets1 == rets2
        Call a1 b1 == Call a2 b2 =
            a1 == a2 && b1 == b2
        _ == _ =
            False

   In this program GHC HEAD builds a new SRT for the recursive group of
   `(==)`, `(/=)` and the dictionary closure. Then `/=` points to `==`
   in its SRT field, and `==` uses the SRT object as its SRT. With this
   patch we use the closure for `/=` as the SRT and add `==` there. Then
   `/=` gets an empty SRT field and `==` points to `/=` in its SRT
   field.

   This change looks fine to me.

   Main.o gets 0.07% larger, executable sizes are identical.

head.hackage
------------

head.hackage's CI script builds 428 packages from Hackage using this
patch with no failures.

Compiler performance
--------------------

The compiler perf tests report that the compiler allocates slightly more
(worst case observed so far is 4%). However most programs in the test
suite are small, single file programs. To benchmark compiler performance
on something more realistic I build Cabal (the library, 236 modules)
with different optimisation levels. For the "max residency" row I run
GHC with `+RTS -s -A100k -i0 -h` for more accurate numbers. Other rows
are generated with just `-s`. (This is because `-i0` causes running GC
much more frequently and as a result "bytes copied" gets inflated by
more than 25x in some cases)

Extra compiler allocations
--------------------------

Runtime allocations of programs are as reported above (NoFib section).

The compiler now allocates more than before. Main source of allocation
in this patch compared to base commit is the new SRT algorithm
(GHC.Cmm.Info.Build). Below is some of the extra work we do with this
patch, numbers generated by profiled stage 2 compiler when building a
pathological case (the test 'ManyConstructors') with '-O2':

- We now sort the final STG for a module, which means traversing the
  entire program, generating free variable set for each top-level
  binding, doing SCC analysis, and re-ordering the program. In
  ManyConstructors this step allocates 97,889,952 bytes.

- We now do SRT analysis on static data, which in a program like
  ManyConstructors causes analysing 10,000 bindings that we would
  previously just skip. This step allocates 70,898,352 bytes.

- We now maintain an SRT map for the entire module as we compile Cmm
  groups:

      data ModuleSRTInfo = ModuleSRTInfo
        { ...
        , moduleSRTMap :: SRTMap
        }

   (SRTMap is just a strict Map from the 'containers' library)

   This map gets an entry for most bindings in a module (exceptions are
   THUNKs and CAFFY static functions). For ManyConstructors this map
   gets 50015 entries.

- Once we're done with code generation we generate a NameSet from SRTMap
  for the non-CAFFY names in the current module. This set gets the same
  number of entries as the SRTMap.

- Finally we update CafInfos in ModDetails for the non-CAFFY Ids, using
  the NameSet generated in the previous step. This usually does the
  least amount of allocation among the work listed here.

Only place with this patch where we do less work in the CAF analysis in
the tidying pass (CoreTidy). However that doesn't save us much, as the
pass still needs to traverse the whole program and update IdInfos for
other reasons. Only thing we don't here do is the `hasCafRefs` pass over
the RHS of bindings, which is a stateless pass that returns a boolean
value, so it doesn't allocate much.

(Metric changes blow are all increased allocations)

## [the-tcpdump-group/libpcap](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap)@[a973128a85...](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/commit/a973128a85d7dd75c7ea6fdcf746fc143a987d03)
#### Wednesday 2020-01-29 22:26:13 by Guy Harris

On Linux, return error on interface going away, not just going down.

This is a pain to detect, because the PF_PACKET socket code appears to
get separate "interface went down" and "interface went away"
notifications in my "unplug a USB Wi-Fi adapter" tests on my VMware
Fusion Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine (5.3.0 kernel), and the first
notification delivers a wakeup and returns ENETDOWN while the second
notificaiton delivers *no* wakeup and sets the ifindex member of the
struct packet_sock for the socket, so there's nothing we can test after
the wakeup that's guaranteed to indicate that the interface has
disappeared.

So what we have to do is remember the ENETDOWN but not return it as an
error, and then arrange to periodically check whether the interface is
still there; if it isn't, we *then* return the "interface went away"
error, and, if we see traffic or see that the interface is up, we clear
the remembered ENETDOWN and stop doing the periodic checks.

This is tricky, because it needs to work not only for blocking pcap_t's,
where we're in a loop doing poll() calls, so we can keep checking within
the loop, but also for non-blocking pcap_t's on which the caller is
doing select()/poll()/epoll_wait().

In order to make *that* work, we need to tweak the semantics of
pcap_get_required_select_timeout() so that it's not guaranteed that it
will always return the same value, so that it should be called within
event loops rather than called once outside the event loop.  Normally,
there is no timeout required for Linux PF_PACKET sockets, but when we're
doing the periodic tests, the timeout is required.

While we're doing that, we make the return value of
pcap_get_required_select_timeout() a const pointer - there was no good
reason for the caller to modify it (it doesn't belong to the caller).

If poll() returns POLLERR, use getsockopt(SO_ERROR) to get the socket
error, rather than a read().

Update the documentation to reflect this, and make various other
cleanups (including documenting the error return value for
pcap_get_selectable_fd() to -1 rather than PCAP_ERROR - it's not an
error code, it's just a specific error value).  Also note that, for
kqueues on *BSD/macOS and for select/poll on Linux, the timeout needn't
be used as a timeout for the call - you can have a timer, so that when
that *particular* timer fires, you try calling pcap_dispatch() on the
pcap_t to which it corresponds.

Update selpolltest to add more capabilities needed when testing this on
Linux.

Adds referential integrity to the 'about this site'

Thank you Jasmine for speaking with me. The time we shared is possibly a scheduled substance and I have abuse issues. I'm really sorry you couldn't completely fix the mental health issues that the company, the blog, and my independent work have compromised. I'm still here for you and your friends should you need to lean on me. With much appreciation, I am glad we met in the nick of time.
