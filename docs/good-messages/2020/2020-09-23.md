added page banner, intro for each section

- We'll need to change the page banner, it's ugly and doesn't convey enough information about the committees... Need to think about how to avoid redundancy with committee descriptions on main page while still conveying enough info for this page to make sense on its own (perhaps get design involved?)
- Links still need to be updated for the socials, what you see is just a placeholder
- intro section for each committee section is roughly in-place, will be making several more changes

Fixes scars sticking around after a limb is dismembered (#53763)

During dismemberment from wounds, some scars would stick around even though the limb was no longer attached to the person. This was because I removed the scars from the person before removing the wounds, which itself would create more scars that would still be tied to the victim's scars. This fixes that, and tidies up some related code as well. Notably, you can now see which types of wounds a detached limb is suffering from by sight. Also, I have no clue what happened before when you attached a limb with existing wounds to someone, but I've made sure it applies the wounds to the person where they left off.

I also realized I made an order of operations error in the self-treatment for broken bones (with the bone gel and surgical tape) on the bone gel step, which made failing these treatments and briefly passing out/wasting a use of the gel 38 percentage points more likely than intended. This corrects that, so the base is 25%/45% failure for severe/critical blunt wounds. It also raises the bonuses to succeeding you get from painkillers a bit since you're going through a lot of trouble for all this already.

The saga continues. This creepers now inhibits updates so I can override his dumb configurations that parses all my work in code and writing. 

I need to this person lose electronic access and computer work. This dude imposes his misery and failures on others.

Typo

Lesson learned boys and girls... Test your code before deploying it to production.

Note to self: I need to have a better local test environment that better matches production.

adding sha256sum output

the last build showed gpg on the GitHub shared runner running Ubuntu is somehow still v2.2.4

Ah, so the reason why gnupg is still stale on the GitHub runner is because it's an old version of Ubuntu = Bionic = 18.04 LTS. That version is, yes, v2.2.4

 * https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/gnupg

It looks like we can, in fact, switch from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04 by changing 'ubuntu-latest' to 'ubuntu-20.04' (no fucking clue how latest isn't actually the latest *facepalm*), but I'm afraid even that would be a mismatch between Debian 10

#### Wednesday 2020-09-23 14:31:10 by Marko Grdinić

"4:25pm. I am up. I had time to think about this.

I need to redesign the prepass. I know where I went wrong.

First of all, let me backtrack to how the type definitions were before. Forget about using generics.

Instead the correct thing to do here is the same thing I did during parsing and type inference - loosen up the type definitions just a little so that I have the flexibility to do the work that I need to do efficiently.

```fs
    let next i x = free_vars i env (match annot with Some annot -> x + ty annot | None -> x)
    match x with
    | Choice1Of4 x -> next 0 (term x)
    | Choice2Of4 x -> next 0 (ty x)
    | Choice3Of4 (id, x) -> next 1 (term x - id)
    | Choice4Of4 (id, x) -> next 1 (ty x -. id)
```

Consider this shit. That I am writing code like this really, really bothered me. But within the constraints of how `E` was defined I really had no choice.

I am going to do it differently.

```fs
            cp id pat on_succ on_fail
        List.foldBack loop l EPatternMiss
```

Oh yeah, let me do one thing here.

```fs
and compile_clauses env clauses = List.map (fun (pat,on_succ) -> let x,env = make_compile_pattern_env env pat in x,pat,EPatternMemo(term env on_succ)) clauses
```

I should not be putting `EPatternMemo` here.

```fs
            cp id pat on_succ (EPatternMemo on_fail)
        List.foldBack loop l EPatternMiss
    and compile_clauses env clauses = List.map (fun (pat,on_succ) -> let x,env = make_compile_pattern_env env pat in x,pat,term env on_succ) clauses
```

Let me do this instead.

I'll do the same thing in the typecase compiler.

Now let me back up the work that I did thus far. Let me commit here."

"4:35pm. Done to a chore.

```fs
type FreeVarsEnv = {|free_vars : int []; stack_size : int|}
```

I'll aim for this to be a finished product.

4:40pm.

```fs
    | EFun of Range * FreeVars * Id * E * T option
    | EForall of Range * FreeVars * Id * E
    | EJoinPoint of Range * FreeVars * E * T option
```

This will also be a finished product.

```fs
    | EFun' of Range * FreeVars * Id * E * T option
    | EForall' of Range * FreeVars * Id * E
    | EJoinPoint' of Range * FreeVars * E * T option
    | EFun of Range * Id * E * T option
    | EForall of Range * Id * E
    | EJoinPoint of Range * E * T option
```

This is the correct choice. Now...

```fs
| EFreeVars of FreeVars
```

Time for this.

I'll do the same thing for `T`.

```fs
    | TArrow' of Range * FreeVars * Id * T
    | TArrow of Range * Id * T
    | TFreeVars of FreeVars
```

There. This should loosen it up a bit.

Now, I will separate the initial pass from the propagation one...

Actually, no. I need an alternative `FreeVars`.

```fs
type FreeVarsEnv' = {|free_vars : int []; max : int; min : int|}
type FreeVars' = {term : FreeVarsEnv'; ty : FreeVarsEnv'}
```

This is good.

```fs
let propagate env x annot =
```

This will significantly simplify propagate. That having said, let me comment it out for the time being.

4:50pm.

```fs
    and pattern_function env r clauses annot =
        match clauses with
        | [PatVar(_,x), on_succ] ->
            let id,env = add_term_var env x
            EFun(r,id,term env on_succ,annot)
        | _ ->
            let id,env = fresh_term_var env
            EFun(r,id,compile_pattern id (compile_clauses env clauses),annot)
```

Now that I do not have to think about free vars in the first step, that makes things a lot easier for me.

4:55pm. Let me refactor the first function.

5pm. Forget Hagure Idol. Focus on programming. Damn it, I won't get anything done today at this rate. I need to focus. Let met put in another few hours. I will do this until I am done.

5pm. Ugh...

```fs
| EForall(_,a,_,_) | EJoinPoint(_,a,_,_) | EFun(_,a,_,_,_) -> propagated_vars a // No need to eval the optional types for join points and functions.
```

This is not as planned. I mean, looking the propagate function now it would be an enormous pain in the ass to rebuild the whole AST.

Reference equality dictionaries? Yes.

Let me bring them in.

5:10pm.

```fs
    let (+) (a : PropagatedVars) (b : PropagatedVars) : PropagatedVars = {
        term = {|vars = Set.union a.term.vars b.term.vars; max_var = max a.term.max_var b.term.max_var |}
        ty = {|vars = Set.union a.ty.vars b.ty.vars; max_var = max a.ty.max_var b.ty.max_var |}
        }
```

Ah, fuck. It is so annoying getting the min now. Let me just do it as I go along.

```fs
let free_vars i (env : Env) (x : PropagatedVars) : FreeVars = {
    term = {|free_vars = Set.toArray x.term.vars; stack_size = max 0 (x.term.max_var-env.term.i) + i |}
    ty = {|free_vars = Set.toArray x.ty.vars; stack_size = max 0 (x.ty.max_var-env.ty.i) + i |}
    }
```

Let me get rid of this.

```fs
let propagate env x =
    let dict = Dictionary(HashIdentity.Reference)
    let vars = Dictionary(HashIdentity.Reference)
    let (+) (a : PropagatedVars) (b : PropagatedVars) : PropagatedVars = {
        term = {|vars = Set.union a.term.vars b.term.vars; max = max a.term.max b.term.max; min = min a.term.min b.term.min |}
        ty = {|vars = Set.union a.ty.vars b.ty.vars; max = max a.ty.max b.ty.max; min = min a.ty.min b.ty.min |}
        }
    let (-) (a : PropagatedVars) i = {a with term = {|vars = Set.remove i a.term.vars; max = max i a.term.max; min = min i a.term.min |} }
    let (-.) (a : PropagatedVars) i = {a with ty = {|vars = Set.remove i a.ty.vars; max = max i a.ty.max; min = min i a.ty.min |} }
    let empty' term ty = let f x = {|vars = x; max=0; min=System.Int32.MaxValue|} in {term = f term; ty = f ty}
    let empty = empty' Set.empty Set.empty
    let singleton_term i = empty' (Set.singleton i) Set.empty
    let singleton_ty i = empty' Set.empty (Set.singleton i)
    let vars x v = vars.Add(x,v); v
```

This should do nicely.

```fs
    let (-) (a : PropagatedVars) i = {a with term = {|vars = Set.remove i a.term.vars; max = max i a.term.max; min = if 0 <= i then min i a.term.min else a.term.min |} }
    let (-.) (a : PropagatedVars) i = {a with ty = {|vars = Set.remove i a.ty.vars; max = max i a.ty.max; min = if 0 <= i then min i a.ty.min else a.ty.min |} }
```

Whops, forgot that recursive statements can be negative. Don't want't to take the min of those.

5:30pm.

```fs
let vars x v = vars.Add(x,v); v
```

Ah, yes. In vars I also need to empty the scope count.

```fs
let vars x (v : PropagatedVars) = vars.Add(x,v); empty' v.term.vars v.ty.vars
```

Easiest way to do it is like this.

```fs
let scope x (v : PropagatedVars) = vars.Add(x,v); empty' v.term.vars v.ty.vars
```

Let me rename this to scope.

5:40pm.

```fs
let propagate x =
    let dict = Dictionary(HashIdentity.Reference)
    let (+) (a : PropagatedVars) (b : PropagatedVars) : PropagatedVars = {
        term = {|vars = Set.union a.term.vars b.term.vars; max = max a.term.max b.term.max; min = min a.term.min b.term.min |}
        ty = {|vars = Set.union a.ty.vars b.ty.vars; max = max a.ty.max b.ty.max; min = min a.ty.min b.ty.min |}
        }
    let (-) (a : PropagatedVars) i = {a with term = {|vars = Set.remove i a.term.vars; max = max i a.term.max; min = if 0 <= i then min i a.term.min else a.term.min |} } // Recursive vars are negative and get inlined so they should be ignored when calculating the range of a scope.
    let (-.) (a : PropagatedVars) i = {a with ty = {|vars = Set.remove i a.ty.vars; max = max i a.ty.max; min = if 0 <= i then min i a.ty.min else a.ty.min |} }
    let empty' term ty = let f x = {|vars = x; max=0; min=System.Int32.MaxValue|} in {term = f term; ty = f ty}
    let empty = empty' Set.empty Set.empty

Today it turns out I was mostly cleaning up, but I did get this done at least. This is the core of the resolution pass. It is really a big thing - without it I would't be able to compile local mutually recursive statements.

6:05pm. I am a bit behind schedule, but I will finish the resolution of recursives and scope lowering tomorrow. I'll merge both of them into a single pass.

Actually, what made me decide to it like that just now is the realization that recursive blocks will be eliminated from the finished product. Since recursive blocks have negative ids, I can just get rid of them and this will simplify things greatly.

```fs
type ResolveEnv = Map<int,E * Set<int>>
```

Since I will be doing that, there is no way this is right.

```fs
type ResolveEnv = { term : Map<int,E>; ty : Map<int,T>; term_rec_free_vars : Map<int,Set<int>> }
```

Not much choice but to do it like this. This is for the best.

Oh yeah, for once the that I decided to inline global recursives right away was the right choice. I am glad I did that as it will make things a lot more straightforward.

6:10pm. I am tired as hell right now and my stress is high, but there will be absolutely nothing from finishing this tomorrow. I really should have gotten the design right the first time around, but that is the way things go sometime.

Let stop here for the day."

experimental new feature: proxy_dns_daemon

since many users complain about issues with modern, ultracomplex
clusterfuck software such as chromium, nodejs, etc, i've reconsidered
one of my original ideas how to implement remote dns lookup support.
instead of having a background thread serving requests via a pipe,
the user manually starts a background daemon process before running
proxychains, and the two processes then communicate via UDP.
this requires much less hacks (like hooking of close() to prevent
pipes from getting closed) and doesn't need to call any async-signal
unsafe code like malloc(). this means it should be much more compatible
than the previous method, however it's not as practical and slightly
slower.

it's recommended that the proxychains4-daemon runs on localhost, and
if you use proxychains-ng a lot you might want to set ip up as a service
that starts on boot. a single proxychains4-daemon should theoretically
be able to serve many parallel proxychains4 instances, but this has not
yet been tested so far. it's also possible to run the daemon on other
computers, even over internet, but currently there is no error-checking/
timeout code at all; that means the UDP connection needs to be very
stable.

the library code used for the daemon sources are from my projects
libulz[0] and htab[1], and the server code is loosely based on
microsocks[2]. their licenses are all compatible with the GPL.
if not otherwise mentioned, they're released for this purpose under
the standard proxychains-ng license (see COPYING).

Add files via upload

initial base with signup/login system.
The goal here is to setup a complete, yet secure, inventory control system that can be quickly tailor made to fit any business.
Software is all glitter and flash these days; too much bs. 
This program will allow the user to quickly setup and customize a complete inventory control system within just a few hours/days.
And, being a singular batch program this system is lightweight and causes NO lag time as with many modern software.

Remember boyz n girlz; around here we stick to K(keep)I(it)S(simple)S(stupid)
so that our software runs like it should with nothing bogging down efficiency.
