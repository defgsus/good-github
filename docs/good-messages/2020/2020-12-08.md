Captain's Log 2020 Day 8: It has been so long since our sleigh crash landed on the Antarctic shore that I'm not sure if I'm hallucinating or not, but I see Newton creeping up behind me. The crew are telling me that it is just an illusion and that I have nothing to worry about, but I fear the lack of sleep may be getting to them because when I double back, I see footsteps in the ice. I hope the howling winds die down tomorrow, so we can sleep well tonight and get our wits back. Everyone appears to be a little on edge, yours truly included. I just hope we do not turn on one another. -Oliver Ren

Evil hack to work around SDL bug 4700.

Check if we're in the requested mode after the fullscreen window was
created. If not: Try to switch again in the requested mode by calling
SDL_SetWindowDisplayMode(). If that's successfull set the new window
size with SDL_SetWindowSize(). That shouldn't be necessary, at least to
SDLs crappy doku, but without the subsequent SDL_GetWindowDisplayMode()
call fails with 'Invalid Window'. Use that call to check if we're now
in the requested mode. If yes, process. If not abort and trigger the
fallback magic. It'll set `r_mode 4` and `vid_fullscreen 0`.

Caveat: In the worst case this will switch the display mode 3 times.
To create the window, to work around the bug and to set a refresh rate.
No problem for flat panels, but my unforgotten Trinitron CRT would
have cried in pain.

U: massive enchancements

Things turned out less trivial than they seemed to me.
Script now understands arguments (thx j4-dmenu-desktop sources for the
hints). Script is still faster than i3-dmenu-desktop and maybe a bit
slower than j4-dmenu-desktop but it's hardly noticeable even on my old
EeePC (yeah, they are still alive. God bless Void and Debian teams for
supporting the 32-bit architecture).

path-finding: source-based, mistakes, missing piece (#512)

- feerate vs "fee rate"  : so far we have always used "fee rate" (2 words). I would stick with this for consistency. Also it is better English as feerate is an invented term.
- you wrote "FREERATE" --> ha ha very funny, a Freudian slip, but sorry, it will not be free. ;) smiling
- uppercasing
- commas
- avoid extremes and hype, avoid "very" : very expensive --> expensive
- successfull -> ...ful (one L)
- sentence simplifications
- Onion vs onion, lowercase or uppercase, since this is not a product name it should be lowercase
- the example does not contain the information needed, added "forward" field in onion
- some part missing from a sentence
- etc

signing: major change to use app keys by default

We now use new application-specific keys and certificates for included apps
like Chromium / webview, Microg, and F-Droid, instead of relying on the
device-specific `releasekey`.  This allows us to share these keys between
multiple devices, push the same app updates to multiple devices, and remove an
ugly SELinux workaround for GrapheneOS that robotnix required.

Unfortunately, changing app keys will lose any data associated with those apps.
Fortunately, most data associated with those apps should be easy to re-create.
(Re-login to services in chromium, re-add F-Droid repos, etc.)
I hope to avoid breaking changes like this in the future by getting these
changes done relatively early in the projects' life.

If you've previously generated robotnix keys, you will need to do the
following to update to the new key directory layout: Move all keys and
certificates beginning with `com.android` from the device subdir (e.g.
`crosshatch`) under your `keyStorePath` to the parent directory. The files
beginning with `releasekey`, `platform`, `shared`, `media`, `networkstack`,
and `avb`/`verity` (if you have it) are device-specific, and should remain
under the device subdirectory.  For example, I ran the following command on my
machine:
 ```shell
$ mv /var/secrets/android-keys/crosshatch/com.android.* /var/secrets/android-keys/
 ```
After this, re-run `generateKeysScript` to create new application keys (e.g.
Chromium, F-Droid).
