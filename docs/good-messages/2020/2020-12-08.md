Update index.html

Put the id div as a div containing the container for the our phylosophy section
<div id="Our Philosophy">	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
<div class="row padding">
    <div class="col-lg-6">   
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We know that greatness in a disruptive era requires bold ambition, 
        curious talent and a culture that believes we're smarter together.</p>
        <p>We approach every challenge holistically, with best-in-class expertise
        in data, creativity, media, technology, search, social and more. We call 
        this Alchemy. It has the power to build our clients' brands and transform 
        their business. And while it may seem like magic, we've got it down to a science.</p>
