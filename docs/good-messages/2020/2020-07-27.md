wgengine/magicsock: deflake some tests with an ugly hack

Starting with fe68841dc7649162c43849beb2fcf9a2ad80ee7c, some e2e tests
got flaky. Rather than debug them (they're gnarly), just revert to the old
behavior as far as those tests are concerned. The tests were somehow
using magicsock without a private key and expecting it to do ... something.

My goal with fe68841dc7649162c43849beb2fcf9a2ad80ee7c was to stop log spam
and unnecessary work I saw on the iOS app when when stopping the app.

Instead, only stop doing that work on any transition from
once-had-a-private-key to no-longer-have-a-private-key. That fixes
what I wanted to fix while still making the mysterious e2e tests
happy.
