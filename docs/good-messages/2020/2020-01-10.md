As much as I am British, I am also practical and if the would of programming decides to use the American spelling then who am I to stand in the way. It does remind me of a conferance call at Nokia when an American colleague decided to point out that we had spelt colour wrong in the brand 'deck'... I think it was the Finish that found this the most amusing, the brits just rolled their eyes. True story. He will now have the last laugh as I decide that I have in fact spelt colour wrong. I would contest that I simple didn't write it effeciantly enough :-). If this ever appears in a tweet I will be amazing. Maybe this is a new craze #CommitStories If you are reading this from the future then hello! How is our planet doing, she was suffering from an autoimmune disorder the last I checked.

One of my favorite Thanksgiving classics!

It was just before Thanksgiving and I wanted to use what I learned from the HTML and CSS modules in my web development course.   Since I love cooking and my friends always ask me to write down my recipes, I decided to start by creating this mini web page just in time for Thanksgiving.  Give me a star if you tried this recipe and liked it.  If you would like to see more, follow me here on Github.  ^_^

controller: add some thoughts about remaining effort

The controller was originally written to target the execution of a
template hook, so it's missing a nice separation between the setup and
render phase. I've added some thoughts about this, and some reminders
about which parts are remaining to demonstrate a full set of
functionality.

Also, since this is a proof of concept, the code is a bit rough, so I've made
notes to remind myself of the improvements I was thinking about when
imagining the polished version of the code.

drm/i915: Fix MST disable sequence

When moving the pipe disable & co. function calls from
haswell_crtc_disable() into the encoder .post_disable() hooks I
neglected to account for the MST vs. DDI interactions properly.
This now leads us to call these functions two times for the last
MST stream (once from the MST code and a second time from the DDI
code). The calls from the DDI code should only be done for SST
and not MST. Add the proper check for that.

This results in an MCE on ICL. My vague theory is that we turn off
the transcoder clock from the MST code and then we proceed to touch
something in the DDI code which still depends on that clock causing
the hardware to become upset. Though I can't really explain why
Stan's hack of omitting the pipe disable in the MST code would avoid
the MCE since we should still be turning off the transcoder clock.
But maybe there's something magic in the hw that keeps the clock on
as long as the pipe is on. Or maybe the clock isn't the problem and
we now touch something in the DDI disable code that really does need
the pipe to be still enabled.

drm/i915/sdvo: Implement proper HDMI audio support for SDVO

commit d74408f528261f900dddb9778f61b5c5a7a6249c upstream.

Our SDVO audio support is pretty bogus. We can't push audio over the
SDVO bus, so trying to enable audio in the SDVO control register doesn't
do anything. In fact it looks like the SDVO encoder will always mix in
the audio coming over HDA, and there's no (at least documented) way to
disable that from our side. So HDMI audio does work currently on gen4
but only by luck really. On gen3 it got broken by the referenced commit.
And what has always been missing on every platform is the ELD.

To pass the ELD to the audio driver we need to write it to magic buffer
in the SDVO encoder hardware which then gets pulled out via HDA in the
other end. Ie. pretty much the same thing we had for native HDMI before
we started to just pass the ELD between the drivers. This sort of
explains why we even have that silly hardware buffer with native HDMI.

$ cat /proc/asound/card0/eld#1.0
-monitor_present		0
-eld_valid		0
+monitor_present		1
+eld_valid		1
+monitor_name		LG TV
+connection_type		HDMI
+...

This also fixes our state readout since we can now query the SDVO
encoder about the state of the "ELD valid" and "presence detect"
bits. As mentioned those don't actually control whether audio
gets sent over the HDMI cable, but it's the best we can do. And with
the state checker appeased we can re-enable HDMI audio for gen3.

"10:05am. I went to bed pretty late, but I slept well. Well, it is time to slack. I do not really feel like starting now. It is my vacation and everything, I'll put in the effort later. I've found the English rip of Infinite Dendogram vol 2 and I want to read it. LHscans picked it up as well, so maybe we'll see the other volumes translated in a timely manner as well.

The threads on /a/ about it are always a joy to lurk in.

I saw a while ago that Himenospia will be ending soon. That is really lame. There was a lot of foreshadowing, but that means nothing now - no world war, no shadow war, no human extinction, no nothing. Just the MC licking the floor of her jail cell. Vol 1 of Himenospia was beyond amazing, but now I expect nothing of it.

10:10am. *ahem* Much like I do not expect anything of the field of ML right now.

In fact, that has always been the case. I've always been a true believer in its long term potential, but in the short term I've opted to cast many nets as an expression of my skepticism. I've channeled my skepticism into learning and trying to reason through the algorithms I've looked into. That desire is completely broken now.

Now, I will channel my skepticism through the use of evolutionary methods.

Much like I've dropped type theory in favor of mastering the low style, I will also drop higher order optimizers like KFAC in favor of various tricks. I will use my 'reversibility' ideas to separate out the RL from the SL aspects and that will make KFAC irrelevant. I won't be able to use it smoothly with reversibility anyway and it is just going to be dead weight there.

Also it is incompatible with some of newer tricks that I want to use.

This kind of tends to be the usual outcome with fancy things. You bet on Zap and then realize it does nothing for CFR. You bet on KFAC, and then discover the principles of reversibility. You aim for understanding and then far too quickly reach your limits, realizing that the truest expression of understanding are the programs themselves.

10:20am. I am not going to fail again. This time I will play God without irony.

Let me stop here. Rather than ranting, let me vacation. I'll take care of the let statements and whatever else is needed when it is time to start."

However, since your website domain (as igorprado.com) has already expired, in this way, the demo page of [react notification system] would not be able to be visited.

[lldb/CMake] Change how we deal with optional dependencies

Recently there has been some discussion about how we deal with optional
dependencies in LLDB. The approach in LLVM is to make things work out of
the box. If the dependency isn't there, we move on silently.

That's not true for LLDB. Unless you explicitly disable the dependency
with LLDB_ENABLE_*, you'll get a configuration-time error. The
historical reason for this is that LLDB's dependencies have a much
broader impact, think about Python for example which is required to run
the test suite.

The current approach can be frustrating from a user experience
perspective. Sometimes you just want to ensure LLDB builds with a change
in clang.

This patch changes the optional dependencies (with the exception of
Python) to a new scheme. The LLDB_ENABLE_* now takes three values: On,
Off or Auto, with the latter being the default. On and Off behave the
same as today, forcing the dependency to be enabled or disabled. If the
dependency is set to On but is not found, it results in a configuration
time warning. For Auto we detect if the dependency is there and either
enable or disable it depending on whether it's found.

Differential revision: https://reviews.llvm.org/D71306

PS: The reason Python isn't included yet is because it's so pervasive
that I plan on doing that in a separate patch.

fix(ingame-terminal): Fixed improper const string allocation.

Also I decided to standardize std::string use throughout this
API because me having a conniption over const cstring allocation
wasn't getting me anywhere. Also I discovered after doing some
research that ImGui does window name "namespace" management
builtin. So I was trying to do a nothingburger. That's been
eliminated. I think everything else is good so far.

--------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------

If you shit on me again Barney I'm going to take your purple
ass and chuck you off a cliff. Not really, I'll probably just
cry about it (literally because I have a minor god complex
and having someone else be better than me is absolutely the worst
most degrading thing ever) and then convince myself that I'll
somehow be better than you if I use the current opportunity as
a learning experience (even though I know I'm not better than
anyone, and no one is better than me; we're all equal in the eyes
of time & the universe and whatnot because there is no scale)
Inevitably comming back with my ego bruised and better work
accomplished. So please, don't stop giving me good advice
even if I may cry because of it.

I do appreciate that all the problems weren't addressed at once,
because I know the first time I felt like you were just shitting
on me to halt progress, even if that wasn't your intent. Not having
to stare at a wall of disappointment on my own end is nice.

I don't know atm what could help us collaborate better / help me
learn faster / stop me from dying on the inside when I make mistakes
so just keep doing you and being a good reviewer.

Good news is when I deem something important enough I almost never
forget it; and because I hyperfixate over programming I shouldn't
make the same mistakes again.

I've also just came from a C/C++ hiatus doing things in Python,
Javascript, and a lot of higher level programming languages. Totally
giving myself excuses because I feel like shit about making you
spend extra time on my PR when I feel like I should have known
better.

sched/core: Implement new approach to scale select_idle_cpu()

Hackbench recently suffered a bunch of pain, first by commit:

  4c77b18cf8b7 ("sched/fair: Make select_idle_cpu() more aggressive")

and then by commit:

  c743f0a5c50f ("sched/fair, cpumask: Export for_each_cpu_wrap()")

which fixed a bug in the initial for_each_cpu_wrap() implementation
that made select_idle_cpu() even more expensive. The bug was that it
would skip over CPUs when bits were consequtive in the bitmask.

This however gave me an idea to fix select_idle_cpu(); where the old
scheme was a cliff-edge throttle on idle scanning, this introduces a
more gradual approach. Instead of stopping to scan entirely, we limit
how many CPUs we scan.

Initial benchmarks show that it mostly recovers hackbench while not
hurting anything else, except Mason's schbench, but not as bad as the
old thing.

It also appears to recover the tbench high-end, which also suffered like
hackbench.
