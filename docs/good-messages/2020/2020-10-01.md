ext2 block allocation, pmm bug fix

Slowly moving towards a functional ramfs with the ability to mark a
block as used.

The real reason for this commit is the bug fix though: while figuring
out a better alternative to my stupid `equal_n` function, I added
`strncmp` to my libc (I had forgotten the existence of memcmp...), and
suddenly, my terminal stopped working.
Armed with the experience of recent bugs, I got the feeling it might be
related to my out-of-binary static variables being non-zero at program
launch, and added that guarantee. It fixed the problem.
However, paint was still crashing at launch: garbage program code being
executed. Tracing where the corruption occured, the paging code appeared
to be the culprit, and I debugged that for too long without success. A
day later, it occured to me that my paging code being correct, it could
access an invalid virtual address. Physical pages were affected, so
perhaps they were mis-attributed? A quick 2 a.m. code review of the code
responsible for marking a span of physical memory as used led me to
notice that the last block to mark wasn't being marked unless the span's
size was a multiple of the block size... It fixed things up.

Create Simple Fun #1: Seats in Theater

Your friend advised you to see a new performance in the most popular theater in the city. He knows a lot about art and his advice is usually good, but not this time: the performance turned out to be awfully dull. It's so bad you want to sneak out, which is quite simple, especially since the exit is located right behind your row to the left. All you need to do is climb over your seat and make your way to the exit.

The main problem is your shyness: you're afraid that you'll end up blocking the view (even if only for a couple of seconds) of all the people who sit behind you and in your column or the columns to your left. To gain some courage, you decide to calculate the number of such people and see if you can possibly make it to the exit without disturbing too many people.

Given the total number of rows and columns in the theater (nRows and nCols, respectively), and the row and column you're sitting in, return the number of people who sit strictly behind you and in your column or to the left, assuming all seats are occupied.

Create I love you, a little , a lot, passionately ... not at all

Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

I love you
a little
a lot
passionately
madly
not at all
When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say for a flower of a given number of petals, where nb_petals > 0.

give up for tonight

it works now, but the simulator movement is still wonky. hopefully

#### Thursday 2020-10-01 10:02:36 by Marko Grdinić

"9:10am. I am up. And I slept great.

9:20am. I want to start early today.

9:45am. Or I could go for the Strike Witches thread instead. Yeah, I need my chilling. No way am I just starting right off the gate. Let me catch up with the thread and then I will make the first step. Which is filling out the type partial evaluator cases one by one.

Ok, focus me.

```fs
    | TArrow' of Range * Scope * Id * T
    | TArrow of Range * Id * T
    | TJoinPoint' of Range * Scope * T
    | TJoinPoint of Range * T
    | TUnit of Range
    | TV of Id
    | TPair of Range * T * T
    | TFun of Range * T * T
    | TRecord of Range * Map<string,T>
    | TUnion of Range * Map<string,T>
    | TSymbol of Range * string
    | TApply of Range * T * T
    | TPrim of Range * Config.PrimitiveType
    | TTerm of Range * E
    | TMacro of Range * TypeMacro list
    | TNominal of Id
    | TArray of Range * T
    | TLayout of Range * T * BlockParsing.Layout
```

Let me go through all of these in turn. It will be much easier the the term stuff. But even considering the term stuff, I am OP now. Assuming I can get my bearings, I can plow through it.

9:55am. Just what is the power that I seek? In my loneliness, I can't help but wonder what I trully identify with?

Effort, perseverance, will...how can it compare to the mind controlling power of the machines? Believe in the machines of your own creation.

If I try to accomplish anything on my own I will undoubtedly fail. It is beyond a single human's ability to oppose the combine power of society, but the power machines can change and grow to eventually eclipse any obstacle in its path.

10am. So much internal drama is just churn. Let today be another day where I stayed true to my desire. Let me put down the necessary pieces. When the partial evaluator is done I will be able to rest more easily. I will have a surplus of time for the first time in a while. I will have the option to decide on the next step and the leeway to think about what comes ahead.

Spiral v0.2 needs completion.

And I am obviously the only one who can do it.

10:05am. Strong desire like I have cannot ultimately win in the end. Anybody looking at the story of my life would just be predicting the point where I break. But if I can take that desire and turn it into a computer program, I can make it sharper, stronger and unbreakable. The ideal will is possible.

I need to get to the point where I can interact with the programs of my making in a much more direct fashion.

And towards that end, I might as well start by offloading my burdens to the computer.

Spiral v0.2 needs completion.

I want to aim higher. Rather than just completing my agents, I'll make Spiral v0.2 pay for itself and along the way I will even break Python's dominance in ML.

All of that is something that would be worthy of me.

10:10am. I am not going to be in poverty for that much longer. At some point my skill at programming will start paying off.

10:15am. Programming is bound to attain mind controlling properties at some point. At it source it is moving symbols around, but at its poeak it is the idealization of control.

I might be on the path on transcendence, but when I suffer, it is because I cannot believe anything. Indeed, I made my plans but positive reinforcement has not been coming quickly and in large enough quantities.

Nevertheless, I must move on. When I complete the partial evaluator things will get easier. I will be able to start work on more meaningful things. So let me get a move on this.

The partial evaluator is a blast from the past. I've been through this numerous times before, and this time I will get a perfect grade on the test.

10:20am. Let me spend today's time wisely.

Put down the first case.

```fs
    and ty s x =
        match x with
        | TArrow'(_,scope,i,body) ->
            assert (i = scope.ty.stack_size)
            YTypeFunction(body,Array.map (vt s) scope.ty.free_vars,scope.ty.stack_size)
```

Good. Let me do the next one.

```fs
| TJoinPoint'(_,scope,body) ->
```

Now come the type join point.

```fs
| JPType of T * ConsedNode<Ty []>
```

This should indeed be the key, but I do not need an explicit node to push so let me remove it.

10:35am.

```fs
        | TJoinPoint'(r,scope,body) ->
            let dict, hc_table = Utils.memoize join_point_type (fun _ -> Dictionary(HashIdentity.Structural), HashConsTable()) body
            let join_point_key = hc_table.Add(s.env_global_type)
            match dict.TryGetValue(join_point_key) with
            | true, Some ret_ty -> ret_ty
            | true, None -> raise_type_error s "Type join points must not be unboxed during their definition."
            | false, _ ->
                assert (0 = scope.term.free_vars.Length)
                let s : LangEnv = {
                    trace = r :: s.trace
                    seq = ResizeArray()
                    cse = [Dictionary(HashIdentity.Structural)]
                    i = ref 0
                    env_global_type = Array.map (vt s) scope.ty.free_vars
                    env_global_term = [||]
                    env_stack_type = Array.zeroCreate<_> scope.ty.stack_size
                    env_stack_term = Array.zeroCreate<_> scope.term.stack_size
                    }
                dict.[join_point_key] <- None
                let ret_ty = ty s body
                dict.[join_point_key] <- Some ret_ty
                ret_ty
```

Let me go with this.

10:35am. Now the next case.

10:45am.

```fs
| YTypeFunction of body : T * ty : Ty [] * ty_stack_size : StackSize
```

Damn it, this thing has only one stack size. This makes things complicated.

10:55am.

```fs
and term_seq s x = term_seq' {s with seq=ResizeArray(); i=ref !s.i; cse=Dictionary(HashIdentity.Structural) :: s.cse} x
```

Let me make this like so.

```fs
    and term_scope' s x =
        let x = term s x
        let x_ty = data_to_ty s x
        seq_apply s x, x_ty
    and term_scope s x = term_scope' {s with seq=ResizeArray(); i=ref !s.i; cse=Dictionary(HashIdentity.Structural) :: s.cse} x
```

Let me rename it to this as well.

11:05am.

```fs
    and ty s x =
        match x with
        | TArrow | TJoinPoint -> failwith "Compiler error: Should have been transformed during the prepass."
        | TArrow'(_,scope,i,body) ->
            assert (i = scope.ty.stack_size)
            YTypeFunction(body,Array.map (vt s) scope.ty.free_vars,scope.term.stack_size,scope.ty.stack_size)
        | TJoinPoint'(r,scope,body) ->
            let dict, hc_table = Utils.memoize join_point_type (fun _ -> Dictionary(HashIdentity.Structural), HashConsTable()) body
            let join_point_key = hc_table.Add(s.env_global_type)
            match dict.TryGetValue(join_point_key) with
            | true, Some ret_ty -> ret_ty
            | true, None -> raise_type_error (add_trace s r) "Type join points must not be unboxed during their definition."
            | false, _ ->
                assert (0 = scope.term.free_vars.Length)
                let s : LangEnv = {
                    trace = r :: s.trace
                    seq = ResizeArray()
                    cse = [Dictionary(HashIdentity.Structural)]
                    i = ref 0
                    env_global_type = Array.map (vt s) scope.ty.free_vars
                    env_global_term = [||]
                    env_stack_type = Array.zeroCreate<_> scope.ty.stack_size
                    env_stack_term = Array.zeroCreate<_> scope.term.stack_size
                    }
                dict.[join_point_key] <- None
                let ret_ty = ty s body
                dict.[join_point_key] <- Some ret_ty
                ret_ty
        | TB -> YB
        | TV i -> vt s i
        | TPair(_,a,b) -> YPair(ty s a, ty s b)
        | TFun(_,a,b) -> YFunction(ty s a, ty s b)
        | TRecord(_,a) -> YRecord(Map.map (fun _ -> ty s) a)
        | TUnion(_,a) -> YUnion(Map.map (fun _ -> ty s) a)
        | TSymbol(_,a) -> YSymbol a
        | TApply(r,a,b) ->
            let s = add_trace s r

            | YRecord a ->
                match ty s b with
                | YSymbol b ->
                    match Map.tryFind b a with
                    | Some x -> x
                    | None -> raise_type_error s <| sprintf  "Cannot find key %s in the record." b
                | b -> raise_type_error s <| sprintf "Expected a symbol in the record application.\nGot: %s" (show_ty b)

                let b = ty s b
                let s =
                    {s with
                        env_global_type = gl_type
                        env_global_term = [||]
                        env_stack_type = Array.zeroCreate<_> ty_stack_size
                        env_stack_term = Array.zeroCreate<_> term_stack_size
                        }
                s.env_stack_type.[0] <- b
                ty s body
            | a -> raise_type_error s <| sprintf "Expected record, nominal or a type function.\nGot: %s" (show_ty a)
        | TPrim(_,a) -> YPrim a
        | TTerm(_,a) -> term_scope s a |> snd
        | TMacro(r,a) -> let s = add_trace s r in YMacro(a |> List.map (function TMText a -> Text a | TMType a -> Type(ty s a)))
        | TNominal i -> YNominal env.nominals.[i]
        | TArray(_,a) -> YArray(ty s a)
        | TLayout(_,a,b) -> YLayout(ty s a,b)
```

Here it is.

11:10am. Now the next step is to implement nominal unbox.

11:15am. Focus me. This morning has been quite good so far.

Focus...Let me do that unbox and then I'll consider taking a break. It won't be too tough now that I've come to this point.

11:20am.

```fs
    and nominal_eval s x =
        match x with
        | YApply(YTypeFunction(body,env_global_ty,term_stack_size,ty_stack_size),b) -> failwith "TODO"
        | YApply(a,_) -> raise_type_error s <| sprintf "Expected a type level function in nominal application.\nGot: %s" (show_ty a)
        | YNominal a -> ty s a.node.body
        | _ -> raise_type_error s <| sprintf "Expected a nominal or a nominal application.\nGot: %s" (show_ty x)
```

Got the easy stuff out of the way. Let me deal with the actual apply now.

```fs
            | YTypeFunction(body,gl_type,term_stack_size,ty_stack_size) ->
                let b = ty s b
                let s =
                    {s with
                        env_global_type = gl_type
                        env_global_term = [||]
                        env_stack_type = Array.zeroCreate<_> ty_stack_size
                        env_stack_term = Array.zeroCreate<_> term_stack_size
                        }
                s.env_stack_type.[0] <- b
                ty s body
```

This is in `ty`.

11:25am.

```fs
    and nominal_apply s x =
        match x with
        | YApply(YTypeFunction(body,gl_type,term_stack_size,ty_stack_size),b) ->
            let s =
                {s with
                    env_global_type = gl_type
                    env_global_term = [||]
                    env_stack_type = Array.zeroCreate<_> ty_stack_size
                    env_stack_term = Array.zeroCreate<_> term_stack_size
                    }
            s.env_stack_type.[0] <- b
            ty s body
        | YApply(a,_) -> raise_type_error s <| sprintf "Expected a type level function in nominal application.\nGot: %s" (show_ty a)
        | YNominal a -> ty s a.node.body
        | _ -> raise_type_error s <| sprintf "Expected a nominal or a nominal application.\nGot: %s" (show_ty x)
```

Here it is. Nice.

Now I can implement `ty_to_data` properly.

11:30am.

```fs
    let rec ty_to_data s x =
        let rec f = function
            | YB -> DB
            | YPair(a,b) -> DPair(f a, f b)
            | YSymbol a -> DSymbol a
            | YRecord l -> DRecord(Map.map (fun _ -> f) l)
            | YUnion | YLayout | YPrim | YArray | YFunction | YMacro as x -> let r = DV(L(!s.i,x)) in incr s.i; r
            | YNominal | YApply as a -> DNominal(nominal_apply s a |> ty_to_data s, a)
            | YTypeFunction -> raise_type_error s "Cannot turn a type function to a runtime variable."
        f x
```

Perfect.

11:35am. ...

11:40am. I am thinking about union types and how they interact with nominals. The current course I am on is fine.

11:45am.

```fs
| PatUnbox(r,a) -> EOp(r,Unbox,[EV id; cp id a on_succ on_fail])
```

So this is how I deal with pattern unbox.

11:50am.

```fs
| EDefaultLit(r,a,b) -> failwith "TODO"
```

I am thinking what comes next. Right now, I think I have the core set. The icebreaking is done and I am trully through the threeshold.

What I'll do here after I return from the break is start doing all the cases in turn beginning with `EDefaultLit`. I just have to roll up my sleeves and get cracking.

```fs
    and term_scope'' s x =
        let x = term s x
        let x_ty = data_to_ty s x
        seq_apply s x, x_ty
    and term_scope' s cse x = term_scope'' {s with seq=ResizeArray(); i=ref !s.i; cse=cse :: s.cse} x
    and term_scope s x = term_scope' s (Dictionary(HashIdentity.Structural)) x
```

Let me do this like so.

11:55am.

```fs
    let rec ty_to_data s x =
        let f = ty_to_data s
        match x with
        | YB -> DB
        | YPair(a,b) -> DPair(f a, f b)
        | YSymbol a -> DSymbol a
        | YRecord l -> DRecord(Map.map (fun _ -> f) l)
        | YUnion | YLayout | YPrim | YArray | YFunction | YMacro as x -> let r = DV(L(!s.i,x)) in incr s.i; r
        | YNominal | YApply as a -> DNominal(nominal_apply s a |> ty_to_data s, a)
        | YTypeFunction -> raise_type_error s "Cannot turn a type function to a runtime variable."
```

This function used to be so difficult. Remember how in v0.09 I kept using `destructure` everywhere when instead I only needed to do it at key points?

It is really easy for me now, but it is not a trivial thing at all to grasp such an intricate machine that is Spiral's partial evaluator. The way I am doing it now is super obvious and common sense, but it sure was not clear to me years ago.

Abstractions build on one another in the end. I did not get to this point in a day.

12pm. There will be nothing to stop me from finishing this.

Yeah, I have many cases to go through, but now that the core is set, it is like a few dozen or so isolated challenges. And I have the code from last time to guide me. I will crsuh this.

Let me have breakfast, and I will resume this."

vo_gpu: x11egl: cleanup EGL correctly

...probably.

The EGL backend had a strange problem: when recreating the window, EGL
surface creation sometimes mysteriously failed. For example, keeping the
"_" key down (cycles video by default) destroys and recreates the window
in rapid succession, which will often enough show the "Could not create
EGL surface!" message.

This was puzzling because due to mpv's architecture, the X11 Window and
even the X11 Display were fully destroyed, the thread on which they ran
was destroyed, and then everything was recreated. There shouldn't have
been any state that could make subsequent EGL initialization fail.

It turns out mpv forgot to free EGLSurfaces in the x11 code. EGL is a
pretty crazy API (full of thread local and global state with weird
lifetime requirements), and for example it seems EGLDisplay cannot be
explicitly released, but apparently implicitly dies when the native
display is closed (at least EGL 1.5 claims eglTerminate() does _not_
invalidate the display, only certain objects linked to it). It appears
that Mesa still referenced at least EGLSurface in some form, and either
some pointer or some X11 ID was dangling, and when it randomly matched
when eglCreateWindowSurface() was called, it failed.

Fix this by calling eglTerminate(), which supposedly destroys (or rather
unreferences) contexts and surfaces created from the display (but
absurdly not the display itself).

Now why can't you just destroy the display? If it's implicitly
invalidated, why can't it just call eglTerminate() implicitly when this
happens? Did Mesa do something wrong when they somehow didn't
automatically remove the dangling object (so I could claim not to be
responsible for the bug)? Who the fuck knows, and I'm too tired to
figure this out (both because it's late, and because I'm tired of this
EGL crap API).

Still not sure if the code is correct now. I think EGL was designed to
maximize implementation and API-use complications. How else could you
possibly come up with something like the EGLDisplay life cycle? Or am I
just making a fuss? Anyway, fuck EGL, fuck computers, fuck technology.

Fixes: #7129

Fixed user profile so you can view it regardless of if you have a booking or not. Also displays multiple bookings (it's super ugly sorry). Finally, added a home button on the navbar, it's not needed but i think makes for a better user experience to have a link to index on the icon and the dropdown

pdfimage devices - fix %Invocation and add /Info dictionary

I'd thought that we had missed off the %Invocation from the PDF output
of the PDF image devices, but in fact it was only that the pdfocr
devices had it emitted in a surprising place in the file.

That's fixed here just by moving when we write it so that its location
is consistent between the devices.

Moved some definitions common to both pdfimage and pdfocr from the
device's .c files to the pdfimage.h file.

Added emission of a very basic /Info dictionary. To facilitate future
enhancements the number of 'static' (ie predefined) objects has been
turned into a #define and we use that wherever possible instead of the
previous hard-coded magic number. Because of the font objects required
for pdfocr, and the fact that they refer to each other, these still
don't use the #define and will have to be manually adjusted if we ever
change this again.

Acrobat ignores the /Info dictionary, apparently it only reads the XML
/Metadata values (at least in modern versions), so adding the Info
dictionary doesn't help. Creating the XMP metadata is unfortunately
quite complicated, we'd need to steal quite a bit of code from pdfwrite
and at the moment I think its more trouble than its worth. I may change
my mind in future.

[Spike] Query Executor in Rust (#135)

Co-authored-by: Ran Magen <ran@apollographql.com>

![spike](https://media.giphy.com/media/XuSS2uqOPf83K/giphy.gif)

## What this is
This is a spike of a porting the JavaScript [query executor](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/60d974240769aac3e1c75ff968657b2d3e60e9b6/packages/apollo-gateway/src/executeQueryPlan.ts) which takes the query plan generated by the new Rust query planner and does a simple http fetch to the federated service and merges the data back together. This is **not something we should intend to merge**, rather it was a spike to see where things will be tricky as we work to do the port genuinely and where we could slice things for smaller deliverables.

## What do I do with this?
What I would to get out of this exercise is a shared understanding of some of the footguns which may lie ahead, what a common data structure needs to look like for the executor, and some of the challenges (and opportunities) in moving from a single threaded environment to a multi-threaded one. So

1. Don't review this for code quality / idiomatic Rust code. Its not that I'm not looking to improve my Rust, but rather this is a sketch of an idea not a real thing.
2.  Do read through the [main executor](http/src/main.rs). Below is a more detailed guide of what is interesting
3. Do ask questions about the data structures, general shape of the problem.
4. Don't focus on the http parts (tide, parsing of the response, etc). This was just for local testing.

## Detailed Review Notes

- The JS query executor relies heavily on two things to be successful. First, the single threaded nature of JavaScript and second, the ease of interior mutability within that thread. In particular, the `FlattenNode` and the `FetchNode` both mutate the result sink in a way that works if there is only one thread and a shared reference to the sink. For example, [flattenResultsAtPath](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/60d974240769aac3e1c75ff968657b2d3e60e9b6/packages/apollo-gateway/src/executeQueryPlan.ts#L165) mutates the results while creating a zip for subsequent nodes to work on. This is really hard / not what we should do in a world where you have multiple threads and interior mutability isn't really the way to go.
- `RwLock` is incredible. In the executor we need to be able to read from a shared reference at multiple times without block access to the data but block on writes. This is important because prior to sending a fetch we need to read the results to generate variables for downstream requests and we don't want to block on this for every request that is being formed. However, we do need to block on writes so that reads get the updated data correctly. A `Mutex` blocks on both but `RwLock` gets us just what we wanted. You can see where we [create the lock](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/compare/main...jbaxleyiii/gateway-spike#diff-1d121b833f22f1fd43615c8db9fa578bR78) and an example where we [write back to it](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/compare/main...jbaxleyiii/gateway-spike#diff-1d121b833f22f1fd43615c8db9fa578bR293)
- deep merging of json isn't easy. I found a library but am not 100% sure it actually does what we want. It may or may not be why  parallel flatten nodes [don't work](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/compare/main...jbaxleyiii/gateway-spike#diff-1d121b833f22f1fd43615c8db9fa578bR170-R175)
- Instead of manually forking threads, I am relying on [futures to manage promises](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/compare/main...jbaxleyiii/gateway-spike#diff-1d121b833f22f1fd43615c8db9fa578bR109-R117) for me. I'm not sure if this is actually doing what I want it to do but it behaves like `Promise.allSettled` which is similar to the existing one. Maybe we should go more all in on threads here, not sure.
- We are going to need to do [some cloning](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/compare/main...jbaxleyiii/gateway-spike#diff-1d121b833f22f1fd43615c8db9fa578bR215-R227) when it comes time to send requests. Mainly of the variables because these could be used across multiple requests to the executeNode can't take ownership of them. I don't think this is a problem but wanted to flag it here for discussion.
- [Some idioms in JS are just not possible in Rust.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-gateway/src/executeQueryPlan.ts#L206). This is on the whole a good thing and it has already helped to improve this implementation but don't count on a direct port being the same shape in each part. 
- We will need to figure out lifetimes / ownership of the schema within threads so it can be created outside of a request. I [didn't worry about that right now](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/compare/main...jbaxleyiii/gateway-spike#diff-1d121b833f22f1fd43615c8db9fa578bR24-R50) but that is definitely something we will need to do

## Suggested next steps
I think after an initial read through, a pairing session could be a helpful way to talk through this. Overall I'm quite thrilled at how quickly this came together and it makes me even more excited about when we tackle this for real. Let me know if you have any questions! 👍 

## Additional changes
#186 was merged into this one. Its description:

This PR was developed on top of #135

First and foremost, any changes to the existing _executor.rs_ and related code written in #135 are mostly there as **suggestions**. @jbaxleyiii lmk if you want to pair on these or feel free to take / reject parts. I didn't dig too deep into the implementation of the executor yet, I'm going to start doing that this week.

Second: This PR separates out the Stargate library from the binary, for a few reasons:
1. Separating out the business logic from the wrapping server makes for easier testing.
2. The library doesn't choose an async runtime, nor does it assume any specific implementation of an HTTP server.
3. Use actix-web instead of tide; we've discussed these options and feel more comfortable going with a more mature server implementation, as well as one that uses tokio.

@jbaxleyiii If these changes look good, we can merge them into #135 and we can continue from there. If you want to do it differently, lmk!

- [ ] Address `todo!` / `unimplemented!` / `FIXME` in the code
- [ ] Tests for the executor (ideally these should be unit tests on the Stargate library, for coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests. I was thinking we can set up acephei services locally and then the gateway would have `localhost` references to those on different ports, integration tests would be entirely localhost.
- [ ] Add tracing/metrics middleware -- I believe there are some existing crates.
- [ ] Write more log lines so that they're integrated with the logger of the http server (use `env_logger` ?)

Change its schtick: now is a lifesaving item

If you die while wearing the Helm of Undeath, it saves your life... by permanently turning you into a death knight.

Some changes to unchanging-lifesaving interactions were needed to make this work.
1) Lifesaving does not remove intrinsic unchanging
2) Being lifesaved while polyd and unchanging does not rehumanize you

Fix importing this library via CMake

Ugh. I finally tried importing one of my own libraries using
FetchContent and it failed hard.

I thought I had a cool system to prevent accidentally enabling tests
as a subproject. It used a variable that I thought was set depending
on whether the current project name matched the root project name.

Well, the variable wasn't getting set correctly. Instead of evaluating
the current and root project names, it was just assigning the variable
names, as a semicolon separated list, to the variable. CMake said,
"if variable? Yup, looks like variable is set. Let do this thing!"
Well, it said that a lot. Because it was always set.

So, I fixed that by figuring out the correct way of conditionally
assigning a variable in CMake. Cool.

But it wasn't. Nothing changed. The variable was still assigned a
wonky value. I said I was importing this library into one of my own
libraries, right? Yeah, well guess what variable I set in that
project? That's right! The same one! Using the same broken logic!
I'll just go fix-- Wait a minute! My root project is setting the
variable my imported projects use to determine if they are root
projects?? That's not gunna work!

I have decided that user defined CMake variables are the devil and
shouldn't be used. Instead, I evaluate the current and root project
names at each location that is dependent.

That was a fun head scratcher!

I also had to guard the compiler_settings library behind the same
check and figured I shouldn't force a project to use linters if they
didn't ask for them. After all that, guess what the importing project
gets? Just the library they asked for! I will need to fill out the
target features for the library though.
