my god it works even better

New improvements include:
 - DMing the DM who requested the schedule, to avoid noisying up the channel
 - not requiring anyone to copy and paste any stupid bullshit; the date selection is now handled entirely on the web, and posts to the channel automatically.
 - some light security features to make sure people can't just spam the channel willy-nilly.
 - pretty sure I fixed the bug that didn't let a DM choose a night

Fixed text input events with UIM

Alex Baines

I realized overnight that my patch probably broke text input events with UIM, and I confirmed that it does. Can't believe I overlooked that... I've been making stupid mistakes in these patches recently, sorry.

Anyway, *this* one seems to fix it properly. Knowing my luck it probably breaks something else.

This shit is so fucking stupid

Not only will this not work, but getting this far was already a challenge with the terrible documentation.
Will probably try setting up Azure DevOps again since that is at least somewhat easy.

Remove expulsion and allow questing with the leader dead, but at a price

The main point of this feature is to remove the possibility for
unwinnable games via getting expelled from the quest permanently, prior
to questing, with no way back in. Much of the code that does this is
drawn from UnNetHack. A side effect is that a significant barrier (of
gaining a bunch of levels) in pacifist games is removed as well.

The player still gets banished from the quest upon doing things that
would get them banished forever previously. But the quest portal isn't
sealed off, and the leader becomes angry. The leader remains peaceful
until you approach them after being "exiled".

What other variants have done in allowing leader death to open up the
quest is to add measures to make the quest leader harder to kill,
usually at least by making them immune to death rays, and often further
buffs to their combat skills. I don't really like this approach for
three reasons:
1) It doesn't make any flavor sense that quest leaders are inherently
   death-magic-resistant.
2) It seems like it closes off one route of trivializing the battle
   without closing off other routes, not that that is a good solution
   either since it just becomes an arms race between the player and the
   developer.
3) The quest leader is not always supposed to be a powerful warrior
   (e.g. Hippocrates is supposed to be sick and frail; making him a
   beefy fighter would undercut that flavor). It allows for less nuanced
   quests.

So instead of that, I went for a softer disincentive to enter the quest
by way of dead leader, in the form of permanent bad luck penalties.
These exist whether or not you personally kill the leader, and make it
hard for you to keep your luck up, especially in the later game. If you
do kill the leader personally, you are saddled with massive luck and god
anger penalties, because the existing large alignment record penalty was
ineffective on its own. I'm not totally happy with these, since they can
be rectified by altar farming and have no long-term consequences
afterward, but it didn't seem like there was a save-stable way to track
the status of the player killing the leader.

Also, direct kills of quest guardians got smaller (but still
significant) luck and god anger penalties.

Add the bio and projects section.
Vincent you still owe me those 8 minutes remember? Don't you think just because I did it myself means I forgot about those 8 minutes. You think you can avoid giving me help? I've dealt with enough school project classmates to know how to deal with you vincent. Do you think I forgot about you. You WILL help me some time.

I also remember you saying "10 minutes per day" You better give me help or that's going to add up reall fast vincent don't you fucking forget it.

0-127-0 - For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. “Someday is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually, just do it and correct course along the way.

feat(issue): add firebase and extends to trigger the test error

I thought that I made a mistake in the first place but the culprit is coming from Firebase.
These types are so fucked up anyway I just hate that shit.
Well I still hope that a workaround can be found with the createMock function

Set scrollview on the power menu

So why? Because fuck you that's why...

No, you need this for if and when we decide to add more items to the power menu and the
density is too high. Previously if you had more than 5 items, it would cut you off. So
you either had to decide which 5 items you wanted or deal with the jank. That's no longer
the case.

- Added a landscape view so we can set a horizontal scrollview

- Made the power menu dialog all one color. Josh and I talked about this and I previously
made the case to keep it the same but after thinking it over, it looks better all one color.

Fixes my bash prompt

Oh boy. There's a lot I regret in here.

First off, `bash-profile` isn't a thing. I assume that's why the history
of the file has things that don't end up working out. Fixing this by
adding `bash_profile` which.... is the right name for what I wanted. I
imagine I added this when I was first starting out and never questioned
it.

The colors in my PS1 were, AFAICT, never a thing. I can't find any
evidence for them online and I don't believe I had defined those colors
myself in another file, unless I removed it before I created a dotfiles
repo. All of the colors were unset.

Instead of locally having `git-prompt.sh`, which I was having trouble
with anyway, this adds https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt.
This way, I do not have to maintain it (see: the last 5 years with no
changes made to this file). Plus it has a lot of more modern features
that make it more awesome than... whatever I'd been trying to do before
which may or may not have worked.

Also, I learned the differences when bashrc vs bash_profile are loaded.
Basically, what matters is whether it's a shell that you authenticate
into (either with ssh or, in my case, with tmux) or not. Loading one
from the other ensures we always get what we want.
