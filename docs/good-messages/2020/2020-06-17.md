docs: update troubleshooting documentation

Update a few broken links and create a comprehensive troubleshooting
guide. Still needs more detail, particularly since the gopls, modules,
and GOPATH documentation is still missing.

I'd love to delete the FAQ entirely -- anything worth saying
should already be in the documentation, so the information should just
be made more accessible. I tried to delete as much as possible, but some
leftovers will still have to be cleaned up in follow-up CLs. I'll
convert that section to "Known issues" which is more helpful.

Oh my god Joe. You really honestly need help. Please check yourself into a hospital or something. I’m blocking you n



Now since you can’t seem to not contact me. Please leave me alone.

Well, seeing that you unblocked me, let me explain a bit more...
First off, I DID go to a mental hospital, ask my previous coworker who literally drove me there the day after my out-of-body experience, Neal Kahle:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/neal-kahle-6347a861/
and I scared the living SHIT out of all of them.
I have his email: nealkahle@hotmail.com
I'm sure we can retrieve medical records if necessary.
He'd probably be happy to hear from someone like you. He has 4 kids. I've sent him and the group at Interactive Intelligence email updates, but I haven't been allowed to send any new updates recently.
Also two others:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-record-592615126/
https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-feldkamp-901568130/

Now, I know this may seem all very confusing,
so I'd be happy to explain more at any time
