- Returned Farm scenes back to life (visit settings). Now the link in Changelog (7.0.0) can open an additional porn category in Laptop->Masturbate, but nothing more
- I removed the Settings Check Widget and created a new Problem Solver unit. It will check and fix settings errors. Well, it should. I tried, and it worked for me
- Added a new link to the Living room. Now you can choose between the usual school outfit and "the lewdest" one. If you have a lewd school skirt, it will be applied. If you have a lewd school uniform - it will be put on
- Fixed issues with changing clothes (Beach). Plus, now you should buy Bikini panties with Bikini. It's required, yes
- Fixed age adding after Birthday (the "181 years" issue)

Added "RESOLUTION" parameter

 Discord User jteich did some investigation (Thanks!) and helped me understanding this rather obscure parameter:

Internally, is called "TRIGGER", and is passed into the baseband when configuring the desired spectrum sample rate.

Please forgive me in advance if this explanation is not 100% correct. It's only my interpretation, based on my own observation and jteich's comments over Discord chat.

This trigger parameter apparently determines the amount of data over time used for calculating the signal's power inside each specttrum's bin, before considering it "done".

In short, if you lower this resolution value then the cascade will tend to be rendered a bit faster, while kind of blind to tiny signals.

On the other hand, a bigger value will help rendering and distinguishing different signals on the cascade.

Too big a value can easily clutter up the cascade. But then it may be a "blessing" when inspecting higher freuqencies -where hackrf is more deaf"

The default value of 32 is quite decent. But then, now you can experiment with it. Cheers

Update autocomplete.rkt

Hi, sorry if this is a waste of time for you, I was just thinking of adding a couple more shortcuts that I think some students might find helpful especially with where we are in the course right now. I am a CS135 student right now and this is honestly such a useful program which is why I'm trying to add on to it. Please don't pay it any mind if you don't like these changes I won't be bothered.

Deprecate SSL pinning and trust chain verification. (#534)

Oh boy. Here's a controversial change.
![](http://i.imgur.com/t8JjQix.gif)

Let's give a bit of backstory.

A few weeks ago, Facebook was contacted by a whitehat hacker (the good
guys) about a security vulnerability here in SocketRocket.

For those of you who are truly interested in what that security flaw
was, it is essentially the same flaw as outlined here:

https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/ineffective-certificate-pinning-implementations/

So, we were faced with a choice - quietly push out a patch, and hope
that eventually existing applications updated, or be transparent and
admit we screwed up.

This is us admititng we screwed up. And while yes, we could probably fix
the implementation. But we talked internally, and decided that the best
approach here is to completely remove the option for pinning.

For all of our existing users that use certificate pinning, while we
understand that in the past there has been a very large barrier to entry
with getting a CA to issue a certificate.

However, since the rollout of CAs like LetsEncrypt, there's become an
ever-dwindling reason to actually use self-signed or unsigned
certificates.

For this reason, we're going to go ahead and deprecate the APIs that
allow SSL pinning and disabling trust chain verification. The pinning
APIs are now going to throw an exception when invoked, and the trust
chain APIs have deprecation warnings.

If you are a user of these APIs, and you for some reason **CANNOT** use
a trust chain validated certificate, PLEASE speak up. While we cannot
think of any reason to use those kinds of certificates, it's entirely
possible we overlooked something. We'll leave this pullrequest unmerged
for a two week period (Monday, August 28th, 2017), at which point,
unless we have feedback convincing us otherwise, we will go ahead with
this change.

I was born in Czech small city in the mountains, Jilemnice. In my free time I play ice hockey . I like walking around the mountains. I like to spend time with friends at the cottage .  As graphic designer, I like to entertain people with graphic photomontages.

In 2018, I had a phone call from Tomáš Bárta, who is the head of KRPA FORM, a company which (nebo that? ted nevim) focuses on paper production. He told me that they had managed to create a new pape. This new paper they wanted to import into fast food companies. The paper is unique in that it is fully compostable and nongreasy. He asked me to create a new design for this type of product. We made an appointment with him in the office, where we met with five people - me and company representatives.
We consulted design parameters together. The design had to capture the advantages of paper and highlight the origin of the product. Due to the production price, it only had to be black and white. And for printing reasons, it only had to contain 100 percent stroke coverage. We clarified and agreed on the next meeting, when I presented them my first sketches.
I started exploring the websites. I was looking for inspiration in designs of packaging, but all things failed because of the colors. For a long time, I thought about how to highlight the benefits of paper with design. I solved this problem by designing vectors. I created five sketches, which I presented to the company's members at the next meeting. They consulted with each other and chose the direction in which we will continue.
The members of company liked the vektors and they wanted to use them in the design. I decided to create a cover background from vectors. I also started to focus on the main design. I didn't have much to choose from, so I opened an Adobe sketch and started drawing vector images.
The design should be playful and clean. For a long time I struggled with the vectors of individual dishes and their placement. In the end, I was inspired by the game of Five in Line - so the design was finally created. I presented the design to the company and the members were excited. Together we fine-tuned all the details and released the design to the printer.
Currently/nowadays this design is used in a large number of fast food restaurants in the Czech Republic. In the future, we plan to expand the supply to other countries like Slovakia, Poland or Germany, and I'll have to adjust/edit the design for these countries.

sideband: diagnose more sideband anomalies

In demultiplex_sideband(), there are two oddities when we check an
incoming packet:

  - if it has zero length, then we assume it's a flush packet. This
    means we fail to notice the difference between a real flush and a
    true zero-length packet that's missing its sideband designator. It's
    not a huge problem in practice because we'd never send a zero-length
    data packet (even our keepalives are otherwise-empty sideband-1
    packets).

    But it would be nice to detect and report the error, since it's
    likely to cause other confusion (we think the other side flushed,
    but they do not).

  - we try to detect packets missing their designator by checking for
    "if (len < 1)". But this will never trigger for "len == 0"; we've
    already detected that and left the function before then.

    It _could_ detect a negative "len" parameter. But in that case, the
    error message is wrong. The issue is not "no sideband" but rather
    "eof while reading the packet". However, this can't actually be
    triggered in practice, because neither of the two callers uses
    pkt_read's GENTLE_ON_EOF flag. Which means they'd die with "the
    remote end hung up unexpectedly" before we even get here.

    So this truly is dead code.

We can improve these cases by passing in a pkt-line status to the
demultiplexer, and by having recv_sideband() use GENTLE_ON_EOF. This
gives us two improvements:

  - we can now reliably detect flush packets, and will report a normal
    packet missing its sideband designator as an error

  - we'll report an eof with a more detailed "protocol error: eof while
    reading sideband packet", rather than the generic "the remote end
    hung up unexpectedly"

  - when we see an eof, we'll flush the sideband scratch buffer, which
    may provide some hints from the remote about why they hung up
    (though note we already flush on newlines, so it's likely that most
    such messages already made it through)

In some sense this patch goes against fbd76cd450 (sideband: reverse its
dependency on pkt-line, 2019-01-16), which caused the sideband code not
to depend on the pkt-line code. But that commit was really just trying
to deal with the circular header dependency. The two modules are
conceptually interlinked, and it was just trying to keep things
compiling. And indeed, there's a sticking point in this patch: because
pkt-line.h includes sideband.h, we can't add the reverse include we need
for the sideband code to have an "enum packet_read_status" parameter.
Nor can we forward declare it, because you can't forward declare an enum
in C. However, C does guarantee that enums fit in an int, so we can just
use that type.

One alternative would be for the callers to check themselves that they
got something sane from the pkt-line code. But besides duplicating
logic, this gets quite tricky. Any error condition requires flushing the
sideband #2 scratch buffer, which only demultiplex_sideband() knows how
to do.

pdLUT3d: a new tool for loading and applying 3D LUT files

This is an exciting feature!  Photoshop didn't add this feature until CS6 (https://www.photoshopessentials.com/photo-editing/color-lookup-cs6/), and none of the major free photo editors - including GIMP, Krita, or Paint.NET - can do this, so I think is another neat differentiator for PhotoDemon.

3D LUT files (most commonly in the .CUBE format, but PD supports .3DL too) are 3D lookup tables that describe complex color transformations.  3D LUTs can be used to approximate any per-pixel filter at high resolution, provided that filter only affects individual pixel values and not neighboring values (e.g. blur doesn't work, but Levels or Curves does).  3D LUTs are basically the Curves tool on steroids, and they are widely used in film editing as a primary mechanism of color-grading.

Here's a link to Photoshop's user manual on the feature, with sample photos:
https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/edit-photo-color-lookup-adjustment.html

This new class can read 3D LUT files in both major file formats (CUBE and 3DL), and it can apply the resulting table to arbitrary images.  Parsing the lookup files was mostly straightforward, except I had to write a bunch of new string code to optimize parsing hundreds of thousands of float values from text input.  The result is a lovely new parsing implementation that performs remarkably well, with most LUT files loading in milliseconds and the largest ones I have (7 mb files containing 64 * 64 * 64 = 262,144 discrete adjustments) loading in less than a second.  I don't have a modern copy of Photoshop to test against, but I doubt that even they can read these files much faster than that.

Even better, the process of applying a 3D LUT to an image is mostly agnostic to the size of the table itself.  On my 10+ year-old development PC, an 8 megapixel image with the aforementioned "ultra-large table" processes in about 850 ms, so we've achieved roughly 10-megapixel-per-second real-world throughput.  This is especially impressive given that a single pixel lookup requires some ~250 logical and arithmetic operations, per NVidia (https://www.nvidia.com/content/GTC/posters/2010/V01-Real-Time-Color-Space-Conversion-for-High-Resolution-Video.pdf).

PD's LUT application code also uses the more-advanced tetrahedral interpolation (instead of trilinear interpolation), which provides both higher-quality and faster results.  Based on my limited testing against images from online Photoshop tutorials, our results are pretty much identical to Adobe's - a huge win given that I had never even heard of tetrahedral interpolation before tackling this project, and the algorithm isn't described anywhere in good detail online (sigh).  I had to piece my implementation together from that aforementioned NVidia pdf.

My next task is preparing a UI so users can actually access this feature.  (Currently I've just been running hard-coded tests against specific files.)  That should be done in the next few days.

vo_gpu: opengl: make it work with EGL 1.4

This tries to deal with the crazy EGL situation. The summary is:

- using eglGetDisplay() with multiple windowing platforms doesn't really
  work, but Mesa had an awful hack for it
- this hack can be disabled at build time, and some distros sometimes
  accidentally or intentionally do so
- Mesa will probably eventually disable it by default
- we switched to eglGetPlatformDisplay(), but this requires EGL 1.5
- the very regrettable graphics company (also known as Nvidia) ships
  drivers (for old hardware I think) that are EGL 1.4 only
- that means even though we "require" EGL 1.5 and link against it, the
  runtime EGL may be 1.4
- trying to run mpv there crashes in the dynamic linker
- so we have to go through some more awful compatibility hacks

This commit tries to do it "properly", but using EGL 1.4 as base. The
plaform selection mechanism is a messy extension there, which got
elevated to core API in 1.5 (but OF COURSE in incompatible ways).

I'm not sure whether the EGL 1.5 code path (by parsing the EGL_VERSION)
is really needed, but if you ask me, it feels slightly saner not to rely
on an EGL 1.4 kludge forever. But maybe this is just an instance of
self-harm, since they will most likely never drop or not provide this
API.

Also, unlike before, we actually check the extension string for the
individual platform extensions, because who knows, some EGL
implementations might curse us if we pass unknown platform parameters.
(But actually, the more I think about this, the more bullshit it is.)

X11 and Wayland were the only ones trying to call eglGetPlatformDisplay,
so they're the only ones which are adjusted in this commit.

Unfortunately, correct function of this commit is unconfirmed. It's
possible that it crashes with the old drivers mentioned above.

Why didn't they solve it like this:

struct native_display {
    int platform_type;
    void *native_display;
};

Could have kept eglGetDisplay() without all the obnoxious extension BS.

	3) Sorted the string.po files so now you can translate it easily as it only includes string used.
	4) New xbe file with a few fixes.

		( only effects new users )
	6) Updated screenshot.py script to save as png.
	7) Moved the option to rip games to the skin settings > scripts menu
	8) New XBE to fixed intros for good now, should be no issues at all.

	10) Fixed the new view options showing when highlighting the scroll bar.

	16) Now if Auto login is enabled for a profile if you press the RStick in it will bring up the Options menu.

		( this seems to fix random crashing with FTP, also fixes the corrupt filezilla server.xml issue as its copied on each boot. )
	18) Intro videos can be in two places now. System\intro or next to the default.xbe
		( intro.mp4 is still looked for in both locations, I may at some point add random video playback from the intro folder )

	20) New updater look.

	49) Imagelib usage is now set to 8MB to combat ram hitting 0MB and causing black images.

Adjustments > Photo filters: complete overhaul

This is one of those "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" changes.

Photo filters are literal filters that you snap over the top of a camera lens.  They work by filtering (or in some cases, emphasizing) specific wavelengths of light, which allows for dramatic light capture that cannot be reproduced in post.

Photoshop provides a weird mimicry of these filters in its "Image > Adjustments > Photo Filter" tool.  I originally tried to outdo Photoshop by providing a much more comprehensive list of filters in PhotoDemon's version of the tool, complete with each filter's full technical name and descriptions.

Unfortunately, that made this tool an extraordinary translation burden, with 70 phrases comprising nearly 400 words of text for a single esoteric dialog.  (For perspective, that's more than 4% of PhotoDemon's total language file!)

This was insanity, and today I finally reworked this dialog to simply reproduce the same options as Photoshop.  That's the primary purpose of this tool, after all - to provide a "drop-in" replacement for Photoshop tutorials that require it.  It was silly of me to overcomplicate it in the first place, and I apologize to my translators for such an overkill implementation.

The new version of this tool is leaner, cleaner, and faster.  While here, I reworked the algorithm to operate exclusively in the CieLAB color space, which produces a higher-quality transform than Photoshop at an even faster speed than PD's old implementation.  The result is more dramatic lighting regardless of which "filter" you're applying, with especially improved results when trying to e.g. warm up a very cool photo (or cool a photo with very warm tones).
