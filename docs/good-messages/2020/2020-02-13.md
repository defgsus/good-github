Shark Tale Script - Dialogue Transcript Voila! Finally, the Shark Tale script is here for all you quotes spouting fans of the movie starring Jack Black and Will Smith.  This script is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of Shark Tale. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and I'll be eternally tweaking it, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. You won't hurt my feelings. Honest. Swing on back to Drew's Script-O-Rama afterwards for more free movie scripts!

He won't be back till later.                              How are my little babies this morning?                              You miss me? You doin' good?                              Huh?

You can't be serious.                              I'm dead serious.  It takes more than muscle to run things.                              Now Lenny, he's got the brains.  That's somethin' special.                              - He's special all right.  - What does that mean?                              - Nothing.

You said "what" first.                              I didn't say what,  I asked you what.                              You said "And then, what?"  I said "What?"                              No, I said "what what", like what what?                              - You said "what" first.  - Now you're making fun of me?

Snap it.                              - You're not snappin' it...  - Oscar.                              Hey, don't sweat it.  A lot of white fish can't do it.                              - Would you just sit down, okay?  - Thank you.                              I've been goin' over my markers.  You're into me for five grand.                              -   G's, okay?  -   G's? Man, you trippin'?   G's.                              Oh, yeah?  See if this refreshes your memory.                              That's crazy, look at that.                              You wrote everything down  so you wouldn't forget.                              This a perfect example of why  you're in management, and I'm not.                              You go, boy.                              I have to pay Don Lino protection,  so everything you owe me, you owe him.                              - How you figure that?  - Simple. The food chain.                              See, on top there's Don Lino.  There's me, and there's regular fish.                              - That's me.  - No.                              There's plankton, there's amoebas...                              - Then there's me?  - I'm gettin' there.                              There's coral, there's rocks, there's  whale pooh, and then there's you.                              That's messed up.                              So if Don Lino's squeezin' me,  he's squeezin' you.                              - What?  - Oscar.                              Sorry.                              - Easy, boss, find your happy place.  - Happy place.                              There is no happy place with him here.  [high-pitched] I'm serious.                              Okay, please.  Please, just gimme some time.                              That's all I'm asking.  I'm begging you, Sykes. Please. Please.                              All right.                              'Cause I like you,  I'm gonna give you    hours to pay up.                              All of it?  How am I supposed to do that?                              That's your problem. Bring my       clams to the track tomorrow, or else.                              - Or else what?  - The boys'll explain.                              [both laugh]                              - [sizzling]  - [Oscar] Unpleasant.                              [Angie]      clams?                              You borrowed      clams  from Mr. Sykes?                              Oscar, why do you get yourself  into these situations?                              I don't know, Ang.                              It's just hard, all right,  because I'm a little fish in a big pond.                              A really big pond.  The ocean.                              I'm a nobody.  I want some of that.                              - Mrs. Sanchez?  - What?                              # It's ladies' night,  Oh, what a night...                              Ew. No. That.                              The top of the reef.  Where the somebodies live.                              I wanna be rich and famous like them,  but I'm stuck down here.                              Well, what's wrong with down here?                              I'll tell you what's wrong  with down here.                              Remember my dad?  He worked at the Wash his whole life.                              # Ooh, child...                              [Oscar]  He was the number one tongue scrubber.                              Every year for    years.                              To me, working at the Wash  was the coolest job in the ocean.                              But then I learned something  I will never forget.                              Oscar's dad's a tongue scrubber!                              Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!                              Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!  Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!                              My dad was the greatest.                              But nobody loves a nobody.                              I want to be a somebody.                              Oscar, you don't have to live  at the top of the reef to be a somebody.                              [grunts]                              What's the difference? If I don't pay  Mr. Sykes back by tomorrow...                              I'm dead anyway, so...                              Wait here.                              What's this?                              - A pink pearl?  - Mm-hm.                              Where'd you get that?                              My grandmother gave it to me.                              She said it started  from a tiny grain of sand,                              but then, after a while,  it grew into something beautiful.                              Dreams can begin small too.                              - No. No, I couldn't...  - Take it.                              It'll get you the money you need  for Mr. Sykes.                              What do you mean, you don't understand?  We've been over it      times.                              I don't want to have to say it again.                              You're really giving me agita.  I don't know how else to say this.                              You see something,  you kill it, you eat it. Period. Thanks.                              That's what sharks do.  That's a fine tradition.                              What's the matter with you? Your  brother Frankie, here, he's a killer.                              - Thanks, Pop.  - He's beautiful.                              He does what he's supposed to do.  Wipe your face.                              But you... I'm hearin' things.                              You gotta understand, when you  look weak it makes me look weak.                              - I can't have that.  - I know, Pop, I'm sorry.                              Lenny. Lenny. Look at me.  Look at me.                              This handin' over the business,  it's for you, for both of yous,                              and you're acting  like you don't even want it.                              I need to know that  you can handle that.                              [sighs]                              [splutters]                              All right. Right here,  in front of me now, eat this.                              - [whimpers]  - Yeah. Gee, thanks, Pop.                              Here's the thing.                              I'm on a diet. I read an article about  these shrimps. They're not good for ya.                              You know how many calories  are in one of those shrimps?                              A lot.                              It's true.  It's true and the other thing is,                              my sister had a baby and I took it over  because she passed away                              and then the baby lost its legs  and its arms                              and now it's nothing but a stump  but I still take care of it with my wife                              and it's growing and it's fairly happy,                              but it's difficult 'cause I've been  working a second shift at the factory                              to put food on the table,                              but all the love I see in that little  guy's face makes it worth it in the end.                              True story.                              - [sobs]  - [sighs]                              I'm not askin' you anymore.  I'm tellin' you. Eat it!                              - No. Have mercy.  - Pop, please...                              - Eat!  - No eat.                              Son, eat the shrimp!                              No, please.                              - Lenny! Eat, eat, eat!  - Don't! Pop!                              Put the shrimp down!                              Go now. No one's looking.  Get out of here.                              - You're free, now go.  - Thank you.                              You're a good person.                              Come on, fellas.                              Pop, I can handle the reef.  It's not a problem.                              No. We're gonna do this as a family.                              Frankie, I want you to take Lenny out,  show him the ropes.                              - Come on, Pop.  - You're gonna learn how to be a shark.

C'mon, man! Get your game face on!                              [yelps]                              So... [chuckles] Lola, my name's...                              My name is Oscar, sweetie.                              [gasps] Mrs. Sanchez.                              The hippity-hop smooth talk  don't work with me.                              My bad. Hey, so...                              Oscar. I was starting to think  you skipped out on me.                              Sykes! I see you're already on your way  to the concession stand.                              What are you doing?                              Mind bringing us back some drinks?  That would be great, thanks.                              And some of them  little wiener thingies.                              - The ones with the toothpicks?  - Don't listen to him.                              - Let me escort you to... my box.  - Your box?!                              His box?! You can't even afford  the gum under the seats.                              He just laid five grand on Lucky Day.  I think he can afford anything he wants.                              - Five grand? My five grand?!  - No, it was another five grand.                              You had the money to pay me back  and you bet it anyway?                              - Hold up.  - Gimme that!                              - Clearly I've made a mistake.  - No, no, wait! Lola!                              Look. Deep down, I'm really superficial.                              And don't get me wrong, you're cute,  but... you're a nobody.                              Oscar, you cute, but you're a nobody.                              [Ernie] Wait. Lola. Come back.                              I'm not a nobody. I'm a wiener.                              [Ernie and Bernie laugh]                              You are unbelievable.  You're in trouble up to your gills                              and still you're askin' for more.  Now go on, get in here.                              Oscar, you better pray  that this horse of yours comes through.                              Bettin' my five thousand.                              Hey. Outta my seat.  You, outta my seat.                              Unbelievable.                              - Sit tight and watch the race.  - With your good eye.                              [Ernie] Good eye.                              [announcer] The horses are  at the post. And they're off!                              Fish Fingers, then Seabiscuit  and Salmonella.                              Lucky Day seems to be having trouble  getting out of the gate.                              - What?  - Only a sucker would bet on that horse.                              Don't sweat it.  He does this all the time. He's playin'.                              What's this? Lucky Day is now  crashing his way through the gate,                              and he's off and running.                              Seabiscuit, Fish Fingers...

And here comes Lucky Day,                              coming up from behind,  passing Yellow Tail, Salmonella.                              You see? Who's your fish now?

They're head to head. Neck to neck.  Lucky Day's ahead.                              I'm tired just thinkin'  about countin' all of this money.                              - Look at Lucky Day go.  - # We're movin' on up                              # To the eastside...

Everything's set, it's a lock,  we good to go, we in the money,                              and he trips underwater.                              Who in the halibut trips underwater?                              - And by the way, on what?  - That's it. That's it, I've had it.                              [high-pitched] Ernie. Bernie.  Find the deepest hole in the ocean                              and when you do, dig deeper.  And put him in it.                              [wails]                              Sorry, kid.

Go on, man.                              Well, I'll tell you what happened.                              Big ol' shark,  about       -feet long.                              - So he's swimming at me, right?  - [crowd gasp]                              - With teeth like razors.  - Razors.                              And I was, like,  you're gonna come at me like that?                              You're gonna come  at the "O" like that?                              Do the muscle thing, the muscle thing.                              Oh, right.                              So I told that dude, "You see this guy?"  and I pointed like this.                              Well, he's got a brother.  And he lives right over here.                              And I think it's time  for a little family reunion.                              - [laughs]  - [crowd cheer]                              You see, mon. I told you.

As the first fish in history to ever  take on a shark and win, tell me:                              Does this mean you're now protector  of the reef, new sheriff in town?

[Katie] You heard it here first.                              From now on, any shark tries  to bother this reef, it's his funeral.

It's a terrible thing, Don Lino.  Everybody loved Frankie.                              May whoever did this  die a thousand deaths.                              May his stinking, maggot-covered  corpse rot in the fiery depths of hell.                              Thank you for your kind thoughts,  Giuseppe.

Oh, Lenny...                              - Don't worry, boss.  - I said some things to him...                              We gotta find him.                              We're searching everywhere.  Forget about it, he'll turn up.                              What's wrong with that kid?  Why's he gotta be so different?                              Frankie, God rest his soul,  he was perfect. Perfect.                              Oh... Luca. Who could have done this?                              Oh... Luca.

I totally betrayed you,                              but listen, I got just one  little problem I gotta take care of.                              - Oh, what's that?  - Sharks are coming to get me!                              And they should.  I mean, what'd you expect?                              You'd take credit  for killing a shark,                              and then everything would be fine  and dandy for the rest of your life?                              Uh... yeah.                              But, hey, don't you worry about it.                              Me and Lenny got it.  We gonna fix it.                              "We"? I don't want any part of this.                              Too late, veggie-boy.  They're lookin' for you, too.                              Point taken. What's the plan?                              - This is what we gonna do.  - [Angie] Here's the plan.                              You tell the truth.  And, you, go home.                              [both laugh]                              All right, look,  this is what we're gonna do.                              We're gonna paint you up all bloody.  A mess, right?          …

Localizations (#133)

This PR add support for localization.

If you are a plugin author and looking for some boilerplate code, take a look at https://github.com/matterpoll/matterpoll/pull/133/commits/54617ce30edf17b6c365271eb108e9a2f808e12d.

## General translation rules
- When a translation is missing, use the English one.
- For texts displayed to only one user e.g. ephemeral messages, use the users local.
- For texts displayed to multiple users e.g. use [the Default Server Language](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#default-server-language). (I'm not 100% happy with that. I would love to hear other ideas on this)

There is currently only a German translation.

## Technical notes

This is pretty much a first try on localization of plugins. I tried to "get something" done.

I use the same library (https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) as the MM server, but version 2. The main difference between V1 and V2 are:
- All default strings are kept inside the codebase. This improves the dev experience greatly. No more tapping to `en.json`.
- Improved support for plural forms
- Removed the global state
- There are now **two** translation file for every language:
 - `active.de.json`: This contain all translated messages
 - `translate.de.json`: This contains to messages, that have to be translated. This file get auto populated every time a messages in the source changes. (This is awesome). New messages also get auto populated into this file, so you easy to track what needs to be translated.
- New CLI tools to support the two files (They require some time go get used to, I admit)

I did keep the messages in global scope. This allows me to use them in tests. This might not be suitable for everybody.

I opted to use `json` instead of the default `toml`. 0/5 if this is a good idea. Might be worth to go with the standard.


## How to do translation?

This is a bit complicated, but:
- We can add commands to the make file
- Running the command inside `i18n` makes the easier. But I wanted to be able to run them from the root directory.
- Using `toml` instead of `json` would make this easier.

### Translating a new language

Replace `de` with your local!

`touch asserts/i18n/translate.de.json`

`goi18n merge -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ assets/i18n/active.en.json
assets/i18n/translate.de.json`

After `translate.de.json` has been translated, rename it to `active.de.json`.

See also https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n#translating-a-new-language

### Translating new messages

`goi18n extract -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ server/`

`goi18n merge -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ i18n/active.*.json`

Translate your messages

`goi18n merge -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ i18n/active.*.json i18n/translate.*.json`

See also https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n#translating-new-messages

## Open problems
The following things are not translatable, due to technical limitations of Mattermost:
- System console settings page
- Slash command help text


Fixes #119

##### 2020-02-13 10:08:17 by Marko Grdinić

"7:55am. Sometimes I dream about trading and this was one of those times. I must have woken up something like 2 hours ago and was lying in bed all this time.

Towards the end of my trading period, back in 2013, I have daytrading a shot. Two things beat me at that time:

1) The 25k daytrading limit. Thanks to this one, I was mostly an observer for two years, rather than a trader.
2) But primarily, the biggest issue is that I could not watch many stocks at the same time, so the best trades were always out of my sight.

If I could do sequence prediction properly, I could easily clear the second requirement.

Compare that to online gaming for money (like poker). There is more money in gaming, but all the games are very visual. Even for poker, the online dens opt to make things more difficult for computers by forcing them to solve the vision problem as a Turing test.

I am not sure I really feel like doing this problem.

8:05am. Whatever the case is, whether I chose to go back to trading or poker or anything else - I absolutely need the aid of computers.

8:10am. Everybody who is successful in trading these days is certainly using them as an aid. In fact, the character of the market itself changed post-2000 due to digitization of trading.

And whatever the case, I am going to need the completed Spiral in order to make good use of neuromorphic chips.

Having something that is orders of magnitude more efficient than GPUs and works without the need for batching would be a game changer. Definitely for RL. And for sequence prediction of the sort I would need for trading, the same would apply.

GPUs are huge and unwieldy hammers, neurochips are spears in comparison.

8:25am. And I will need to master them before I can do anything.

New hardware always changes the nature of the game, and this time it won't be an exception. Nature might have eclipsed me, but even it needed neurons before it could get intelligence.

8:30am. Let me start here. I can't just dwell in my own thoughts all day.

8:35am. https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/f2t5il/d_the_future_of_ml_unsupervised_learning/

This thread is interesting.

/u/adventuringraw: "It looks like Sergey Levine's focus was on transfer learning. Can we have a distributed army of agents using their off-time to open doors and do other menial tasks to learn, unsupervised, a highly generalized way of achieving goals in their environment, and share that knowledge among them?

Yann LeCun on the other hand seems to have put his core bet on model/representation learning.

I think both are going to be incredibly important. There's already good evidence that model based reinforcement learning can drastically improve sample efficiency in RL tasks. The SimPLe algorithm from Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Atari for example was able to outperform state of the art model free approaches on most games. On same games, by over an order of magnitude, and the 'world model' in this case was just a crude video prediction model. What happens when disentangled representation learning allows for a proper breakdown of 'entities' with meaningful attributes? SPACE was a recent exciting paper on that front I thought, maybe it would be possible to improve converged performance above state of the art model free approaches, and also do that with better sample efficiency than SimPLe even?

If you go even further though, and start asking about Causal Flow among the latent variables, you can start (potentially) getting very efficient ways to transfer to new tasks, or maybe even potentially run hypothetical 'thought experiments' to quickly trace possible trajectories between the current state and a given goal. (the World Model paper on the original DOOM had an agent trained entirely in a hallucinated 'imagined' version of Doom it learned for example).

Honestly though, I think the 'real' way forward is going to be around starting to turn all these crazy ideas into carefully abstracted building blocks to be layered together. Go-Explore for example, the first approach that was able to beat Montezuma's Revenge, and it doesn't even require any differentiable AI system at all, it's almost like a bizarre glorified A* or something. The basic idea, is to save a super low res screenshot of what the agent is seeing, and then save policies that can get from screenshot to screenshot, so you can traverse long distances just from going from goal post to goal post. But if you have the inter-goal navigation handled by a more powerful approach (say, a more classic differentiable learning system of some kind) you can end up with much more robust inter-goal transitions. Really helpful if you're in a stochastic environment instead of a deterministic one. But the obvious question... how should 'goal' posts be encoded? Screenshots obviously seem kind of shitty, but like... what if you could use a representation learning approach to encode goals? Some vector based representation of 'come back here with a key'. Where are the keys? (three have been seen, how should that be encoded?).

So you might end up combining all these different ideas and more (inverse scene graph from Hinton? Mixture of Experts approach for task-specific computational subunits?) to end up with a device that can 'reason' at different levels of abstraction, ideally working with a minimal representation that captures only the details needed to get from your current state, to the current subgoal on the way to the 'true' goal.

So I guess my actual vote... how (in an unsupervised manner) can useful (actionable) information relevant to a wide range of goals be encoded in a way that allows for easy policy retrieval and training, composition (so you can mix and match building blocks instead of running into a combinatorial explosion... 'be at this door with no key', 'be at this door with key A', 'be at this door with keys A and B', be at this door with key B', 'be at this door with key A and a ladder'....)? Can this all be done in a way that maximizes generalization and sample efficiency? And (even more) done in a way that allows for meaningful human intervention (look at this example of a human performing this task. Let's use human language to give the machine a goal. Let's have the model explain what it's doing and why, ideally in a way that's easy for humans to understand) and so on.

I don't know. I guess it feels like the building blocks are still being built and understood. It's common now to have papers with different 'modules' performing different kinds of computation (a CNN 'eyes' system, maybe a predictive RNN system, sort of subbing in for the human DLPFC, maybe an NLP system for communicating goals to the agent) but I think it'll be a while before we start to get into like... a theory of ML agent composition. Maybe it'll end up where there are common models (like VGG or whatever) that are used if your agent needs eyes, or another pretrained block (Turning-NLG or BERT or GPT-2 or whatever) for language comprehension, or another common model for whatever else you like, and then have integration systems plugging the pieces together.

But... yeah. Generalization and Representation learning I guess, tl;dr, haha. I definitely think it's WAY too limiting to say the future is in reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning though. That's like saying electricity is the future of telegraphy, speaking in the early 1800's. Like... yeah, that's true, but there was SO MUCH low level bullshit that needed to be understood to really use electricity properly there, and that was only a small part of the struggle. That work needed to be completed of course, but it also took an encoding scheme (Samuel Morse... there were MANY failed attempts before his ideas took off) it took logistical/engineering challenges (how the fuck are you going to run a line through the Goddamn ocean?) it took... man. All kinds of things. RL and unsupervised learning are probably lynchpin technologies, but while they're necessary, they're far from sufficient. I think none of the ideas above are sufficient, I think there's a whole lot of work ahead."

"thanks man. If you want a much more coherent and well organized overview of the state of things though, I'd highly recommend reading Jeffrey Dean's The Deep Learning Revolution and Its Implications for Computer Architecture and Chip Design, it's way more coherent than my mess of a comment above, haha.

That paper's WAY more readable than most papers. It's kind of a big picture overview of where things have been the last few years (starting with the TPU development and rollout for improving inference and training speed at the hardware level) and then gets into near future opportunities for AI fueled computational improvements. The coolest ideas I think have to do with revisiting very mature, stable technologies that haven't changed in decades, like SQL execution planning and hash table hash function design, and seeing if there are improvements that can be made to runtime speed/memory footprint using information about what kind of data was retrieved in the past. Crazy to think that understanding SQL in a decade might require some deep learning knowledge, haha.

The paper ends with the author's 3 big things they're expecting to be important in the future. Submodule based approaches like mixture of experts, AutoML, and transfer learning, potentially all combined, which totally makes sense when you think about it... in a Mixture of Experts type approach, why should all the computational subunits have the same architecture? Each one could potentially be refined on the task it's meant to run on, and distill itself down until you end up with really broad, powerful, minimal little units that can handle their own little corner of the problem space as optimally as possible. Transfer learning could be used to make sure each subunit is as generalizable as possible, within their problem space.

The thing I think's really cool about that paper though... not only is it easy to read, and not only are the ideas interesting and well presented, these aren't just ideas from some academic or whatever about what might be important. This paper is written by Jeffrey Dean, the lead of the Google Brain Project. The ideas here aren't ideas, they're a road map of what Google's done, what they're working on now, and what they're planning on working on over the next few years. Most of the stuff he's talking about is pretty far away from my own core interest (disentangled representation learning for computer vision and reinforcement learning) but still a cool read. If you're interested in overview stuff, there's people way more knowledgable than me writing, just hard to find their stuff sometimes."

https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05289
The Deep Learning Revolution and Its Implications for Computer Architecture and Chip Design

Let me take a look at it then.

9:05am. Interesting that he mentioned a sparse architecture that does subarchitecture search online. Sounds like what the brain does.

Let me finally start.

The future will come eventually, after I finish Spiral.

For this morning, let me go through that tutorial.

9:40am. Had to take a break. Let me resume.

```
vscode.window.showInformationMessage('selected text: ${text}');
```

For some reason I am having difficulty with string interpolation. What is going on here?

Ah, I need to use ` rather than '.

Ok.

9:50am. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples

This page will be useful. This tutorial is actually pretty good. I am definitely learning a lot from it.

10:10am. Finally done with the tutorial.

This was quite good as an icebreaker.

10:20am. Am taking a little breather right now.

Let me check out the difference between tuple and the array again. The difference between `([item]) => ...` and `[item] => ...` confused me a bit.

Mhhh, I have no idea. It seems arrays are used both as regular arrays and tuples.

10:25am. Well, forget that for the time being.

10:30am. Enough slacking. I need to think of what comes next. I should do one more thing before I take off for breakfast.

I should put in at least another hour of work into this.

10:35am. Right now there are still many things I lack, but rather than going through those samples randomly, let me check out the VS Code extensions documentation again. Maybe it will make more sense now.

10:55am. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/extension-anatomy

I really do feel like I wasted this morning. Let me just focus on this for a while.

11am. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/overview

This stuff I should go through.

11:05am. Let me take a real break here.

Then when I gather my motivation, I will start going through the examples one by one."

Update Depth3D.fx

Depth3D: Harden to help prevent cheating.                                                       -=let me know if I can do more=-

+Cursor Is now Bound to the 3D image only.
+Removed Depth Buffer Debug view to keep users from using this to cheat.
+Basic VR Compatibility added so that it can be used with VR Desktop apps.
+Basic Theater Mode added for Cellphone VR users.
+Renamed many items in the UI to help new users with controlling this shader.
+New Depth Detection Code.
+New Screen Boundary Detection added.
+Edge Handling added from SuperDepth3D

Fixed issues with the UI in Freestyle and automated many functions as I could to reduce UI clutter. The idea was to keep as much of the functionality as possible without sacrificing too much.

Fixed issues with NV System that was causing a black screen on my Testers PC. This was not easy, I had to remote into a user's pc halfway across the world since I needed someone with an NV Card that was able to help me. Seems like this may be an issue for me with porting my other shaders. Thank you, Durante - aka Dorinte & TheGordinho - aka Gordinho

The goal of Depth3D to allow users to experience the world of 3D Gaming by adding real depth to your game. -=This shader requires depth access to work=-

This shader will work with 3D TV, 3D Monitors, and the NEW VR HMDs. The VR Theater experience worth exploring in VR.
Here are two free applications for VR Headsets That I seen people use that anyone can try.
Virtual Space
https://store.steampowered.com/app/703480/Virtual_Space/
Big Screen
https://bigscreenvr.com/help/gettingstarted/sbs3d/

Older games and non-VR games can benefit from being played again with Stereo3D.
I have been working on My 3D Shader for some time now and learned how to improve things over time even with limitations. My hope is to share this experience with as many people as possible.
I would like this shader to be considered as a standard shader to be used as openly as NV discontinued 3DVision Stereo Software. Since I know many users in the 3D community still enjoy 3D gaming.

Please let me know if there is anything I can change. That can help. Thank you.

Noted Issues
One of the things that bug me with Depth3D It's hard to use for new users. So I will be making better tutorials when I have the hardware to do so for VR.

"12:35pm. Done with breakfast, done with chores. Let me start.

As expected it is one thing to be motivated to do great things, and it is quite another to do the grind.

Seriously, Spiral v0.2 is the last time I will subject myself to this. I am really unfortunate that nobody else made a language like Spiral, and that my talents are well suited for this kind of design work.

But being in this room, trying to painstakingly put the pieces together is...inhuman.

It was one thing to do this in 2017, but 2020 is really my limit. I want to be done with the most of it here, so that I can do more interesting programming after that.

In the future I'll either want to offload this work to AI agents, or find a way to literally mind control myself into enjoying this properly.

There is only so many times I can play the willpower card.

1:05pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/virtual-documents

I can't really say I am studying this. At best, I am dwelling in my thoughts while sampling the documentation on the side.

Let me do that for the whole API docs and then I will go directly for the samples.

1:30pm. This kind of study is hugely wasteful of time and it reminds me a bit of my time in school when the teacher will drone on and I would be lost in my dreamworld, not at all paying attention to the lecture.

Nonetheless, it is the best I can do. I guess it is too much to expect that I'll be able to finish this in a week. VS Code plugins are APIs piled on APIs and I can't really grok that just like that. I am simply going to have to do it like this, in multiple passes, each time internalizing something new.

If there is one thing I am grateful, it is that I am not checking social media and Mangdadex every 15m like yesterday.

1:35pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide

Well, let me just continue at my current pace. Since I am already more than halfway into it, I'll give this documentation another pass. Then I'll just focus on studying the samples.

1:40pm. Focus me, focus. Do not get lost in thought.

Actually, this journal is a problem on its own. It drew me out of the zone. I'll try to stop writing it until I am at least done with the docs.

https://www.apeth.com/nonblog/stories/textmatebundle.html

Let me read this. I have no idea what Textmate grammars are. The VS Code documentation is the first time I've encountered them.

1:55pm. Ok, I skimmed that. Do I really have to use Textmate? Can't I use my own parser?

2:05pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#contributing-a-basic-grammar

Ok, I have to focus on this just a little. I can do keyword coloring for Spiral with this.

In fact, that should be the very first thing I do, as a part of the project.

2:30pm. Done with that section. I will keep it in mind. Obviously I do not get it all just from reading this, but through experimentation I should be able to figure it out.

2:50pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide

Nearly done with docs. I need a short break here. After that I will finish this up and move to the samples.

3:10pm. Let me resume.

Let me finish this last bit of the docs and then I will move to the samples. Reading the docs is like reading a math book. It is not real skill - real skill is only acquired once you start playing around with the stuff yourself and put some of that into procedural memory.

3:15pm. Oh, Kengan Omega is out. Let me read this first then. I've already been spoilered that Ohma comes comes back.

3:35pm. I had no idea I would relax for so long. The chapter was hype. But seriously, let me resume.

3:55pm. Now I started reading threads on the ML sub. Focus me, focus!

4pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide

I have to admit, there are a shitload of details in here.

I said I wasted the morning, but it feels like I wasted everything after that. In the morning I at least did that tutorial. Let me just finish this and then I will finally move to the samples.

All this reminds me when in 2015 I spend like a month wastefully studying GUIs. I autistically went through all the examples in Petzold's book like it was a sacred tome.

4:05pm.

```
{
  "name": "Language Server E2E Test",
  "type": "extensionHost",
  "request": "launch",
  "runtimeExecutable": "${execPath}",
  "args": [
    "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}",
    "--extensionTestsPath=${workspaceRoot}/client/out/test",
    "${workspaceRoot}/client/testFixture"
  ],
  "stopOnEntry": false,
  "sourceMaps": true,
  "outFiles": ["${workspaceRoot}/client/out/test/**/*.js"]
}
```

Yesterday, I said I am starting to warm up to Typescript, but so far literally everything is like this. This is not like learning algorithms. Everything is one huge DSL, built out of smaller ones. All the functions have optional parameters, I literally cannot even begin guessing how complex all this is out of the hood or how it fits together.

4:15pm. Done with the documentation. I've skimmed it once more. I really did not get anything towards the end, and now the tedium is really hitting me. I am not sure whether I am up for playing with samples like I said I would, but let me give it a try.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples

I think I'll start things off by cloning this.

4:25pm. I'll give the status bar example a try.

...Why is it building so long? This is ridiculous. Maybe I should have ran it in debug mode.

4:35pm. No, it seems like I am doing wrong. Running F5 is not starting another instance of code with the plugin active. I have no idea what is going on.

Let me do one thing. There are two other plugin tutorials on Youtube so let me watch those.

4:50pm. https://youtu.be/srwsnNhiqv8

I am trying to watch this, but my focus is really dead at this point.

I should be figuring out how to get that status bar extension to run, but I do not feel like it. Seriously, fuck documentation. I am such a masochist.

Tomorrow, I am going to go into this more creatively if possible.

The way I've been approaching it so far is the worst.

All this really makes me appreciate programming though. If this was math, I'd have to basically throw in the towel here, but I know that with programming if I trace it, I can figure out everything.

That reminds me.

Remember my Pharo experience and how I managed to go by simply tracing through everything? I should be doing that here. I mean I have the debugger. I should use it.

I actually completely forgot about this before I mentioned tracing just now.

I thought Pharo was a waste of time, but I did get something from it in the end.

I should be tracing, tracing, tracing the shit out of everything, especially in the beginning.

Things like tracing and randomized testing is something math lost when it detached itself from a computational basis.

5pm. What I did in the last week is something I should not make a habit of.

This spending of time is a great show of will, but not so much of intelligence. Pharo really taught me that you should just take courage and dive into the system if you want to understand it.

If I am going to master these examples, I should channel the experience of last year.

Let me stop here for the day. Rather than trying to push myself, I should just take a bath instead and do this trace when I am fresh and ready to go."

lua: fix highly security relevant arbitrary code execution bug

It appears Lua's package paths try to load .lua files from the current
working directory. Not only that, but also shared libraries.

  WHAT THE FUCK IS WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FUCKING DOING?

mpv isn't setting this package path; currently it's only extending it.
In any sane world, this wouldn't be a default. Most programs use
essentially random working directories and don't change it.

I cannot comprehend what bullshit about "convenience" or whatever made
them do something this broken and dangerous. Thousands of programs using
Lua out there will try to randomly load random code from random
directories.

In mpv's case, this is so security relevant, because mpv is normally
used from the command line, and you will most likely actually change
into your media directory or whatever with the shell, and play a file
from there. No, you don't want to load a (probably downloaded) shared
library from this directory if a script try to load a system lib with
the same name or so.

I'm not sure why LUA_PATH_DEFAULT in luaconf.h (both upstream and the
Debian version) put "./?.lua" at the end, but in any case, trying to
load a module that doesn't exist nicely lists all package paths in
order, and confirms it tries to load files from the working directory
first (anyone can try this). Even if it didn't, this would be
problematic at best.

Note that scripts are _not_ sandboxed. They're allowed to load system
libraries, which is also why we want to keep the non-idiotic parts of
the package paths.

Attempt to fix this by filtering out relative paths. This is a bit
fragile and not very great for something security related, but probably
the best we can do without having to make assumptions about the target
system file system layout. Also, someone else can fix this for Windows.

Also replace ":" with ";" (for the extra path). On a side note, this
extra path addition is just in this function out of laziness, since
I'd rather not have 2 functions with edit the package path.

mpv in default configuration (i.e. no external scripts) is probably not
affected. All builtin scripts only "require" preloaded modules, which,
in a stroke of genius by the Lua developers, are highest priority in the
load order. Otherwise, enjoy your semi-remote code execution bug.

Completely unrelated this, I'm open for scripting languages and
especially implementations which are all around better than Lua, and are
suited for low footprint embedding.

path: change win32 semantics for joining drive-relative paths

win32 is a cursed abomination which has "drive letters" at the root of
the filesystem namespace for no reason. This requires special handling
beyond tolerating the idiotic "\" path separator.

Even more cursed is the fact that a path starting with a drive letter
can be a relative path. For example, "c:billsucks" is actually a
relative path to the current working directory of the C drive. So for
example if the current working directory is "c:/windowsphone", then
"c:billsucks" would reference "c:/windowsphone/billsucks".

You should realize that win32 is a ridiculous satanic trash fire by the
point you realize that win32 has at least 26 current working
directories, one for each drive letter.

Anyway, the actual problem is that mpv's mp_path_join() function would
return a relative path if an absolute relative path is joined with a
drive-relative path. This should never happen; I bet it breaks a lot of
assumptions (maybe even some security or safety relevant ones, but
probably not).

Since relative drive paths are such a fucked up shit idea, don't try to
support them "properly", and just solve the problem at hand. The
solution produces a path that should be invalid on win32.

Joining two relative paths still behaves the same; this is probably OK
(maybe).

The change isn't very minimal due to me rewriting parts of it without
strict need, but I don't care.

Note that the Python os.path.join() function (after which the mpv
function was apparently modeled) has the same problem.

Merge branch 'work.openat2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs

Pull openat2 support from Al Viro:
 "This is the openat2() series from Aleksa Sarai.

  I'm afraid that the rest of namei stuff will have to wait - it got
  zero review the last time I'd posted #work.namei, and there had been a
  leak in the posted series I'd caught only last weekend. I was going to
  repost it on Monday, but the window opened and the odds of getting any
  review during that... Oh, well.

  Anyway, openat2 part should be ready; that _did_ get sane amount of
  review and public testing, so here it comes"

From Aleksa's description of the series:
 "For a very long time, extending openat(2) with new features has been
  incredibly frustrating. This stems from the fact that openat(2) is
  possibly the most famous counter-example to the mantra "don't silently
  accept garbage from userspace" -- it doesn't check whether unknown
  flags are present[1].

  This means that (generally) the addition of new flags to openat(2) has
  been fraught with backwards-compatibility issues (O_TMPFILE has to be
  defined as __O_TMPFILE|O_DIRECTORY|[O_RDWR or O_WRONLY] to ensure old
  kernels gave errors, since it's insecure to silently ignore the
  flag[2]). All new security-related flags therefore have a tough road
  to being added to openat(2).

  Furthermore, the need for some sort of control over VFS's path
  resolution (to avoid malicious paths resulting in inadvertent
  breakouts) has been a very long-standing desire of many userspace
  applications.

  This patchset is a revival of Al Viro's old AT_NO_JUMPS[3] patchset
  (which was a variant of David Drysdale's O_BENEATH patchset[4] which
  was a spin-off of the Capsicum project[5]) with a few additions and
  changes made based on the previous discussion within [6] as well as
  others I felt were useful.

  In line with the conclusions of the original discussion of
  AT_NO_JUMPS, the flag has been split up into separate flags. However,
  instead of being an openat(2) flag it is provided through a new
  syscall openat2(2) which provides several other improvements to the
  openat(2) interface (see the patch description for more details). The
  following new LOOKUP_* flags are added:

  LOOKUP_NO_XDEV:

     Blocks all mountpoint crossings (upwards, downwards, or through
     absolute links). Absolute pathnames alone in openat(2) do not
     trigger this. Magic-link traversal which implies a vfsmount jump is
     also blocked (though magic-link jumps on the same vfsmount are
     permitted).

  LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS:

     Blocks resolution through /proc/$pid/fd-style links. This is done
     by blocking the usage of nd_jump_link() during resolution in a
     filesystem. The term "magic-links" is used to match with the only
     reference to these links in Documentation/, but I'm happy to change
     the name.

     It should be noted that this is different to the scope of
     ~LOOKUP_FOLLOW in that it applies to all path components. However,
     you can do openat2(NO_FOLLOW|NO_MAGICLINKS) on a magic-link and it
     will *not* fail (assuming that no parent component was a
     magic-link), and you will have an fd for the magic-link.

     In order to correctly detect magic-links, the introduction of a new
     LOOKUP_MAGICLINK_JUMPED state flag was required.

  LOOKUP_BENEATH:

     Disallows escapes to outside the starting dirfd's
     tree, using techniques such as ".." or absolute links. Absolute
     paths in openat(2) are also disallowed.

     Conceptually this flag is to ensure you "stay below" a certain
     point in the filesystem tree -- but this requires some additional
     to protect against various races that would allow escape using
     "..".

     Currently LOOKUP_BENEATH implies LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS, because it
     can trivially beam you around the filesystem (breaking the
     protection). In future, there might be similar safety checks done
     as in LOOKUP_IN_ROOT, but that requires more discussion.

  In addition, two new flags are added that expand on the above ideas:

  LOOKUP_NO_SYMLINKS:

     Does what it says on the tin. No symlink resolution is allowed at
     all, including magic-links. Just as with LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS this
     can still be used with NOFOLLOW to open an fd for the symlink as
     long as no parent path had a symlink component.

  LOOKUP_IN_ROOT:

     This is an extension of LOOKUP_BENEATH that, rather than blocking
     attempts to move past the root, forces all such movements to be
     scoped to the starting point. This provides chroot(2)-like
     protection but without the cost of a chroot(2) for each filesystem
     operation, as well as being safe against race attacks that
     chroot(2) is not.

     If a race is detected (as with LOOKUP_BENEATH) then an error is
     generated, and similar to LOOKUP_BENEATH it is not permitted to
     cross magic-links with LOOKUP_IN_ROOT.

     The primary need for this is from container runtimes, which
     currently need to do symlink scoping in userspace[7] when opening
     paths in a potentially malicious container.

     There is a long list of CVEs that could have bene mitigated by
     having RESOLVE_THIS_ROOT (such as CVE-2017-1002101,
     CVE-2017-1002102, CVE-2018-15664, and CVE-2019-5736, just to name a
     few).

  In order to make all of the above more usable, I'm working on
  libpathrs[8] which is a C-friendly library for safe path resolution.
  It features a userspace-emulated backend if the kernel doesn't support
  openat2(2). Hopefully we can get userspace to switch to using it, and
  thus get openat2(2) support for free once it's ready.

  Future work would include implementing things like
  RESOLVE_NO_AUTOMOUNT and possibly a RESOLVE_NO_REMOTE (to allow
  programs to be sure they don't hit DoSes though stale NFS handles)"

py-uncompyle6: updated to 3.6.4

3.6.4:
plateau

The main focus in this release was fix some of the more glaring problems creapt in from the last release due to that refactor.

uncompyle6 code is at a plateau where what is most needed is a code refactoring. In doing this, until everything refactored and replaced, decomplation may get worse.

Therefore, this release largely serves as a checkpoint before more major upheaval.

The upheaval, in started last release, I believe the pinnicle was around c90ff51 which wasn't a release. I suppose I should tag that.

After c90ff5, I started down the road of redoing control flow in a more comprehensible, debuggable, and scalable way. See The Control Flow Mess.

The bulk of the refactoring going on in the decompyle3 project, but I try to trickle down the changes.

It is tricky because the changes are large and I have to figure decompose things so that little testable pieces can be done. And there is also the problem that what is in decompyle3 is incomplete as well.

Other than control flow, another change that will probably happen in the next release is to redo the grammar for lambda expressions. Right now, we treat them as Python statements, you know, things with compound statements in them. But lambdas aren't that. And so there is hackery to paper over difference making a statement out of an expression the wrong thing to do. For example, a return of an "and" expression can be expressed as nested "if" statements with return inside them, but the "if" variant of the bytecode is not valid in a lambda.

In the decompyle3 code, I've gone down the road making the grammar goal symbol be an expression. This also offers the opportunity to split the grammar making parsing inside lambda not only more reliable because the wrong choices don't exist, but also simpler and faster because all those rules just need don't need to exist in parsing.

I cringe in thinking about how the code has lived for so long without noticing such a simple stupidity, and lapse of sufficient thought.


3.6.3:
Martin and Susanne

Of late, every release fixes major gaps and embarrassments of the last release....

And in some cases, like this one, exposes lacuna and rot.

I now have [control] flow under control, even if it isn't the most optimal way.

I now have greatly expanded automated testing.

On the most recent Python versions I regularly decompile thousands of Python programs that are distributed with Python. when it is possible, I then decompile Python's standard test suite distributed with Python and run the decompiled source code which basically checks itself. This amounts to about 250 test programs per version. This is in addition to the 3 CI testing services which do different things.

Does this mean the decompiler works perfectly? No. There are still a dozen or so failing programs, although the actual number of bugs is probably smaller though.

However, in perparation of a more major refactoring of the parser grammar, this release was born.

In many cases, decompilation is better. But there are some cases where decompilation has gotten worse. For lack of time (and interest) 3.0 bytecode suffered a hit. Possibly some code in the 3.x range did too. In time and with cleaner refactored code, this will come back.

Commit c90ff51 was a local maxiumum before, I started reworking the grammar to separate productions that were specific to loops versus those that are not in loops.
In the middle of that I added another grammar simplication to remove singleton productions of the form sstmts-> stmts. These were always was a bit ugly, and complicated output.

At any rate if decompilation fails, you can try c90ff51. Or another decompiler. unpyc37 is pretty good for 3.7. wibiti uncompyle2 is great for 2.7. pycdc is mediocre for Python before 3.5 or so, and not that good for the most recent Python. Generally these programs will give some sort of answer even if it isn't correct.

decompyle3 isn't that good for 3.7 and worse for 3.8, but right now it does things no other Python decompiler like unpyc37 or pycdc does. For example, decompyle3 handles variable annotations. As always, the issue trackers for the various programs will give you a sense for what needs to be done. For now, I've given up on reporting issues in the other decompilers because there are already enough issues reported, and they are just not getting fixed anyway.

Solved a shitshow in the making

- Playercols now have custom ruler compatibility, operated via a toggle switch that changes the operation of the system from on-actions to MTTF.  For faster, cleaner operation, use the default option, but since paradox is stupid, you cant have on_startup events hit custom rulers, so this is a necessary evil.

- also added more imamite history
