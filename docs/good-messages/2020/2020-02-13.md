Shark Tale Script - Dialogue Transcript Voila! Finally, the Shark Tale script is here for all you quotes spouting fans of the movie starring Jack Black and Will Smith.  This script is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of Shark Tale. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and I'll be eternally tweaking it, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. You won't hurt my feelings. Honest. Swing on back to Drew's Script-O-Rama afterwards for more free movie scripts!

He won't be back till later.                              How are my little babies this morning?                              You miss me? You doin' good?                              Huh?

You can't be serious.                              I'm dead serious.  It takes more than muscle to run things.                              Now Lenny, he's got the brains.  That's somethin' special.                              - He's special all right.  - What does that mean?                              - Nothing.

You said "what" first.                              I didn't say what,  I asked you what.                              You said "And then, what?"  I said "What?"                              No, I said "what what", like what what?                              - You said "what" first.  - Now you're making fun of me?                              No, you misunderstood.                              Sorry we're late, Pop.  Lenny had an accident. He was born.                              Sorry we're late, Pop.  Lenny had an accident.

My Lenny is a killer. You hear me?  A cold-blooded killer. Look at him.                              Huh?                              That's it! That's it! You are out!

Snap it.                              - You're not snappin' it...  - Oscar.                              Hey, don't sweat it.  A lot of white fish can't do it.                              - Would you just sit down, okay?  - Thank you.                              I've been goin' over my markers.  You're into me for five grand.                              -   G's, okay?  -   G's? Man, you trippin'?   G's.                              Oh, yeah?  See if this refreshes your memory.                              That's crazy, look at that.                              You wrote everything down  so you wouldn't forget.                              This a perfect example of why  you're in management, and I'm not.                              You go, boy.                              I have to pay Don Lino protection,  so everything you owe me, you owe him.                              - How you figure that?  - Simple. The food chain.                              See, on top there's Don Lino.  There's me, and there's regular fish.                              - That's me.  - No.                              There's plankton, there's amoebas...                              - Then there's me?  - I'm gettin' there.                              There's coral, there's rocks, there's  whale pooh, and then there's you.                              That's messed up.                              So if Don Lino's squeezin' me,  he's squeezin' you.                              - What?  - Oscar.                              Sorry.                              - Easy, boss, find your happy place.  - Happy place.                              There is no happy place with him here.  [high-pitched] I'm serious.                              Okay, please.  Please, just gimme some time.                              That's all I'm asking.  I'm begging you, Sykes. Please. Please.                              All right.                              'Cause I like you,  I'm gonna give you    hours to pay up.                              All of it?  How am I supposed to do that?                              That's your problem. Bring my       clams to the track tomorrow, or else.                              - Or else what?  - The boys'll explain.                              [both laugh]                              - [sizzling]  - [Oscar] Unpleasant.                              [Angie]      clams?                              You borrowed      clams  from Mr. Sykes?                              Oscar, why do you get yourself  into these situations?                              I don't know, Ang.                              It's just hard, all right,  because I'm a little fish in a big pond.                              A really big pond.  The ocean.                              I'm a nobody.  I want some of that.                              - Mrs. Sanchez?  - What?                              # It's ladies' night,  Oh, what a night...                              Ew. No. That.                              The top of the reef.  Where the somebodies live.                              I wanna be rich and famous like them,  but I'm stuck down here.                              Well, what's wrong with down here?                              I'll tell you what's wrong  with down here.                              Remember my dad?  He worked at the Wash his whole life.                              # Ooh, child...                              [Oscar]  He was the number one tongue scrubber.                              Every year for    years.                              To me, working at the Wash  was the coolest job in the ocean.                              But then I learned something  I will never forget.                              Oscar's dad's a tongue scrubber!                              Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!                              Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!  Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!                              My dad was the greatest.                              But nobody loves a nobody.                              I want to be a somebody.                              Oscar, you don't have to live  at the top of the reef to be a somebody.                              [grunts]                              What's the difference? If I don't pay  Mr. Sykes back by tomorrow...                              I'm dead anyway, so...                              Wait here.                              What's this?                              - A pink pearl?  - Mm-hm.                              Where'd you get that?                              My grandmother gave it to me.                              She said it started  from a tiny grain of sand,                              but then, after a while,  it grew into something beautiful.                              Dreams can begin small too.                              - No. No, I couldn't...  - Take it.                              It'll get you the money you need  for Mr. Sykes.                              What do you mean, you don't understand?  We've been over it      times.                              I don't want to have to say it again.                              You're really giving me agita.  I don't know how else to say this.                              You see something,  you kill it, you eat it. Period. Thanks.                              That's what sharks do.  That's a fine tradition.                              What's the matter with you? Your  brother Frankie, here, he's a killer.                              - Thanks, Pop.  - He's beautiful.                              He does what he's supposed to do.  Wipe your face.                              But you... I'm hearin' things.                              You gotta understand, when you  look weak it makes me look weak.                              - I can't have that.  - I know, Pop, I'm sorry.                              Lenny. Lenny. Look at me.  Look at me.                              This handin' over the business,  it's for you, for both of yous,                              and you're acting  like you don't even want it.                              I need to know that  you can handle that.                              [sighs]                              [splutters]                              All right. Right here,  in front of me now, eat this.                              - [whimpers]  - Yeah. Gee, thanks, Pop.                              Here's the thing.                              I'm on a diet. I read an article about  these shrimps. They're not good for ya.                              You know how many calories  are in one of those shrimps?                              A lot.                              It's true.  It's true and the other thing is,                              my sister had a baby and I took it over  because she passed away                              and then the baby lost its legs  and its arms                              and now it's nothing but a stump  but I still take care of it with my wife                              and it's growing and it's fairly happy,                              but it's difficult 'cause I've been  working a second shift at the factory                              to put food on the table,                              but all the love I see in that little  guy's face makes it worth it in the end.                              True story.                              - [sobs]  - [sighs]                              I'm not askin' you anymore.  I'm tellin' you. Eat it!                              - No. Have mercy.  - Pop, please...                              - Eat!  - No eat.                              Son, eat the shrimp!                              No, please.                              - Lenny! Eat, eat, eat!  - Don't! Pop!                              Put the shrimp down!                              Go now. No one's looking.  Get out of here.                              - You're free, now go.  - Thank you.                              You're a good person.                              Come on, fellas.                              Pop, I can handle the reef.  It's not a problem.                              No. We're gonna do this as a family.                              Frankie, I want you to take Lenny out,  show him the ropes.                              - Come on, Pop.  - You're gonna learn how to be a shark.

C'mon, man! Get your game face on!                              [yelps]                              So... [chuckles] Lola, my name's...                              My name is Oscar, sweetie.                              [gasps] Mrs. Sanchez.                              The hippity-hop smooth talk  don't work with me.                              My bad. Hey, so...                              Oscar. I was starting to think  you skipped out on me.                              Sykes! I see you're already on your way  to the concession stand.                              What are you doing?                              Mind bringing us back some drinks?  That would be great, thanks.                              And some of them  little wiener thingies.                              - The ones with the toothpicks?  - Don't listen to him.                              - Let me escort you to... my box.  - Your box?!                              His box?! You can't even afford  the gum under the seats.                              He just laid five grand on Lucky Day.  I think he can afford anything he wants.                              - Five grand? My five grand?!  - No, it was another five grand.                              You had the money to pay me back  and you bet it anyway?                              - Hold up.  - Gimme that!                              - Clearly I've made a mistake.  - No, no, wait! Lola!                              Look. Deep down, I'm really superficial.                              And don't get me wrong, you're cute,  but... you're a nobody.                              Oscar, you cute, but you're a nobody.                              [Ernie] Wait. Lola. Come back.                              I'm not a nobody. I'm a wiener.                              [Ernie and Bernie laugh]                              You are unbelievable.  You're in trouble up to your gills                              and still you're askin' for more.  Now go on, get in here.                              Oscar, you better pray  that this horse of yours comes through.                              Bettin' my five thousand.                              Hey. Outta my seat.  You, outta my seat.                              Unbelievable.                              - Sit tight and watch the race.  - With your good eye.                              [Ernie] Good eye.                              [announcer] The horses are  at the post. And they're off!                              Fish Fingers, then Seabiscuit  and Salmonella.                              Lucky Day seems to be having trouble  getting out of the gate.                              - What?  - Only a sucker would bet on that horse.                              Don't sweat it.  He does this all the time. He's playin'.                              What's this? Lucky Day is now  crashing his way through the gate,                              and he's off and running.                              Seabiscuit, Fish Fingers...

And here comes Lucky Day,                              coming up from behind,  passing Yellow Tail, Salmonella.                              You see? Who's your fish now?

They're head to head. Neck to neck.  Lucky Day's ahead.                              I'm tired just thinkin'  about countin' all of this money.                              - Look at Lucky Day go.  - # We're movin' on up                              # To the eastside...

Everything's set, it's a lock,  we good to go, we in the money,                              and he trips underwater.                              Who in the halibut trips underwater?                              - And by the way, on what?  - That's it. That's it, I've had it.                              [high-pitched] Ernie. Bernie.  Find the deepest hole in the ocean                              and when you do, dig deeper.  And put him in it.                              [wails]                              Sorry, kid.

Go on, man.                              Well, I'll tell you what happened.                              Big ol' shark,  about       -feet long.                              - So he's swimming at me, right?  - [crowd gasp]                              - With teeth like razors.  - Razors.                              And I was, like,  you're gonna come at me like that?                              You're gonna come  at the "O" like that?                              Do the muscle thing, the muscle thing.                              Oh, right.                              So I told that dude, "You see this guy?"  and I pointed like this.                              Well, he's got a brother.  And he lives right over here.                              And I think it's time  for a little family reunion.                              - [laughs]  - [crowd cheer]                              You see, mon. I told you.

As the first fish in history to ever  take on a shark and win, tell me:                              Does this mean you're now protector  of the reef, new sheriff in town?

[Katie] You heard it here first.                              From now on, any shark tries  to bother this reef, it's his funeral.

It's a terrible thing, Don Lino.  Everybody loved Frankie.                              May whoever did this  die a thousand deaths.                              May his stinking, maggot-covered  corpse rot in the fiery depths of hell.                              Thank you for your kind thoughts,  Giuseppe.

Oh, Lenny...                              - Don't worry, boss.  - I said some things to him...                              We gotta find him.                              We're searching everywhere.  Forget about it, he'll turn up.                              What's wrong with that kid?  Why's he gotta be so different?                              Frankie, God rest his soul,  he was perfect. Perfect.                              Oh... Luca. Who could have done this?                              Oh... Luca.

I totally betrayed you,                              but listen, I got just one  little problem I gotta take care of.                              - Oh, what's that?  - Sharks are coming to get me!                              And they should.  I mean, what'd you expect?                              You'd take credit  for killing a shark,                              and then everything would be fine  and dandy for the rest of your life?                              Uh... yeah.                              But, hey, don't you worry about it.                              Me and Lenny got it.  We gonna fix it.                              "We"? I don't want any part of this.                              Too late, veggie-boy.  They're lookin' for you, too.                              Point taken. What's the plan?                              - This is what we gonna do.  - [Angie] Here's the plan.                              You tell the truth.  And, you, go home.                              [both laugh]                              All right, look,  this is what we're gonna do.                              We're gonna paint you up all bloody.  A mess, right?          …

Extract and Expose Server:handle function and use it in :run

When testing a server I don't want to have to spin up a separate thread
to run the server and then communicate with it over a socket. This is
something that I have experienced in rails and other web frameworks. Not
only is it annoying but it can cause issues with managing database
access (not that we have that yet). Instead I have exposed the :handle
function which will process a request and return a response. Then in
:run we can construct a request from a socket connection, pass it to
:handle and render the response.

In the tests we can do a number of things then:

1. Access the raw response. I'm also preserving the body object returned
   so that tests can query the content of the view object. No more
   brittle UI tests!

2. If you need brittle UI tests (and sometimes we do!) then you can
   render the view object in the test and make assertions against it.
   You could even load the result of the view object into a headless
   browser to test! One issue here is that without a sever running none
   of the linked resources would be requested... perhaps there is value
   in having a server running. Or perhaps these type of tests could have
   a separate test harness?

Generalise framework to be reusable for Thanos as well.

We love this functionality! Especially asserting on metric, amazing! Super clean.

Thanks for this @pracucci!

## Changes

* Rename framework to e2e. `framework` to me does not mean for what framework. Happy to discuss naming here :D
* Split cortex stuff to e2ecortex
* Split DBs services to e2edb I think it's useful to share those.

Localizations (#133)

This PR add support for localization.

If you are a plugin author and looking for some boilerplate code, take a look at https://github.com/matterpoll/matterpoll/pull/133/commits/54617ce30edf17b6c365271eb108e9a2f808e12d.

## General translation rules
- When a translation is missing, use the English one.
- For texts displayed to only one user e.g. ephemeral messages, use the users local.
- For texts displayed to multiple users e.g. use [the Default Server Language](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#default-server-language). (I'm not 100% happy with that. I would love to hear other ideas on this)

There is currently only a German translation.

## Technical notes

This is pretty much a first try on localization of plugins. I tried to "get something" done.

I use the same library (https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) as the MM server, but version 2. The main difference between V1 and V2 are:
- All default strings are kept inside the codebase. This improves the dev experience greatly. No more tapping to `en.json`.
- Improved support for plural forms
- Removed the global state
- There are now **two** translation file for every language:
 - `active.de.json`: This contain all translated messages
 - `translate.de.json`: This contains to messages, that have to be translated. This file get auto populated every time a messages in the source changes. (This is awesome). New messages also get auto populated into this file, so you easy to track what needs to be translated.
- New CLI tools to support the two files (They require some time go get used to, I admit)

I did keep the messages in global scope. This allows me to use them in tests. This might not be suitable for everybody.

I opted to use `json` instead of the default `toml`. 0/5 if this is a good idea. Might be worth to go with the standard.


## How to do translation?

This is a bit complicated, but:
- We can add commands to the make file
- Running the command inside `i18n` makes the easier. But I wanted to be able to run them from the root directory.
- Using `toml` instead of `json` would make this easier.

### Translating a new language

Replace `de` with your local!

`touch asserts/i18n/translate.de.json`

`goi18n merge -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ assets/i18n/active.en.json
assets/i18n/translate.de.json`

After `translate.de.json` has been translated, rename it to `active.de.json`.

See also https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n#translating-a-new-language

### Translating new messages

`goi18n extract -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ server/`

`goi18n merge -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ i18n/active.*.json`

Translate your messages

`goi18n merge -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ i18n/active.*.json i18n/translate.*.json`

See also https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n#translating-new-messages

## Open problems
The following things are not translatable, due to technical limitations of Mattermost:
- System console settings page
- Slash command help text


Fixes #119

"7:55am. Sometimes I dream about trading and this was one of those times. I must have woken up something like 2 hours ago and was lying in bed all this time.

Towards the end of my trading period, back in 2013, I have daytrading a shot. Two things beat me at that time:

1) The 25k daytrading limit. Thanks to this one, I was mostly an observer for two years, rather than a trader.
2) But primarily, the biggest issue is that I could not watch many stocks at the same time, so the best trades were always out of my sight.

If I could do sequence prediction properly, I could easily clear the second requirement.

Compare that to online gaming for money (like poker). There is more money in gaming, but all the games are very visual. Even for poker, the online dens opt to make things more difficult for computers by forcing them to solve the vision problem as a Turing test.

I am not sure I really feel like doing this problem.

8:05am. Whatever the case is, whether I chose to go back to trading or poker or anything else - I absolutely need the aid of computers.

8:10am. Everybody who is successful in trading these days is certainly using them as an aid. In fact, the character of the market itself changed post-2000 due to digitization of trading.

And whatever the case, I am going to need the completed Spiral in order to make good use of neuromorphic chips.

Having something that is orders of magnitude more efficient than GPUs and works without the need for batching would be a game changer. Definitely for RL. And for sequence prediction of the sort I would need for trading, the same would apply.

GPUs are huge and unwieldy hammers, neurochips are spears in comparison.

8:25am. And I will need to master them before I can do anything.

New hardware always changes the nature of the game, and this time it won't be an exception. Nature might have eclipsed me, but even it needed neurons before it could get intelligence.

8:30am. Let me start here. I can't just dwell in my own thoughts all day.

8:35am. https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/f2t5il/d_the_future_of_ml_unsupervised_learning/

This thread is interesting.

/u/adventuringraw: "It looks like Sergey Levine's focus was on transfer learning. Can we have a distributed army of agents using their off-time to open doors and do other menial tasks to learn, unsupervised, a highly generalized way of achieving goals in their environment, and share that knowledge among them?

Yann LeCun on the other hand seems to have put his core bet on model/representation learning.

I think both are going to be incredibly important. There's already good evidence that model based reinforcement learning can drastically improve sample efficiency in RL tasks. The SimPLe algorithm from Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Atari for example was able to outperform state of the art model free approaches on most games. On same games, by over an order of magnitude, and the 'world model' in this case was just a crude video prediction model. What happens when disentangled representation learning allows for a proper breakdown of 'entities' with meaningful attributes? SPACE was a recent exciting paper on that front I thought, maybe it would be possible to improve converged performance above state of the art model free approaches, and also do that with better sample efficiency than SimPLe even?

If you go even further though, and start asking about Causal Flow among the latent variables, you can start (potentially) getting very efficient ways to transfer to new tasks, or maybe even potentially run hypothetical 'thought experiments' to quickly trace possible trajectories between the current state and a given goal. (the World Model paper on the original DOOM had an agent trained entirely in a hallucinated 'imagined' version of Doom it learned for example).

Honestly though, I think the 'real' way forward is going to be around starting to turn all these crazy ideas into carefully abstracted building blocks to be layered together. Go-Explore for example, the first approach that was able to beat Montezuma's Revenge, and it doesn't even require any differentiable AI system at all, it's almost like a bizarre glorified A* or something. The basic idea, is to save a super low res screenshot of what the agent is seeing, and then save policies that can get from screenshot to screenshot, so you can traverse long distances just from going from goal post to goal post. But if you have the inter-goal navigation handled by a more powerful approach (say, a more classic differentiable learning system of some kind) you can end up with much more robust inter-goal transitions. Really helpful if you're in a stochastic environment instead of a deterministic one. But the obvious question... how should 'goal' posts be encoded? Screenshots obviously seem kind of shitty, but like... what if you could use a representation learning approach to encode goals? Some vector based representation of 'come back here with a key'. Where are the keys? (three have been seen, how should that be encoded?).

So you might end up combining all these different ideas and more (inverse scene graph from Hinton? Mixture of Experts approach for task-specific computational subunits?) to end up with a device that can 'reason' at different levels of abstraction, ideally working with a minimal representation that captures only the details needed to get from your current state, to the current subgoal on the way to the 'true' goal.

So I guess my actual vote... how (in an unsupervised manner) can useful (actionable) information relevant to a wide range of goals be encoded in a way that allows for easy policy retrieval and training, composition (so you can mix and match building blocks instead of running into a combinatorial explosion... 'be at this door with no key', 'be at this door with key A', 'be at this door with keys A and B', be at this door with key B', 'be at this door with key A and a ladder'....)? Can this all be done in a way that maximizes generalization and sample efficiency? And (even more) done in a way that allows for meaningful human intervention (look at this example of a human performing this task. Let's use human language to give the machine a goal. Let's have the model explain what it's doing and why, ideally in a way that's easy for humans to understand) and so on.

I don't know. I guess it feels like the building blocks are still being built and understood. It's common now to have papers with different 'modules' performing different kinds of computation (a CNN 'eyes' system, maybe a predictive RNN system, sort of subbing in for the human DLPFC, maybe an NLP system for communicating goals to the agent) but I think it'll be a while before we start to get into like... a theory of ML agent composition. Maybe it'll end up where there are common models (like VGG or whatever) that are used if your agent needs eyes, or another pretrained block (Turning-NLG or BERT or GPT-2 or whatever) for language comprehension, or another common model for whatever else you like, and then have integration systems plugging the pieces together.

But... yeah. Generalization and Representation learning I guess, tl;dr, haha. I definitely think it's WAY too limiting to say the future is in reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning though. That's like saying electricity is the future of telegraphy, speaking in the early 1800's. Like... yeah, that's true, but there was SO MUCH low level bullshit that needed to be understood to really use electricity properly there, and that was only a small part of the struggle. That work needed to be completed of course, but it also took an encoding scheme (Samuel Morse... there were MANY failed attempts before his ideas took off) it took logistical/engineering challenges (how the fuck are you going to run a line through the Goddamn ocean?) it took... man. All kinds of things. RL and unsupervised learning are probably lynchpin technologies, but while they're necessary, they're far from sufficient. I think none of the ideas above are sufficient, I think there's a whole lot of work ahead."

"thanks man. If you want a much more coherent and well organized overview of the state of things though, I'd highly recommend reading Jeffrey Dean's The Deep Learning Revolution and Its Implications for Computer Architecture and Chip Design, it's way more coherent than my mess of a comment above, haha.

That paper's WAY more readable than most papers. It's kind of a big picture overview of where things have been the last few years (starting with the TPU development and rollout for improving inference and training speed at the hardware level) and then gets into near future opportunities for AI fueled computational improvements. The coolest ideas I think have to do with revisiting very mature, stable technologies that haven't changed in decades, like SQL execution planning and hash table hash function design, and seeing if there are improvements that can be made to runtime speed/memory footprint using information about what kind of data was retrieved in the past. Crazy to think that understanding SQL in a decade might require some deep learning knowledge, haha.

The paper ends with the author's 3 big things they're expecting to be important in the future. Submodule based approaches like mixture of experts, AutoML, and transfer learning, potentially all combined, which totally makes sense when you think about it... in a Mixture of Experts type approach, why should all the computational subunits have the same architecture? Each one could potentially be refined on the task it's meant to run on, and distill itself down until you end up with really broad, powerful, minimal little units that can handle their own little corner of the problem space as optimally as possible. Transfer learning could be used to make sure each subunit is as generalizable as possible, within their problem space.

The thing I think's really cool about that paper though... not only is it easy to read, and not only are the ideas interesting and well presented, these aren't just ideas from some academic or whatever about what might be important. This paper is written by Jeffrey Dean, the lead of the Google Brain Project. The ideas here aren't ideas, they're a road map of what Google's done, what they're working on now, and what they're planning on working on over the next few years. Most of the stuff he's talking about is pretty far away from my own core interest (disentangled representation learning for computer vision and reinforcement learning) but still a cool read. If you're interested in overview stuff, there's people way more knowledgable than me writing, just hard to find their stuff sometimes."

The Deep Learning Revolution and Its Implications for Computer Architecture and Chip Design

Let me take a look at it then.

9:05am. Interesting that he mentioned a sparse architecture that does subarchitecture search online. Sounds like what the brain does.

Let me finally start.

The future will come eventually, after I finish Spiral.

For this morning, let me go through that tutorial.

9:40am. Had to take a break. Let me resume.

```
vscode.window.showInformationMessage('selected text: ${text}');
```

For some reason I am having difficulty with string interpolation. What is going on here?

Ah, I need to use ` rather than '.

Ok.

9:50am. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples

This page will be useful. This tutorial is actually pretty good. I am definitely learning a lot from it.

10:10am. Finally done with the tutorial.

This was quite good as an icebreaker.

10:20am. Am taking a little breather right now.

Let me check out the difference between tuple and the array again. The difference between `([item]) => ...` and `[item] => ...` confused me a bit.

Mhhh, I have no idea. It seems arrays are used both as regular arrays and tuples.

10:25am. Well, forget that for the time being.

10:30am. Enough slacking. I need to think of what comes next. I should do one more thing before I take off for breakfast.

I should put in at least another hour of work into this.

10:35am. Right now there are still many things I lack, but rather than going through those samples randomly, let me check out the VS Code extensions documentation again. Maybe it will make more sense now.

10:55am. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/extension-anatomy

I really do feel like I wasted this morning. Let me just focus on this for a while.

11am. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/overview

This stuff I should go through.

11:05am. Let me take a real break here.

Then when I gather my motivation, I will start going through the examples one by one."

markdown: Add helper configuration.

This refactoring is the first step toward sharing
our markdown code with mobile.  This focuses on
the Zulip layer, not the underlying third party `marked`
library.

Even though it looks like a pretty invasive change,
you will note that we barely needed to modify the
node tests to make this pass.  And we have pretty
decent test coverage here.

All of the places where we used to depend on
other Zulip modules now use helper functions that
any client (e.g. mobile) can configure themselves.
Or course, in the webapp, we configure these from
modules like people/stream_data/hash_util/etc.

Even in places where markdown used to deal directly with
data structures from other modules, we now use functions.
This gives mobile/webapp flexibility for how to handle
live data, plus it's just more consistent if everything
is a function.

For escape_html, we could have injected util.escape_html,
but that would mean that the mobile app would have to
inject their own version.  I decided it was better to just
duplicate the function within the webapp.  (If you are
wondering why I don't have the webapp just call into
markdown for escape_html in other places, it's just that
I don't want that monstrous dependency for things like
vdom.)

There were a couple other util functions related to our
subject/topic conversion that I just inlined:

    set_topic_links
    get_message_topic

The latter had some blueslip checks that I didn't
carry over, since those were really only intended
to catch obscure codepaths that might have still
used "subject".

I decided to keep the helpers data structure completely flat,
so we don't have ugly nested names like
`helpers.emoji.get_emoji_codepoint`.  Because of this,
some of the names aren't 1:1, which I think is fine.

For example, we map `people.get_by_name` to
`get_user_by_name`.

It's likely that mobile already has different names
for their versions of these functions, so trying for
fake consistency would only help the webapp.  In some
cases, I think the webapp functions have names that
could be improved, but we can clean that up in future
commits, and since the names aren't coupled to markdown
itself (i.e. only the config), we will be less
constrained.

It's worth noting that `marked` has an `options`
data structure that it uses for configuration, but
I didn't piggyback onto it, since the `marked`
options are more at the lexing/parsing layer vs.
the app-data layer stuff that our helpers mostly
help with.

Hopefully it's obvious why I just put helpers in
the top-level namespace for the module rather than
passing it around through multiple layers of the
parser.

There were a couple places in markdown where we
were doing awkward `hasOwnProperty` checks for
emoji-related stuff.  Now we use the Python
principle of ask-forgiveness-not-permission and
just handle the getters returning falsy data.  (It
should be `undefined`, but any falsy value is
unworkable in the places I changed, so I use
the simpler, less brittle form.)

We also break our direct dependency on
`emoji_codes.json` (with some help from the
prior commit).

In one place I rename streamName to stream_name,
fixing up an ancient naming violation that goes
way back to before this code was even extracted
away from echo.js.  I didn't bother to split this
out into a separate commit, since 2 of the 4
lines would be immediately re-modified in the
subsequent commit.

For the ui_init piece, we simply require
markdown_config at the top of ui_init.  Also,
there was a comment about needing to initialize
markdown after emoji that no longer applies,
since the initialization code just wires up
functions and doesn't actually consume emoji
data.

Note that we still depend on `fenced_code`
via the global namespace, instead of simply
requiring it directly or injecting it.  The
reason I'm postponing any action there is that
we'll have to change things once we move
markdown into a shared library.  (The most
likely outcome is that we'll rename/move both files
at the same time and fix the namespace/require
details as part of that commit.)

"12:35pm. Done with breakfast, done with chores. Let me start.

As expected it is one thing to be motivated to do great things, and it is quite another to do the grind.

Seriously, Spiral v0.2 is the last time I will subject myself to this. I am really unfortunate that nobody else made a language like Spiral, and that my talents are well suited for this kind of design work.

But being in this room, trying to painstakingly put the pieces together is...inhuman.

It was one thing to do this in 2017, but 2020 is really my limit. I want to be done with the most of it here, so that I can do more interesting programming after that.

In the future I'll either want to offload this work to AI agents, or find a way to literally mind control myself into enjoying this properly.

There is only so many times I can play the willpower card.

1:05pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/virtual-documents

I can't really say I am studying this. At best, I am dwelling in my thoughts while sampling the documentation on the side.

Let me do that for the whole API docs and then I will go directly for the samples.

1:30pm. This kind of study is hugely wasteful of time and it reminds me a bit of my time in school when the teacher will drone on and I would be lost in my dreamworld, not at all paying attention to the lecture.

Nonetheless, it is the best I can do. I guess it is too much to expect that I'll be able to finish this in a week. VS Code plugins are APIs piled on APIs and I can't really grok that just like that. I am simply going to have to do it like this, in multiple passes, each time internalizing something new.

If there is one thing I am grateful, it is that I am not checking social media and Mangdadex every 15m like yesterday.

1:35pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide

Well, let me just continue at my current pace. Since I am already more than halfway into it, I'll give this documentation another pass. Then I'll just focus on studying the samples.

1:40pm. Focus me, focus. Do not get lost in thought.

Actually, this journal is a problem on its own. It drew me out of the zone. I'll try to stop writing it until I am at least done with the docs.

https://www.apeth.com/nonblog/stories/textmatebundle.html

Let me read this. I have no idea what Textmate grammars are. The VS Code documentation is the first time I've encountered them.

1:55pm. Ok, I skimmed that. Do I really have to use Textmate? Can't I use my own parser?

2:05pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#contributing-a-basic-grammar

Ok, I have to focus on this just a little. I can do keyword coloring for Spiral with this.

In fact, that should be the very first thing I do, as a part of the project.

2:30pm. Done with that section. I will keep it in mind. Obviously I do not get it all just from reading this, but through experimentation I should be able to figure it out.

2:50pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide

Nearly done with docs. I need a short break here. After that I will finish this up and move to the samples.

3:10pm. Let me resume.

Let me finish this last bit of the docs and then I will move to the samples. Reading the docs is like reading a math book. It is not real skill - real skill is only acquired once you start playing around with the stuff yourself and put some of that into procedural memory.

3:15pm. Oh, Kengan Omega is out. Let me read this first then. I've already been spoilered that Ohma comes comes back.

3:35pm. I had no idea I would relax for so long. The chapter was hype. But seriously, let me resume.

3:55pm. Now I started reading threads on the ML sub. Focus me, focus!

4pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide

I have to admit, there are a shitload of details in here.

I said I wasted the morning, but it feels like I wasted everything after that. In the morning I at least did that tutorial. Let me just finish this and then I will finally move to the samples.

All this reminds me when in 2015 I spend like a month wastefully studying GUIs. I autistically went through all the examples in Petzold's book like it was a sacred tome.

4:05pm.

```
{
  "name": "Language Server E2E Test",
  "type": "extensionHost",
  "request": "launch",
  "runtimeExecutable": "${execPath}",
  "args": [
    "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}",
    "--extensionTestsPath=${workspaceRoot}/client/out/test",
    "${workspaceRoot}/client/testFixture"
  ],
  "stopOnEntry": false,
  "sourceMaps": true,
  "outFiles": ["${workspaceRoot}/client/out/test/**/*.js"]
}
```

Yesterday, I said I am starting to warm up to Typescript, but so far literally everything is like this. This is not like learning algorithms. Everything is one huge DSL, built out of smaller ones. All the functions have optional parameters, I literally cannot even begin guessing how complex all this is out of the hood or how it fits together.

4:15pm. Done with the documentation. I've skimmed it once more. I really did not get anything towards the end, and now the tedium is really hitting me. I am not sure whether I am up for playing with samples like I said I would, but let me give it a try.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples

I think I'll start things off by cloning this.

4:25pm. I'll give the status bar example a try.

...Why is it building so long? This is ridiculous. Maybe I should have ran it in debug mode.

4:35pm. No, it seems like I am doing wrong. Running F5 is not starting another instance of code with the plugin active. I have no idea what is going on.

Let me do one thing. There are two other plugin tutorials on Youtube so let me watch those.

4:50pm. https://youtu.be/srwsnNhiqv8

I am trying to watch this, but my focus is really dead at this point.

I should be figuring out how to get that status bar extension to run, but I do not feel like it. Seriously, fuck documentation. I am such a masochist.

Tomorrow, I am going to go into this more creatively if possible.

The way I've been approaching it so far is the worst.

All this really makes me appreciate programming though. If this was math, I'd have to basically throw in the towel here, but I know that with programming if I trace it, I can figure out everything.

That reminds me.

Remember my Pharo experience and how I managed to go by simply tracing through everything? I should be doing that here. I mean I have the debugger. I should use it.

I actually completely forgot about this before I mentioned tracing just now.

I thought Pharo was a waste of time, but I did get something from it in the end.

I should be tracing, tracing, tracing the shit out of everything, especially in the beginning.

Things like tracing and randomized testing is something math lost when it detached itself from a computational basis.

5pm. What I did in the last week is something I should not make a habit of.

This spending of time is a great show of will, but not so much of intelligence. Pharo really taught me that you should just take courage and dive into the system if you want to understand it.

If I am going to master these examples, I should channel the experience of last year.

Let me stop here for the day. Rather than trying to push myself, I should just take a bath instead and do this trace when I am fresh and ready to go."

Refactored dynamic learning module.
* I wasn't happy with the way the code for the dynamic learning module
  was written. It was difficult to see at which point it was that a
  newly derived Top program clause would be added to the dynamic
  database. In particular, it looked like the process was different for
  the Top prorgam of an invented predicate. It seems I thought that the
  way I'd written the code, the Top program for an invented predicate
  would be written to the dynamic database only once it was fully
  constructed, whereas for a target predicate each clause in the Top
  program would be written to the dynamic database as soon. Anyway this
  seems to have been my intent- but that's not what was happening. In
  both cases, each new clause in the Top program would be written to the
  dynamic database immmediately after it passed _generalisation_.
  However, the code obfuscated this because it would try to write an
  invented Top program's clauses to the dynamic database all together,
  at the end of construction- that would fail because the writing was
  attempted with a call to assert_prorgram/3, that only writes a clause
  to the database if the clause (or a variant of it) is not already
  there. A further problem was that the Top program returned as a list
  at the end of construction was different than the Top program written
  to the dynamic database because clauses were written to the database
  immediately after genearlisation- whereas they were added to the
  return-list only after _specialisation_. This may have affected what
  was learned in some cases. In any case, the code obfuscated the order
  in which things were done and what was done even, so I rewrote it to
  clarify the situation.
* The new code performs generalisation, constraint checking and
  specialisation in a single findall/3 loop. The loop could equally be
  done with forall/2 but findall/3 makes it much easier because it
  avoids a whole bunch of conditionals that are needed if forall/2 is
  used instead. It sucks a bit because the return list of findall/3 is
  not really-really used, except to check that the Top program is not
  empty (if it is, construction fails silently). Each new clause derived
  through this process is written to the dynamic database only after
  it's passed specialisation, after generalisation and constraint
  testing. Because of the use of nondeterminism, it's very bloody hard
  to pass references to clauses written to the database during recursive
  Top program construction for predicate invention, or the clauses
  themselves, to the top-level of the recursion, so clauses are read
  from the database at the end of Top program construction instead. By
  that I mean _all_ clauses, with invented symbols or not. This is done
  at the end of the top-level Top program construction, not in the
  recursive steps. So it's very dirty, impure Prolog- but at least it's
  now easier to read the code and understand what is going on. I think.
* A few tests suggest that the code works at least as good as before and
  possibly even better in some cases, e.g. in the string transformation
  experiments from the Bias Reformulation paper with Metagol.

Coursera applying for Financial Aid

## Why are you applying for Financial Aid? 

I’m a student from Bangladesh and want to learn Big Data Essentials. I think it will be beneficial for me to get into a good firm as an intern. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So, I’m badly in need of this financial aid. Receiving this Financial Aid will open for me a new horizon of the world of Coursera courses, which in turn will help me in the future. Sir, we are four brothers and we all are at the learning stage and it becomes a lot difficult for the family members to pay the whole amount for all the three of us and if I add up my course it will make even harder for them to pay. Sir, I need this course very badly for my CV and for increasing my knowledge about the subject.


## How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

I want to take this course as I want to learn Big Data Essentials. I want to complete the course due to my curiosity and also that I can put a good CV to get applied to a job. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out various programs in a computer language and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments that are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.

## Would you consider using a low-interest loan to pay for your courses? No then Explain

Sir, the financial status of the family is not too good to pay the loan amount. We already have a lot of dept in the bank and my parents are paying it on a regular basis. It would make their life even harder to add a new loan over them. Sir, I don't want to put any pressure over them. Sir, it would be a great help for me to get a good job and help my family if I'm able to get this course.

11.1.phpunit-bridge & routing Recipes

Let's see what recipes we have left:

composer recipes
Updating symfony/phpunit-bridge
Next up is phpunit-bridge. Copy its name and run:

composer recipes:install symfony/phpunit-bridge --force -v
It says it created - probably updated - 5 files. You know the process:

git add -p
Updating .env.test
The first is .env.test with two changes. This fix is a silly typo on the APP_SECRET variable - that's not important - and the second is a new PANTHER_APP_ENV variable. If you're using Symfony Panther - a cool testing tool - then this variable is used to tell Panther which environment to launch. If you're not, then you don't technically need this... but it doesn't hurt anything. You also might install Panther in the future.
As a challenge, let's see if we can just add the second change. To do that, type "s", which means "split". The tool will then try to ask you about each change independently. Say "n" to the first and "y" to the second.

.phpunit.result.cache inside .gitignore
The next update is inside .gitignore: it ignores a new .phpunit.result.cache file. This is why I love updating recipes. Since version 7.3, PHPUnit outputs this file under certain conditions as a way to remember which tests failed. It should be ignored, and this takes care of that. Enter "y".

Updating bin/phpunit
Woh! The next change looks bigger - this is bin/phpunit: a script that this packages adds to help execute PHPUnit. It has a number of subtle updates... and since you've almost definitely not made any custom tweaks to this file, let's add the change.

Updating phpunit.xml.dist
The last update is for phpunit.xml.dist - PHPUnit's configuration file. You may have some customizations here that you want to keep - so be careful. The recipe updates are tiny: these changed from <env to <server - a mostly meaningless change to how environment variables are added - and it looks like something about these two SYMFONY_PHPUNIT variables got tweaked a bit.
Hit "y" to accept this patch. The last change is for symfony.lock - hit "y" for this one too.

11.2.phpunit-bridge & routing Recipes

Updating symfony/routing
Done! The next recipe on the list is symfony/routing. Let's jump straight to update it:

composer recipes:install symfony/routing --force -v
And then get into:

git add -p
Bah! Duh! I should have committed my changes before starting this and then reverted the stuff we did not want - like this. We'll do that in a minute. Hit "n" to ignore the .env.test change.
The first real change is in config/packages/routing.yaml: strict_requirements is gone and utf8: true was added. If you dug into the recipe history, you could find the reason behind both of these. utf8 is a new feature in routing. By setting this to true, you're activating that feature. We may not need it, but I'm going to say yes to this.
The second change - strict_requirements - is thanks to a little reorganization of the routing config files that, actually, I am responsible for. The short story is that: you want this key to be set to a different value in different environments. I moved some config around to get that done with less files.
Hit "y" to add these changes. And... yep! This is symfony.lock, so accept this too. Phew! Let's see how things look:

git status
Woh! A new routing.yaml file for the prod environment! If you open that - config/packages/prod/routing.yaml - it has strict_requirements: null:

4 lines  config/packages/prod/routing.yaml
framework:
    router:
        strict_requirements: null
It's part of that reorganization I was just talking about. Add that change:

git add config/packages/prod/routing.yaml
The last change - which we need to do manually - is to delete config/packages/test/routing.yaml:

4 lines  config/packages/test/routing.yaml
framework:
    router:
        strict_requirements: true
It's another file with strict_requirements and it is gone from the new recipe. Why? It's just not needed anymore: if you followed the logic, you'd find that strict_requirements is already true in the test environment. Delete it:

git rm config/packages/test/routing.yaml
Oh... I apparently modified that file? Whoops! Yep, I added a g! Not helpful. Remove it and... delete the file:

git rm config/packages/test/routing.yaml
Let's see how things look:

git status
A lot of progress from those two recipe updates. Let's commit:

git commit -m "upgrading phpunit &amp; routing recipes"
The one change left - that we decided we didn't care about - is in .env.test. Revert it with:

git checkout .env.test
Woo! Let's find out what recipes we have left:

composer recipes
Woh! Only 3 main Symfony repositories left: security-bundle, translation and validator. Let's do those next.

introduce new release process

Context
=======

After multiple discussions about our current release schedule and
process, we've come to the conclusion that we need to be able to make a
distinction between technical snapshots and marketing releases. In other
words, we need to be able to create a bundle for early adopters to test
without making it an officially-supported version, and without
necessarily implying everyone should go through the trouble of
upgrading. The underlying goal is to have less frequent but more stable
"official" releases.

This PR is a proposal for a new release process designed under the
following constraints:

- Reuse as much as possible of the existing infrastructure, to minimize
  effort but also chances of disruptions.
- Have the ability to create "snapshot"/"nightly"/... releases that are
  not meant for general public consumption, but can still be used by savvy
  users without jumping through too many extra hoops (ideally just
  swapping in a slightly-weirder version string).
- Have the ability to promote an existing snapshot release to "official"
  release status, with as few changes as possible in-between, so we can be
  confident that the official release is what we tested as a prerelease.
- Have as much of the release pipeline shared between the two types of
  releases, to avoid discovering non-transient problems while trying to
  promote a snapshot to an official release.
- Triggerring a release should still be done through a PR, so we can
  keep the same approval process for SOC2 auditability.

The gist of this proposal is to replace the current `VERSION` file with
a `LATEST` file, which would have the following format:

```
ef5d32b7438e481de0235c5538aedab419682388 0.13.53-alpha-20200214-3025-ef5d32b7
```

This file would be maintained with a script to reduce manual labor in
producing the version string. Other than that, the process will be
largely the same, with releases triggered by changes to this `LATEST`
and the release notes files.

Version numbers
===============

Because one of the goals is to reduce the velocity of our published
version numbers, we need a different version scheme for our snapshot
releases. Fortunately, most version schemes have some support for that;
unfortunately, the SDK sits at the intersection of three different
version schemes that have made incompatible choices. Without going into
too much detail:

- Semantic versioning (which we chose as the version format for the SDK
  version number) allows for "prerelease" version numbers as well as
  "metadata"; an example of a complete version string would be
  `1.2.3-nightly.201+server12.43`. The "main" part of the version string
  always has to have 3 numbers separated by dots; the "prerelease"
  (after the `-` but before the `+`) and the "metadata" (after the `+`)
  parts are optional and, if present, must consist of one or more segments
  separated by dots, where a segment can be either a number or an
  alphanumeric string. In terms of oredering, metadata is irrelevant and
  any version with a prerelease string is before the corresponding "main"
  version string alone. Amongst prereleases, segments are compared in
  order with purely numeric ones compared as numbers and mixed ones
  compared lexicographically. So 1.2.3 is more recent than 1.2.3-1,
  which is itself less recent than 1.2.3-2.
- Maven version strings are any number of segments separated by a `.`, a
  `-`, or a transition between a number and a letter. Version strings
  are compared element-wise, with numeric segments being compared as
  numbers. Alphabetic segments are treated specially if they happen to be
  one of a handful of magic words (such as "alpha", "beta" or "snapshot"
  for example) which count as "qualifiers"; a version string with a
  qualifier is "before" its prefix (`1.2.3` is before `1.2.3-alpha.3`,
  which is the same as `1.2.3-alpha3` or `1.2.3-alpha-3`), and there is a
  special ordering amongst qualifiers. Other alphabetic segments are
  compared alphabetically and count as being "after" their prefix
  (`1.2.3-really-final-this-time` counts as being released after `1.2.3`).
- GHC package numbers are comprised of any number of numeric segments
  separated by `.`, plus an optional alphanumeric qualifier separated by
  a `-`. I could not find any official documentation on ordering.
- npm uses semantic versioning so that is covered already.

After much more investigation than I'd care to admit, I have come up
with the following compromise as the least-bad solution. First,
obviously, the version string for stable/marketing versions is going to
be "standard" semver, i.e. major.minor.patch, all numbers, which works,
and sorts as expected, for all three schemes. For snapshot releases, we
shall use the following format:

```
0.13.53-alpha-20200214-3025-ef5d32b7
```

where the components are, respectively:

- `0.13.53`: the expected version string of the next "stable" release.
- `alpha`: a marker that hopefully scares people enough.
- `20200214`: the date of the release commit, which _MUST_ be on
  master.
- `3025`: the number of commits in master up to the release commit
  (included). Because we have a linear, append-only master branch.
- `ef5d32b7ù : the first 8 characters of the release commit sha.

The main downside of this format is that, strictly speaking, it is not
going to sort correctly under semantic versioning, as the entire string
after the first `-` will be parsed as a single alphanumeric qualifier,
and therefore compare lexicographically. In other words, commit 10000
will sort as being before commit 9999. I think that's acceptable.

The upsides are:

- It clearly indicates it is an unstable release (`alpha`).
- It clearly indicates how old it is, by including the date.
- To humans, it is immediately obvious which version is "later" even if
  they have the same date, allowing us to release same-day patches if
  needed.
- It contains the git sha so the commit built for that release is
  immediately obvious.

Alternatives I considered:

- Correct smeantic versioning: `0.13.53-alpha.20200214.3025.ef5d32b7`.
  This works well for npm and maven, but is unacceptable to GHC. It can
  be made to work (and I did) by providing GHC with an alternative,
  equivalent version format (e.g. replacing the relevant dots with dashes,
  or moving the `-alpha` to the end), but I ultimately decided the added
  complexity wasn't worth it.
- Not having any non-numeric component, e.g. `0.13.53.20200214.3025`.
  This is not valid semantic versioning and is therefore rejected by
  npm.
- Not having detailed info: just go with `0.13.53-snapshot`. This is
  what is generally done in the Java world, but we then lose track of what
  version is actually in use and I'm concerned about bug reports. This
  would also not let us publish to the main Maven repo (at least not more
  than once), as artifacts there are supposed to be immutable.
- No having a qualifier: `0.13.53-3025` would be acceptable to all three
  version formats. However, it would not clearly indicate to humans that
  it is not meant as a stable version, and would sort differently under
  semantic versioning (which counts it as a prerelease, i.e. before
  `0.13.53`) than under maven (which counts it as a patch, so after
  `0.13.53`).

Release notes
=============

Release notes are a bit tricky. Because we want the ability to make
snapshot releases, then later on promote them to stable releases, it
follows that we want to build commits from the past. However, if we
decide post-hoc that a commit is actually a good candidate for a
release, there is no way that commit can have the appropriate release
notes: it cannot know what version number it's getting, and, moreover,
we now track changes in commit messages.

The only sensible solution here is to pick up the release notes as of
the commit that triggers the release.

New release process
===================

Just like releases are currently controlled mostly by detecting
changes to the `VERSION` file, the new process would be controlled by
detecting changes to a `LATEST` file. The format of that file would
include both the version string and the corresponding SHA.

Upon detecting a change to the `LATEST` file, CI would run the entire
release process, just like it does now with the VERSION file. The main
differences are:

1. Before running the release step, CI will checkout the commit
  specified in the LATEST file.
2. The `//:VERSION` Bazel rule will be replaced by a repository rule
  that gets the version to build from an environment variable, with a
  defailt of `0.0.0` to remain consistent with the current `daml-head`
  behaviour.

Some of the manual steps will need to be skipped for a snapshot release.
See amended `release/RELEASE.md` in this commit for details.

The LATEST file should not be edited manually. It should be edited
through the script provided in this PR, which has the following
behaviour:

1. `./release create` will create a new branch and update the LATEST
  file to designate the latest commit on origin/master as the next
  snapshot release.
2. `./release publish` will create a new branch and update the LATEST
  file to drop the qualifier, but keep the same commit.

The main caveat of this approach is that the official release will be a
different binary from the corresponding snapshot. It will have been
built from the same source, but with a different version string. This is
somewhat mitigated by Bazel caching, meaning any build step that does
not depend on the version string should use the cache and produce
identical results. I do not think this can be avoided when our artifact
includes its own version number.

Add shadows to particles

This required a major overhaul of the shadow/light implementation, which
I am pretty glad about. About damn time.

Rename RenderStrategies to RenderPasses. It is now possible to add
custom render passes before and after the actual draw-renderpass. The
transparent pass is always last. Renderer::addRenderpass*() add a
render pass ONLY to the NEXT drawFrame() call. This means that
Renderer::addRenderPass*() has to be called every frame if you want to
execute the pass every frame.

Lights use this new renderpass mechanic to generate shadow maps. Lights
now inherit from IRenderObject (which I have to rename urgently) and act
as normal drawable objects in the tree. They use the update() method to
add shadow render passes to the Renderer.

This means that I was finally able to get rid of the light shit in
SceneRoot and the crappy light buffer update in Renderer::drawFrame().
This actually increased the performance since I added a dirty flag to
lights so they only update the light buffer (which they now manage for
themselves, as it should be) when necessary instead of every frame.

The shadow pass is now a lot simpler as well.

AssetLoader is now initialized in Renderer::init(). Renderer throws an
exception if OpenGL is not initialized when calling Renderer::init().

Disable multisampling because the insane framerate I can reach now is
nice to look at.

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].

 */
Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

py-uncompyle6: updated to 3.6.4

3.6.4:
plateau

The main focus in this release was fix some of the more glaring problems creapt in from the last release due to that refactor.

uncompyle6 code is at a plateau where what is most needed is a code refactoring. In doing this, until everything refactored and replaced, decomplation may get worse.

Therefore, this release largely serves as a checkpoint before more major upheaval.

The upheaval, in started last release, I believe the pinnicle was around c90ff51 which wasn't a release. I suppose I should tag that.

After c90ff5, I started down the road of redoing control flow in a more comprehensible, debuggable, and scalable way. See The Control Flow Mess.

The bulk of the refactoring going on in the decompyle3 project, but I try to trickle down the changes.

It is tricky because the changes are large and I have to figure decompose things so that little testable pieces can be done. And there is also the problem that what is in decompyle3 is incomplete as well.

Other than control flow, another change that will probably happen in the next release is to redo the grammar for lambda expressions. Right now, we treat them as Python statements, you know, things with compound statements in them. But lambdas aren't that. And so there is hackery to paper over difference making a statement out of an expression the wrong thing to do. For example, a return of an "and" expression can be expressed as nested "if" statements with return inside them, but the "if" variant of the bytecode is not valid in a lambda.

In the decompyle3 code, I've gone down the road making the grammar goal symbol be an expression. This also offers the opportunity to split the grammar making parsing inside lambda not only more reliable because the wrong choices don't exist, but also simpler and faster because all those rules just need don't need to exist in parsing.

I cringe in thinking about how the code has lived for so long without noticing such a simple stupidity, and lapse of sufficient thought.


3.6.3:
Martin and Susanne

Of late, every release fixes major gaps and embarrassments of the last release....

And in some cases, like this one, exposes lacuna and rot.

I now have [control] flow under control, even if it isn't the most optimal way.

I now have greatly expanded automated testing.

On the most recent Python versions I regularly decompile thousands of Python programs that are distributed with Python. when it is possible, I then decompile Python's standard test suite distributed with Python and run the decompiled source code which basically checks itself. This amounts to about 250 test programs per version. This is in addition to the 3 CI testing services which do different things.

Does this mean the decompiler works perfectly? No. There are still a dozen or so failing programs, although the actual number of bugs is probably smaller though.

However, in perparation of a more major refactoring of the parser grammar, this release was born.

In many cases, decompilation is better. But there are some cases where decompilation has gotten worse. For lack of time (and interest) 3.0 bytecode suffered a hit. Possibly some code in the 3.x range did too. In time and with cleaner refactored code, this will come back.

Commit c90ff51 was a local maxiumum before, I started reworking the grammar to separate productions that were specific to loops versus those that are not in loops.
In the middle of that I added another grammar simplication to remove singleton productions of the form sstmts-> stmts. These were always was a bit ugly, and complicated output.

At any rate if decompilation fails, you can try c90ff51. Or another decompiler. unpyc37 is pretty good for 3.7. wibiti uncompyle2 is great for 2.7. pycdc is mediocre for Python before 3.5 or so, and not that good for the most recent Python. Generally these programs will give some sort of answer even if it isn't correct.

decompyle3 isn't that good for 3.7 and worse for 3.8, but right now it does things no other Python decompiler like unpyc37 or pycdc does. For example, decompyle3 handles variable annotations. As always, the issue trackers for the various programs will give you a sense for what needs to be done. For now, I've given up on reporting issues in the other decompilers because there are already enough issues reported, and they are just not getting fixed anyway.

Basic support for newer versions (#435)

This is still quite incomplete but putting it up here because replays and playing alone vs ai work.
(At least for me)

Multiplayer/observing don't work.

A too big overhaul of the existing code wasn't necessary, once the game has
been launched it functions mostly the same. Some struct layouts are a different (And obviously
the addresses as well) but that's mostly it.

Forge isn't used here, though other parts of code call directly to forge so it was changed
to have hacky support for non-forge windows. Probably should refactor it so that Bw1161 calls
to forge and BwScr does something else, and everyone goes through that interface.

Most of the changes were during launch:

1) The JS code of app which verifies the version will now recognize if the selected starcraft
directory has "x86/starcraft.exe" in it and uses that to decide if we launch 1161 mode or not
(Game dll relies on '-launch' cmdline argument being passed/not for detecting this).

The code was written pretty quickly so it could likely be organized a lot better, I just didn't
want to focus on it too much :p

2) The App's C++ side got a alternate injection implementation which launches the game as a
process to be debugged, uses windows apis to debug it a bit in order to get out DLL injected
right before Windows calls TLS callbacks of the exe. The code is messy, maybe relies a bit on Windows internals (doesn't
work on Wine, should work on Win7+) and I really hate it and wish that I never have to touch
it again.

Hopefully it won't cause any issues.

The api won't also fit 1:1 with the older injection code, most notably inject+resume are a single
operation with this newer method, the explicit `process.resume()` is only meaningful with 1.16.1.
(It could be developed further to separate inject and resume from each other but I really would
rather not)

3) Once the process is launched, we still need to do a bit of.. trickery in order to be able to patch
it reliably. That part is done in a black-box dll sb_init.dll. Don't worry too much about how 
it works =) Once sb_init.dll is ready it calls a callback that was provided to it and we can
patch the exe.

4) After all that, we still need to figure out what memory addresses are used by the current
exe for variables/functions. Conveniently, I happen to have a library called `samase_scarf` which
takes the exe binary data as input and is able to figure out those important addresses.

It is quite complex project and I really should document it, but shieldbattery's side is nice and clean,
needing only few lines of code per variable.

After that everything mostly just works. There were minor differences at few places, e.g. 1.16.1
allows 255 as invalid storm player id but now it has to be 0xffffffff or else the game crashes

# Additional things

The server has a 30 second launch timeout specified at `server/lib/wsapi/lobbies.js`. It may
be worth it to increase that when trying this (At least it would have been necessary for this PC,
but I have a locally patched it very high anyway since it gets in the way of debugging launch issues)

Since debugging this is quite tough compared to 1.16.1, and there can be unexpected crashes on
other systems, I added a simple crash handler that writes a minidump to logs folder on crash.
Debugging those can be often easier than live debugging (Still not that simple).
The crash message needs improvement though so that people know where to find the crash dump and
such. 1.16.1 also benefits from that if it ever crashes. Even still should probably explicitly
block the usual error reporter as it has sent minidumps on some versions for just assertion
failures.

* Injection patches

* Able to play alone

* Fix issues

* Integrate forge more with scr

* Minor dependency update

* Make SCR support be behind a flag

* Add logging callback to the native process code

Implementation has to make sure JS objects are only used on the JS thread
(which is not the same thread what process creation is done on)

* Remove an unnecessary commented out debug message

markdown: Add helper configuration.

This refactoring is the first step toward sharing
our markdown code with mobile.  This focuses on
the Zulip layer, not the underlying third party `marked`
library.

Even though it looks like a pretty invasive change,
you will note that we barely needed to modify the
node tests to make this pass.  And we have pretty
decent test coverage here.

All of the places where we used to depend on
other Zulip modules now use helper functions that
any client (e.g. mobile) can configure themselves.
Or course, in the webapp, we configure these from
modules like people/stream_data/hash_util/etc.

Even in places where markdown used to deal directly with
data structures from other modules, we now use functions.
This gives mobile/webapp flexibility for how to handle
live data, plus it's just more consistent if everything
is a function.

I decided to keep the helpers data structure completely flat,
so we don't have ugly nested names like
`helpers.emoji.get_emoji_codepoint`.  Because of this,
some of the names aren't 1:1, which I think is fine.

For example, we map `people.get_by_name` to
`get_user_by_name`.

It's likely that mobile already has different names
for their versions of these functions, so trying for
fake consistency would only help the webapp.  In some
cases, I think the webapp functions have names that
could be improved, but we can clean that up in future
commits, and since the names aren't coupled to markdown
itself (i.e. only the config), we will be less
constrained.

It's worth noting that `marked` has an `options`
data structure that it uses for configuration, but
I didn't piggyback onto it, since the `marked`
options are more at the lexing/parsing layer vs.
the app-data layer stuff that our helpers mostly
help with.

Hopefully it's obvious why I just put helpers in
the top-level namespace for the module rather than
passing it around through multiple layers of the
parser.

There were a couple places in markdown where we
were doing awkward `hasOwnProperty` checks for
emoji-related stuff.  Now we use the Python
principle of ask-forgiveness-not-permission and
just handle the getters returning falsy data.  (It
should be `undefined`, but any falsy value is
unworkable in the places I changed, so I use
the simpler, less brittle form.)

We also break our direct dependency on
`emoji_codes.json` (with some help from the
prior commit).

In one place I rename streamName to stream_name,
fixing up an ancient naming violation that goes
way back to before this code was even extracted
away from echo.js.  I didn't bother to split this
out into a separate commit, since 2 of the 4
lines would be immediately re-modified in the
subsequent commit.

For the ui_init piece, we simply require
markdown_config at the top of ui_init.  Also,
there was a comment about needing to initialize
markdown after emoji that no longer applies,
since the initialization code just wires up
functions and doesn't actually consume emoji
data.

Note that we still depend on `fenced_code`
via the global namespace, instead of simply
requiring it directly or injecting it.  The
reason I'm postponing any action there is that
we'll have to change things once we move
markdown into a shared library.  (The most
likely outcome is that we'll rename/move both files
at the same time and fix the namespace/require
details as part of that commit.)

Solved a shitshow in the making

- Playercols now have custom ruler compatibility, operated via a toggle switch that changes the operation of the system from on-actions to MTTF.  For faster, cleaner operation, use the default option, but since paradox is stupid, you cant have on_startup events hit custom rulers, so this is a necessary evil.

- also added more imamite history
