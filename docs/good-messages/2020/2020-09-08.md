libdepengine: avoid building dependees after dependencies failed

This is another hack on the horrid sorcery logic of running many times
through the same code to do different things. The problem: Building of
a dependency fails, but sorcery still tries to build the spell depending
on the failed one, usually resulting in predictable failure, otherwise
in a perhaps unintended build with an older installed version of the
dependency.

Example was nss failing for me (still have to figure out that weird one)
and still firefox cast bein attempted after that. This is stupid
behaviour.

I solve that by grepping for the spell in $FAILED_LIST and using occurence
there to indicate a nonzero return value where there is no value recorded
from the depengine_cast_engine. The only justification is that it works.

Caveat: It only works to avoid nonsense in the casting phase. If things
fail in configure phase, we still have the pecuilarity that dependees are
removed from the cast only if they have been processed before. If you
specified

	cast a b

where b depends on a and configuration of a fails, b is still attempted to
be cast. This is for another night, or a proper rewrite.

Note: There are other places with grep $spell $FAILED_LIST. I suggest checking if that
should read "^$spell$" instead there, too.

Begin replacing the Surt-terrain with Fantasy24

For a while (it escapes me how long), we've been coloring our assets
using a pallette taken from Surt's Blowhard 2: Blowharder asset pack.
It was a sort of Gameboy Color-esque pallette that was bright and
poppy - I liked it a lot!

However, we bottomed out on what we (I) could do with it almost
immediately. A limited pallette is partially a blessing, partially a
curse: the limited color set looks good and helps me know what should
go where, but a pallette that's too limited stretches my flimsy art
skills to the limit.

I needed a pallette that had more tones - one that could express a
better range, and also trended towards warmer colors. The Fantasy24
pallette was the best one I could find. It has a good mix of colors,
all of them are warmer and (best of all) it comes with color usage
examples so that my tiny brain doesn't twist in twain. Neat!

The building textures were actually the first to use this pallette,
but this commit rolls out those changes to the basic terrain items.

Create The love-letter-mystery

James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.

To do this, he follows two rules:

He can only reduce the value of a letter by , i.e. he can change d to c, but he cannot change c to d or d to b.
The letter a may not be reduced any further.
Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.

For example, given the string , the following two operations are performed: cde → cdd → cdc.

Function Description

Complete the theLoveLetterMystery function in the editor below. It should return the integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make the string a palindrome.

theLoveLetterMystery has the following parameter(s):

s: a string
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries.
The next  lines will each contain a string .

Constraints


 | s | 
All strings are composed of lower case English letters, *ascii[a-z], with no spaces.

Output Format

A single line containing the minimum number of operations corresponding to each test case.

Sample Input

4
abc
abcba
abcd
cba
Sample Output

2
0
4
2
Explanation

For the first test case, abc → abb → aba.
For the second test case, abcba is already a palindromic string.
For the third test case, abcd → abcc → abcb → abca → abba.
For the fourth test case, cba → bba → aba.

Create 160A-Twins.cpp

Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.

Now let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, n coins of arbitrary values a1, a2, ..., an. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.

As you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. "But why split the money equally?" — you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.

Input
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces.

Output
In the single line print the single number — the minimum needed number of coins.

Create I want to make a DIFFERENCE

��I 'm a child of God and all my HEART BELONGS TO HIM �� I am grateful for all that he has given me and taught me along my life path �� Good is My Heart and my soul, the only one who takes control �� �� �� Love xo

I know I am took me 40 to 50 years to figure it out?? Why I had a secret so deep I NEVER TOLD ANYONE!!!! I can tell you now: at 6 or 7 years old, my Grandfather of all people molested me! I kept that secret in for 40 years till I finally found a counselor, I felt completely comfortable with!! I told her!! OMG I felt shell shocked! It tok me sometime and lots more counseling to find the me inside!! She is a pretty good-looking, smart and likes to have fun :-) I am a true christian, and proud of it!! I really believe that all the problems and pain I went through was God's way of telling me! Hey, Debbie slow down and llisten!! That is how I got the title for my book, "Written from MY HEART! I want to make a difference" About how we all have hearts that truly LOVE but we are listening to God talking to us!! We get caught up in the world and all its trappings that we forget , who put us here!! I believe God and Mother Earth gave us this plant to live, grow and prosper! That is why we have the three needs to live, Food, water and shelter!
Than God, our Father sent us Jesus to show us how to live!! To be a human with a heart that loves everyone! He died on the cross for our sins and shed his blood down on us to make sure we would live like him! When he said,"Forgive them for they know not what they do"
the Holy Spirit inot our hearts that we can live like Jesus or destroy ourself to hell!!
Than how to love yourself? First thing one needs to do is listen to their hearts!! Live like people who care about each other! Not being selfish and self centered as MOST ALL HAVE BECOME!! I say LOVING YOURSELF, is really hard if your life has been a horrible, not normal, or not taught right from wrong??
What do you think?? Add anything?? Please do!! I want honest input and suggestions!!
Thank you My Buddy for reading all this!?

[Death Knight] Frostscythe aoe cap, Frostwyrm's Fury baseline, more 2H support (#5244)

BoS 2h support
glacial advance 2h support
howling blast 2h support
remorseless winter 2h support

Using find_class_spell on Death Knight, was returning 0, so the aura was not applying, rolling back to using find_spell
with the id, as that is what other class modules seem to be doing as well
note - melekus: yeah it seems I fucked up there

Remove the crit aura apply from frostscythe, as the apply_affecting_aura is now applying it

To Whom It May Concern:


 	I wanted to make my cover letter a glimpse of the person you would consider for this position.  As a resume is created for experience and education, the cover letter is about looking at characteristics of who or what kind of person or applicant you would be hiring.  I say this because a person’s ability to think outside the box cannot be placed on paper, a person’s personality or understanding of inner office workflow cannot be gauged by a resume.  The real question is will I the candidate this excel at completing any and all task assigned.  To this question I say yes that I do have the ability to establish great relationships with the internal customer and external customers while also completing assigned tasks given within the scope of any duties assigned within any company or organization in a timely fashion.  

My current career objective is to become extremely knowledgeable in the new work environment/infrastructure of the company or organization being hired into.  To apply my knowledge and experience to my new position being applied for and to quickly adapt and learn OJT skills in the workplace environment.  I am an experienced line manager with extensive knowledge in team-building that ranges from organizing project teams while also encouraging individuals in the team to work together in current or future challenges with motivation and inspiration and teamwork.  I use an Agile approach to my daily tasks, and some would say that this is like writing down goals on a post-it notes but in a more advanced form.  The advantage of using the Agile methodology allows me to keep tabs on each person in the team and the group as a whole using techniques like standups for the daily morning meetings.   I have developed many solid skills in hiring and retaining employees while also having incorporated technological advances into a company where such advances require a significant amount of employee training, and knowledge upgrading.   

     In conclusion, I believe I have the required skills, knowledge, and experience for this position. I am a person that works great in teams, as their leader or an individual.  I can apply as much or as little experience and effort into any position hired into, as well as the technological savvy and a positive attitude toward implementing/incorporating change.  I am skilled in the technological and administrative aspects of the business enterprise and with these skills I have an added advantage to be the best candidate for this position.  


Thank You and Kindest Regards,
Eric Witowski

Use Pyright for Python completion

I was starting to get very unhappy with the pyls server performance,
and Pyright smokes the doors off of it (in a very limited test of it).
(I resent that they aren't open sourcing Pylance... not cool Microsoft)

Also while M$ is definitely evil, Palantir is about as evil as you'd
imagine a company named for magical seeing eyes used by an evil wizard
and a giant flaming evil helleye to communicate evil plans with each
other, might be.  I'll shack up with the ol' em-dollar-sign any day
over that [censored] Thiel dude and his creepy "secure underneath the
