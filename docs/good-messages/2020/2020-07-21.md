For GCC8, do not omit frame pointer for intr_dispatch() and via1_intr()
(-fomit-frame-pointer is enabled for -O and higher for GCC8).

This is required by rtclock_intr() which unwinds stack frame of caller!

XXXXXX
We need to get rid of this hackest hack for rtclock_intr(). This problem
was discussed back in 2014:

http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-mac68k/2014/08/15/msg000595.html
http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-mac68k/2014/08/17/msg000600.html
http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-mac68k/2014/08/17/msg000601.html

However, unfortunately, the problem has been left untouched until today.

The patch attached in the third message works around the problem. But,
it adds hard-coded magic numbers to intr_dispatch() and via1_intr().
For real fix, we should probably reconsider whole interrupt handling.

Anyway, now kernel compiled by GCC8 works fine as far as I can see.
