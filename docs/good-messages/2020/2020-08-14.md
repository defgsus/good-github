I LOVE the override keyword

However compilers produce far more annoying warnings when you mix
virtual functions with and without the override keyword (i.e. it needs
to be everywhere)

Also without macros, C++98 compatibility is lost

Deprecate `no_arg_sql_function!`

This makes the minor changes to `sql_function!` required to allow 0
argument functions to be defined with this macro. `no_arg_sql_function!`
has been deprecated. Even though we could technically remove it since
this is a major version bump, I still would prefer to deprecate things
when possible, so `no_arg_sql_function!` will live on until 3.0.

There are some changes in behavior here. The most notable is that we
generate a function rather than a unit struct. I had previously
considered having the macro create a unit struct instead of a module if
there were no arguments, but ultimately I think the difference in
behavior is confusing, and requiring folks to put `()` at the end of
calls isn't a huge migration pain.

The biggest thing that `sql_function!` doesn't support is the ability to
add a constraint to the backends allowed. This capability was originally
added for `NOW()`, back when we actually generated that SQL instead of
`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. We stopped using it a long time ago, and I doubt
anyone else is using this in the wild. Honestly it was a pretty poorly
thought out feature to begin with, so I'm happy to see it go. If we
decide in the future we want to support this for `sql_function!`, I
think the best way to do it is to allow `where` clauses at the end, and
any bounds that are on `DB` get magically applied to the write
impls/type variable. That behavior feels really implicit and confusing,
so I think we should probably just encourage folks to not use
`sql_function!` if they need lower level control.

One unfortunate side effect of this is that `now` still doesn't get
parenthesis, and we can't have a function and struct with the same name.
If we *really* want to migrate `now` to be consistent, we could
implement all the traits implemented on `now` for `fn() -> now`. This is
a terrible terrible awful hack but could actually work.

Bug fixes and removal of useless shit

Sorry developer vr menu, your presence is legit fucking useless and utterly shit, not wanted and doesn't serve a purpose to any human on this planet.
