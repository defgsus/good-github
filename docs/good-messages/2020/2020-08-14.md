Hexadecimal converter, Kinda done  kinda sucks

Kinda sucks, I stupidly used int for everything, so there's a pretty big loss of integrity, and factorials of 16 threw an out of range exception, so being a piece of shit, i just threw a g at the of my string.
Ex. 256 != 100,     256 = g00

Hi. If you are reading this.. I am sorry.. I am  very tired, and i've worked the whole day. I've been working day and night for 2 months straight and I am very tired... I won't be doing an extensive commit message.. I need to rest... Sorry. Tomorrow I will be more detailed, I  promise. I cant take this anymore, honestly. I hope to finish this project pretty soon.. I really do. I miss my friends. And my bf.

"4:40pm. No those good ideas are nothing. They would introduce cycles.

So the only way to multi arg constraints is to have an array and do all processing over it.

For once, I think I am going to say that this is too much. If I really want my record apply, I can have it, but I better be prepared to pay up. And to be honest, I am not. I do not want to pay up.

The way the inference is implemented now is great, and multi arg constraints would wreck it.

4:45pm. It is just for higher ranked types, map constraints and various other ideas. You can sit down and put them in, and they would work, but at certain point you need to draw the line between what are essential and non-essential features in a language. Especially when there are decent substitutes for the non-essential features.

4:50pm. Do I want to work until I have the perfect language, or do I want I want finish this by the end of the month and go to the next phase?

Finish, finish, finish!

I'll take care of v0.2, and the agents will take care of the rest.

4:55pm. I am not competing with Haskell or Scala or Rust here on which language has the most elaborate type system.

I do not even need the prototype constraints. They would take too much time. In fact, they would make the language less flexible. Literally every use of typeclasses I can think of can have a bottom-up default.

Forget the complicated things. Finish the language. It is more important that I make that next version of the ML library in Spiral v0.2. It is more important that I get my hands on those next gen chips.

I am not trying to impress other people with a bullet list of features. Nobody is going to give Spiral a pass if typechecking of prototypes is deferred to the partial evaluation stage.

...Though they might give it a pass if I at least do not have the number constraint. That one clearly needs to be in.

It just goes to show how the simple things are the most important.

5pm. I am really glad that I took time to do the most basic of the constraints. That was really great of me. Being able to tell the type system that forall is constrained to a number will pay off.

5:05pm. Now, although it is not interesting as multi arg constraints and other fancy features, I need to focus on on finally dealing with those damn lets.

```fs
        //| RawMatch of Range * body: RawExpr * (Pattern * RawExpr) list
        //| RawRecBlock of Range * ((Range * VarString) * RawExpr) list * on_succ: RawExpr
```

Tomorrow, I will imagine that the gun pointing at me, and start seriously focusing on these cases. I have what it takes to do them now. I went thought them over and over in my head way too many times. I need to do these.

5:10pm. Right now isn't the time to start anything new though. I've been at it from an early point today and deserve my rest.

5:15pm. Tomorrow, I will face my enemy. These two cases I seem to be perenially stuck on, but tomorrow I will overcome them. Then I will be 'done' with the typechecker. I think tying up the loose ends will take a while after that, at least a few days. Probably more. But I should be able to move to testing after that.

I think that if I stick to my decision of not adding any new features, I have a really good chance of being completely done with the typechecker by the end of the month. Hopefully I will have gotten type on hover and documentation parts of editor support by that time as well. But if I can't then it is no biggie. I'll definitely be able to deal with it sometime early next month in that case.

5:20pm. Let me try to unwind here."

"Hey Dog can I get some Ice Cream?" "Only a spoonful!"

As we can see, King Bach has presented a rather large spoon to his friend. The humor in this video stems from the fact that King Bach would like to eat ice cream but his friend retorts at him, saying he can only have a spoon full, nothing more.
Bach then suddenly changes his expression and body language and reveal that he is indeed in possession of a spoon. And not just any spoon, it is a massive stainless steel spoon.
This is funny because you would never expect someone to just be casually in possession of a massive spoon to eat ice cream with. It is completely unorthodox and uncalled for. This is why the video is so humorous and was put on the 2012 Epic Vine Compilation playlist on Youtube

"8pm.

```fs
        let rec scope_lower scope x =
            let f = scope_lower scope
            match x with
            | TyMetavar(_,{contents=Some x} & link) -> go x link f
            | TyMetavar(V(scope',q,w,e),link) when scope < scope' -> let x = fresh_var'' (V(scope,q,w,e)) in link := Some x; x
            | TyVar(V(scope',_,_,name)) when scope < scope' -> errors.Add(r,ForallVarScopeError(name,got,expected)); fresh_var''(V(scope,Set.empty,fresh_kind(),null))
            | TyVar _ | TyMetavar _ | TyConstraint _ | TyHigherOrder _ | TyB | TyPrim _ | TySymbol _ -> x
            | TyPair(a,b) -> TyPair(f a, f b)
            | TyRecord l -> TyRecord(Map.map (fun _ -> f) l)
            | TyFun(a,b) -> TyFun(f a, f b)
            | TyForall(a,b) -> TyForall(a, f b)
            | TyArray a -> TyArray(f a)
            | TyApply(a,b,c) -> TyApply(f a, f b, c)
            | TyInl(a,b) -> TyInl(a,f b)
```

You know for this thing, rather than reconstructing it all, I might just make the scope mutable. I'll change `V` to a record make the scope field mutable.

Also I forgot to go over the places where `term_subst` is called.

```fs
        | RawApply(r,a',b) ->
            match f' a' with
            | TyRecord l -> apply_record r s l (f' b)
            | a -> let v = fresh_var() in unify (range_of_expr a') a (TyFun(v,s)); f v b
```

This stupid place is literally the only place I really need to do it.

```fs
let f' x = let v = fresh_var() in f v x; term_subst v
```

Let me change this then.

```fs
    let rec apply_record r s l x =
        let f = apply_record r s
        match visit_t x with
```

Here I am visiting now. I got rid of all the uses of term subst.

But I can do more.

```fs
and [<ReferenceEquality>] Var = V of scope: int * Constraint Set * TT * display_name: string
```

Let me change this.

```fs
        let rec scope_lower scope x =
            let f = scope_lower scope
            match visit_t x with
            | TyMetavar(x,_) when scope < x.scope -> x.scope <- scope
            | TyVar(x) when scope < x.scope -> errors.Add(r,ForallVarScopeError(x.name,got,expected))
            | TyVar _ | TyMetavar _ | TyConstraint _ | TyHigherOrder _ | TyB | TyPrim _ | TySymbol _ -> ()
            | TyApply(a,b,_) | TyPair(a,b) | TyFun(a,b) -> f a; f b
            | TyRecord l -> Map.iter (fun _ -> f) l
            | TyForall(_,a) | TyArray a | TyInl(_,a) -> f a
```

This is good isn't it?

```fs
        let rec scope_lower scope x =
            let f = scope_lower scope
            match visit_t x with
            | TyMetavar(x,_) when scope < x.scope -> x.scope <- scope
            | TyVar(x) when scope < x.scope -> errors.Add(r,ForallVarScopeError(x.name,got,expected))
            | TyVar _ | TyMetavar _ | TyConstraint _ | TyHigherOrder _ | TyB | TyPrim _ | TySymbol _ -> ()
            | TyApply(a,b,_) | TyPair(a,b) | TyFun(a,b) -> f a; f b
            | TyRecord l -> Map.iter (fun _ -> f) l
            | TyForall(_,a) | TyArray a | TyInl(_,a) -> f a

        let rec occurs_check i x =
            let f = occurs_check i
            match visit_t x with
            | TyConstraint _ | TyVar _ | TyHigherOrder _ | TyB | TyPrim _ | TySymbol _ -> ()
            | TyForall(_,a) | TyInl(_,a) | TyArray a -> f a
            | TyApply(a,b,_) | TyFun(a,b) | TyPair(a,b) -> f a; f b
            | TyRecord l -> Map.iter (fun _ -> f) l
            | TyMetavar(i',_) -> if i = i' then er()
```

It might be worth merging these two.

```fs
        let rec occurs_check_and_scope_lower i x =
            let f = occurs_check_and_scope_lower i
            match visit_t x with
            | TyVar x -> if i.scope < x.scope then errors.Add(r,ForallVarScopeError(x.name,got,expected))
            | TyConstraint _ | TyHigherOrder _ | TyB | TyPrim _ | TySymbol _ -> ()
            | TyForall(_,a) | TyInl(_,a) | TyArray a -> f a
            | TyApply(a,b,_) | TyFun(a,b) | TyPair(a,b) -> f a; f b
            | TyRecord l -> Map.iter (fun _ -> f) l
            | TyMetavar(x,_) ->
                if i = x then er()
                elif i.scope < x.scope then x.scope <- i.scope
```

Yeah, this will make things run faster. These are good optimizations.

```fs
        let rec occurs_check_and_scope_lower i x =
            let f = occurs_check_and_scope_lower i
            match visit_t x with
            | TyConstraint _ | TyHigherOrder _ | TyB | TyPrim _ | TySymbol _ -> ()
            | TyForall(_,a) | TyInl(_,a) | TyArray a -> f a
            | TyApply(a,b,_) | TyFun(a,b) | TyPair(a,b) -> f a; f b
            | TyRecord l -> Map.iter (fun _ -> f) l
            | TyVar x -> if i.scope < x.scope then raise (TypeErrorException [r,ForallVarScopeError(x.name,got,expected)])
            | TyMetavar(x,_) -> if i = x then er() elif i.scope < x.scope then x.scope <- i.scope
```

Let me do it like this. I want to block the unification when either scope or occurs check fails.

8:30pm.

```fs
            match visit_t a'', visit_t b'' with
            | TyMetavar(a,link), TyMetavar(b,_) & b' ->
                if a <> b then
                    unify_kind a.kind b.kind
                    b.scope <- min a.scope b.scope
                    b.constraints <- a.constraints + b.constraints
                    link := Some b'
```

Yeah, I like this. No I really should not be doing programming this late, but I could not help myself.

```fs
            | TyForall(a,b), TyForall(a',b') | TyInl(a,b), TyInl(a',b') ->
                unify_kind a.kind a'.kind
                loop (forall_subst_single (a,b),b')
```

Actually, I do not think I need to unify kinds here. That will happen naturally in the metavar cases.

```fs
    let forall_subst_all x =
        let rec loop m x =
            match visit_t x with
            | TyForall(a,b) -> loop ((a, fresh_subst_var a.constraints a.kind) :: m) b
            | x -> subst m x
        loop [] x
```

Since I am visiting here, I do not need to do that...

```fs
let v (r,x) = Map.tryFind x env.term |> Option.orElseWith (fun () -> Map.tryFind x top_env.term) |> Option.map term_subst
```

Here.

```fs
let v (r,x) = Map.tryFind x env.term |> Option.orElseWith (fun () -> Map.tryFind x top_env.term) |> Option.map visit_t
```

This does not need the range anymore either.

8:45pm.

```fs
type [<ReferenceEquality>] 'a ref' = {mutable contents' : 'a}
```

Eh, I'll leave this in. I do not feel like removing it.

And with this I am done with the late day session. It is usually a mistake to program when I am tired like this as mistakes can easily creep in. I might end up paying for it when the testing time comes around.

Still the intent behind my optimizations is sound.

Let me do one thing.

8:50pm. ...No forget it. I'll optimize error messages at some later point. Not now.

Let me get back to unwinding.

Yes, I know I should not do this, but it is better than letting my thoughts grow stale. Inspiration is a precious resource. Best to get it out early.

Now that I've done this, the typechecker should be as fast as possible. The only thing left then is to actually finish it and move to testing."

Remove ObjCThemis.xcodeproj (#704)

* Remove ObjCThemis.xcodeproj

The idea behind building "objcthemis.framework" has been to unify import
syntax between Carthage and CocoaPods. Unfortunately, it turned out to
be a mistake. "objcthemis.framework" does not work without
"themis.framework" being present alongside it because of how module
resolution works. Despite "objcthemis.framework" providing the same
"themis" module as "themis.framework", the compiler will look for a
framework named "themis.framework" when resolving "import themis".

Moreover, the original issue that "objcthemis.framework" has been called
to rectify can be resolved more elegantly by importing the module:

    @import themis;

which work well with "themis.framework" in both Carthage and CocoaPods.

Since "objcthemis.framework" does not bring any value, remove it. Move
all new things added to ObjCThemis.xcodeproj into Themis.xcodeproj
(such as testing Swift 4 vs 5). Remove the import warning. Now Carthage
will build only one framework: "themis.framework" from Themis.xcodeproj.

I am sorry for the trouble and confusion of this fizzled migration.

* Change "product name" to "themis"

Make sure that Xcode targets produce "themis.framework", not
"objcthemis.framework".

* Recreate Xcode schemes

It seems that some components stick the schemes after renaming. Recreate
them to make sure that we're building "themis.framework" and there are
no traces of the old Xcode project.

* Bring back proxy umbrella header "themis.h"

Since the framework is named "themis.framework", its umbrella header
is expected to be called "themis.h". The actual umbrella header for
ObjCThemis is "objcthemis.h" which we simply include.

* Use alternative imports in unit tests

One of the reasons for "objcthemis.framework" existence was to run
ObjCThemis unit tests from Xcode. Initially, "themis.framework" has
prevented that due to import issues, and "objcthemis.framework" has
allowed #import <objcthemis/objcthemis.h> to work. Now that latter
is gone, the unit-tests are broken again.

However! It seems that using modular imports works for Xcode and
Carthage (which uses Xcode project). The bad news here is that it
*does not* work for CocoaPods, which still works only with the old
form because CocoaPods does some special wicked magic with headers,
putting them into the "objcthemis" directory.

I do not have much time and willingness to deal with this stupidity
anymore right now, so here's a compromise: Carthage uses its form,
CocoaPods use their form, and you get this TODO to maybe get rid of
this wart some time later.

Moved music commands into its own file.
Please, for the love of god, use 4-space indentation and no tabs. It's a pain to read and my IDE doesnt like it

Deprecate `no_arg_sql_function!`

This makes the minor changes to `sql_function!` required to allow 0
argument functions to be defined with this macro. `no_arg_sql_function!`
has been deprecated. Even though we could technically remove it since
this is a major version bump, I still would prefer to deprecate things
when possible, so `no_arg_sql_function!` will live on until 3.0.

There are some changes in behavior here. The most notable is that we
generate a function rather than a unit struct. I had previously
considered having the macro create a unit struct instead of a module if
there were no arguments, but ultimately I think the difference in
behavior is confusing, and requiring folks to put `()` at the end of
calls isn't a huge migration pain.

The biggest thing that `sql_function!` doesn't support is the ability to
add a constraint to the backends allowed. This capability was originally
added for `NOW()`, back when we actually generated that SQL instead of
`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. We stopped using it a long time ago, and I doubt
anyone else is using this in the wild. Honestly it was a pretty poorly
thought out feature to begin with, so I'm happy to see it go. If we
decide in the future we want to support this for `sql_function!`, I
think the best way to do it is to allow `where` clauses at the end, and
any bounds that are on `DB` get magically applied to the write
impls/type variable. That behavior feels really implicit and confusing,
so I think we should probably just encourage folks to not use
`sql_function!` if they need lower level control.

One unfortunate side effect of this is that `now` still doesn't get
parenthesis, and we can't have a function and struct with the same name.
If we *really* want to migrate `now` to be consistent, we could
implement all the traits implemented on `now` for `fn() -> now`. This is
a terrible terrible awful hack but could actually work.
