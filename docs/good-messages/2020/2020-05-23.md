Getting all the plumbing in place to run kernel timers on CPU (then move to GPUs). I now recall why I have love/hate relationship with C++ ... making abstractions is verbose like hell and leads to code unreadable by anyone by expert C++ programmers. Sad how horrible and ugly this looks compared to our nice Lua kernels. Maybe the darned kerneldrive should be Lua ...

Update Lost Summer Days

This poem is about a girl I met working at a summer job in college. When I went to the work area, it was a rainy day and I stepped in a huge puddle looking like an idiot in front of everyone, It was probably the last stage of youth that I ascended through (at age 21). The poem laments that I did not capitalize on the opportunities I may have had.. or maybe didn't. We only have one life but I wasted mine. Don't do the same

"11:05am. Yesterday went about as I expected. Even though I managed to cut it short early this time, I am in no shape to do any programming today unfortunately. Still, I had a bunch of ideas during the night.

```
    let agent_template =
        let run f = let poller = new NetMQPoller() in poller, Task.Run(fun () -> f poller : unit)
        let dispose state =
            state |> Option.iter (fun l ->
                let pollers, tasks = Array.unzip l
                pollers |> Array.iter (fun (x : NetMQPoller) -> x.Stop())
                Task.WaitAll(tasks)
                tasks |> Array.iter (fun x -> x.Dispose())
                )
        fun (l : (NetMQPoller -> unit) []) -> MailboxProcessor.Start(fun mailbox ->
            let rec loop state = async {
                let! () = mailbox.Receive()
                dispose state
                return! Array.map run l |> Some |> loop
                }
            loop None
            )
```

Yesterday I complained that there is no way of disposing the tasks after the loop is over. Here is how I could have done it...

```
        fun (l : (NetMQPoller -> unit) []) -> MailboxProcessor.Start(fun mailbox -> async {
            let rec loop state = async {
                let! () = mailbox.Receive()
                dispose state
                return! Array.map run l |> Some |> loop
                }
            let! state = loop None
            dispose state
            })
```

Something like this. I am going to have to look into how cancellation tokens work. This is just a sketch. Let me undo this and I'll demonstrate what I want on the other agent.

11:20am.

```
        let agent_ui = MailboxProcessor.Start(fun mailbox -> async {
            use agent_zeromq = agent_template [|client (AddServer >> mailbox.Post); server (AddClient >> mailbox.Post)|]
            let rec loop (model : State) = async {
                let update (f : _ ISubject) i x = f.OnNext(i, x); i+1
                state_stream.OnNext(model)
                match! mailbox.Receive() with
                | AddServer x -> return! loop {model with server_count=update server_stream model.server_count x}
                | AddClient x -> return! loop {model with client_count=update client_stream model.client_count x}
                | StartExample -> agent_zeromq.Post(); return! loop model
                }
            do! loop {server_count=0; client_count=0}
            })
```

I have to push in this direction when it comes to the overall design of things.

11:25am. Still, for disposable resources, I'd imagine real agents would have a more elegant way of halting.

Even though I've suggested the above idea, I am not sure the use clauses would ever get triggered if I hit the cancellation token on an agent.

11:30am. It probably would though if the agent is using exceptions to exit.

Let me give it a try.

```
module Main

open System
open System.Reactive.Disposables

[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv =
    //Avalonia.ZeroMQ.Main.main argv
    let agent = MailboxProcessor.Start(fun mailbox -> async {
        use x = Disposable.Create(fun () -> printfn "Disposing")
        let! y = mailbox.Receive()
        printfn "Should not hit this."
        return ()
        })
    Console.ReadKey()
    (agent :> IDisposable).Dispose()
    Console.ReadKey()
    0

```

Let me first check out the behavior of `Dispose`. I do not expect this to trigger the `use` statement in the agent.

Yeah, it is nothing. Let me move to the next experiment.

11:40am.

```
[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv =
    //Avalonia.ZeroMQ.Main.main argv
    use src = new CancellationDisposable()
    let agent = MailboxProcessor.Start(fun mailbox -> async {
        use x = Disposable.Create(fun () -> printfn "Disposing")
        let! z = async {
            let! q = mailbox.Receive()
            printfn "Should not hit this (2)."
            return! q
            }
        printfn "Should not hit this."
        return ()
        }, src.Token)
    Console.ReadKey()
    (src :> IDisposable).Dispose()
    Console.ReadKey()
    0
```

Disposing the agent does nothing visible, but using the cancellation does in fact trigger the `use` statement inside the agent. Great. This does in fact work how I expected it.

11:45am. The next thing I want to test is synchronization for observables.

Using the `ThreadPoolScheduler` to synchronize would not be a good idea probably. Let me check whether it launches everything on a different thread.

11:55am.

```
module Main

open System
open System.Threading
open System.Reactive.Subjects
open System.Reactive.Concurrency

[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv =
    //Avalonia.ZeroMQ.Main.main argv
    let s = Subject.Synchronize(Subject(),ThreadPoolScheduler.Instance)
    use __ = s.Subscribe(fun x ->
        printfn "Got %s on thread %i" x Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId
        )
    printfn "Thread %i" Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId
    s.OnNext("q")
    s.OnNext("w")
    s.OnNext("e")
    Console.ReadKey()
    0
```

Not what I expected. This will in fact launch all `OnNext`s on the same thread. Which is the kind of behavior that I would want and actually makes using the `ThreadPoolScheduler.Instance` useful. Great.

```
[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv =
    //Avalonia.ZeroMQ.Main.main argv
    ThreadPoolScheduler.Instance.Schedule(fun () -> printfn "Thread %i" Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)
    ThreadPoolScheduler.Instance.Schedule(fun () -> printfn "Thread %i" Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)
    ThreadPoolScheduler.Instance.Schedule(fun () -> printfn "Thread %i" Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)
    Console.ReadKey()
    0
```

This gives me 3 different threads. I wonder how Rx does it. I actually do not know how it would be possible to launch all the items on a single thread using this scheduler.

12pm. This might be worth asking on SO. If I were in an usual state of mind I would do it, but I am in no mood for it right now.

12:05pm. Let me move my attention to what I was doing yesterday.

Now, even though I am working on UI stuff during the present time, in the back of my mind, I am also considering how I would use these techniques to do editor support for Spiral.

12:25pm.

```
        let agent_ui = MailboxProcessor.Start(fun mailbox ->
            let agent_zeromq = agent_template [|client (AddServer >> mailbox.Post); server (AddClient >> mailbox.Post)|]
            let rec loop (model : State) = async {
                let update (f : _ ISubject) i x = f.OnNext(i, x); i+1
                state_stream.OnNext(model)
                match! mailbox.Receive() with
                | AddServer x -> return! loop {model with server_count=update server_stream model.server_count x}
                | AddClient x -> return! loop {model with client_count=update client_stream model.client_count x}
                | StartExample -> agent_zeromq.Post(); return! loop model
                }
            loop {server_count=0; client_count=0}
            )
```

I am getting lost in the same kind of line as I did yesterday. I am looking at this and wondering whether this is really the true way.

12:30pm. I am not sure that it is.

Let me go get breakfast."

fix(__dirname): adds horrible wrapper hack for __dirname with webpack & electron & workers (#115)

This is an abominable hack which works around the fact webpack just does whatever the fuck it wants
with workers. We stall everything in the worker until we've sent it the correct path to the .asar,
then in the NDI store module we temporarily set the location of grandiose within the .asar.
Guaranteed this will come back to bite us in the arse.
