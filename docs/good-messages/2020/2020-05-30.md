Big solar panel energy
Solar panel utilises celestial angle to calc rf/tick

Solar panel functionality has has a pretty major overhaul, some new methods here, some tears there, you get the drill.
methods added:
SolarPanelTile.generateEnergy - This handles energy generation
SolarPanelTile.atDesiredTickRate this is server only, checks if the tick is good to run on
SolarPanelTile.sunCalc - This calculates the sun intensity

Other stuff added I forgot about

InferiusPickaxe has returned, this is so I can start to setup unique properties from it's own unique class, this may return if I can streamline this into the ItemInit function.

Core package added, with some common color codes: Colors.java
and some utilities:
utils.java

Odium event kinda setup, this will be a ticking world event so focus will have to be made to make this pretty server friendly, will add a tickshift system like SolarPanelTile for example.

Revert "contact: Mastodon"

This reverts commit 8127a94aa9574e5333ca15f1a40fd8b4897a3f5b.

I'm so sorry.
I feel embarassed to have ever associated myself with the Fediverse.
From the feels of it, being a general run-of-the-mill guy invalidates
my opinion.
Already dealt with this enough from bullies during school.

And they wonder why _normal_ people still stick to Twitter...

Day 002 of #100DaysOfCode
I learned how to write and read file from Disk, how to randomize something and make test file in Go.

I publishd my first Go Library Package called "Random Generator".

When we want a function to return something, we need to tell that function what kind of data type that it will return
eg:
```
func ReturnString() string {
	// Code here
	return "Hello World"
}

// and if the function is going to return more than 1 value, then it should be like this
func MoreThanOneValue() (string, int) {
	return "Hello World", 69
}
```

Naming convention is a lot different from other language, so yeah, it's kinda feel weird sometimes.
And if a variable that should be declared but you dont want to use it, u have to write it with "_"
eg:
```
for _, card := range cards {
	// code here
}
```

Strictly define order of operations when halting a tree

Motivation
----------

When converting fork to an operation, we changed the way that
continuation and failure are reported up the tree to the parent of the
operation. Instead of calling the `join()` method on the parent, we
used the general "exit hook" mechanism to control the flow of the
program. When a child was created, the parent added shutdown hooks to
it that would handle the result of the child finishing and use that to
pass control back to the parent.

The problem with this is that if one of your shutdown hooks has the
responsibility of running other shutdown hooks, which could cause
shutdowns, that run other shutdown hooks, you can zig and zag across
different contexts and experience wildly different orders of shutdown
and context settlement depending on how a context resolves (success,
failure, cancellation, etc..)

In fact, we were observing this behavior, when shutdown hooks were
running in different orders, we'd see vastly different results.

What we'd like to see however is a strict reverse-depth-order teardown
so that whenever a portion of the tree is de-comissioned, nodes that
can have dependencies on prior nodes are de-commissioned first.

For example, in the following tree:

(A,
  (B)
  (C))

As children, both `B`, and `C` can depend on A, and even though `B`
and `C` are siblings, since `C` was created later in the computation,
it is conceivable that it depends on `B`. The reverse is not (easily)
true. Therefore, the order of destruction we want is `C` -> `B` ->
`A`.

Approach
--------

We address this problem by splitting shutdown callbacks into two
distinct categories. The first is the original mechanism, added by
`ensure()`, and which now has _zero_ effect on the control flow of the
application. The exit hooks added in this way are just a flat list of
functions to run a single time when the context is finalized. Each
hook in the list only operates within the single context, and is
mainly just meant to be added from user-land to control runtime
resources.

The second kind of hook is used exclusively for handing off control of
the computation from the finalizing context. In other words, "the
computation represented by this context is now complete, what happens
next?" While exit hooks can be many, there can only be a single
continuation hook, and if we think about it, this make sense. Like a
normal function, it can do a great many things, call out to a number
of other functions, but it can only return to a single place.

In summary, by placing these two callbacks into different worlds, we
can guarantee that shutdown hooks are run in a very precise order, and
that they cannot (without dedicated nefarious hackery) interfere with
the continuation of the computation.

Implementation
--------------

This uses the simplest thing that could possibly work: leave the
current teardown mechanism as-is, and introduce a single callback to a
new context. This callback is aptly name "continue", and is invoked as
the very last thing a context _ever does_.

Now, finalize can only every be invoked a single time, and has a very
strict structure.

1. record results
2. halt all children in reverse order
3. run all exit hooks in reverse order
4. finalize the promise.
4. continue.

New Guarantees:

- spawn: all spawned child contexts are destroyed before their parent
  context is finalized. There is no continuation by default, so it
  just goes away without having any effect on the parent. However, if
  the parent is halted at any point during its run, it will be halted
  immediately.
- monitor: In addition to spawn guarantees, any failed monitor raises failure in its parent
- fork: In addition to monitor guarantees. parent may not continue
  until completed (though it may spawn more operations).
- join: In addition to fork guarantees, parent may not run any operations until joined child is completed.

For further context:

https://github.com/thefrontside/effection.js/issues/70

Open Questions
--------------

- There is probably a way to model the internal continuations
  semi-monadically so that we don't have to store state like required
  children and `waiting ` and what not on the context, and so that in
  `monitor` and `fork` and other control functions, we don't have to
  fiddle with that state, but instead allow the control function
  itself to somehow pass control to the "next" thing, which naturally
  unfolds the computation. If it sounds hand-wavy, it is, but until
  that elegant solution is found, we can start with a hackier one.
- We will need some way to "re-direct" the continuation of a context
  in the case of joining a fork. In other words, if we join a fork,
  something else needs to happen when it continues, not what happens
  when it was originally conceived.

Ledge/monkey grab & Jump up monkey grab

There's some voodoo in Core's code that makes Lara not align properly with both these animations when using Mrshina's outfit. So when grabbing a ledge you can see Lara hanging from her fingernails, and when you grab monkey bars her hands disappear into the ceiling. And both are using the same animations.
How could I even fix that. GG Core. 👍
(jk I love you but I hate all that hardcoded shit you put in your engine)

I hate python. I hate cython.

Can't begin to tell you how much I hate these. If you had to
invent a language that was any more mind-melting, screwed up
and inoperable, you'd call it "brainfuck".

This stuff is just utterly opaque as mud, unpredictable,
never does what you expect it to do and is just plain confusing
every time you use it. I have no clue why people like python.
Its upside-down and backwards and has the toilet bolted to
the ceiling. Because that just makes going to the toilet so
much more interesting.

Sheesh.

No vocal rig! Just four simple 4-group Maschine rig in Ableton Live.

Lots of weird routing through Group 5, "filters," which allows me to have just two outputs from Maschine, one for Aux sends and one for Master send (Group 5 goes to master and the individual tracks have their aux sends go to the single aux out).

On each filter track there's the reverb on/off and filter (both MIDI-controlled) and each goes to both the Group -> Master and the Aux (and that send is controlled by MIDI)

**Advantages**

- Filter, 'verb and delay sends are included in lock states which are nice for morphing and all that (though I rarely use it).
- Everything is contained in Maschine, mostly, so if I needed to pop out and not use a DAW, I could easily.

**Disadvantages**

- No midi-controllable cue. This sucks and it's confirmed ![image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/887ia6jjz89ps04/Screenshot%202020-05-30%2018.41.04.png?dl=1)
- No MIDI feedback for anything. Maschine does suck this way.
- If you're using a simple MIDI controller then you need more advanced MIDI-mapping options (like being able to invert a range or limit a range). Maschine can do neither. If you're using MIDI Designer (I'm not right now), this isn't a hard limit but annoying.
- Adjusting MIDI routings is a hassle but possible.

So now I'm moving back to an older paradigm for me (but with just 4 tracks, which is new): all the MIDI-controllable parameters are going to be in Ableton, which means I need to split the kits out into four tracks of output. So that 4 tracks and no cue mix coming out of Maschine, because I'm going to cue inside Live. I would die to have Maschine **show** which tracks are on the cue bus, but that's impossible.

I even tried mapping cue to a macro control and then mapping that, which failed. So frustrating! Anyway, moving ahead with the plan. Maschine is my girlfriend but what an asshole!
