MCExpr::evaluateAsRelocatableImpl : allow evaluation of non-VK_None MCSymbolRefExpr when MCAsmLayout is available

https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=4acf8c78e659833be8be047ba2f8561386a11d4b
(1994) introduced this behavior:
if a fixup symbol is equated to an expression with an undefined symbol, convert
the fixup to be against the target symbol. glibc relies on this behavior to perform
assembly level indirection

```
asm("memcpy = __GI_memcpy"); // from sysdeps/generic/symbol-hacks.h

...
  // call memcpy@PLT
  // The relocation references __GI_memcpy in GNU as, but memcpy in MC (without the patch)
  memcpy (...);
```

(1) It complements `extern __typeof(memcpy) memcpy asm("__GI_memcpy");` The frontend asm label does not redirect synthesized memcpy in the middle-end. (See D88712 for details)
(2) `asm("memcpy = __GI_memcpy");` is in every translation unit, but the memcpy declaration may not be visible in the translation unit where memcpy is synthesized.

MC already redirects `memcpy = __GI_memcpy; call memcpy` but not `memcpy = __GI_memcpy; call memcpy@plt`.
This patch fixes the latter by allowing MCExpr::evaluateAsRelocatableImpl to
evaluate a non-VK_None MCSymbolRefExpr, which is only done after the layout is available.

GNU as allows `memcpy = __GI_memcpy+1; call memcpy@PLT` which seems nonsensical, so we don't allow it.

`MC/PowerPC/pr38945.s` `NUMBER = 0x6ffffff9; cmpwi 8,NUMBER@l` requires the
`symbol@l` form in AsmMatcher, so evaluation needs to be deferred. This is the
place whether future simplification may be possible.

Note, if we suppress the VM_None evaluation when MCAsmLayout is nullptr, we may
lose the `invalid reassignment of non-absolute variable` diagnostic
(`ARM/thumb_set-diagnostics.s` and `MC/AsmParser/variables-invalid.s`).
We know that this diagnostic is troublesome in some cases
(https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1008), so we can consider
making simplification in the future.

Persistent block metadata may now have mutable parts
Not allowing this makes stuff like anvil damage, colour, wood type, live/dead bit, wet/dry etc all too much hassle to deal with.
Naturally I want to get rid of this shit altogether, but first it's necessary to construct a new system that we can shift into before all this bullshit can be addressed fully, so for now we have to work within the bounds of the old system.
This change will permit dynamic colours for concrete/concrete powder etc, dynamic wood types where the wood type isn't embedded in the legacy ID, and so forth. Allowing full flexibility requires either more old system hacks or completing the migration to a new system which doesn't have these limitations. I prefer to do the latter, but this change will make it somewhat easier to do.

Move flashlight to C++14 (#267)

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookresearch/flashlight/pull/267

Upgrade to C++ 14.

We've been talking about this for some time; I think it's time to make the transition.

To be honest, moving to C++17 may not be a bad step in the near future, but making incremental changes will make this transition easier.

For now, this change only removes backports for `make_unique` and various `type_traits`, and leaves other things as they are for now.

### General Thoughts
- Staying >= 4 years behind the standard (2020 - 2014), to me, is extremely reasonable
- ArrayFire already requires C++14 to build from source
- gcc >= 5 has solid support for C++14 already, and that's our compiler recommendation as is since we use some "advanced" C++11 features.
- PyTorch has a C++14 minimum for its C++ API to build from source, so this is consistent with other competing frameworks frameworks

### What's new in C++14?
A light summary here â€” there are a wealth of new features that make life better:
- `std::make_unique<T>` (enough said)
- Removal of a bunch of awful type trait backports
  - `std::remove_const_t` and friends
  - `decay_t`!
- `auto` as a return type for functions
- `auto` lambda params!
```
auto fun = [](auto v) { return v + 1; };
```
- Move capture rather than reference in a persistent pointer!
```
auto _myFoo = std::make_unique<Foo>();
auto fun = [myFoo = std::move(_myFoo)]() { ... }
```
- Compile time literals for a bunch of stuff (datetime, string)
```
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
auto week = 168h;
```

fix mishy bug

HOLY SHIT for the longest time I thought something was wrong in the script files

through trial and error I discovered it was solved with the original arb files.
When I noticed Mensa had two names while browsing one of them in a hex editor
("Mensa" and "Mrs. Mensa") I remembered the multiple entries for Mishy

these names that can't be safely edited really should be skipped by the dumper/inserter,
but whatever man
