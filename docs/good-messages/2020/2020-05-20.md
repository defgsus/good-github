Merge pull request #7948 from certbot/snap-build-squashed

Despite this PR (only) being ~200 lines containing mostly code copied from another repo, there is a lot going on here. For the sake of making it both easier to review and to remember some of these things in the future by referring back to this PR, I've documented a lot of noteworthy things with section headers below. With that said, it's probably not necessary to read each section unless you're interested in that topic.

The most noteworthy thing for the reviewer is **this PR should be merged and not squashed** to preserve authorship. To merge this code, once we're happy with this PR, I'll probably open a new PR squashing any commits I make in response in review comments back into a single commit to try to keep history somewhat clean. To help prevent this PR from being accidentally squashed, I'm making this a draft PR for now.

### Git history of https://github.com/basak/certbot-snap-build

I think it is worth preserving the git history of https://github.com/basak/certbot-snap-build that this PR is based on in this repo to help us track why things were done a certain way. To do this while keeping our git history somewhat clean, I took the approach described at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1425892/how-do-you-merge-two-git-repositories/21495718#21495718 to move all history of https://github.com/basak/certbot-snap-build into a `snap` directory. I then squashed all commits so that sequential commits from the same author are one commit. I probably could have reordered commits to try and squash things a little more, but I personally don't think it's worth the trouble. Finally, I merged this rewritten history into this branch of the Certbot repo.

The contents of the `snap` directory are identical to the current contents of https://github.com/basak/certbot-snap-build before my final commit in this PR which makes the changes to make things work in this repo.

### Travis stages

This is described in general at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-stages/, but I don't think we should deploy the snap if any of our tests are failing. To accomplish this, I created a "Snap" stage that builds, tests, and deploys the snap which is only executed after a "Test" stage that contains all of our other tests. The "Snap" stage will not run until the "Test" stage completes successfully.

### snap/local

This directory is ignored by `snapcraft` which I think makes it a good place to store `snap` specific scripts like `build_and_install.sh`.

See https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapcraft/+bug/1792203 for more info.

### Why remove certbot-compatibility-test from apacheconftest toxenvs?

Because it's not used. In theory, it could go in its own PR, but it'll create merge conflicts with this one so I'd personally prefer to include this simple change in this PR as well.

### Checklist for landing this PR

- [x] Squash all of my commits into one commit
- [x] Update the release instructions to have to move the snap to the beta channel
- [x] Shut down Robie's nightly builds probably by updating his repo to say that the code has moved here and deleting everything

server,gossip/resolver,cli: gate the SRV lookups under a new flag

In v20.1 the bootstrap resolver code was changed to prefer SRV
records, if present in DNS, to regular A/AAAA records.

This change turned out to be a bit too immature as multiple defects
were found in succession:

- the code was improperly using records with port 0.
- it would crash if DNS was not available.
- it does not follow the regular SRV naming rules, where
  a service should be named as `_svcname._tcp.xxxx`.
- it is not able to re-perform the SRV lookup after the
  node has started up, if it takes a while for the rest
  of the cluster to catch up.

Some of these issues have since been fixed, but others remain open.
In order to not let users experience trouble with this feature
until it matures a bit, this patch introduces a new CLI flag
`--experimental-dns-srv` which defaults to false.

Also this patch adds the missing test for the join resolution.

Release note (backward incompatible change): CockroachDB v20.1
introduced a new rule for the `--join` flag causing it to prefer SRV
records, if present in DNS, to look up the peer nodes to join. This
feature is experimental. However, it is also found to cause disruption
in in certain deployments. To reduce this disruption and UX surprise,
the feature is now gated behind a new command-line flag
`--experimental-dns-srv` which must now be explicitly passed to
`cockroach start` to enabled it.
