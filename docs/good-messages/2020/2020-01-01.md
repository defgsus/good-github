"10:05am. Wow the 20s are here. Will I be able to accomplish anything in this decade, I wonder? Whatever it turns out to be, I will do my best.

Right now the decision of whether or not to put in higher rankeds types into Spiral is really torturing me. Even if I do not put them in, it is not like everything suddenly becomes easy.

I have no idea. I just need more time to think about this.

10:15am. Agh, this will take some time. Let me update Simulacrum page.

10:45am. Let me leave a comment as well. I was a bit too lazy this year.

12pm. "Let me say a few extra words as I was lazy this year and will make the above my monthly PL thread review as well. I made this decision because the review itself captures all that I wanted to say, but this place is special to me, so I want do a bit more here.

Let's see...2022 is just too early as the date for the Singularity. The memristors fell through, the hardware is not there, the algorithms are not there. They might be here in 2029 and should be, but I can't see it happening in 2022. If does happen at that time, I am certain it won't be due to anything I personally did. My ambition for the next two years is to make v0.2 of Spiral and given how long the previous versions took, that seems realistic for how long it will take me to wrap the language up.

It is not like it necessarily needs to take 2 years, things like a simple type systems and editor support could certainly be done much more quickly than that. But also, it is not like making a partial evaluator should take that long either, and yet it did. But after I got the requisite experience, I found that I could do it in a month - that is what my [February 2019 rewrite](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language/tree/v0.1) of Spiral demonstrated.

Back in 2017 I could have only dreamed about such an ability. Whenever I try to skip steps, I stumble. I always want to grasp beyond my reach, but I've never even once managed to break the laws of causality. So v0.2 is going to need its investment of time.

But once I have it; once I have the design, the implementation and the editor support, I will never have to look at another language again. v0.2 will be pretty plain in terms of type system features. It certainly won't be anything to write about compared to dependently typed languages, or even what Haskell is today. Nonetheless what it will have are those generative constraints I've talked about.

Because of them Spiral v0.2 will have by far the best generative capabilities of any statically typed language in existence. The whole issue of GPU backends and ML libraries will just fall into the background once v0.2 is on the scene, and I will be able to program in comfort knowing that the work is done. I already solved it halfway with the previous version and now it is the time to finish the job.

No doubt, the Inspired will dream up designs and create languages that Spiral v0.2 cannot even compare in power and usability, but nonetheless I am confident that the idea of combining constraint solving with partial evaluation is going to go down as one of the greatest ideas in PL design ever. It just solves some very difficult problems with static typing quite cleanly that even dependent types don't.

Even those great languages of the future might end up doing it. So v0.2 needs to happen, and nobody but me can do it. There are plenty of other things I could do, but none of them are as good as this. Spiral has to be done at some point and that is when my focus will be freed to actually do the things I said I would.

But what about money? I've long been trying to angle it without success so that my increases in programming skill correspond to increases in financial capacity, but this world is not that sort of game apparently. It might get closer to that once AI stops being a toy and programming skill becomes a closed loop leading to further increases in that skill.

I really do envy the Inspired quite a bit. Imagine if I could do everything I did in the past 5 years in something like 5 days. That should be easily doable for them. The future is just so unfair. My efforts take up the entirety of my life and yet they are so light compared to what they could be. My limitations are so burdensome and onerous. A stroke of bad luck could happen and I will not be there to see the Singularity happen. I just have no idea what is the point of even being a human. Why must this era exist? When those of the future look back on this, what do they really see? Is it a nightmare...or the first flame?

If they need a reminder of what the purpose of life is, then let them find this post and be reminded that the main axiom is power.

As pathetic as it is to hear something like that from a human, I will never give up on this desire or this ambition. I am just a tiny plant in a big forest looking upwards towards the sky and thinking: 'Wouldn't it be great if those assholes stopped blocking the shade.'

The fire will happen and the seeds I've planted will sprout."

12:05pm. Let me go with this. This is good enough.

12:15pm. I guess I'll start slacking here.

Even if I decide to kick out HRTs, I still have HKTs to deal with. I am just not really sure how to deal with those. Right now I am thinking of how I would do things like printing and such on the partial evaluation side.

I am definitely missing something.

Just for the sake of HKTs, do I not need foralls and type variables at the type level?

Something slipped my mind. Do HKTs not need to be type level functions? Sure I could make them similar to inlineables, but shouldn't I be better than that?

There is literally no need for them to be macros in their composition...

Or no wait. Maybe there is. If I make type level functions foralls as opposed to inlineables, how will I deal with `real nominal` types?

12:20pm. Wait, actually, if I do make macro like type level functions, could I not do that way the HRTs like I originally intended.

Like if you ever try to box `<type function>` it would be quite obvious.

12:25pm. No, HKTs are still quite different from HRTs. For HRTs I would need explicit foralls on the type level.

During partial evaluation I really only want to deal with inlineables of various stripes and monomorphic types.

Yeah, I can't really go beyond first order logic unless I want to put in some quite significant effort into it.

12:30pm. Which I do not really want.

But HKTs will not give me much trouble. I will be able to deal with them quite fine if I make them inlineables.

This is the way to go.

Let me take a break here."

Create Scrabble

Scrabble
In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.

There are many ways you can extend this project on your own if you finish and want to get more practice!

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced developer work through it, click “Get Help“ to see a project walkthrough video.

Tasks
14/15Complete
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Build your Point Dictionary
1.
We have provided you with two lists, letters and points. We would like to combine these two into a dictionary that would map a letter to its point value.

Using a list comprehension and zip, create a dictionary called letter_to_points that has the elements of letters as the keys and the elements of points as the values.

2.
Our letters list did not take into account blank tiles. Add an element to the letter_to_points dictionary that has a key of " " and a point value of 0.

Score a Word
3.
We want to create a function that will take in a word and return how many points that word is worth.

Define a function called score_word that takes in a parameter word.

4.
Inside score_word, create a variable called point_total and set it to 0.

5.
After defining point_total, create a for loop that goes through the letters in word and adds the point value of each letter to point_total.

You should get the point value from the letter_to_points dictionary. If the letter you are checking for is not in letter_to_points, add 0 to the point_total.

6.
After the for loop is finished, return point_total.

7.
Let’s test this function! Create a variable called brownie_points and set it equal to the value returned by the score_word() function with an input of "BROWNIE".

8.
We expect the word BROWNIE to earn 15 points:

(B + R + O + W + N + I + E)

(3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1) = 15
Let’s print out brownie_points to make sure we got it right.

Score a Game
9.
Create a dictionary called player_to_words that maps players to a list of the words they have played. This table represents the data to transcribe into your dictionary:

player1	wordNerd	Lexi Con	Prof Reader
BLUE	EARTH	ERASER	ZAP
TENNIS	EYES	BELLY	COMA
EXIT	MACHINE	HUSKY	PERIOD
10.
Create an empty dictionary called player_to_points.

11.
Iterate through the items in player_to_words. Call each player player and each list of words words.

Within your loop, create a variable called player_points and set it to 0.

12.
Within the loop, create another loop that goes through each word in words and adds the value of score_word() with word as an input.

13.
After the inner loop ends, set the current player value to be a key of player_to_points, with a value of player_points.

14.
player_to_points should now contain the mapping of players to how many points they’ve scored. Print this out to see the current standings for this game!

If you’ve calculated correctly, wordNerd should be winning by 1 point.

Ideas for Further Practice!
15.
If you want extended practice, try to implement some of these ideas with the Python you’ve learned:

play_word() — a function that would take in a player and a word, and add that word to the list of words they’ve played
update_point_totals() — turn your nested loops into a function that you can call any time a word is played
make your letter_to_points dictionary able to handle lowercase inputs as well

"2:40pm. Done with breakfast, chores and that batch of Satanophany chapters. As much as I want to read LNs, let me do what I need to do as per rules I set for myself.

3pm. I am going to step away from the screen for a while.

Right now I am having great trouble. Yeah, I could kick out HRTs and resort to prenex polymorphism, but that is not satisfying to me. Now just because I would lose the benefits of HRTs, but also because one simple thing - I still have to deal with foralls in the outermost layer.

3:20pm. I guess I'll stay here for a while longer.

Right now I am thinking about what I did yesterday...

I can't really remember. Why would it be a problem to just make `Type` the base `Type0`. That would disallow the passing of HRTs and would essentially give me everything that I want.

3:45pm. I am actually making a lot of progress with this line of reasoning.

I am really starting to get satisfied with what I am having in mind now. Rather than kick out HRT, I will make only the base types allowable in type level functions and foralls.

That means I won't be able to write a generic type identity `type f x = x`, but I do not really need that anyway.

3:45pm.

```
_ : Set₁
_ = (∀ (a : Set) → (∀ (a : Set) → (∀ (a : Set) → a → a) → a) → a) → Set
```

This works in Agda. As expected, the base `Set` really should be the base, rather than the universe of all possible `Set`s.

3:55pm. Ok, let me once more amend the review.

4pm. Er, I thought I had removed impredicative polymorphism from the list, and yet I see it is still there. What the hell? I clearly remember removing it.

Did I undo that by accident at some point? Strange.

Well, nevermind. It is good that it was left in.

At any rate, this is really good. Making `Type -> Type` to mean `Type0 -> Type0` is exactly what I need here. There should never be a need for functions of `Type1`.

If I can make this restriction I will be able to make full integration with the partial evaluator without necessarily having to make any sacrifices such as removing HRTs.

The biggest problem behind that is that it makes no sense to not have foralls, since I very clearly need to have them in the outermost layer.

If I restrict myself to just the prenex polymorphism, then if I have Type in Type I still have the same boxing confusion.

4:05pm. This is great as with the `Type0` restriction everything will be boxable and I won't get errors during partial evaluation time, but during typechecking instead.

4:35pm. Since I am already taking a break, let me stop here for a while.

I am really satisfied with my reasoning right now. Basically, apply a HRT passed as an argument should not be any different from applying one at the top level and this restriction will close the loops.

Though, given a function `forall a b. Con a ~> b => a -> b`, there can't be too many constructions of these. Signatures like these should be entirely dominated by the constraint considerations right? Well, that would be the case if Spiral was a pure language. Since it is impure there will be tricks, but nonetheless...

4:40pm. Well, either way it will be fine.

I'll think about it while I am taking a bath and after that is done the day will be over, so I'll be able to have some fun.

With this, I think I've cleared most of the hurdles in the design of Spiral v0.2. From here on out I'll be able to focus on the implementation. Tomorrow, I will get that parser going.

I am going to eat this thing up. I won't let it block me for long."
