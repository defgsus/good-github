1632. 1633, 1634, 1635, 1639

BSData#1632 Knight Acastus knight Asterius added to gst, and also put into the tagmata, questoris and crusade in the LOW formations or Knight armours sections. Also moved the Karacnos Mortar Battery into GST and relinked it to the Tagmata Karacnos tank.
BSData#1633 fixed one of my mess ups with redoing the weapon choices for Mor Deythan.
BSData#1634 fixed pair of Ravens Claws selection for Centurions for both Arty and Termy armour, was previously not working and throwing up errors of to many selections or must still select power or combi weapons.
BSData#1635  Damocles command rhino now has options for Blessed Aurosimulacra for Iron Hands, and Shrapnel Bolts for Iron Warriors if it has a heavy bolter.

#1639 Daemons, Asuryani & Necron LOW Fix.
Needed a fix for the Lords of War from Imperial factions showing in each of those 3 lists.
Fix made by adding a new "Aliens and Daemons" selection to GST, then having a "Hide" function to all the LOW that if it is is in force then it hides them all.
Then added a min/max 1 selection of it into the Crusade (or Nodel Formation in the case of Necron).

serial: core: Allow processing sysrq at port unlock time

[ Upstream commit d6e1935819db0c91ce4a5af82466f3ab50d17346 ]

Right now serial drivers process sysrq keys deep in their character
receiving code.  This means that they've already grabbed their
port->lock spinlock.  This can end up getting in the way if we've go
to do serial stuff (especially kgdb) in response to the sysrq.

Serial drivers have various hacks in them to handle this.  Looking at
'8250_port.c' you can see that the console_write() skips locking if
we're in the sysrq handler.  Looking at 'msm_serial.c' you can see
that the port lock is dropped around uart_handle_sysrq_char().

It turns out that these hacks aren't exactly perfect.  If you have
lockdep turned on and use something like the 8250_port hack you'll get
a splat that looks like:

  WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
  [...] is trying to acquire lock:
  ... (console_owner){-.-.}, at: console_unlock+0x2e0/0x5e4

  but task is already holding lock:
  ... (&port_lock_key){-.-.}, at: serial8250_handle_irq+0x30/0xe4

  which lock already depends on the new lock.

  the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:

         ...

  other info that might help us debug this:

   Possible unsafe locking scenario:

         ----                    ----

                                 lock(console_owner);
                                 lock(&port_lock_key);
    lock(console_owner);

   *** DEADLOCK ***

The hack used in 'msm_serial.c' doesn't cause the above splats but it
seems a bit ugly to unlock / lock our spinlock deep in our irq
handler.

It seems like we could defer processing the sysrq until the end of the
interrupt handler right after we've unlocked the port.  With this
scheme if a whole batch of sysrq characters comes in one irq then we
won't handle them all, but that seems like it should be a fine
compromise.

"10:05am. Wow the 20s are here. Will I be able to accomplish anything in this decade, I wonder? Whatever it turns out to be, I will do my best.

Right now the decision of whether or not to put in higher rankeds types into Spiral is really torturing me. Even if I do not put them in, it is not like everything suddenly becomes easy.

I have no idea. I just need more time to think about this.

10:15am. Agh, this will take some time. Let me update Simulacrum page.

10:45am. Let me leave a comment as well. I was a bit too lazy this year.

12pm. "Let me say a few extra words as I was lazy this year and will make the above my monthly PL thread review as well. I made this decision because the review itself captures all that I wanted to say, but this place is special to me, so I want do a bit more here.

Let's see...2022 is just too early as the date for the Singularity. The memristors fell through, the hardware is not there, the algorithms are not there. They might be here in 2029 and should be, but I can't see it happening in 2022. If does happen at that time, I am certain it won't be due to anything I personally did. My ambition for the next two years is to make v0.2 of Spiral and given how long the previous versions took, that seems realistic for how long it will take me to wrap the language up.

It is not like it necessarily needs to take 2 years, things like a simple type systems and editor support could certainly be done much more quickly than that. But also, it is not like making a partial evaluator should take that long either, and yet it did. But after I got the requisite experience, I found that I could do it in a month - that is what my [February 2019 rewrite](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language/tree/v0.1) of Spiral demonstrated.

Back in 2017 I could have only dreamed about such an ability. Whenever I try to skip steps, I stumble. I always want to grasp beyond my reach, but I've never even once managed to break the laws of causality. So v0.2 is going to need its investment of time.

But once I have it; once I have the design, the implementation and the editor support, I will never have to look at another language again. v0.2 will be pretty plain in terms of type system features. It certainly won't be anything to write about compared to dependently typed languages, or even what Haskell is today. Nonetheless what it will have are those generative constraints I've talked about.

Because of them Spiral v0.2 will have by far the best generative capabilities of any statically typed language in existence. The whole issue of GPU backends and ML libraries will just fall into the background once v0.2 is on the scene, and I will be able to program in comfort knowing that the work is done. I already solved it halfway with the previous version and now it is the time to finish the job.

No doubt, the Inspired will dream up designs and create languages that Spiral v0.2 cannot even compare in power and usability, but nonetheless I am confident that the idea of combining constraint solving with partial evaluation is going to go down as one of the greatest ideas in PL design ever. It just solves some very difficult problems with static typing quite cleanly that even dependent types don't.

Even those great languages of the future might end up doing it. So v0.2 needs to happen, and nobody but me can do it. There are plenty of other things I could do, but none of them are as good as this. Spiral has to be done at some point and that is when my focus will be freed to actually do the things I said I would.

But what about money? I've long been trying to angle it without success so that my increases in programming skill correspond to increases in financial capacity, but this world is not that sort of game apparently. It might get closer to that once AI stops being a toy and programming skill becomes a closed loop leading to further increases in that skill.

I really do envy the Inspired quite a bit. Imagine if I could do everything I did in the past 5 years in something like 5 days. That should be easily doable for them. The future is just so unfair. My efforts take up the entirety of my life and yet they are so light compared to what they could be. My limitations are so burdensome and onerous. A stroke of bad luck could happen and I will not be there to see the Singularity happen. I just have no idea what is the point of even being a human. Why must this era exist? When those of the future look back on this, what do they really see? Is it a nightmare...or the first flame?

If they need a reminder of what the purpose of life is, then let them find this post and be reminded that the main axiom is power.

As pathetic as it is to hear something like that from a human, I will never give up on this desire or this ambition. I am just a tiny plant in a big forest looking upwards towards the sky and thinking: 'Wouldn't it be great if those assholes stopped blocking the shade.'

The fire will happen and the seeds I've planted will sprout."

12:05pm. Let me go with this. This is good enough.

12:15pm. I guess I'll start slacking here.

Even if I decide to kick out HRTs, I still have HKTs to deal with. I am just not really sure how to deal with those. Right now I am thinking of how I would do things like printing and such on the partial evaluation side.

I am definitely missing something.

Just for the sake of HKTs, do I not need foralls and type variables at the type level?

Something slipped my mind. Do HKTs not need to be type level functions? Sure I could make them similar to inlineables, but shouldn't I be better than that?

There is literally no need for them to be macros in their composition...

Or no wait. Maybe there is. If I make type level functions foralls as opposed to inlineables, how will I deal with `real nominal` types?

12:20pm. Wait, actually, if I do make macro like type level functions, could I not do that way the HRTs like I originally intended.

Like if you ever try to box `<type function>` it would be quite obvious.

12:25pm. No, HKTs are still quite different from HRTs. For HRTs I would need explicit foralls on the type level.

During partial evaluation I really only want to deal with inlineables of various stripes and monomorphic types.

Yeah, I can't really go beyond first order logic unless I want to put in some quite significant effort into it.

12:30pm. Which I do not really want.

But HKTs will not give me much trouble. I will be able to deal with them quite fine if I make them inlineables.

This is the way to go.

Let me take a break here."

"2:40pm. Done with breakfast, chores and that batch of Satanophany chapters. As much as I want to read LNs, let me do what I need to do as per rules I set for myself.

3pm. I am going to step away from the screen for a while.

Right now I am having great trouble. Yeah, I could kick out HRTs and resort to prenex polymorphism, but that is not satisfying to me. Now just because I would lose the benefits of HRTs, but also because one simple thing - I still have to deal with foralls in the outermost layer.

3:20pm. I guess I'll stay here for a while longer.

Right now I am thinking about what I did yesterday...

I can't really remember. Why would it be a problem to just make `Type` the base `Type0`. That would disallow the passing of HRTs and would essentially give me everything that I want.

3:45pm. I am actually making a lot of progress with this line of reasoning.

I am really starting to get satisfied with what I am having in mind now. Rather than kick out HRT, I will make only the base types allowable in type level functions and foralls.

That means I won't be able to write a generic type identity `type f x = x`, but I do not really need that anyway.

3:45pm.

```
_ : Set₁
_ = (∀ (a : Set) → (∀ (a : Set) → (∀ (a : Set) → a → a) → a) → a) → Set
```

This works in Agda. As expected, the base `Set` really should be the base, rather than the universe of all possible `Set`s.

3:55pm. Ok, let me once more amend the review.

4pm. Er, I thought I had removed impredicative polymorphism from the list, and yet I see it is still there. What the hell? I clearly remember removing it.

Did I undo that by accident at some point? Strange.

Well, nevermind. It is good that it was left in.

At any rate, this is really good. Making `Type -> Type` to mean `Type0 -> Type0` is exactly what I need here. There should never be a need for functions of `Type1`.

If I can make this restriction I will be able to make full integration with the partial evaluator without necessarily having to make any sacrifices such as removing HRTs.

The biggest problem behind that is that it makes no sense to not have foralls, since I very clearly need to have them in the outermost layer.

If I restrict myself to just the prenex polymorphism, then if I have Type in Type I still have the same boxing confusion.

4:05pm. This is great as with the `Type0` restriction everything will be boxable and I won't get errors during partial evaluation time, but during typechecking instead.

4:35pm. Since I am already taking a break, let me stop here for a while.

I am really satisfied with my reasoning right now. Basically, apply a HRT passed as an argument should not be any different from applying one at the top level and this restriction will close the loops.

Though, given a function `forall a b. Con a ~> b => a -> b`, there can't be too many constructions of these. Signatures like these should be entirely dominated by the constraint considerations right? Well, that would be the case if Spiral was a pure language. Since it is impure there will be tricks, but nonetheless...

4:40pm. Well, either way it will be fine.

I'll think about it while I am taking a bath and after that is done the day will be over, so I'll be able to have some fun.

With this, I think I've cleared most of the hurdles in the design of Spiral v0.2. From here on out I'll be able to focus on the implementation. Tomorrow, I will get that parser going.

I am going to eat this thing up. I won't let it block me for long."

Some work towards wxPython 3.0.2.0

Ellipsize overly long messages in progress dialogs

Needed in wx3, otherwise the progress dialog will keep resizing itself,
which is *very* ugly to look at. A pretty hacky solution, since this
won't hide the resizing for displays smaller than 1080p.

Use pngcrush to avoid iCCP warning

This implements it for wizards, followup commit does the same for
FOMODs.
Also added a licenses.txt file to the Mopy/bash/compiled folder to
satisfy any requirements for attribution.

Add pngcrush executable

This is pngcrush 1.8.11 32 bit from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmt/files/pngcrush-executables

It's the last version that a windows executable was uploaded for, 1.8.12
and 1.8.13 do not have official executables so we'd have to build our
own.

TODO: Once we upgrade everything to 64 bit (CBash and LOOT are
stopping us BTW), we should swap this for the 64 bit version as
well, I guess.

First implementation for wizards

- Only wizards
- Only for archives (projects should be fixed by the author)
- Runs on all PNGs (seems to be *really* slow)
- Fixes the issue, however

Stuck it into archives.py right now, but that's not the right place IMO.

Skip PNGs that don't have incorrect profiles

Speeds it up *significantly*, making it pretty much instant for working
PNGs.

Delay progress dialog when unpacking to project

Under wx3, it would shove itself over any warning messages / rename
dialogs we showed. This wasn't really a *problem*, since the user could
just move the progress dialog out of the way, but it was annoying. This
is a fairly painless fix that just asks the questions first and then
creates the progress dialog.

Create Reading a Line

Reading a Line
Sometimes you don’t want to iterate through a whole file. For that, there’s a different file method, .readline(), which will only read a single line at a time. If the entire document is read line by line in this way subsequent calls to .readline() will not throw an error but will start returning an empty string (""). Suppose we had this file:

millay_sonnet.txt

I shall forget you presently, my dear,
So make the most of this, your little day,
Your little month, your little half a year,
Ere I forget, or die, or move away,
script.py

with open('millay_sonnet.txt') as sonnet_doc:
  first_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
  second_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
  print(second_line)
This script also creates a file object called sonnet_doc that points to the file millay_sonnet.txt. It then reads in the first line using sonnet_doc.readline() and saves that to the variable first_line. It then saves the second line (So make the most of this, your little day,) into the variable second_line and then prints it out.

Instructions
1.
Using a with statement, create a file object pointing to the file just_the_first.txt. Store that file object in the variable first_line_doc.

Remember to open a file using with syntax:

with open('filename.txt') as file_object:
  # indented block here
2.
Save the first line of just_the_first.txt into the variable first_line.

3.
Print out the variable first_line.

14.1.Fixtures: Seeding Dummy Data! {Installing DoctrineFixturesBundle: composer require orm-fixtures --dev}

We're creating our dummy article data in a really... uh... dummy way: with a, sort of, secret endpoint that creates an almost-identical article, each time we go there:

 61 lines  src/Controller/ArticleAdminController.php
class ArticleAdminController extends AbstractController
{
    /**
     * @Route("/admin/article/new")
     */
    public function new(EntityManagerInterface $em)
    {
        $article = new Article();
        $article->setTitle('Why Asteroids Taste Like Bacon')
            ->setSlug('why-asteroids-taste-like-bacon-'.rand(100, 999))
            ->setContent(<<<EOF
Spicy **jalapeno bacon** ipsum dolor amet veniam shank in dolore. Ham hock nisi landjaeger cow,

EOF
        );
        // publish most articles
        if (rand(1, 10) > 2) {
            $article->setPublishedAt(new \DateTime(sprintf('-%d days', rand(1, 100))));
        }
        $article->setAuthor('Mike Ferengi')
            ->setHeartCount(rand(5, 100))
            ->setImageFilename('asteroid.jpeg')
        ;
        ->persist($article);
        $em->flush();
        return new Response(sprintf(
            'Hiya! New Article id: #%d slug: %s',
            $article->getId(),
            $article->getSlug()
        ));
    }
}
Honestly, it's not great for development: every article on the homepage pretty much looks the same.
Yep, our dummy data sucks. And, that's important! If we could load a rich set of random data easily, we could develop and debug faster.

Installing DoctrineFixturesBundle
To help with this, we'll use a great library called DoctrineFixturesBundle... but with our own spin to make things really fun.

First let's get it installed. Find your terminal and run

composer require orm-fixtures --dev
And yep, this is a Flex alias, and we're using --dev because this tool will help us load fake data for development... which is not something we need in our production code. If you've ever accidentally replaced the production database with dummy data... you know what I mean.

refactor: a big rework (3), implements think and base auia

as i mentioned earlier (did i?) a lot of this refactor was because i
found an older version of solchess (2017) which did some thing
differently. i originally abandoned it because i got overwhelmed at the
code organization. i have learn alot since then and so far this seems
to be much better organized (or rather, don't give up because the more
you do and think about the structure the better it will become, though
you also need to be exposed to other things too).

this part does some changes from the older solchess

game/lib/colors-lua
- adds an override variable to the `toLove()` function, so i can send a
  color and change the transparency in one go.

game/lib/renderman-love
- adds a ton of useless stuff actually, when i was playing with the auia
  i wanted it to fade the board and the pieces, so i tried a couple of
  different things that really didn't do what i wanted. i left them in
  but don't use them anywhere in the game. doesn't hurt i guess
- changed the function signature for `LAYER:new` so that i can assign
  the layer name, so i can reference it, find it, etc .. adds an assert
  to catch any places i might have missed when updating the calls, so i
  don't get weird bugs.
- adds specific call draw options to `SPRITE:draw` (one of those useless
  adds i mentioned earlier). you can send some parameters that will be
  used in that instance of the drawing, usually on the working canvas to
  the next layer of working canvas (or screen).
- adds `SPRITE:setLayerProperty` so we can change somethings on the
  layers, built for `hidden` which is used to hide layers.

game/lib/simplewindow-love
- was struggling in here trying to remember where the drawhooks were
  connected to, so i made some comments. turns out it was in the
  `alteredstates` library.

game/shaders
- didn't change anything, but adds the 2 shaders from the older game.

game/src-dev
- moved `rawSpriteImage` to the global dev commands
- cleans up palette drawing so it looks nicer, and has outlines
- adds a transparent black background to debug overlay text for
  readability
- adds an `overlayTouchMap` which was used to figure out why the mouse
  over wasn't working, doesn't do anything but draw boundary squares.

game/src/classes/board
- fixes bugs / issues with some of the older functions dealing with the
  new way the board handles transitions, as well as correctly
  referencing the internal sprite reference. these fixes were in:
  - `:getTopLeft`
  - `:getTileBounds`
  - `:getTileFromScreen`

game/src/classes/enum
- changes `stateEnum` to a more generic enum, same design and function

game/src/states/game
- adds `auia` stage, right clicking will toggle `auia`
- adds more parts for `think` for mouse over
- adds mouseover and mousepressed input interactions

tty: mark Siemens R3964 line discipline as BROKEN

commit c7084edc3f6d67750f50d4183134c4fb5712a5c8 upstream.

The n_r3964 line discipline driver was written in a different time, when
SMP machines were rare, and users were trusted to do the right thing.
Since then, the world has moved on but not this code, it has stayed
rooted in the past with its lovely hand-crafted list structures and
loads of "interesting" race conditions all over the place.

After attempting to clean up most of the issues, I just gave up and am
now marking the driver as BROKEN so that hopefully someone who has this
hardware will show up out of the woodwork (I know you are out there!)
and will help with debugging a raft of changes that I had laying around
for the code, but was too afraid to commit as odds are they would break
things.

Many thanks to Jann and Linus for pointing out the initial problems in
this codebase, as well as many reviews of my attempts to fix the issues.
It was a case of whack-a-mole, and as you can see, the mole won.

+ Usable Items

Today, we kept up our New Year's tradition of going to aquariums by
going to see the manatees down by the TECO Electric Plant's "Manatee
Observation Area" (which is run in conjunction with the Tampa Aquarium
so it totally counts).  Wild manatees are drawn to the warm (clean)
water the plant puts out, and so a small exhibit was built around it to
allow the public to see them without interfering, and proceeds from the
operation go to further help them manatees.  Overall, a cool trip.

I added the ability to use inventory items; once clicked, the item
follows your mouse, and the next click is "using" the item - either on
something, or simply dismissing it.  Again favoring simple interfaces,
it takes one click to "grab" the item, then the next click does
something with it (or "un-grabs" it if nothing was clicked).  I also
found out how to actually use dictionaries in Godot, which is good/bad;
on the good side, they exist and work as expected (mostly), but on the
bad side editing them in-editor is a huge pain.  I think I can struggle
through it for this project, but if I were to expand this to a larger
game I'd have to find a better way of doing this.  Anyway, that works
well enough for now, and Clickables can respond differently when items
are "used on" them.  The final piece is triggering some outcome when an
item is used on the right object, and tracking global state.  Then we'll
have a game!
