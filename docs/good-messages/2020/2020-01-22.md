What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

7-pieces Syzygy tablebase support

This is the first patch teaching Stockfish how to use the 7-pieces
Syzygy tablebase currently calculated by Bujun Guo (@noobpwnftw) and
Ronald de Man (@syzygy1). The 7-pieces database are so big that they
required a change in the internal format of the files (technically,
some DTZ values are 16 bits long, so this had to be stored as wide
integers in the Huffman tree).

Here are the estimated file size for the 7-pieces Syzygy files,
compared to the 151G of the 6-pieces Syzygy:

```
7.1T    ./7men_testing/4v3_pawnful (ongoing, 120 of 325 sets remaining)
2.4T    ./7men_testing/4v3_pawnless
2.3T    ./7men_testing/5v2_pawnful
660G    ./7men_testing/5v2_pawnless
117G    ./7men_testing/6v1_pawnful
87G     ./7men_testing/6v1_pawnless
```
Some pointers to download or recalculate the tables:

Comment by Leonardo Ljubiƒçiƒá (@DragonMist)

This is an amazing achievement, generating and being able to use 7 men syzygy
on the fly. Thank you for your efforts @noobpwnftw !! Looking forward how this
will work in real life, and expecting some trade off between gaining perfect
play and slow disc Access, but once the disc speed and space is not a problem,
I expect 7 men to yield something like 30 elo at least.

Comment by Michael Byrne (@MichaelB7)

This definitely has a bright future. I turned off the 50 move rule (ala ICCF
new rules) for the following position:  `[d]8/8/1b6/8/4N2r/1k6/7B/R1K5 w - - 0 1`
This position is a 451 ply win for white (sans the 50 move rule, this position
was identified by the generator as the longest cursed win for white in KRBN v KRB).

Now Stockfish finds it instantly (as it should), nice work üëäüëç .

I need to start admitting some research code.

It's been, broadly speaking, "tricky" to plan out and design some of
this project.  It's been doubly tricky to do it while understanding
the holistic performance implications of the detailed choices.
And while "premature optimization, evil", etcetera... I've gone
through the performance rodeo in this vincinity at least once before
(in the form of the refmt libraries): and resultingly, I'm going to
claim a slightly-better-than-zero intuition for what's premature and
what's utterly critical to keep track of as early as possible lest
ye be doomed to a rewrite after learning things the hard way.

(Arguably, half this codebase **is** the rewrite after learning things
the hard way.  But I digress.)

So: to combat this "trickiness", I've started writing a lot of
"research" code and experimental benchmarks.
This is still certainly fraught with peril -- in fact, one of the
major things I've learned overall is just *how* dangerously misleading
microbenchmarks can be (and to combat this, I've now started regularly
reading the assembler output to make sure the optimizer is doing
exactly what I think it is, neither more nor less) -- but it's much
more informative than *not* doing it, and trying to suss out the mess
later once you've built a whole system.

And that's what it's time to start committing.
(I should've started a while ago, honestly.)

This "rsrch" directory will get some more content momentarily in
coming commits, because there's a *lot* of stuff on my localhost.
Some of it was so preliminary I'm not going to bother to preserve it;
a lot of things are potentially pretty interesting, as educational
and archeological material, if nothing else: those I'm going to commit.

(It's possible all this will end up `git rm` again at some time in the
future, too.  But honestly, it's darn hard to remember "why didn't
you just do X?" sometimes.  Notes need to get committed *somewhere*,
at least briefly enough that it's possible to dig them out again.)

So!  To start: here are some research benchmarks into what strongly-
natively-typed builders might look like in our codegen outputs.

These are from about Oct 13th, as best I can suss localhost mtimes.
I think most of these concepts are ones I'm (frustratingly) backing
away from now, because I've learned a *lot* more about performance
in the meanwhile, and I don't think these are gonna do well.
But the worked exploration into ergonomics is still potentially
interesting and worth review!
