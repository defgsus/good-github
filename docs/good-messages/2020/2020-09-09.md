audio: fix stream-silence with push AOs (somewhat)

--audio-stream-silence is a shitty feature compensating for awful
consumer garbage, that mutes PCM at first to check whether it's
compressed audio, using formats advocated and owned by malicious patent
troll companies (who spend more money on their lawyers than paying any
technicians), wrapped in a wasteful way to make it constant bitrate
using a standard whose text is not freely available, and only rude users
want it. This feature has been carelessly broken, because it's
complicated and stupid. What would Jesus do? If not getting an aneurysm,
or pushing over tables with expensive A V receivers on top of them, he'd
probably fix the feature. So let's take inspiration from Jesus Christ
himself, and do something as dumb as wasting some of our limited
lifetime on this incredibly stupid fucking shit.

This is tricky, because state changes like end-of-audio are supposed to
be driven by the AO driver, while playing silence precludes this. But it
seems code paths for "untimed" AOs can be reused.

But there are still problems. For example, underruns will just happen
normally (and stop audio streaming), because we don't have a separate
heuristic to check whether the buffer is "low enough" (as a consequence
of a network stall, but before the audio output itself underruns).

[lldb] Don't infinite loop in SemaSourceWithPriorities::CompleteType when trying to complete a forward decl

SemaSourceWithPriorities is a special SemaSource that wraps our normal LLDB
ExternalASTSource and the ASTReader (which is used for the C++ module loading).
It's only active when the `import-std-module` setting is turned on.

The `CompleteType` function there in `SemaSourceWithPriorities` is looping over
all ExternalASTSources and asks each to complete the type. However, that loop is
in another loop that keeps doing that until the type is complete. If that
function is ever called on a type that is a forward decl then that causes LLDB
to go into an infinite loop.

I remember I added that second loop and the comment because I thought I saw a
similar pattern in some other Clang code, but after some grepping I can't find
that code anywhere and it seems the rest of the code base only calls
CompleteType once (It would also be kinda silly to have calling it multiple
times). So it seems that's just a silly mistake.

The is implicitly tested by importing `std::pair`, but I also added a simpler
dedicated test that creates a dummy libc++ module with some forward declarations
and then imports them into the scratch AST context. At some point the
ASTImporter will check if one of the forward decls could be completed by the
ExternalASTSource, which will cause the `SemaSourceWithPriorities` to go into an
infinite loop once it receives the `CompleteType` call.

btrfs: if BTRFS_IOC_DEV_INFO returns  dev root generate a friendly error message

On systems that boot without initrd on a btrfs root file systems the
BTRFS_IOC_DEV_INFO ioctl returns  dev root as backing device. That
sucks, since that is not a real device visible to userspace.

Since this has been that way since forever, and it doesn't look like the
kernel will get fixed soon for this, let's at least generate a useful
error message in this case.

This is not a bug fix, just a tweak to make this more recognizable.

Once the kernel gets fixed to report the correct device nodes in this
case, in a way userspace can make sense of them things will magically
work for systemd, too.

(Note that this doesn't add a log message about this to really all cases
we call get_device() in, but just the main ones that are called in early
boot context, after all all there's no benefit in seeing this message
too many times.)

[IMP] core: introduce `api.constrains_unlink`

With this commit, a new ORM api decorator is introduced:
`constrains_unlink`.

This decorator is to be applied to Model methods that check for specific
business conditions when attempting to unlink a record via the
interface.

E.g. trying to unlink a validated journal entry

This decorator allows this logic to exist outside the `BaseModel.unlink`
method and is automatically bypassed when in uninstall mode, this means
that during an uninstall any and all data related to a module can and
will be removed easily and cleanly while still being able to apply
business logic to manual deletion of records.

This feature opens the gates to solving a very big problem with
uninstalls: records and tables that remain in a database despite the
relevant module being uninstalled, because if an override to unlink
raises an error, the data will never be deleted from the database.

Henceforth, overrides of unlink shall solely be used for data-cleaning
purposes, i.e. deletion or modification of data that is related to the
one currently being deleted but cannot be automatically deleted because
there are no proper SQL relations.

In certain very specific, low-level scenarios an unlink may be
overridden to raise an error, but this should only be done if you know
what the fuck you're doing, most of the time you'll want to resort to
`@api.constrains_unlink`.

Following commits will replace any `unlink` overrides that raise
business errors by methods decorated with `api.constrains_unlink`.
