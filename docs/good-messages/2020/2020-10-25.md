path: switch back to using non-XDG config dir by default

XDG is stupid, so change back to the standard behavior. Unfortunately,
most users will now have the XDG one, so we will still need to load
this. (This is exactly the same problem as when XDG support was
introduced, just the other way around).

This should not affect any normal users. Hopefully I tested this well
enough; my intention is not to torment miserable XDG fans; they can keep
using their config dir if they want it.

This changes behavior in two cases:
- new users (now creates ~/.mpv/ instead of ~/.config/mpv/)
- users which have both directories

The latter case will behave subtly or obviously different, not sure.
Just fix your shit.

Extend the manpage with all the messy details, as far as I could reverse
engineer them from the code.
