DO NOT BLINDLY UPDATE // THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT BUILD

Important Note: If you test this resource in your server, please report back to us! We have not thoroughly tested this update and would appreciate your feedback.

Removed:
- Checking if a client event needed to be triggered, inside of a loop, that only triggered when a variable was set, that was only set inside two other events.... I know, and I very sorry for this abomination, please forgive me.

AncientSettings: FOD pressed state [2/2]

* Adapt recent FOD impl changes
* Move FOD icon picker options into it's own category and hide for non-FOD devices
* White joins the war (MIUI V11.0.2 Global)
* But what is a war? Let me explain with some examples
War is intense armed conflict between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents and militias. It is generally characterized by extreme violence, aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties. The scholarly study of war is sometimes called polemology (/ˌpɒləˈmɒlədʒi/ POL-ə-MOL-ə-jee), from the Greek polemos, meaning "war", and -logy, meaning "the study of". While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances. In all ages war has been an important topic of analysis. In the latter part of the 20th century, in the aftermath of two World Wars and in the shadow of nuclear, biological, and chemical holocaust, more was written on the subject than ever before. Endeavours to understand the nature of war, to formulate some theory of its causes, conduct, and prevention, are of great importance, for theory shapes human expectations and determines human behaviour. The various schools of theorists are generally aware of the profound influence they can exercise upon life, and their writings usually include a strong normative element, for, when accepted by politicians, their ideas can assume the characteristics of self-fulfilling prophecies. The analysis of war may be divided into several categories. Philosophical, political, economic, technological, legal, sociological, and psychological approaches are frequently distinguished. These distinctions indicate the varying focuses of interest and the different analytical categories employed by the theoretician, but most of the actual theories are mixed because war is an extremely complex social phenomenon that cannot be explained by any single factor or through any single approach. Reflecting changes in the international system, theories of war have passed through several phases in the course of the past three centuries. After the ending of the wars of religion, about the middle of the 17th century, wars were fought for the interests of individual sovereigns and were limited both in their objectives and in their scope. The art of maneuver became decisive, and analysis of war was couched accordingly in terms of strategies. The situation changed fundamentally with the outbreak of the French Revolution, which increased the size of forces from small professional to large conscript armies and broadened the objectives of war to the ideals of the revolution, ideals that appealed to the masses who were subject to conscription. In the relative order of post-Napoleonic Europe, the mainstream of theory returned to the idea of war as a rational, limited instrument of national policy. This approach was best articulated by the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz in his famous classic On War (1832–37). World War I, which was “total” in character because it resulted in the mobilization of entire populations and economies for a prolonged period of time, did not fit into the Clausewitzian pattern of limited conflict, and it led to a renewal of other theories. These no longer regarded war as a rational instrument of state policy. The theorists held that war, in its modern, total form, if still conceived as a national state instrument, should be undertaken only if the most vital interests of the state, touching upon its very survival, are concerned. Otherwise, warfare serves broad ideologies and not the more narrowly defined interests of a sovereign or a nation. Like the religious wars of the 17th century, war becomes part of “grand designs,” such as the rising of the proletariat in communist eschatology or the Nazi doctrine of a master race. Some theoreticians have gone even further, denying war any rational character whatsoever. To them war is a calamity and a social disaster, whether it is afflicted by one nation upon another or conceived of as afflicting humanity as a whole. The idea is not new—in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars it was articulated, for example, by Tolstoy in the concluding chapter of War and Peace (1865–69). In the second half of the 20th century it gained new currency in peace research, a contemporary form of theorizing that combines analysis of the origins of warfare with a strong normative element aiming at its prevention. Peace research concentrates on two areas: the analysis of the international system and the empirical study of the phenomenon of war. World War II and the subsequent evolution of weapons of mass destruction made the task of understanding the nature of war even more urgent. On the one hand, war had become an intractable social phenomenon, the elimination of which seemed to be an essential precondition for the survival of mankind. On the other hand, the use of war as an instrument of policy was calculated in an unprecedented manner by the nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. War also remained a stark but rational instrumentality in certain more limited conflicts, such as those between Israel and the Arab nations. Thinking about war, consequently, became increasingly more differentiated because it had to answer questions related to very different types of conflict. Clausewitz cogently defines war as a rational instrument of foreign policy: “an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill our will.” Modern definitions of war, such as “armed conflict between political units,” generally disregard the narrow, legalistic definitions characteristic of the 19th century, which limited the concept to formally declared war between states. Such a definition includes civil wars but at the same time excludes such phenomena as insurrections, banditry, or piracy. Finally, war is generally understood to embrace only armed conflicts on a fairly large scale, usually excluding conflicts in which fewer than 50,000 combatants are involved.

But enough violence, let us look into the history of MIUI to understand more:
MIUI V1 is launched back in 16-Aug-2010, it was the fruit of labour of 100 supporters, together they had a common dream to customise Google's Android Mobile Operating System. Back then , it was customized for Google Nexus One. MIUI V1 was simple, pain and easy to use. It features more functionalities as compare to the Pure AOSP ROM, back then! The first edition of MIUI icon now appears slightly astringent, rounded rectangle shape is not currently used conventional, but somewhere between one form of circles and squares. Draw icon, introduced Muji (MUJI) concept, and strive life, naturalization. Of course, some small green icon appears on the robot, and also shows the time of the native Android MIUI tribute. In pursit for perfectism, MIUI V2 was further improvisionised and undergo more customization, much more new functions were added to MIUI V2. And by this time, MIUI V2 is made available for much more smartphones! MIUI icons with constantly updated system has undergone some changes. Icons rounded rectangle frame into the current has been used; and in the icon draws the attention to detail, using a shadow has been re-revised, so that the icon looks more delicate. On 20-April-2012, MIUI V3 ROM was borne! This is marked a major milestone for MIUI ROM, when themes is firstly introduced and it give users the flexibility to customise how they want their MIUI ROM to look like! And this functions set a standard in future MIUI ROM! At this time, it is based on Google's Android Mobile Operating System 2.3, named "Gingerbread". It can be that this is an important milestone on the MIUI development process. In this big release, the icon was re-drawing, most of them designed to meet the then mainstream style - quasi-physical. Moreover, simple and clean, elegant design style, gradually gave birth to DNA MIUI design. Later about a year, on 22-February-2013, MIUI V4 ROM was borned! Together with the Google's Android Mobile Operating System evolved (into 4.0 nicknamed "Ice-cream Sandwich" or "ICS") and introduction of a series of Google-related APPs. Similiarly in the MIUI V4 ROM ,a series of Mi APPS APPs was also developed and included, eg. APP Store, Music, Video. There is also new functions added into MIUI V4  ROM, (e.g. Tencent's Anti-Virus), which is not found in standard Google's pure AOSP ROM. When MIUI V4's icon appears, you will find it looked better, more concise, and more modern the. Phone, contacts, browser, text messaging, these four resident application icon in the Dock light becomes softer, more concise content, intuitive, clear; and like folders, such systems music player, the camera comes with application icon, in the continuation of the DNA on the basis of MIUI design, more modern constitution sense, no longer so bloated, becomes cool altogether. A year later, in 5-Dec-2014, a brand new MIUI V5 ROM was released. It undergo-ed a major GUI redesign and revamp, from addition of notification at a swipe-down shade menu to system animations and desktop beautification, but yet retain the similiar users' experience and operations! However, at this point of time, due to the Mainland China government policies, all access to Google services are totally blocked, and all smartdevices are not allowed to be installed with any Google's APPs! Hence, a whole new environment of MIUI ROM were incorporated into MIUI V5 ROM, and all Google's APP and service were totally removed. The consistent style icons give people a pleasing viewing experience. The system comes with a carefully drawn the application icon, supplemented by a different color, icon originally intended to ensure the materialization of the basis of further abstraction to it, so that more simple-looking icons. In addition, the next version V5 launched the "perfect icon" program, the first official to redraw the more than 200 third-party applications icon, the purpose is to make MIUI V5 icon vision, achieve unprecedented unity. On the fifth birthday of MIUI ROM,6-Aug-2015, a all-new MIUI 6 was released. It was a new milestone for MIUI ROM, the GUI was re-designed, icons get a brand new refresh looks, more and new apps were included, and many new functions were added! For the first time, there were unofficially slogan for MIUI ROM, e.g. Visually Stunning, Stunningly Simple.! In MIUI 6, it looked even better. Simple lines, colorful color, you can see here like theme shops, map a continuation of the traditional kind is somewhat innovative icon designs; you can also find a clock, compass, a class of completely subvert the traditional recorder. MIUI icons 6, can fit the spirit "minimalist aesthetics". Icon shoot flat, minimalist, and instead a higher degree of recognition. As soon as you see this icon, you will know what your open applications. About 1 year later, on 13-Aug-2015, an exciting MIUI 7 was launched. For the first time, It included 4 built-in themes, for 4 major category of users. New features like 'Baby album', 'Child Mode', Extra-large Font size was incorporated. Although GUI and icons largely remind unchanged, but the underlying process undergo optimization, RAM management, and better battery life operation. MIUI 7 was made in the mind of better users' experience, and hence the slogan 'Your By design'! in MIUI 7 ROM, natively 5 built-in Themes was included. This able users to customised their outlook of their Mi devices. And for the first time, there is a slogon, 'Yours by Design'.

Now it may seem like I am a MIUI fanboy for knowing all of this and that is true.

Add a context menu entry to "Open Windows Terminal here" (#6100)

## Summary of the Pull Request

I went with the simple option - just open the Terminal with the default profile in the selected directory. I'd love to add another entry for "Open Terminal here with Profile...", but that's going to be follow-up work, once we sort out pulling the Terminal Settings into their own dll.

## References
* I'm going to need to file a bunch of follow-ups on this one.
  - We should add another entry to let the user select which profile
  - We should add the icon - I've got to do it in `dllname.dll,1` format, which is annoying.
  - These strings should be localized.
  - Should this only appear on <kbd>Shift</kbd>+right click? Probably! However, I don't know how to do that.

## PR Checklist
* [x] Closes #1060
* [x] I work here
* [ ] Tests added/passed
* [n/a] Requires documentation to be updated

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

This adds a COM class that implements `IExplorerCommand`, which is what lets us populate the context menu entry. We expose that type through a new DLL that is simply responsible for the shell extension, so that explorer doesn't need to load the entire Terminal just to populate that entry.

The COM class is tied to the application through some new entries in the manifest. The Clsid values are IMPORTANT - they must match the UUID of the implementation type. However, the `Verb` in the manifest didn't seem important.

Replace the Dynamic type with the "Any" trait

The Any trait is a trait implemented by all objects automatically, and
replaces all use of the Dynamic type. This means that Inko is now
statically typed, instead of being gradually typed.

The Any type is introduced as it can be cast to any other type. Using
"Object" to represent something that could be anything does not work, as
objects can't be casted to other objects. Any being implemented by all
objects does allow one to cast it to an object.

Argument types must now be known, meaning you either have to specify a
default value, and explicit type, or both. In other words, this is no
longer valid:

    def foo(number) { }

For closures and lambdas the compiler still tries to infer the argument
types based on how these blocks are used.

The behaviour of omitting method return types also changed. Prior to
this commit, leaving out a return type would result in it being inferred
as Dynamic. Starting with this commit, omitting a method's return type
results in:

1. The compiler inferring the return type as Nil
2. The compiler inserting a `return` at the end of the method, unless a
   `return` is already present

Take for example this method:

    def init {
      @number = 10
    }

Prior to this commit, the return type of `init` would be `Dynamic` and
the value returned would be `10` (an `Integer`). In this commit this is
changed so that `init` is inferred to return `Nil`, and the actual
return value is also `Nil` (not `10`). This matches how dynamic return
types were used in the standard library so far: to signal we don't
really care about the return value.

For closures and lambdas, the compiler still tries to infer the return
type based on the body; defaulting to Nil if no other type could be
determined.

== Reasons for moving to static typing

Inko was gradually typed for a few reasons. First, when I started
working on Inko I was leaning more towards making it a dynamic language
similar to Ruby or Python. As I spent more time working on it, I
realised I was starting to prefer a statically typed language more and
more.

I also felt that gradual typing would strike a balance between the rapid
prototyping capabilities of a dynamic language, and the safety of a
statically typed language. But in practise I found this not to be the
case. For example, in dynamic languages (e.g. Ruby) I spend a lot of
time jumping between running the code, and fixing silly errors such as
the use of undefined local variables; something a statically typed
language could easily detect.

Inko using statically typed code as a baseline (instead of dynamically
typed code) also made using dynamic types frustrating. Take this code
for example:

    def add(a, b) {
      a + b
    }

    let result = add(10, 20)

Here `a` and `b` are dynamically typed, so is the return type. Now
imagine we want to print the results:

    import std::stdio::stdout

    def add(a, b) {
      a + b
    }

    let result = add(10, 20)

    stdout.print(result)

This will fail to compile, as `stdout.print` expects a `ToString`, but
`result` is a `Dynamic` and the compiler does not know if the runtime
type implements `ToString`. This inevitably leads to a lot of cast
expressions like so:

    import std::stdio::stdout

    def add(a, b) {
      a + b
    }

    let result = add(10, 20)

    stdout.print(result as Integer)

If we're going to require developers to cast dynamic types almost every
time they use them, they won't be all that useful. And if they're not
useful, we should just get rid of them.

This doesn't mean gradual typing is a bad idea. In fact, I think it's a
great way of making a dynamically typed language more safe. TypeScript
is a good example: it takes JavaScript (dynamically typed), and adds
static typing on top. But supporting gradual typing in a statically
typed language just doesn't bring any benefits, and makes certain
optimisations more difficult or even impossible. And thus dynamic typing
is no more.

Clean up lifecycle management

Summary:
Sorry for the fairly large diff, but the stacking was beginning to get a bit counterproductive and I'd prefer to be able to do all of the churn on this diff prior to the fbpkg stuff. Also apologies for the changes from recent reviews but some earlier comments by Alexey gave me some inspiration to clean up the lifecycle management here.

The overall idea is to make it more of a "batteries included" approach rather than allowing callers to fine-tune parameters, as this shouldn't be necessary in the large majority of cases.

Mainly, I leverage context managers and two separate classes to get the "isolated daemon" and "single-use" semantics now, which I think ends up with a cleaner overall reading experience. I've also gone ahead and implemented a concrete location where both the backing and checkout will be placed under `buck-image-out`, in line with what was mentioned on D21331735. In addition, I added the option to instead specify `checkout_name` to have a named checkout within that dir. Finally, I made a `transient_checkout` decorator to give us the "isolated checkout" behaviour we had been going for in tests.

What this offers is a clean entry-point for tests to call into to get an Eden checkout, while also still being mildly explicit about the transiency.

I also added a considerable amount of comments throughout to try to clear things up and help potential future consumers.

* ci(travis): include NodeJS 12 and 14 with 10 among the tested versions

perf(ci-sh): uses npm ci instead of npm install which is designed for CI environments and therefore
is slightly faster.

* build(webpack,tsc): add webpack cache-loader and tsc incremental flag to speed builds up

caching is no magic bullet so we will have to monitor how this affects developer flow on the long
run and if theres any annoying side effects with cached builds hanging around longer than they
should be (e.g. cache invalidation fail)

* build(package-json): refactor how tests are executed to get a unified view of test coverage

Before this, tests were executed on a per package level and dumped their coverage report somewhere
in the middle of the process, individually. After this you get a unified report at the very end
showing the total coverage across all packages.

* chore(prettierignore): make prettier ignore the new contribs folder so (do not format it)

I missed this when the original PR introducing the contribs folder was accepted.
We do not want to
work on the original codebases anymore
so having prettier leave it as is is probably the
best/easiest.

* build(tslint): cockpit tslint will not enforce double quotes to match prettier defaults

Previously it was single quotes and the auto formatter was stuck trying to please both (single vs
double). Does not make much difference to me which one we use but some sort of uniformity is needed
for sure.
