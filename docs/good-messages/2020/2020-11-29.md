Locations and spell updates

* Switched Magic Sign mutations back to not having upgrades again. This
is acceptable now that NO_FAIL allows for tinmkering with experience
granted per cast, so cast-grinding is an actual option now. As a side
benefit, this enables...
* Set it so that the arcanist scenarios can learn some of the magic
signs you'd normally need a pattern scroll for. The above is needed for
that so that selecting and unselecting that trait works correctly.
* Tweaked the spell selection so that the spell lists are a bit more
unique between Seeker of The Arcane and Urban Awakening. Might, Agility,
Insight, and Light are the only ones the two scenarios have in common
now, the remaining spell choices for each are unique to that scenario.
* Added arcane variants to libraries, house_library, churches, and
museums.
* Couple minor additions of arcana content to some newish vanilla
itemgroups.

"3:55pm. I am pretty lost in thought.

4pm. How about I take off for a bit. I'll shut down the computer and spend some time in bed.

```fs
let add_package (s : PackageCoreState, infer_results' : Map<string,InferResult Stream>, dirty_nodes : Set<string>) (dir, x : AddPackageInput) =
    let old_package = Map.tryFind dir s.packages
    let is_dirty = x.links |> Map.exists (fun k _ -> Set.contains k dirty_nodes)
    let env_in =
        let f() =
            let l = x.links |> Map.fold (fun l k v -> (s.packages.[k].env_out >>-* in_module v) :: l) [] |> Job.conCollect
            l >>-* Seq.fold union package_env_default
        if is_dirty then f()
        else match old_package with Some x -> x.env_in | None -> f()

    let id, package_ids =
        if PersistentHashMap.containsKey dir s.package_ids then s.package_ids.[dir], s.package_ids
        else s.package_ids.Count, s.package_ids.Add(dir,s.package_ids.Count)
    let (infer_results, top_env_out), stream =
        match old_package with
        | Some _ when is_dirty -> (multi_file id (env_in >>-* package_to_top)).Run(x.files)
        | Some p -> p.stream.Run(x.files)
        | None -> (multi_file id (env_in >>-* package_to_top)).Run(x.files)
    let env_out = top_env_out >>=* fun top_env_out -> env_in >>- fun env_in -> top_to_package id top_env_out env_in

    let s = // Remove the current package dir from the parents based on the old links.
        let old_links = match old_package with Some x -> x.links | None -> Map.empty
        links_rev_remove old_links dir s
        // Add the current package dir to the parents based on the new links.
        |> links_rev_add x.links dir

    let infer_results = Map.foldBack Map.add infer_results infer_results'

    let package = {
        links = x.links
        rev_links = match old_package with Some x -> x.rev_links | None -> Set.empty
        env_in = env_in
        env_out = env_out
        stream = stream
        }

    { packages = Map.add dir package s.packages; package_ids = package_ids }, infer_results, Set.add dir dirty_nodes

let remove_package (s : PackageCoreState) x =
    match Map.tryFind x s.packages with
    | Some package ->
        let s = links_rev_remove package.links x s
        {s with packages = Map.remove x s.packages}
    | None ->
        s

let package_core =
    let rec loop (s : PackageCoreState) =
        {new PackageCoreStream with
            member _.ReplacePackages(adds,removes) =
                let s,b,_ = List.fold add_package (s,Map.empty,Set.empty) adds
                b, loop (Set.fold remove_package s removes)
            }
    loop {packages=Map.empty; package_ids=PersistentHashMap.empty}
```

Here is the core of the packages as they are done during typechecking, but I am not inspired.

...Lethargy is attacking me whenver I think about this. I did have a decent bit of flow for the multi file stuff, but let me take off for a while.

4:55pm. After gathering my thoughts for a while I have some inspiration. I know how to do the package stream for the prepass.

```fs
// Rather than just throwing away the old results, diff returns the new tree with as much useful info from the old tree as is possible.
let diff_order_changed old new' =
    let mutable same_files = true
    let mutable same_order = true
    let rec elem (o,n) =
        match o,n with
        // In `n`, `meta` and `tc` fields are None.
        | File(path,name,(_,p,tc)) & o,File(path',name',(_,p',_)) when path = path' && name = name' ->
            if same_files then
                if Object.ReferenceEquals(p,p') then o
                else same_files <- false; File(path,name,(None,p',tc))
            else File(path,name,(None,p',None))
        | Directory(name,l), Directory(name',l') when name = name' -> Directory(name,list (l,l'))
        | _, n -> same_order <- false; n
    and list = function
        | o :: o', n :: n' -> elem (o,n) :: (if same_order then list (o', n') else n')
        | [], [] -> []
        | _, n -> same_order <- false; n
    list (old,new')
```

Before I do that, let me revisit this for a bit. Now that I've generalized the file hierarchy that opens some doors for me.

```fs
| File(path,name,(_,p,tc)) & o,File(path',name',p') when path = path' && name = name' ->
```

I meant to simplify things by doing this, but that...

```fs
| _, n -> same_order <- false; n
```

...causes shortcutting to break down.

5:10pm. Had to take a break. Let me do it. Let me start work on the package stream. I am not sure if I'll be able to finish it today, but I should start it off so that I can finish it tomorrow. That will leave the rest of the day for the review.

```fs
type MultiFileStream = EditorStream<DiffableFileHierarchy list,bool * PrepassTopEnv Promise>

let multi_file package_id top_env =
    let rec create files' =
        {new MultiFileStream with
            member _.Run files =
                let files = diff_order_changed files' files
                let x, l = multi_file_run top_env_empty prepass id Prepass.union Prepass.in_module package_id top_env files
                (Map.isEmpty (fst x), snd x), create l
            }
    create []
```

As the initial step, let me do the multi file like this. I am going to need feedback on whether a package is dirty.

Now let me start the package.

```fs
type PackageStream = EditorStream<unit,unit>
```

What should the inputs be?

```fs
type TargetPackage = string
type PackageName = string
type PackageStream = EditorStream<Map<PackageName,InferResult Stream> * TargetPackage,unit>
```

I also need a map of package unadorned file hierarchies.

5:20pm.

```fs
open Spiral.ServerUtils

type TargetPackage = string
type PackageName = string
type PackageStream = EditorStream<Map<PackageName,InferResult Stream * ValidatedFileHierarchy> * TargetPackage,unit>
```

This is the ideal input, but it would be inefficient to transform the entire supervisor state just for this. Can't I do better?

```fs
type SupervisorState = {
    modules : Map<string, TokRes * ParserRes Promise * ModuleStream>
    infer_results : Map<string, InferResult Stream>
    diff_stream : PackageDiffStream
    packages : PackageMaps
    }
```

```fs
type ResultMap<'a> = Map<string,Result<'a,string>>
type PackageMaps = {
    package_schemas : PackageSchema ResultMap
    package_links : MirroredGraph
    validated_schemas : ValidatedSchema ResultMap
    }
```

I really don't want to pass in this entire thing into `PackageStream`.

Let me compromise a little. I'll do less work in the package stream.

```fs
type PackageStream = EditorStream<Map<PackageName,InferResult Stream * ValidatedFileHierarchy> * PackageName seq,unit>
```

It occurred to me that I am going to have to do a manual search in order to make sure that the target package has no errors.

I could construct the inputs for this stream while doing that. And while doing that I should also do a topological sort. That will get me what I need for the prepass in one move.

5:25pm. Lunch time.

6pm. And lunch is done.

6:05pm. Let me call it a day here. I certainly do not feel like programming now. I really wish I did more today, but I'll have to be satisfied with what I've got. Tomorrow I will try to get this current step out of the way.

Let me have some fun here."

Keyboard layout changes + removed some duplicate entries

The underscore and hyphen were listed in the file twice, so now they're not. I also fixed up the layout slightly.

I cheated and used my layout generator script to just recreate the file :).

Oh and sadly the "YO!! _\m/" was changed to "!!!" lol.

Also some things were in the wrong place, like some special characters like question mark was in between the "selection mode sequence" and the "space" button. They should just be with the other letters.

The letters are now all in the order you'd read them for each section, and this goes clockwise from the top right.

I've also put the Esperanto letters underneath the capital letters.

I've resubmitted the pull request because I'm stupid an uploaded the wrong file when I moved the Esperanto to be closer to the letters.

Finish rewriting in C, haven't tried compiling yet
C is the suckless language. Bjarne Stroustrup was a fucking evil idiot who
tried to ruin a perfectly good programming language with shit like
classes and templates in C++ to make code inefficient and messy. Wtf
needs public and private variables and functions in C++ classes? Private
variables are stupid pieces of shit that slow down programs by having to
call getter and setter functions all the time just to access a fucking variable.
Just use a struct. There's all the variables, pointers, and values
stored in the struct that can be accessed directly without the overhead
of a function that just fucking returns a value, and it makes the code
confusing and more janky, which makes it run like shit. If you have any
software projects in C++, I recommend you rewrite the whole fucking
thing in C. It will be easier to work with and easier to optimize. If
you think that optimization doesn't matter because modern computers are
fast and have plenty of resources, go fuck yourself. You're the reason
Fruit Ninja used to run fine on an iPhone 4, but now lags so much on my
Galaxy A21. Modern computers would be capable of so much more if
everyone still tried to optimize their code as well as possible. Fuck
C++. Write in C.
