Hidden gestural bar: fix visual glitches when switching states

hacky way but it works (TODO: find a proper fix in the new year,
i don't have motivation to dig into navbar/keyguard code fuckery now lol)

setting the height to 1px keeps the navbar almost invisible
but fixes the annoying visual glitches when going from screen
off to ambient pulsing or lockscreen (more noticeable on some devices
like bonito)
to replicate the issue without this commit:
- screen ON, then screen off, then double tap to go to ambient,
then double tap to go to lockscreen, then double tap to switch screen off,
then switch screen on again
- or just switch screen off/on a few times with the power button

Also sync the hide pill code with Pulse hide pill feature

I hate my life when I have to deal with this things. Then my friend sends me a gif of a paradoy in which Ash Ketchum rubs his nipples and I hate it even more. But then I remember I'll find someone in my life who can give me headpats, and everything is fine again

Create README.md keep it real so we can?

This all started wen I was manipulated to run around and do weird shit. But the agency inside my head failed to set me up cause I was in a case study.. So lets keep ourselves safe from the clutch of currupt officals.. And lets take back our rights and our minds also its illigal to be in a case study without your knowledge which i was subjected too. Thats why I tell my enemies im in one. :) seeing threw evil aint hard.

"11:10am. I am up.

What I am doing right now - what I have been doing for the past 5.5 years is fundamentally right. Gather inspiration, and then manifest it as code. This is the fundamental act of programming.

This is how a programmer fights. This is the whole of the battle.

The wrong way to fight is to go into it personally, trusting in your own feelings to carry you to victory.

A real wizard fights through proxies. A real wizard always uses proxies.

11:15am. A person is the most effective when his reason and emotions work towards the same goal. When they are opposed, things get nasty. This is later part more or less describes all the failures in my life. Post humans would never have this problem.

You can't relly on your feelings to carry you to victory.

But your manifested inspiration does have hope.

11:20am. I won't run away from my failures. A person's intelligence is the whole of his being. And having various subsystems working properly and in tune with one another is what it means to be smart.

I am dumb. Because I am dumb I can only be a programmer.

My being is set by nature. Then to unlock my true potential I have to go beyond it. Feelings will not be enough.

To do it, I need the power of machines, and my manifested inspiration.

11:20am. Let me chill just a bit and then I will start.

1:20pm. Done with chores and breakfast. Let me catch my breath.

1:25pm. Let me finally start.

1:35pm. Focus me, leave manga for later.

2:15pm. I am getting lost in thought.

Focus on the docs me.

2:45pm. I've been taking a little break now that I am done with unions. Let me resume. I need to get things going.

2:55pm. I am thinking what I should do here.

Ah, I guess the docs will have to be small than I expected. Let me cover the prototypes and then I am done with the top down section.

3pm. Let me do it. It is time to finish the first part of the language. Then I can cover the real segment. After that I will focus on filling out the docs.

3:30pm.

```
Besides the benefit of being inferable during the top-down segment, the prototype instances can be defined in different modules than the prototype as long as the nominal is defined there.

#### TODO - Implement the instance orphan check

The check for that last part needs to be implemented.
```

Let me implement this thing now rather than have a TODO in the docs.

```fs
            term scope {term=Map.empty; ty=env_ty; constraints=Map.empty} prot_body body
            (if 0 = errors.Count then psucc (fun () -> FInstance(r,(fst prot, prot_id),(fst ins, ins_id),fill r Map.empty body)) else pfail),
            // TODO: Do the instance orphan checking here.
            AInclude
                {top_env_empty with
                    prototypes_instances = Map.add (prot_id,ins_id) ins_constraints Map.empty
                    }
```

This should not be difficult.

```fs
let assert_orphan_instance_check (prot_id : GlobalId) (ins_id : GlobalId) = if (prot_id.module_id = module_id || ins_id.module_id = module_id) = false then errors.Add(r,OrphanInstance)
```

```fs
            assert_orphan_instance_check prot_id ins_id
            guard <| fun () ->
            top_env <- {top_env with prototypes_instances = Map.add (prot_id,ins_id) ins_constraints top_env.prototypes_instances}
            term scope {term=Map.empty; ty=env_ty; constraints=Map.empty} prot_body body
            (if 0 = errors.Count then psucc (fun () -> FInstance(r,(fst prot, prot_id),(fst ins, ins_id),fill r Map.empty body)) else pfail),
            AInclude {top_env_empty with prototypes_instances = Map.add (prot_id,ins_id) ins_constraints Map.empty}
```

This should be good. Let me add an error message.

3:40pm. For some reason the exhaustiveness check seems to be busted in the latest F#.

Nevermind this. Let me just move to testing.

3:45pm. It works. I should also disable instance shadowing.

3:50pm. Done. Let me publish the patch.

...Now let me get back to doing the doc.

4:20pm. Let me take a break here. I am done with unions. I think at this point I should just move to the bottom-up segment.

4:55pm. I am back. Let me resume. I have a lot of time, I have no intention of stopping at 6pm. I'll do it for as long as I feel like it. Right now I am at 1.43k lines, so that is 4 pages added today so far. Doing a few more would not be bad.

5pm. Focus me. Start the next section.

It is not going to get done on its own. After the docs are done, the real fun will start.

...Lunch.

5:20pm. I am back. Let me resume. I want to do this for a few more hours. Let me write the documentation instead of surfing /a/.

I need to remind myself to focus.

6:15pm.

```
## Bottom-Up Segment

From the perspective of the written code, the bottom-up segment generally means the code in `.spir` files and in the `real` bodies. From the perspective of compilation phases, the bottom-up segment happens during partial evaluation. Parsing and the type inference would all be a part of the top-down segment.

There have been a few examples in the previous section, and in this one the advanced use cases of the Spiral language will be covered and explained.

In the previous segment, most langauge features have been covered to a degree that is enough for casual use. There are some new things, but a proficient functional programmer could be expected to pick up Spiral in a few days and make headway in it. The language has eveything a functional programmer knows and loves: first class functions, pattern matching, records, tuples, unions, static typing and so on. Spiral support the low style functional programming as much as any language without dependent types.

The real reason to use Spiral though is its support for the staged functional programming style. This should be a novelty to almost everybody.

There is much to complain about the bottom-up segment, I've done as much in a few places earlier. It is a direct inheritance from the earlier version of Spiral where it was the only way to program. I was in love in love with it for a while, and then I dropped it in disgust, so you might thing I'd consider it a failure. But in fact it was a great success - Spiral v0.09 is a language I'd rate extremely highly on the power and expressiveness scale. It gave me a new perspective on what both programming and functional programming is, and if I can be successful at sharing it you'll see that there is no reason to consider functional programming lesser than imperative when it comes to performance.

And as it turns out, the very same things that make the language performant are the ones which make it expressive.

Performance of a language can be boiled down to two factors:

* Understanding what the compiler is doing.
* Having the ability to express that understanding succinctly.
```

I am stuck on how to follow this up.

6:20pm. Ah, damn it. I do not know how to say that I want. I am thinking of Python and dynamic languages, and now I find myself tongue tied. Do I really have to talk about things for which I am not an expert?

6:45pm.

```
Performance of a language can be boiled down to two factors:

* Understanding what the compiler is doing.
* Having the ability to express that understanding succinctly.

Based on those two points, how would various languages rate?

* C - you know what the compiler is (or at least should be) doing as it is bare bones. You have ability to express that understanding, but 'succinctly' is the problem here. The language has very little opportunity for abstraction and nowadays it is more fitting as a compilation target than actual human use.

* Python, Ruby, JS - you do not know what the compiler is doing as the languages in no way expose what the underlying representations of various data structures are - not unless you look under the hood. You can write correct programs and have the abstraction capability, but you have no way to express performance desires.

* Java, C#, F# - Though these langauges are generally considered slower than C, you can get good performance out of them. And the more you program in them like they are C, the closer you actually get C level performance.
```

Drawing in other languages into the story won't be convincing and just opens the door for others to nitpick at me. I already regret mentioning Julia in the previous docs already.

To make things convincing I should provide code samples from various other languages, but that would too much autism.

8:30pm. The memory tradeoff chapter turned into a huge unsubstantiated rant, just the way I like them. If the readers want science they can do it themselves, I want to get the basic theme going.

Let me close here. Currently the docs are at 1.71k. This is not bad. Those two large examples bloat the count somewhat, but even so, they are only 130 lines. I might have written a bunch myself. I was really into it for this last part.

8:35pm. I really have no idea what the hell do I want to do for the rest of the bottom up segment. I get the sense that I should at least demonstrate the struct of arrays stuff and serialization. Those two are Spiral's biggest strengths so I should highlight them. Right now I do not have them, so I am going to have to do some programming instead of just writing, but going in that direction is a good idea anyway.

I haven't really tested typecase or real nominals yet anyway. There are challenges waiting to be dealt with.

8:40pm. Tomorrow, I should start things off by showcasing some of the bottom up techniques for doing type inference and warn the user not to do it.

I should start by explaining filling that the inferencer is doing and do the type application by hand. I'll do that."
