carryon my wayward sooooon

there'll be peace when you are gone
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say

Carry on my wayward son
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say

Carry on my wayward son
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more OH

Carry on, nothing equals the splendor

Don't you cry (DON'T YOU CRYYYY) no more

Pets no longer teleport on unload when sitting

# Changes
* Pets will no longer teleport to the player when they are sitting and the chunk they are in unloads.

# Reason for change
Randomly, all your pets will teleport to you when running in the nether - even if sitting. This happens when the previous chunk unloaded and so now all your lovely pets are now on fire, burning, dying, and may about to try swimming in lava. I've lost pets before to this, and I'm sick of roaming the nether without being able to leave my pets behind. This should fix that change.

Thanks for reading. :)

Add doctests and improve RE.py

I've given up on having both "(?e<name>)" and "(?E<name>)" forms of
extension references. Instead, I've implemented "(?E<name>)" and
"(?E<label=name>)" to do the same thing, with the added benefit of being
able to specify the group label as something different from the
extension name. This will be necessary if, for instance, two ipv4
patterns are needed on one line, maybe for a client and server address.
So that could look like "(?E<client=ipv4>), (?E<server=ipv4)", allowing
the resulting groupdict to have "client" and "server" key values.

I've also pulled back on the parenthesis insanity I was obviously
suffering from when I added the ipv4 and ipv6 extensions.

The doctests are working well so far, making me fix things. I need to
finish these for the remaining pre-loaded RE extensions.

--------

This module extends Python's re module just a touch, so re will be doing
almost all the work. I love the stock re module, but I want it to
support extensible regular expression syntax.

So that's what I've done. You can register your own RE extensions by
calling

    RE.extend(name,pattern)

Doing so means that "(?E<name>)" will be replaced with "(pattern)", and
"(?E<name>)" will be replaced with "(?P<name>pattern)", in any regular
expressions you use with this module. To keep things compatible with the
common usage of Python's standard re module, it's a good idea to import
RE like this:

    import RE as re

You can then create whatever custom extension you'd like in this way:

    re.extend('last_first',r'([!,]+)\s*,\s*(.*)')

Doing so means that

    re_name=re.compile(r'name:\s+(?E<last_first>)')

becomes exactly the same as

    re_name=re.compile(r'name:\s+(([!,]+)\s*,\s*(.*))')

If you use the extension like this,

    re_name=re.compile(r'name:\s+(?E<name=last_first>)')

with "name=last_first" rather than just "last_first", that translates to

    re_name=re.compile(r'name:\s+(?P<name>([!,]+)\s*,\s*(.*))')

so you can use groupdict() to get the value of "name".

It turns out having a few of these RE extensions predefined for your
code can be a handy little step-saver that also tends to increase its
readability, especially if it makes heavy use of regular expressions.

This module comes with several pre-loaded RE extensions that I've come
to appreciate:

General:
  id      - This matches login account names, programming language
            identifiers (for Python, Java, C, etc., but not SQL or other
            more special-purpose languages). Still '(?<id>)' is a nifty
            way to match account names.
  comment - Content following #, ;, or //, possibly preceded by
            whitespace.

Network:
  ipv4     - E.g. "1.2.3.4".
  ipv6     - E.g. "1:2:3:4:5:6".
  ipaddr   - Matches either ipv4 or ipv6.
  cidr     - E.g. "1.2.3.4/24".
  macaddr  - Looks a lot like ipv6, but the colons may also
             be dashes or dots instead.
  hostname - A DNS name.
  host     - Matches either hostname or ipaddr.
  email    - Any valid email address. (Well above average, but not
             quite perfect.) There's also an email_localpart extension,
             which is used inside both "email" and "url" (below), but
             it's really just for internal use. Take a look if you're
             curious.
  url      - Any URL consisting of:
               protocol - req (e.g. "http" or "presto:http:")
               designator - req (either "email_localpart@" or "//")
               host - req (anything matching our "host" extension) port - opt (e.g. ":443")
               path - opt (e.g. "/path/to/content.html")
               params - opt (e.g. "q=regular%20expression&items=10")

Time and Date:
  day      -
  month    -
  date_YMD -
  date_YmD -
  date_mD  -
  time_HM  -
  time_HMS -

FUNCTIONS
compile(pattern, flags=0)
    Compile a regular expression pattern, returning a pattern object.

escape(pattern)
    Escape all non-alphanumeric characters in pattern.

extend(name, pattern, expand=False)
    Register an extension RE pattern that can be referenced with the
    "(?E<name>)" construct. You can call RE.extend() like this:

        RE.extend('account_name','[-_a-z0-9]+')

    And then, anytime you want to match an account name, you can simply
    use the '(?E<account_name>)' extension RE, making your code more
    readable and less prone to errors in regular expressions. Such
    references are replaced by '(?P<account_name>[-_a-z0-9]+)' by the time
    the stock re module gets control, so any match can be extracted by
    group number or group name.

findall(pattern, s, flags=0)
    Return a list of all non-overlapping matches in the string.

    If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of
    groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one
    group.

    Empty matches are included in the result.

match(pattern, s, flags=0)
    Try to apply the pattern at the start of the string, returning a
    match object, or None if no match was found.

purge()
    Clear the regular expression cache

search(pattern, s, flags=0)
    Scan through string looking for a match to the pattern, returning a
    match object, or None if no match was found.

split(pattern, s, maxsplit=0, flags=0)
    Split the source string by the occurrences of the pattern,
    returning a list containing the resulting substrings.

sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)
    Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost
    non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in string by the
    replacement repl. repl can be either a string or a callable; if a
    string, backslash escapes in it are processed. If it is a callable,
    it's passed the match object and must return a replacement string to
    be used.

subn(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)
    Return a 2-tuple containing (new_string, number). new_string is the
    string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences
    of the pattern in the source string by the replacement repl. number
    is the number of substitutions that were made. repl can be either a
    string or a callable; if a string, backslash escapes in it are
    processed. If it is a callable, it's passed the match object and must
    return a replacement string to be used.

template(pattern, flags=0)
    Compile a template pattern, returning a pattern object

feat(java11): allow conditionally turning on the cross-compiler plugin (#110)

The cross-compiler plugin requires a little additional setup (you have to set
the JDK_18 environment variable to point at a Java 1.8 JDK) but it fixes an
issue with Groovy and Kotlin compilation, where it prevents you from calling
Java 11 APIs when cross-compiling to Java 8. (For javac, you just have to say
`--release 8`, but setting it up for Groovy and Kotlin is more complicated.)

The Netflix Nebula plugin turns this on automatically, but only for "candidate"
builds, which is why my Java 11 merges succeeded with container builds and PR
GHA builds, but failed with the Debian builds and post-merge GHA builds. (It
failed because we didn't have "JDK_18" set.) So at first I was annoyed about
that because it's going to be a bit of a pain to configure (you'll see soon
enough), but then when I looked into it more I realized it's a pretty helpful
plugin, so I decided to embrace it.

I don't think we want to enable this all the time, or else developers will also
have to set that variable (which is why it's only enabled for the "candidate"
target). But I would like to turn it on for container and PR builds.

Case Study

DESCRIPTION

Background of Problem Statement :

The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Members of the GroupLens Research Project are involved in many research projects related to the fields of information filtering, collaborative filtering, and recommender systems. The project is led by professors John Riedl and Joseph Konstan. The project began to explore automated collaborative filtering in 1992 but is most well known for its worldwide trial of an automated collaborative filtering system for Usenet news in 1996. Since then the project has expanded its scope to research overall information by filtering solutions, integrating into content-based methods, as well as, improving current collaborative filtering technology.

Problem Objective :

Here, we ask you to perform the analysis using the Exploratory Data Analysis technique. You need to find features affecting the ratings of any particular movie and build a model to predict the movie ratings.

Domain: Entertainment

Analysis Tasks to be performed:

Import the three datasets
Create a new dataset [Master_Data] with the following columns MovieID Title UserID Age Gender Occupation Rating. (Hint: (i) Merge two tables at a time. (ii) Merge the tables using two primary keys MovieID & UserId)
Explore the datasets using visual representations (graphs or tables), also include your comments on the following:
User Age Distribution
User rating of the movie “Toy Story”
Top 25 movies by viewership rating
Find the ratings for all the movies reviewed by for a particular user of user id = 2696
Feature Engineering:
            Use column genres:

Find out all the unique genres (Hint: split the data in column genre making a list and then process the data to find out only the unique categories of genres)
Create a separate column for each genre category with a one-hot encoding ( 1 and 0) whether or not the movie belongs to that genre. 
Determine the features affecting the ratings of any particular movie.
Develop an appropriate model to predict the movie ratings
Dataset Description :

These files contain 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000.

"10:40am. Oh shit, I went to bed late on purpose so I can sleep better, but that caused to me to also get up late.

10:55am. Let me start. Let me check out the Elmish book.

https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/

Once again.

11am. This will be the third time I am reading the intro to this, but this time it will be the charm. Unless it turns out that Fable has some big flaws I am not aware of at the moment, I am going to be doing my web work using it from here on out.

ReasonML is also a reasonable alternative, but since I am doing Spiral in F#, I might as well go all the way with it. I am really fortunate that I really like the language I am using. Once Spiral is back on the scene I'll be complete.

11:40am.

```
// Runs the callback after a delay
let runAfter ms callback =
  async {
    do! Async.Sleep ms
    do callback()
  }
  |> Async.StartImmediate
```

This confuses me. Wouldn't this block the current thread? Well, whatever.

12pm.

```

[<Emit("new Intl.NumberFormat($0, { style: 'currency', currency: $1 })")>]
let moneyFormatter (culture: string) (currency: string) : INumberFormatter = jsNative
```

Oh, I am starting to get how the emit works here.

...Actually, this style of doing macros might be something worth adopting for Spiral.

12:10pm. Windows notifications have really become a pest in recent times. Usually, they would be happy to say something and leave it at that - now they annoy me every 5 minutes.

12:25pm. https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/fable/fable-bindings

Let me stop here. I am too hungry to really pay attention properly.

1:50pm. Done with breakfast. Let me do chores and then I'll resume the book. ...It seems I forgot to commit."

made some huge changes that will make the mobile experience very good

Previously u can't Jump or attack at the same time on mobile. Now it has been changed
Previously even if the Flying enemy shoots bomb that doesn't collide with the player. This has been fixed.
Previously normal bulet can't destroy the Flying enemy . This has been fixed.

Another cool new feature
shield
Previously if u have one extra life and die u respawn. but sometimes if u respwan to the position of an enemy u die instantly now it will no longer happen u will get a shield for 2 sec after respwaning

Fix ignore system

So I found out that Essentials checks for ignores by PLAYER NAMES... which players can CHANGE...

that's a bruh moment.

then again, last time this code was touched was like, 2+ years ago as of today. So I can *somewhat* forgive this stupid decision. Might make a pull request... nah fuck that lol.

"3:05pm. Done with chores. Let me start. I'll definitely have to put in some overtime today.

I'll see whether I can finish the book today (or more like tomorrow) and then I'll ask on SO how to set up a project for VS Code plugins.

3:10pm. "Which binding you can use depends entirely on the platform or environment in which your compiled F# code is running. Different platforms provide different APIs; for example, the APIs available in the browser are different than those available on a Node.js runtime. In the browser, you can manipulate user interface elements and draw 2D shapes on a canvas. Meanwhile, on the Node.js side of things, you can read file contents, call cryptographic functions or host a web server."

This is a good point. Somehow it never occurred to me to think about this difference between browser and Node environments. So VS Code itself is an environment.

3:30pm. This book will take me a while it seems. I am not just going to be able to rush through this. I do not want to force myself to go quicker as it will make me impatient and irritated.

3:40pm. https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/fable/how-fable-works

The book has been quite well done so far. It is pro quality.

This is quite cool. I had no idea Elmish used React under the hood until today.

4:05pm. I am getting lost in thought. The way Fable interact with JS is something that could inspire how I do Spiral. Originally I wanted Spiral to be a code generator I could call from F#, but then it became its own language.

Here I see F# interacting with JS and am thinking that maybe it would be possible to have it interact with Spiral the same way. This is something that would definitely be worth looking into.

But baby steps. I need to get everything else done first. Eventually I will master VS, do the editor support for Spiral, get my hands on those neurochips and so on. Hopefully I'll make some money along the way so I can upgrade my rig. At this point I am 3 generations behind the latest GPU family.

After I do all that, I'll be able to look into deepening my integration with existing ecosystems.

4:10pm. Now focus me. Get through that book chapter. Yeah, this will take a while and is a bit tedious, but I need to go through the motions.

4:30pm. https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/elm/render-html#feliz-vs-fablereact-comparison

This is interesting. I opted for the later in the Lithe POC, but I think that the Feliz examples were cleaner.

Admittedly I did not have much choice at the time, but even so it is true I could have done a better job.

4:50pm.

```
module App

open Elmish
open Elmish.React
open Feliz

type State =
    { Count: int }

type Msg =
    | Increment
    | Decrement

let init() =
    { Count = 0 }

let update (msg: Msg) (state: State): State =
    match msg with
    | Increment ->
        { state with Count = state.Count + 1 }

    | Decrement ->
        { state with Count = state.Count - 1 }

let render (state: State) (dispatch: Msg -> unit) =
  Html.div [
      Html.button [ prop.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch Increment); prop.text "+" ]
      Html.h1 [
        prop.style [(if state.Count < 0 then style.color.red else style.color.black)]
        prop.text state.Count
      ]
      Html.button [ prop.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch Decrement); prop.text "-" ]
      Html.h1 [
        prop.style [ (if state.Count < 0 then style.display.none else style.display.block)]
        prop.text (if state.Count % 2 = 0 then "The count is even" else "The count is odd")
      ]
  ]

Program.mkSimple init update render
|> Program.withReactSynchronous "elmish-app"
|> Program.run
```

I am writing this in VS Code and am really liking it. I actually do like VS Code more as an editor than VS. It handles parentheses better. And you can navigate through history using Alt+left/right.

4:55pm.

```
prop.style [state.Count < 0, [style.color.red]]
```

It is possible to write things like so as well. Interesting.

5pm.

```
let render (state: State) (dispatch: Msg -> unit) =
  let headerText =
    if state.Count % 2 = 0
    then "Count is even"
    else "Count is odd"

  let oddOrEvenMessage = Html.h1 headerText

  Html.div [
    yield Html.button [ prop.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch Increment); prop.text "+" ]
    yield Html.div state.Count
    yield Html.button [ prop.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch Decrement); prop.text "-" ]
    if state.Count > 0 then yield oddOrEvenMessage
  ]
```

So it is possible to do things like so. I had forgotten about this.

5:10pm. `prop.classes ["button"; "is-primary"];`

```
Html.button [ prop.classes ["button"; "is-primary"]; prop.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch Increment); prop.text "+" ]
```

This is pretty nice. I wish I could do CSS styling in WPF.

5:15pm. Time for the next section.

```
This is the big difference between The Elm Architecture and other UI architectures such as MVVM that has the so-called "two-way" binding. In The Elmish Architecture, there is only "one-way" binding and the updates have to occur manually.
```

Two way bindings - this is a simple concept that the more I think about, the less sense it makes to me. I gave it some though how to implement it using reactive extensions, but only then realized that there is no clean way to do this. You can only update the property, update the model, update the property...and so on in a circle. The only way to prevent an infinite loop would be to use a property difference check and use that as a short circuit.

6:05pm. Done with lunch. Let me go on for longer. I want to go for at least one more hour. I really haven't done much today.

6:50pm. https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/elm/todo-app-part2

I admit that I am not studying this particularly in depth. The code here is crystal clear to me - I can really see myself using this to do webdev.

6:55pm. https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/elm/todo-app-part3

Let me stop at this point. I do not feel going any further today.

It is demon slaying time for me. Even though I finished Doom Eternal a while ago, manga and anime is just not doing it for me so I've been replaying the game. It is a lot easier this time around. I really underestimated the game the first time - usually games aren't that hard even on max difficulty, but Doom Eternal really is challenging on Nightmare.

The first time around I skipped the Bullet Time rune on purpose and ended up regretting it. The legions of hell really aren't fucking around in this game.

7pm. It won't take me too long to go through the Elmish book at this pace. Two days more should be enough to go through it in full and then I will look into getting those plugins done.

7:05pm. Well, let me go for it. Games are life. Games are love. I live for the Games."

New species: Harpy
They're a bit like a cross between felid, tengu, and draconian I guess?
They might replace tengu at some point, but for now I'll leave them
together. Tengu is different enough(?), since they're not awful with
weapons, and can actually wear armour.

They can wield weapons, but they're not that great at it, and they
can fly like tengu can (perks included). The only armour they can wear
is helmets/hats and cloaks/scarves. Talons 3, claws 2, carnivorous,
fast 1 (not including the flying bonus, which is why it's only 1).

As for being shit with weapons, well some harpies just have wings, some
have wings and arms, some have arm-wing things, idk depends on your
depiction. Just assume the wings get in the way somehow, lol.

They're squishy, but fast, and can dodge pretty well. Also they get
rCloud eventually (weatherproofing?), so that's cool I guess.

rCloud isn't that huge of a deal, so it's probably fine...
probably...
It's not like they'd ever want to take qaz.
I guess you can fcloud and meph yourself, lol.

Here is my pull request. I finally got it working.

At last the pull request. So I added three bounties to Tumbleweed, I took inspiration from RDR1 seeing how people are asking for a way to redo the bounties I figured to make the bounties work like the first game given how the first game also had re-doable  bounties. Anywho they maybe aren't too distinct from another like I said so feel free to change any how you like.

A quick run down of how my bounties work: Once you get to the location of the bounty whenever you shoot, the body guards will attack. The target however will either fight or flight(as mentioned before). There rest pretty much has already been explained before. You may notice how they are all deadoralive bounties this was just a personal preference because I like the dead or alive concept. But again you may change anything to your satisfaction.

One more thing: Do you think you can maybe write a line of code or something that basically says: if all bounties from area X are set on 3 in the data file reset them to 0? This way making the bounties re-doable? I would do it myself but haven't been able to do so I'm afraid(I am not a very experienced programmer you see).

That's all for now, cheers!

Removed a dumb word I used in a comment

Yikes. Somebody brought this to my attention, I didn't even remember that I'd written it. "Spa" or "Spastic" is kind of a south park esque slang term that used to be pretty common in Ireland, which I used without even thinking about it. It's definitely not something I would say anymore, 10 years on, and it's something I shouldn't have said at the time either. I'm sorry :(

(somebody on twitter was asking me about how much cleaning up of the source code I did before launching this. I think this commit kinda answers that)

Update with half-working shuffling

There are many many hacks going on here, some of them
are probably unnecessary, but it's hard to keep track.
The primary thing to work around is udon's vrchat's awfully
inconsistent networked physics sync on non-kinematic rigidbodies.
However that's implemented, it just doesn't work reliably.

So right now there are some manual buttons to press for the master,
and they'll have to rely on voice to confirm that the tiles aren't
fucked up for all the other players.

Werewolf mask .asset.meta change.

NetIdentity null check in SetDirtyBit

Refactor Underfloor layer and start of Underfloor interactions

Finished Underfloor tile interact

Ties and blue shoe fix.

Loose tie in detective populator.

Add non-palleted beanies.

I wanted to do the single-color beanies but they make my head hurt. Also I spent a whole hour trying to color a beanie orange using the palette system.

Add stethoscope. Also add it to MediDrobe.

Add non-paletted scarves.

Not going to try to colour white sprites in again.

Add fanny packs.

They hold small items, and only three of them.

Ensure proper clean up of powernet on scene change

Only run electrical sim on server

Switch electrical sync to main thread. Removed atmos sim on clients

Fixed subsystem init

Fixed camera focus on closet exit. Fix Fire Extinguisher

Made water tanks great again

resave pogstation

Prevent error when handcuffing dead players

Deleted empty references in some SpawnableList

Fixed editor warning for NetworkManager

Used dontDestroyOnLoad. But this caused a warning because it's not a root object. Not needed anyway because the root already has dontDestroyOnLoad.

Commented out unreachable code, added TODOs

Added default null value to fix editor warnings

Variables default to null anyway, now it's explicit.

Initialized some variables with 0 to fix editor warnings

Those variables defaulted to 0 anyway, now it's not implicit.

Default some variables to false, fixing warnings

They defaulted to false anyway, now it's not implicit.

Fixed some unused variable warnings

Removed most unused variables. Some were commented out, some were left in.

Removed more unused variables & some needless includes

Fixed more "unused variable" warnings.

Quick fix attempt issue #3645

New trait Insulated

Add insulated gloves

Add (useless) meson eyewear.

None of the mesons do anything, but the gar mesons can hurt and butcher stuff. Doesn't include the engineering scanner goggles.

Rename meson .prefab folder. Add material scanners.

Again, they're all useless. Gar material variant does damage again, but uses the same sprites as the meson one.

Add the rest of _glasses.dm.

Again, nothing is useful aside from the gar glasses that work as weapons.

Add most of the HUD eyewear. Still not useful.

I included a HUDBase.prefab that is the parent of all the other HUD .prefabs. Hopefully this saves some trouble in the future... maybe.

Engineering scanner goggles and variants.

Add new eyewear to populators.

Beer goggles for bartenders, HUDSunglasses for security, night vision goggles for syndies, and science goggles for chemists. Also modify BarDrobe.

Remove HUDBase.prefab. Seperate HUD eyewear and make naming consistent.

Added more fire extinguishers to cabinets.

Fixes: Dead players are unpushable with magboots on

Fix playersprite toggling with clothing

Fix the fix

A couple of NRE fixes

UpdateManager clean up

vo_gpu, options: don't return NaN through API

Internally, vo_gpu uses NaN for some options to indicate a default value
that is different depending on the context (e.g. different scalers).
There are 2 problems with this:

1. you couldn't reset the options to their defaults
2. NaN is a damn mess and shouldn't be part of the API

The option parser already rejected NaN explicitly, which is why 1.
didn't work. Regarding 2., JSON might be a good example, and actually
caused a bug report.

Fix this by mapping NaN to the special value "default". I think I'd
prefer other mechanisms (maybe just having every scaler expose separate
options?), but for now this will do. See you in a future commit, which
painfully deprecates this and replaces it with something else.

I refrained from using "no" (my favorite magic value for "unset" etc.)
because then I'd have e.g. make --no-scale-param1 work, which in
addition to a lot of effort looks dumb and nobody will use it.

Here's also an apology for the shitty added test script.

ad_lavc, vd_lavc: return full error codes to shared decoder loop

ad_lavc and vd_lavc use the lavc_process() helper to translate the
FFmpeg push/pull API to the internal filter API (which completely
mismatch, even though I'm responsible for both, just fucking kill me).

This interface was "slightly" too tight. It returned only a bool
indicating "progress", which was not enough to handle some cases (see
following commit).

While we're at it, move all state into a struct. This is only a single
bool, but we get the chance to add more if needed.

This fixes mpv falling asleep if decoding returns an error during
draining. If decoding fails when we already sent EOF, the state machine
stopped making progress. This left mpv just sitting around and doing
nothing.

A test case can be created with: echo $RANDOM >> image.png

This makes libavformat read a proper packet plus a packet of garbage.
libavcodec will decode a frame, and then return an error code. The
lavc_process() wrapper could not deal with this, because there was no
way to differentiate between "retry" and "send new packet". Normally, it
would send a new packet, so decoding would make progress anyway. If
there was "progress", we couldn't just retry, because it'd retry
forever.

This is made worse by the fact that it tries to decode at least two
frames before starting display, meaning it will "sit around and do
nothing" before the picture is displayed.

Change it so that on error return, "receiving" a frame is retried. This
will make it return the EOF, so everything works properly.

This is a high-risk change, because all these funny bullshit exceptions
for hardware decoding are in the way, and I didn't retest them. For
example, if hardware decoding is enabled, it keeps a list of packets,
that are fed into the decoder again if hardware decoding fails, and a
software fallback is performed. Another case of horrifying accidental
complexity.

Fixes: #6618

client API: add async path; fix deadlock for vo_libmpv users

In commit 065c307e8e7db, I broke everything. It seemed like a nice idea,
but it explicitly broke an assumption vo_libmpv were explicitly allowed
to make: that observing properties does not lock the core. The commit
did just that and locked the core for property updates. This made for
example mpv's own OSX backend freeze (it uses vo_libmpv for convenience
to make up for Apple's incredibly broken OpenGL shit).

I don't want to revert that commit just because vo_libmpv's design is
horrible. So instead add an optional asynchronous path, that is only
used if vo_libmpv is in use (best idea ever?).

Interestingly, this isn't so hard. It adds about 90 lines of code, which
are only run on OSX and libmpv users, so I don't have to care about the
crashes and weird behavior this might cause. It even worked on the first
try except for a quickly fixed memory leak. The code path can be tested
anywhere by just turning the uses_vo_libmpv condition into always true.

The atomic is out of laziness. Saves some thinking how to get around the
locking order.

Create READ.ME

Description:
A one-page application for finding your girlfriend / boyfriend.
The application is a list of all users of the system with filters.
When the application starts, once a list of users by API is obtained.
API:
https://gorest.co.in/public-api/users

Screen - 1:
Search field.
Search - text field, searches by first_name / last_name, filtering is applied after entering more than 2 characters.
List.
The list of all users obtained from the API is divided into sections by the first letter of the first_name field.
List structure example:
...
<A>
# 23 - Annie Hettie - 20 year old - female
# 12 - Albert Johnson - 28 year old - male
# 6 - Alfred Bulma - 28 year old - male
<B>
# 78 - Bob Koa - 54 year old - male
<C>
# 13 - Chris Feather - 19 year old - male
# 8 - Connie Ember - 30 year old - female
...
For users with the status "active" the text color is black, for "inactive" - ​​gray.
After a tap on a list item, a modal window pops up with the text "Do you really want to invite a user with id = {id}?" with the Yes and No buttons.
If “Yes” is clicked, this window closes and the “Invitation Sent” modal window opens with the “OK” button.
The person who was invited to the date is no longer displayed in the list.

Screen - 2:
Filters.
Filters are a set of fields that perform interactive filtering. Filtering occurs without a reboot (on the front-end side), with a delay of filtering call of 400 milliseconds (emulation of using an external API). If all filters are inactive, the entire list is displayed.
Fields:
age - two input fields for numbers, "from" and "to", look for in the specified range, if the start / end is not specified, we consider that there is a minimum / maximum value.
gender - a list with the values ​​"Female", "Male", "Both".
Buttons "Cancel" and "OK"- closes and applies the filter, respectively.
Button "Reset" - resets all field values.

How to use:
git clone https://github.com/g-moskovskyi/rn-test-task-app-aj.git
npm install
expo start

Almost finished with sound mapping.
-The walking noise was driving me crazy, but instead of deleting I put it on a delay so now intead of being annoying, its creepy as fuck.
-The items are now all descended from the same blueprint so they can be put into an array. (TODO) This blueprint/class has a play sound function that will be used when the player picks the item up
