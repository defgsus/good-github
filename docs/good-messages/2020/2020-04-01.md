Fix Dennis Sisco CEO date; Fix publisher's issues

Add TOC.
Remove Short title, forcing headers to use full title.
New information from Tom Love points to date of Dennis Sisco becoming
CEO at no earlier than Jan 1986. Using c. 1986 as new date in timeline.
Reverted text referring to CEO change back to Brad Cox’s original text.
Moved discussion of name change to end of paragraph, adding details
about hiring of firm to find a new name from Love’s interview. Date of
name change now pegged to between Nov 1987 and July 1988, as Naroff has
documents pegging the companies names at these dates.
‘~’ character in timeline changed to c., which is moved to before the
year or month. Added a ‘c.’ to Stepstone fold date, as no one seems to
remember exactly when that occurred.
Subsection 4.1 (Objective-C vs C++) changed to paragraph header as
publisher points out subsections are inappropriate if there is only one
subsection.
TODO: Still need to fix Appendices D and E where the top of the scanned
page is brown and overlapping the section headers.

Remove intelligent pet patch ability to throw items at pets for wielding.

I did not even remember porting this, stumbled onto it today, and it turns out its hilariously, incredibly, stupidly glitched. The ability to give pets items is already implemented in a different way in splice, so just remove this entirely.

take out test footnote for now

didn't work and site is live!

was under know the facts, mitigation - 

{{ site.footnote.start }}You may have heard the phrase "flatten the curve" in this context. This refers to the idea that after containment of a new disease-causing pathogen has failed and a global pandemic is on, like now, the best we can do is to mitigate -- trying to flatten the curve of new cases requiring medical care so that it stays [within the capacity of the medical system](https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html). This should [decrease deaths and buy us time](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) to better prepare -- making more respirators / masks and other personal protective equipment, ventilators and retrained medical professionals, and maybe even treatments or vaccines to address the disease. Some critics argue that what we actually want from mitigation measures, however, is really still to stop the spread -- squash the curve, if you will -- and to get back to containment. Because when they put feasible numbers on the curves, they find that we would have to "flatten the curve" -- spread the pandemic out -- for [more than a decade](https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727) in order to stay within the capacity of the medical system. It could be argued that once containment has failed, we can't get it back as a feasible strategy, however, and then using mitigation measures for mitigation's sake makes perfect sense. Anyway, due to this controversy we just avoid using the phrase "flatten the curve" (which may not work for its intended purpose of keeping the pandemic within medical systems' capacities) in favor of "mitigation" and "slowing the spread" (which can still work even if medical systems get overwhelmed. {{ site.footnote.end }}.

"10:05am. I am up.

10:10am. Let me get started on this immediately. I want to study FRP. I am finally near the interesting parts. After I am done with this book, I'll go back to the old one and finish that thing. Then comes the Akka book. After that comes the ReactiveUI.

After that comes real programming. I want to acquire this power and go to the next phase of my programming journey.

Just what would it be like to be able to abstract things like UIs? I want to find out.

10:35am. 235/337. Yesterday I was too tired for this, but now it is coming to me easily.

11am. 241/337. I am confused. Just how could Window exist given the interface constraints?

How can the scan that comes after it be reset?

11:05am. I do not get this. Ah, forget it. Let me just move on. I am sure I will figure it out eventually when I look at the source.

11:15am. 245/337. Done with chapter 9. Let me study the code examples for a bit. Then comes 10. Only 60 pages left and then comes the appendix. I am close to the end of the book. I should be done with it today.

```
var windows = numbers.Window(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(200));
```

Ah, it creates an observable of observables. That explains it all.

```
        private static void ControllingTheWindowClosure()
        {
            Subject<int> numbers=new Subject<int>();
            Subject<Unit> mouseClicks = new Subject<Unit>();
            var windows=numbers.Window(() => mouseClicks);
        }
```

This is a good example. I need to keep in mind that events can control the window closures.

```
        public static IObservable<T> DoLast<T>(this IObservable<T> observable, Action lastAction, TimeSpan? delay = null)
        {
            Action delayedLastAction = async () =>
            {
                if (delay.HasValue)
                {
                    await Task.Delay(delay.Value);
                }
                lastAction();
            };
            return observable.Do(
                (_) => { },//empty OnNext
                _ => delayedLastAction(),
                delayedLastAction);
        }

        public static void RunExample<T>(this IObservable<T> observable, string exampleName = "")
        {
            var exampleResetEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);

            observable
                 .DoLast(() => exampleResetEvent.Set(), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3))
                 .SubscribeConsole(exampleName);

            exampleResetEvent.WaitOne();

        }
```

I am looking at this and wondering whether this could have been written as...

```
            observable
                .Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3))
                .Finally(async () => exampleResetEvent.Set())
```

This. Let me run it.

No, it is not the same thing. For some reason when I do it like that, both windows get created at the same time.

```
        public static void RunExample<T>(this IObservable<T> observable, string exampleName = "")
        {
            var exampleResetEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);

            observable
                 //.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3))
                 //.Finally(async () => exampleResetEvent.Set())
                 //.DoLast(() => exampleResetEvent.Set(), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3))
                 .SubscribeConsole(exampleName);

            //exampleResetEvent.WaitOne();

        }
```

Ah, this damn thing is just to shift the 'press any key' message. How convoluted. It would have been easier to emit the done message.

And it is not any key, but a line, meaning the enter key needs to be pressed.

11:55am. Done with the examples. Now comes chapter 10. Let me just read a few pages and then I'll stop for breakfast.

12:05pm. 247/337. Let me stop here."

Introduce new boot flow to handle SAR 2SI

The existing method for handling legacy SAR is:
1. Mount /sbin tmpfs overlay
2. Dump all patched/new files into /sbin
3. Magic mount root dir and re-exec patched stock init

With Android 11 removing the /sbin folder, it is quite obvious that
things completely break down right in step 1.

To overcome this issue, we have to find a way to swap out the init
binary AFTER we re-exec stock init. This is where 2SI comes to rescue!

2SI normal boot procedure is:
1st stage -> Load sepolicy -> 2nd stage -> boot continue...

2SI Magisk boot procedure is:
MagiskInit 1st stage -> Stock 1st stage -> MagiskInit 2nd Stage ->
-> Stock init load sepolicy -> Stock 2nd stage -> boot continue...

As you can see, the trick is to make stock 1st stage init re-exec back
into MagiskInit so we can do our setup. This is possible by manipulating
some ramdisk files on initramfs based 2SI devices (old ass non SAR
devices AND super modern devices like Pixel 3/4), but not possible
on device that are stuck using legacy SAR (device that are not that
modern but not too old, like Pixel 1/2. Fucking Google logic!!)

This commit introduces a new way to intercept stock init re-exec flow:
ptrace init with forked tracer, monitor PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC, then swap
out the init file with bind mounts right before execv returns!

Going through this flow however will lose some necessary backup files,
so some bookkeeping has to be done by making the tracer hold these
files in memory and act as a daemon. 2nd stage MagiskInit will ack the
daemon to release these files at the correct time.

It just works™  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

do apt-key the stupid way

The latest versions of `apt-key`, `gpg`, and/or `gpg2` helpfully and
_strenuously_ insist upon socket communication with `gpg-agent`.

With the introduction of GPG 2, the presence of a running gpg-agent is now
required. Most (if not all) operations normally performed by the `gpg` program
will fail if the client (the program you thought you had) cannot communicate
with the server (the agent GNU foisted upon you). Because of course you wanted
this.

This is a joy if, say, you like to play inside environments that lack a `tty`
and/or permissions to create Unix sockets. The docker container is one such
environment. But, cheer up --- it's only a problem if you want to do something
silly like `apt-key add` a pubkey.

Any troglodyte without a `gpg-agent` should just `gpg --dearmor` their pubkeys
directly into `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/` like the uncultured swine they are.

Manually pass mouse wheel messages to TermControls (#5131)

## Summary of the Pull Request

As we've learned in #979, not all touchpads are created equal. Some of them have bad drivers that makes scrolling inactive windows not work. For whatever reason, these devices think the Terminal is all one giant inactive window, so we don't get the mouse wheel events through the XAML stack. We do however get the event as a `WM_MOUSEWHEEL` on those devices (a message we don't get on devices with normally functioning trackpads).

This PR attempts to take that `WM_MOUSEWHEEL` and manually dispatch it to the `TermControl`, so we can at least scroll the terminal content.

Unfortunately, this solution is not very general purpose. This only works to scroll controls that manually implement our own `IMouseWheelListener` interface. As we add more controls, we'll need to continue manually implementing this interface, until the underlying XAML Islands bug is fixed. **I don't love this**. I'd rather have a better solution, but it seems that we can't synthesize a more general-purpose `PointerWheeled` event that could get routed through the XAML tree as normal. 

## References

* #2606 and microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml#2101 - these bugs are also tracking a similar "inactive windows" / "scaled mouse events" issue in XAML

## PR Checklist
* [x] Closes #979
* [x] I work here
* [ ] Tests added/passed
* [n/a] Requires documentation to be updated

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

I've also added a `til::point` conversion _to_ `winrt::Windows::Foundation::Point`, and some scaling operators for `point`

## Validation Steps Performed

* It works on my HP Spectre 2017 with a synaptics trackpad
  - I also made sure to test that `tmux` works in panes on this laptop
* It works on my slaptop, and DOESN'T follow this hack codepath on this machine.

In this lesson, Mike Albert taught me Steve Kelly about recursion using string reversal as an example. This lesson used Python as the language of choice. This lesson lasted over 2 hours, with plenty of comments, questions, and answers to back up the understanding. Without Mike's help, I would have been confused about why this worked. Mike explained this concept to me thoroughly and in a well-versed manner. Mike is a great teacher, helped solidify my understanding in not just recursion, but iteration, reversing of a string, as well as other concepts I have forgotten over the years.. I have never encountered recursion before, not even as my brief stint as a Computer Science Major at the University of New Hampshire. Mike Albert is a graduate of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a dual B.S. in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I am proud to call Mike Albert my friend and brother.

enforce default FailType set in operator menu

After a3a8dca8d7e23d7e26c2fc9d16e4b810144dae1c, player profiles started
saving a "PlayerOptionString" from the engine.  This was my lazy
solution for having all modifiers, both those specific to SL and those
defined in the engine, saved to profile and automatically applied.  I
didn't want to have to write a lot of theme code to individually handle
every single modifier the engine has.

It seems that FailType is a per-player modifier in SM5 and was getting
saved in this PlayerOptionsString and then re-applied each game cycle.
The result was that players could save their own FailType modifier to
profile, and effectively override whatever the machine operator had set
in Advanced Options.

It's unlikely anyone would actually do that^, but it's quite likely
someone using a profile could inadvertently get stuck with a
profile-based FailType they didn't want.  It's likely because it
happened to me while testing late last night. :)

So my fix here is to let FailType values be written to and read from
player profiles, but to have extra code in SL at key points that
enforces the FailType specified by the machine operator in Advanced
Options.

This will assuredly confuse two people on Twitter who actually poke
around in their Simply Love UserPrefs.ini and wonder why their
per-player FailType isn't being respected, but I think this is a
reasonable change and a reasonable way to enforce it, overall.
