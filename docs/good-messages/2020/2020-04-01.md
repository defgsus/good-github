Manually pass mouse wheel messages to TermControls (#5131)

## Summary of the Pull Request

As we've learned in #979, not all touchpads are created equal. Some of them have bad drivers that makes scrolling inactive windows not work. For whatever reason, these devices think the Terminal is all one giant inactive window, so we don't get the mouse wheel events through the XAML stack. We do however get the event as a `WM_MOUSEWHEEL` on those devices (a message we don't get on devices with normally functioning trackpads).

This PR attempts to take that `WM_MOUSEWHEEL` and manually dispatch it to the `TermControl`, so we can at least scroll the terminal content.

Unfortunately, this solution is not very general purpose. This only works to scroll controls that manually implement our own `IMouseWheelListener` interface. As we add more controls, we'll need to continue manually implementing this interface, until the underlying XAML Islands bug is fixed. **I don't love this**. I'd rather have a better solution, but it seems that we can't synthesize a more general-purpose `PointerWheeled` event that could get routed through the XAML tree as normal. 

## References

* #2606 and microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml#2101 - these bugs are also tracking a similar "inactive windows" / "scaled mouse events" issue in XAML

## PR Checklist
* [x] Closes #979
* [x] I work here
* [ ] Tests added/passed
* [n/a] Requires documentation to be updated

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

I've also added a `til::point` conversion _to_ `winrt::Windows::Foundation::Point`, and some scaling operators for `point`

## Validation Steps Performed

* It works on my HP Spectre 2017 with a synaptics trackpad
  - I also made sure to test that `tmux` works in panes on this laptop
* It works on my slaptop, and DOESN'T follow this hack codepath on this machine.

Re-engineer the binder-swap transformation

The binder-swap transformation is implemented by the occurrence
analyser -- see Note [Binder swap] in OccurAnal. However it had
a very nasty corner in it, for the case where the case scrutinee
was a GlobalId.  This led to trouble and hacks, and ultimately
to #16296.

This patch re-engineers how the occurrence analyser implements
the binder-swap, by actually carrying out a substitution rather
than by adding a let-binding.  It's all described in
Note [The binder-swap substitution].

I did a few other things along the way

* Fix a bug in StgCse, which could allow a loop breaker to be CSE'd
  away.  See Note [Care with loop breakers] in StgCse.  I think it can
  only show up if occurrence analyser sets up bad loop breakers, but
  still.

* Better commenting in SimplUtils.prepareAlts

* A little refactoring in CoreUnfold; nothing significant
  e.g. rename CoreUnfold.mkTopUnfolding to mkFinalUnfolding

* Renamed CoreSyn.isFragileUnfolding to hasCoreUnfolding

* Move mkRuleInfo to CoreFVs

We observed respectively 4.6% and 5.9% allocation decreases for the following
tests:

Metric Decrease:
    T9961
    haddock.base

fix minor alignment issues with SSM's header text

I spent a few hours tonight trying to figure out what https://github.com/ddrillini/Simply-Love-SM5/issues/17 might be referring to so that there could be one fewer perceived fault with the theme.  This commit contains whatever miscellaneous cleanup was worth keeping after giving up.

I am no closer to divining what "ScreenSummary center header is sized weirdly" might mean, but I am now 104x more confident that bitmap fonts in this theme are a disorganized mess.  Neat.

make Simply Love Options more modular

Simply Love started to seriously support more than just English starting with v4.8.0.  At that time, one of the testers (Jose or HeySora, I think) found that the Simply Love Options screen did not fully update to use a new language until SM was restarted.

I did not have time to fix it then, so v4.8 shipped with the note:

-------------
Please note that immediately after switching the language (for example, from English to Espa√±ol), it may be necessary to restart to StepMania for all in-game text to be properly translated. This is probably a bug, but thankfully you should only need to change the language once.
-------------

Then I forgot about it for a while.

I looked into it today and realized pretty quickly that my SL_CustomPrefs table in ./Scripts/99 SL-ThemePrefs.lua was only being evaluated once, at SM init.

This commit makes SL's use of _fallback's ThemePrefs system more modular by wrapping the existing code in functions.

I added some inline comments and updated the main README.md.
