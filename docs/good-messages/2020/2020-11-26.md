cli: Improve dependency update. Disable GOPROXY so updates actually work

Those monkeys maintaining go decided that go get (1.13+) goes through their
proxies and doesn't look at the actual fucking repositories of the packages
you're depending on. So you only end up seeing new versions of your
dependencies when their fucking proxy gets around to fetching them. I was going
insane wondering what part of MY setup is fucked up leading `go get -u ./...`
to not see the latest commits i pushed to goheadless. But sometimes select
really is broken [1]. FUCK.

While we're at it let's get rid of go.sum - right now the diff is just noise -
we can add it back later when we reach some kind of stable.

Finding docs on this wasn't easy. In the end, the release notes [2] of 1.13
show the way out:
```
go env -w GOPROXY=direct
go env -w GOSUMDB=off
```

To be clear, I'm sure they have their reasons and there's probably significant
benefits to using goproxy. I'd have liked this to be more obvious though - and
maybe have a --force flag when I know better than their proxy.
