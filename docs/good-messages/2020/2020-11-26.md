even more progress on the file format

Did a lot of stuff to fix bugs on it yeah
For the most part, this is actually a sort of functioning release, but theres some bugs:
- Sometimes, authentication may fail despite the password being correct, but when the database is recreated with the same IV and UUID it works??
- Putting no name or no description when creating causes segmentation faults

Now some shit I did
- Reorganized constants, suppressed an error, and put more stuff there
- Removed a few encryption options. These seem to be incompatible with my implementation
- Replaced pdpp handlers with a full database class:
- This class provides extremely easy interfacing between the application and database
- Also, it's cleaner, and stores all its own variables, making encryption, decryption, saving, etc. much easier (no casts required!)
- Changed Skein-512(256)'s personalization string to be the IV
- Completely fixed the conversion helper!
- Fixed compression, decompression, etc. and encryption so the databases are pretty small now
- Cleaner file parsing
- Reorganized and cleaned up includes
- Multiple functions now directly address the database's data rather than having another function do it for them
- Encryption automatically uses the database's metadata and config
- Replaced path addressing with database addressing
- Cleaned up statement list stuff
- Some smaller bug fixes I probably forgot to mention

this is quite a bit of shit isnt it?

PLANNED SCHEDULE:
- Fix all known bugs
- Add key files
- Create header documentation
- Experiment with different hash/checksum/encryption/deriv functions to see if any work
- Icons
- Entropy checker
- On-the-fly database configuration
- Implement more stuff into the "edit" menu
- Try and get Extended ASCII or other unicode chars to work
- Create a better, more streamlined interface, like a table for the list view
- Open up entry info in the same window as the entry list
- Complete GUI
- User-input attributes

Some extra stuff to maybe do:
- CLI application
- KeePass* format integration if I can find docs for their headers and shit
- Create a new format(s)
- Users/Groups
- Switch from SQLite to a better format more suited for things like this (XML, JSON, fucking HTML idk)
- Encrypt the passwords in some way in the database so they usually aren't ever stored in plaintext in memory

wow i just wrote that

FUCKING BREAD HOLY SHIT GODDAMIT

The last few versions of the PR this commit is in kept failing the sanity test because bread wouldn't fit in the radiopack. Bread is a normal sized item and thus wouldn't fit in the radiopack.

feat: add group member attribute

Hi, I saw your nice simple little library for LDAP authentication and started to play around with it. Nice work! I was particularly interested in extracting group information and saw that your example for the forumsys LDAP server wasn't working properly. I looked at the code and saw that the search you do is based on the object class and member attributes, but this last attribute should be uniqueMember for forumsys. So I thought of adding a groupMemberAttribute option. Then, when passing the groupClass option as groupOfUniqueNames and groupMemberAttribute as uniqueMember it finds the group information correctly. Sorry if you find this an unnecessary change, but at least it will make it clear to other users why it won't find group information based on your example? Anyways, glad to hear your thoughts and have a nice evening.

#### Thursday 2020-11-26 17:52:04 by Marko GrdiniÄ‡

"9:40am. I went to bed 'early' tonight so I slept well. Let me watch some PF vids. Yesterday I recruited Octavia and she is a Rogue/Wizard so I am not sure how to build her. Plus I get the sense that I am playing suboptimally. I picked a Diviner specialist, but I only seem to be casting Grease and Web.

Let me chill a bit and then I will start.

10:45am. Let me start.

Yeah, I've slacked a lot in the morning. Maybe I should just skip the morning session and move to breakfast. Let me do that. I'll have an extended afternoon session in place of that.

Though I've said I would start work on the prepass yesterday, I haven't put any thought into what the specific steps should be, so I am not clear at what I should do at the moment.

1:30pm. Let me do the chores.

2pm. Let me finally start for the day.

Today, I seem to be crazy about wizards again. Well, it is not just wizards - about the Pathfinder Kingmaker game in general.

I am actually not that used to thinking so much in depth about games. As a kid my usual flow was to go through them without using my brain too much. So right now I am going through a system shock since I am trying to play them properly.

Let me leave the thoughts of the game aside. For today, for the next 4h I doubt I'll do much programming, but what I should do is form my goals and do some planning on how to complete the compilation pipeline.

Right now I can do cross module and cross package typechecking - a great feat, but I still cannot compile. Until Spiral can produce working code, it will be nothing more than a toy.

2:15pm. I am still hooked on it.

This just goes to show that the only danger to my work is not the games themselves.

I can pry myself off a game, but prying my mind off it can take more work.

2:20pm. Ok, first of all, what happens to those filled tops?

```fs
type InferResult = {
    filled_top : FilledTop Hopac.Promise
    top_env_additions : TopEnv AdditionType
    offset : int
    hovers : RString []
    errors : RString list
    }
```

They are in infer result.

2:35pm. My focus is in the dumps.

You know what, let me turn off the computer for a while. It is clear I cannot pry myself off Pathfinder even though I am not even playing the game right now.

In bed I am going to focus my mind on just the prepass for a while and then hopefully accomplish something.

Today is kind of like a vacation after hitting a milestone it seems.

6:25pm. Done with lunch.

Since the last entry it took me a few hours to still my mind and then I managed to get some planning done.

Let me start with what I do **not** want to do. First let me note the compiling the prepass has a lot of similarity with typechecking.

I have to do deal with packages and modules, and I have to deal with memoizing past results.

So the first instinct would be to mirror the typechecking process.

```fs
let typechecker package_id module_id top_env =
    let rec run old_results env i (bss : Bundle list) =
        match bss with
        | b :: bs ->
            match PersistentVector.tryNth i old_results with
            | Some (b', _, env as s) when b = b' -> Cons(s,Promise(run old_results env (i+1) bs))
            | _ ->
                let rec loop old_results env i = function
                    | b :: bs ->
                        let x = Infer.infer package_id module_id env (bundle_top b)
                        let adds = match x.top_env_additions with AOpen x | AInclude x -> x
                        let _,_,env as s = b,x,Infer.union adds env
                        Cons(s,promise_thunk (fun () -> loop old_results env (i+1) bs))
                    | [] -> Nil
                loop old_results env i bss
        | [] -> Nil
    let rec loop r =
        {new TypecheckerStream with
            member _.Run(res) =
                let r = r()
                let r' =
                    r >>=* fun old_results ->
                    top_env >>= fun top_env ->
                    res >>- fun res ->
                    run (cons_fulfilled old_results) top_env 0 res.bundles
                let a = Stream.mapFun (fun (_,x,_) -> x) r'
                a, loop (fun () -> if Promise.Now.isFulfilled r' then r' else r)
            }
    loop (fun () -> Stream.nil)
```

The issue is that I'd have to start with expanding the `typechecker` and then the other streams. Doing the prepass in tandem with typechecking would explode the complexity of all these functions and to be honest, I am at my limit here.

I can't take any more complexity in these.

Instead what I will do is gather all the package file hierarchies and the map of `InferResult`s and do the prepass as a separate pass.

6:35pm. It is just too much of a burden for me to do anything in any of the other passes anymore. I do not want conflicting goals.

Actually, to start things off, I am going to do it even simpler. I'll forget about doing the prepass concurrently and I'll forget about fetching the `InferResult` streams. I'll also ignore the needs of memoization - I'll leave weaving the prepass compilation into a stream of promises for later.

Instead I will start a function that takes in a fully manifested data, without any streams or promises, and make that work. That will be my goal.

Then after that I should just optimize this for the needs of concurrency and memoization. I'll take it apart and put the pieces in the proper place.

6:40pm. I am going to try to get something done tomorrow. Today I got too obsessed with Pathfinder mechanics.

In general, I have enough discipline to keep myself from playing games or watching anime during the workday, but if my mind gets really fired up about something, I can't outright force it to go where it should.

Programming is directing my creative urges, and those can get hijacked.

Today I am going to do a gaming session, but if this happens tomorrow as well, I'll just stay in bed the whole day until my subconscious falls into line. Let me have some fun here.

This happened in part because I just slept so well tonight. I was so relaxed and all the tension drained out of me. I need a little bit of stress to work properly. Now that I have a clear goal regarding the prepass things should go more smoothly. It is hard to be motivated about something if you do not know exactly what those exact steps are."

Moving the four SMA edge connectors into their own device set. **See Description**

I've moved the four SMA edge connectors into their own device set as it didn't seem to make much sense to have them wrapped up with the trace antennas.
The main change is that the two SMD variants now have document layer helper text showing where a power layer cutout polygon should be located.
Now then, the trouble is, for reasons I don't fully understand, you can't do a simple replace to change to the new footprint. The library throws an error which I can't seem to get rid of. On the Asset Tracker I had to delete my two connectors and add them back in as new ones... Sorry about that.
Apologies for the inconvenience! (Don't hate me!)

        - Smart Pearls have 1/4 the cooldown compared to normal Ender Pearls.
        - Stackable up to 16.
        - Smart Pearls have a distinct particle when the user teleports, to differentiate it from normal Ender Pearls.
        - Smart Pearls have a unique sound effect when the user teleports, to differentiate it from normal Ender Pearls.
        - This item was inspired by the Smart Pearl in Hypixel's Skywars, but I highly doubt the concept is the same as Hypixel's implementation of this item.
        - Crafted by using ender pearls surrounding a piece of lapis lazuli. Crafted in batches of 2.
    - Added a new food item: Golden Heads (aka G-Heads)!
        - Continuing down the Hypixel copy-train, we have created the Golden Head from Hypixel UHC Meet-ups.
            - Food stats identical to Golden Apple:
                - Regeneration II for 5 seconds
                - Absorption I for 2 minutes.
                - 4 hunger points and 9.6 saturation points restored.
        - Like Hypixel's G-Heads, they are consumed instantly.
        - To prevent from accidently eating multiple G-heads, as well as for the sake of balance, we've put a 3-second delay on repeated-head-eating. ;)
        - They are crafted with golden ingots surrounding a player head, similar to Hypixel's G-Head.
        - Players now have a 50% chance to drop their own head when they die.
    - YEAY

            - Harvester increases harvest amount of crops.

                - Wheat crops now drops 3 to 7 wheat when harvested.
                - Haybales now have a 50% chance to duplicate themselves when harvested.

        - Harvester is mutually exclusive with the Fortune enchantment.
    - Two new advancements in-game!

    <Etherium Set Buffs>
     - New item: Godslayer (Etherium Perk)
        - Godslayer perk only works if the user equips a full set of Etherium armor.

    <Better Spawning!>
    - Skeletons can now spawn equipped with swords and axes.
    - There are now different types (classes) of zombies!
        - In hard mode, zombies will always spawn with a class, with a 7.5% chance to spawn with a hard-mode class.
            - These zombies have a lowered chance to drop their hard-mode-only gear (2.5% chance instead of 8.5%).
            - Hard Classes:
                - Furious Zombie:
                    - Netherite Sword with Sharpness 4
                    - Iron Chestplate
                    - Strength III
                - Berserker Zombie:
                    - Iron Axe with Sharpness 5

                    - Resistance I
        - In normal mode, zombies will have a 50% chance of spawning with a normal zombie class.
            - Normal Classes:
                - Warrior Zombies:
                    - Warrior Zombie ~
                        - Iron Helmet and Chestplate
                        - Stone Sword
                    - Weak Warrior Zombie ~
                        - Leather Helmet
                        - Wooden Sword
                - Sword Zombies:
                    - Weak ~ Golden Sword
                    - Simple ~ Bronze Sword
                    - Generic ~ Iron Sword
                    - Strong ~ Alloy Sword
                - Shovel Zombies:
                    - Generic ~ Iron Shovel
                - Axe Zombies:
                    - Simple ~ Bronze Axe
                    - Generic ~ Iron Axe
                - Nitwit Zombie:
                    - Metal Alloy in off-hand
        - In easy mode, the chances of spawning with a weapon is the same as vanilla.
        - The point of this change was to make normal zombies a more annoying-to-deal-with mob, than just a mere punching bag. Now, you're forced to deal with large groups of zombies with more skill required, than just slaying them in one hit with your smite 5 netherite sword.

    <Fixes>
    - Fixed shields not being able to be crafted with metal alloy.
    - Etherium armor now has a unique equip sound effect and a unique set bonus activation sound effect.
    - Etherium sword retextured.
    - Removed irrelevant recipes JSONs.

    <Easter Egg?>
    - A easter egg ;)

    <Technical Stuff>
        - Maven publication has been officially removed since no one uses it anyways and it's kind of redundant.
        - ModRegistry has been refactored to ECRegistry.
        - Project was updated to JDK 15.0.1.
        - JIJ for Fabric-ASM.
        - Fixed all capitalization to match Java's official capitalization. (Thanks... YTG123 ;[           i cry)

Doing some experimentation with matrixes

Terrible idea to experiment before everything works but fuck you.

cli: Improve dependency update. Disable GOPROXY so updates actually work

Those monkeys maintaining go decided that go get (1.13+) goes through their
proxies and doesn't look at the actual fucking repositories of the packages
you're depending on. So you only end up seeing new versions of your
dependencies when their fucking proxy gets around to fetching them. I was going
insane wondering what part of MY setup is fucked up leading `go get -u ./...`
to not see the latest commits i pushed to goheadless. But sometimes select
really is broken [1]. FUCK.

While we're at it let's get rid of go.sum - right now the diff is just noise -
we can add it back later when we reach some kind of stable.

Finding docs on this wasn't easy. In the end, the release notes [2] of 1.13
show the way out:
```
go env -w GOPROXY=direct
go env -w GOSUMDB=off
```

To be clear, I'm sure they have their reasons and there's probably significant
benefits to using goproxy. I'd have liked this to be more obvious though - and
maybe have a --force flag when I know better than their proxy.
