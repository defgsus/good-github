Scatter plot added to example covid19.py. I seems worth repeating the
disclaimer I put in the file:

The datafile time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv is for educational
purposes and reproduced (via download from edsuom.com) under the Terms
of Use for the data file, which is as follows:

"This GitHub repo and its contents herein, including all data,

A few people may come across this source file out of their own
interest in and concern about the COVID-19 coronavirus. I hope this
example of my open-source evolutionary optimization software of mine
gives them some insights about the situation.

BUT PLEASE NOTE THIS CRITICAL DISCLAIMER: First, I disclaim everything
that John Hopkins does. I'm pretty sure their lawyers had good reason
for putting that stuff in there, so I'm going to repeat it. Except
think "Ed Suominen" when you are reading "The Johns Hopkins
University."

Second, I know very little about biology, beyond a layman's
fascination with it and the way everything evolved. (Including this
virus!) I do have some experience with modeling, including using this
ADE package to develop some really cool power semiconductor simulation
software that I'll be releasing in a month or so from when I'm doing
the GitHub commit with this COVID-19 example. The software (also to be
free and open-source!) has a sophisticated subcircuit model for power
MOSFETs that evolves 40+ parameters (an unfathomably huge search
space). And it does so with this very package whose example you are
now reading.

The model I'm using for the number of reported cases of COVID-19
follows the logistic growth model, with a small (and not terribly
significant) linear term added. It has just 4 parameters, and finding
the best combination of those parameters is no problem at all for
ADE.

So, YES, THIS IS STILL A DISCLAIMER, I am not an expert in any of the
actual realms of medicine, biology, etc. that we rely on for telling
us what's going on with this virus. I just know how to fit models to
data, in this case a model that is well understood to apply to
biological populations.

Don't even THINK of relying on this analysis or the results of it for
any substantive action. If you really find it that important, then
investigate for yourself the math, programming, and the theory behind
my use of the math for this situation. Run the code, play with it,
critique it, consider how well the model does or does not
apply. Consider whether the limiting part of the curve might occur
more drastically or sooner, thus making this not as big a deal. Listen
to experts and the very real reasoning they may have for their own
projections about how bad this could get.

It's on you. I neither can nor will take any responsibility for what
you do. OK, ENOUGH DISCLAIMER.

+ Accessiability

Last weekend, after publishing the update, I was feeling pretty good.
This game was really coming together.  I was excited to see someone
actually play it.

Who better than _my dad_.

Now, I mean no offense when I say that my dad is not the best or most
experienced computer user on the planet.  In fact, he may well've never
played a proper video game before, ever.  So when I asked him to give
our game a try, it was treading new ground for him.  And that was
perfect.

Watching him get through the first few tasks was very eye-opening for
me.  I thought I was designing this to be accessiable to people who
aren't familiar with commonalities of video games, but it turns out I'd
made some assumptions I didn't notice, like that you should click on
things, or moving the mouse is part of gameplay.

To that end, this week's update is mostly focused on making the systems
of the game less mysterious to players that maybe aren't familiar with
video games in general.  There's now a "Click to Continue" prompt that
appears on dialog boxes, but only a second or so after all the text has
appeared (which means players that know what to do will probably never
see it).  We added a small tutorial section that instructs a new player
how to look around a room (by moving the mouse) and how to interact (by
prompting a click).  This has a secondary benefit of guiding players to
the right to begin with, which will lead them right to the backpack (and
the first puzzle) _and_ almost gaurentees their mouse will go past the
front door, displaying its exit arrow and hopefully prompting a click
(to show players where their ultimate goal is, and how to get a reminder
of what needs to be done to get there).

I think the most eye-opening thing my dad revealed during his
playthrough, though, was a total design oversight on my part: when asked
to find water for the branch, he found his way into the kitchen, then
saw a pitcher sitting on the counter and clicked it.  He was then
confused as to why nothing happened.  I hadn't even considered this, but
I'd accidentially introduced one of the worst possible pitfalls in
puzzle desing - a solution that makes sense, but doesn't work for no
reason!  This one was an easy fix (now there's a prompt telling you the
pitcher is too heavy, we might remove it entirely), but it's also got me
looking over the whole game to make sure there are no more logical
solutions that we put in the game that just don't work.

The last thing I noticed was that it was hard for him to spot the cup.
I moved it down the counter, but I also added a mouse-over hint icon
that highlights all clickable elements on the screen, which should make
it very obvious what you can interact with to avoid that situation.

On the positive side, with the few mechanics the game has described to
him, my dad actually made it through the first quest.  It was very
exciting to see him think through the puzzles (he gave the branch the
empty cup, triggering the "the cup is empty" message and reasoned that
the sink was the right place to go!), and it gave me some real
confidence that this is going in a reaonsable direction.

Once we get a little more done, I intend to seek out more testers of
various levels of video game experience.  Hopefully we can get the whole
game very welcoming to anyone who would play it; the intended audience
isn't limited to just gamers, after all.

I never got around to reading those side stories with Evileye.

Now that the new volume is out, I might as well go for it.

9:50pm. I am going to bed. I just tried installing `language-javascript-0.7.0.0` as a stand alone package for the hello world app and it is failing with the same error as before. For once, I do not think this is an error by `stack`. I am going to have to do some research in order to get this to run.

...I want to read Overlord, but I am too tired at this point. Let me close for the day here.

This is why I lurk /a/. Sometimes like now, the message really resonates with me and I am just filled with longing to stop being human.

As the next step in that pursuit, I need to get the `language-javascript-0.7.0.0` to work. Let me update those issues and then...I'll slack a little.

I dont experienced this in my windows machines (nor in the azure ci ones). have you tried to follow the recommendations in https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4055223/memory-allocation-errors-can-be-caused-by-slow-page-file-growth?

I would suggest you to set the %STACK_ROOT% environment variable to D:\sr (or other short path) and, after a stack update add in %STACK_ROOT%\config.yaml:

```
local-bin-path: D:/bin # where stack put the executables with `stack install`, it should be in %PATH%
local-programs-path: D:/bin/stack # where stack will put the downloaded ghcs
```

In general try to keep directories of everything as short as possible, moreover if you dont have enabled the longs path option.

```

This advice actually seems decent.

8:30am.

```

Since it is taking up too much space on C: I'll put it on the storage drive instead.

v5 Ah yes

 Ah yes: Back, been mostly assisting family with basic stuff. Pretty much prepared them last month before the stores
		started to lose a lot of stock in the couple of days. Got them more than prepared just in case hard lock-downs
			does occur, not a fan of waiting till the last minute, and worring if you have enough for the family or not.
			besides that mostly got them quite a number of snacks and other goodies in these couple of days to supplement
			the main stuff that was aquired beforehand. On top of that been working on more physical improvements. The better physic I am
			the better my mental strength will be for aquiring even more knowledge & information! That is the life of a scientist and explorer
			of this wonderful universe of ours. Been having a lot of benefits from it, and glad Im started to work on them. The better I can improve my
			self then I would be able to improve the lives of others and see them fulfil their potential. Life is full of mysteries & unknowns waiting
			to be discovered!! So much to do,learn,experience!! Fills me with so much joy and excitment , seeing the progress of our species, and other
			lifeforms that we share on this planet of ours. Ah! words cant explain it, too much, could go on for hours prhaps days lel.

			Anyways to the main objectives:
			* DB for python, just testing for the full stack/front end site respo, but it will be on a new respo called DB0, which will be the temp testing
			ground for a db. Once I aquire more resources will be aquiring a server to use for my a.i and other experiments/servers. Have a lot of plans
			for the future, and want to further improve my skills, and implementing them onto the world. Want to further improve our understanding of code, the universe,
			and our connection to our future brethern as well. The future is ready to be written, it is up to you to make that step forward to write what your life will be

"12:25pm. Done with breakfast. Let me try the new plugin. I'll try installing it.

12:30pm. Ah, the hie build put it into path. I was surprised that that happened. Ok.

It works on the hello world project. Let me see if it works on the Purs compiler.

```
2020-03-14 12:31:30.2280328 [ThreadId 42] - Cabal-Helper decided to use: ProjLocStackYaml {plStackYaml = "C:\\purescript\\stack.yaml"}
'stty' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
'stty' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
'stty' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

For God's sake, even this shitty plugin is hammering `stty` for some reason.

12:35pm. Issue opened, printout sent.

12:40pm. Damn it, I hate this kind of work the most.

1pm. There are just ups and downs over this. But at the very least, I got the Purs compiler to compile. Depending on how things go, maybe the stty issue will get fixed in under a week. In that case I might get some use out of this.

...Actually it is quite suspicious that both of the tools hammer stty. It is unlikely that both of the plugins would have the same error.

```
2020-03-14 12:31:30.2280328 [ThreadId 42] - Cabal-Helper decided to use: ProjLocStackYaml {plStackYaml = "C:\\purescript\\stack.yaml"}
```

I actually checked the `.yaml` file, but did not see any use of it though. So I am drawing a blank again.

1pm. It does not matter. As I said, the most important thing is that I can get the compiler itself to work. What I will do today is start studying Purescript. This will take me a few days, and then after that I will move to the source.

1:25pm. Got a reply by the REPL plugin author. The guy said that this should not prevent me from using the plugin. Now that I am testing Hie, it does seem that is in fact the case for it at least, though not for the REPL plugin.

1:35pm. Yeah, Hie works! Great! I could go without it taking several Gbs in dependencies and taking hours to install, but I finally have Haskell editor support working.

Now I can leave this aside for a while. When it is time to study the Purs compiler I will make good use of this.

Let me do the chores.

Seriously, I am failing both at working and slacking. I am barely into the first chapter of the Overlord side story.

But things are finally looking up for me. I am done with this tool installation episode of my life. Now I can finally start the studies. It is fine if I end up studying Purescript for a few months or even longer. As long as I can master this I will have a powerful tool at my disposal.

2:10pm. Done with chores.

2:15pm. It seems the `stty` has no effect. Well, nevermind that.

Let me start my Purescript adventure here. It is time to get into the swing of things. Right now I do not feel like wasting time in the least. I just want to get things going.

2:20pm. https://leanpub.com/purescript/read
PureScript by Example

https://purescript-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/0.11.7-to-0.12.0.html

Have to keep the version changes in mind.

2:30pm. "In this book, I will try to convince you (or reaffirm your belief) that static types are not only a means of gaining confidence in the correctness of your programs, but also an aid to development in their own right. Refactoring a large body of code in JavaScript can be difficult when using any but the simplest of abstractions, but an expressive type system together with a type checker can even make refactoring into an enjoyable, interactive experience."

There is a deeper principle to this, I am sure of it. There is a parallel between ML and PL - the reason for instability during optimization in ML is a direct consequence of the absence of top down functionality analogous to typechecking.

2:40pm. "This book aims to provide an introduction to the PureScript language for beginners, but it is not the sort of book that provides a list of template solutions to problems. For beginners, this book should be a fun challenge, and you will get the most benefit if you read the material, attempt the exercises, and most importantly of all, try to write some code of your own."

Ok. Even if it takes me extra time I'll endeavor to do the exercises. I'll be busy with Purescript for a while anyway, so there is no point in rushing.

I really hope that by the time the half yearly review time arrives, in 3 months, that I will have a solid grasp of all aspect of Purescript and will know how to do the plugins inside and out.

2:55pm. Hmm, neither `pulp` nor `stago` work from the command line. How did I init the hello world project last time?

3pm.

```
module Main where

import Effect (Effect)
import Effect.Console (log)

main :: Effect Unit
main = do
  log "Hello sailor!"
```

Hmmm, it feels like the package manager and the CLI used in the book are outdated.

I might have to learn about `stago` on my own.

3:05pm. Ah, actually it works, I just have to compile the project first otherwise the IDE will complain for whatever reason.

3:15pm.

```
import Math(sqrt)
```

I installed the `purescript-math` package, but the IDE does not recognize it for some reason. The build works and gives a warning about it being redundant. But I do not think this is what the error is.

Let me try this with `stago`.

...Er, it is `spago`.

It does not have the `purescript-math` package for some reason.

3:25pm. https://github.com/purescript/spago

Let me read its readme.

3:30pm.

---
If you wish to automatically have your project rebuilt when making changes to source files you can use the --watch flag:

```
$ spago build --watch

# or, to clear the screen on rebuild:
$ spago build --watch --clear-screen
```

---

This is nice. I was wondering about this.

https://github.com/purescript/spago#list-available-packages

It can open a REPL on the browser.

3:35pm.

```
import Math(sqrt)

q = sqrt 4.0
```

Somehow this started working. Maybe it takes the IDE some time to figure things out.

Ah, the reason it is saying the import is redundant is because I haven't been using `sqrt`.

```
{ name = "my-project"
, dependencies = [ "console", "effect", "lists", "math", "psci-support" ]
, packages = ./packages.dhall
, sources = [ "src/**/*.purs", "test/**/*.purs" ]
}
```

I am confused. What exactly is the difference between packages and dependencies?

https://github.com/purescript/spago#override-a-package-in-the-package-set-with-a-local-one

I guess it goes into detail here.

4pm. Ok, I've read up on this. When it comes to package management for Spiral, I will copy whatever Purescript is doing.

I've only personally ever had a strong opinion on the matter of partial evaluation, the rest I have no problem with stealing from others.

4:20pm.

```
import Global(nan)
```

I find this very confusing. Not only the IDE, but it seems even the compiler cannot see it even though it is in the dependency list and I've installed it with `spago`.

...Ah, I need to compile the entire project.

4:25pm. Right now I am just finding my way around. I now know how to install dependencies. The way typechecking works, is that rather specifically on typing like in F#, it triggers on save. That is how I intended to do it in Spiral.

So I am really happy to see it working so well here.

I mean sure, instantaneous typechecking of the sort F# offers is great, but it is not a world of difference like not having it in the first place.

4:30pm. "The front-end of our application will be the interactive mode PSCi, but it would be possible to build on this code to write a front-end in Javascript. In fact, we will do exactly that in later chapters, adding form validation and save/restore functionality."

I am in functional mode so I am forgetting that PS is a front end language.

This is actually good. I spent a lot of time learning Typescript and such, but doing that sort of thing in a language like PS will definitely be a breath of fresh air.

```
w x = x.author
```

Oh, it can infer this automatically. This is nice.

4:50pm.

```
w {x, y} = x + y + 4.0
```

This really does work particularly well.

```
E:\Webdev\Purescript\hello>spago repl
Compiling Data.AddressBook
Compiling Main
PSCi, version 0.13.6
Type :? for help

import Prelude

> import Data.AddressBook
> :type w
forall t4.
  { x :: Number
  , y :: Number
  | t4
  }
  -> Number
```

5:10pm. I've started skimming. This stuff is to basic for me to really pay proper attention. I want to get going.

...So much for my promise to do the exercises. I know I am missing stuff like this, but I'll pick it up as I go along. What is most important that today I got familiar with package management and the editor.

I could have gone a lot further if setting up Haskell did not take up so much of my time, but that is how things go.

Oh, I just noticed that I have only 54Gb now. It seems The plugin took over 6Gb in dependencies. They really need to figure out how to distribute the binaries because this is ridiculous.

5:20pm. Oh, the Purs compiler will replace tail recursive calls with while loops.

5:30pm. Let me stop here for the day at section 5.8. It is not that I can't do anymore, but the tedium is getting to me. I'll finish the book tomorrow.

It is really extremely easy. Hopefully the more hands on stuff will catch my interest.

5:35pm. Let me review.

Today's morning was definitely the most significant. I had not expected I would figure out the stack bug so easily nor that I would get Hie operational. Nor that the REPL plugin would fail me on the Purs compiler.

It was quite eventful. But now I finally have the platform from which to study.

On the Purescript side for the past few hours, I figured out how the plugin works and how to compile simple Purs projects. I did my first step into the Purescript world.

5:45pm. I think that I stopped my studies of the `vscode-languageserver-node` too early. Ok, so the server is a mess, but I am going to have to through it more in depth. At the very least, I am going to have to study the client.

Once I am done with all of this a few months down the road, I am going to have to pick it up again and this time finish it. But that can wait.

...

Honestly, nobody told me that Purescript was only 20k. F# for example is over an order of magnitude larger than that. Compiler sizes can be all over the place and you can't really assume it seems.

Purescript is perfect. It fixes Haskell's main weaknesses by having tooling and strict evaluation. And in terms of strengths it has everything I want in a small size (apart from partial evaluation.)

I absolutely must master it. I am going to put in strong effort to do that. Once I get through this, I will have completed the first part of the journey.

I'll return to ML, master those neurochips and just crush all that opposes me. What could be better than that?"

So whoever is behind all this crap whoever stole my money and transferred it and made it look like I bought shut-off websites online game over not to mention that was a federal government issued card you do know what that means right that means whoever did it is going to federal prison. It has nothing to do with me I'm not saying that one word. You dug yourself into that hole. Shouldn't have fooled around with me so I hope it's a good lesson learned because whoever it was and I know who it was I'm just not going to say. I hope you enjoy Federal prison.

wippy umbrella failures don't judge me it's all broken and going to shit

- from my todo notes:
        - don't want to/can't figure this out right but I think Utility Umbrella should be handled similar to ItemBlockerEffect and they can be combined into like some sort of EffectIgnoringEffect where ItemBlocker returns true if invoke is an instance of an item and Utility return true if it's the weather and then those effects will be removed from invoke lists anyways it seems doable but just don't feel like doing it right now so there's a hacky bullshit solution instead woooo
        - actually jk don't have any idea what to do anymore because it seems reallllllyyy shitty to have to pass the weather requester around but it's more than just in the invoke methods weather is checked individually in most places and I don't know what the fuck to do
        - okay looks like we should try out putting a getWeather/isWeather method on the attacking Pokemon and go from there also like Idk it doesn't feel great but I think it will just be important to try and enforce not being able to get the weather another way... also this change is probably too big to want to include with the rest of the items so let's try and put this in a separate branch or something

- but yeah basically this is all going to shit and I'm not happy so gonna commit this wippy stuff to a separate branch and gtfo for now
- there's basically some setup stuff here for the new premise of getting the weather status from the relevant Pokemon (but is not implemented) and it also contains the remnants of the original kind of hacky but completely insufficient way of just checking at the time of invoke effect list creation (problem is weather is most often checked directly and not through invoke effects)
- there is also some setup for test things basically when I sort of get to this point I would normally just revert everything and start over and I know there's not a lot of test things set up so far but like I don't want to write that framework type stuff again ANYWAYS THIS IS SUPER WIP DON'T JUDGE ME
