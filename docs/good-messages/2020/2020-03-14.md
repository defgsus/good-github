wippy umbrella failures don't judge me it's all broken and going to shit

- from my todo notes:
        - don't want to/can't figure this out right but I think Utility Umbrella should be handled similar to ItemBlockerEffect and they can be combined into like some sort of EffectIgnoringEffect where ItemBlocker returns true if invoke is an instance of an item and Utility return true if it's the weather and then those effects will be removed from invoke lists anyways it seems doable but just don't feel like doing it right now so there's a hacky bullshit solution instead woooo
        - actually jk don't have any idea what to do anymore because it seems reallllllyyy shitty to have to pass the weather requester around but it's more than just in the invoke methods weather is checked individually in most places and I don't know what the fuck to do
        - okay looks like we should try out putting a getWeather/isWeather method on the attacking Pokemon and go from there also like Idk it doesn't feel great but I think it will just be important to try and enforce not being able to get the weather another way... also this change is probably too big to want to include with the rest of the items so let's try and put this in a separate branch or something

- but yeah basically this is all going to shit and I'm not happy so gonna commit this wippy stuff to a separate branch and gtfo for now
- there's basically some setup stuff here for the new premise of getting the weather status from the relevant Pokemon (but is not implemented) and it also contains the remnants of the original kind of hacky but completely insufficient way of just checking at the time of invoke effect list creation (problem is weather is most often checked directly and not through invoke effects)
- there is also some setup for test things basically when I sort of get to this point I would normally just revert everything and start over and I know there's not a lot of test things set up so far but like I don't want to write that framework type stuff again ANYWAYS THIS IS SUPER WIP DON'T JUDGE ME

wow lots of tests wow

- WeatherChangedEffect no longer passes the weather that was changed to (you can just figure it out your fucking self with the battle)
- Ice Face is now affected by Utility Umbrella (at first I was like hm yeah that's strange they don't interact I guess I'll just leave it like that BUT THEN I REMEMBERED that it's likely not an exception at all because the game weirdly only works with sun and rain for the umbrella even with it's super vague description and I changed that to all weather so Ice Face no longer restores in hail now with umbrella)
- Utility Umbrella no longer allows buffet damage from hail and sandstorm (see above rant for the same explanation)
- Not sure why I decided before to change Shore Up and Floral Healing to fully heal in Sandstorm/Grassy Terrain in the past but I reverted that back to 2/3 (instead of 1/2)
- added a new FAKE FREEZER move for testing which I have definitely considered before which is basically just there to consistently apply freezing status
- fixed the new bug with Air Lock not being able to remove weather conditions naturally (was always decrementing Clear Skies so weather was not being removed)
- Sand Veil, Sand Rush, Slush Rush, and Snow Cloak abilities were previously still allowing buffet damage from sandstorm or hail and now they don't
- added a bunch of tests for buffet damage from hail and sandstorm in EffectTest
- moved most logic from testInfo.statModifierTest to new assertStatModifier method on TestPokemon
- oh and also lots of utility umbrella tests for like every possible weather condition and effect
