Try to appease MSVC even more elaborately in the alignment hacking space.

MSVC doesn't support passing by-value parameters with alignment of
16-bytes or higher apparantly. What is deeply confusing is that it seems
to *sometimes* (but not always) apply this to any type whose alignment
is set using __declspec(align(...)). This caused lots of errors when we switch
SmallVector over to use the automatically aligned character array
utilities as they used __declspec(align(...)) heavily.

As a pretty horrible but effective work-around, we instead cherry pick
the smallest alignment sizes with specific types that happen to have the
correct alignment, and then fall back to the attribute solution past
them. This should resolve the MSVC build errors folks have been hitting.
Sorry for that. In good news, it will do this without introducing other
UB I hope. =]

Thanks to Timur Iskhodzhanov for helping me test this!

Introduce a new SROA implementation.

This is essentially a ground up re-think of the SROA pass in LLVM. It
was initially inspired by a few problems with the existing pass:
- It is subject to the bane of my existence in optimizations: arbitrary
  thresholds.
- It is overly conservative about which constructs can be split and
  promoted.
- The vector value replacement aspect is separated from the splitting
  logic, missing many opportunities where splitting and vector value
  formation can work together.
- The splitting is entirely based around the underlying type of the
  alloca, despite this type often having little to do with the reality
  of how that memory is used. This is especially prevelant with unions
  and base classes where we tail-pack derived members.
- When splitting fails (often due to the thresholds), the vector value
  replacement (again because it is separate) can kick in for
  preposterous cases where we simply should have split the value. This
  results in forming i1024 and i2048 integer "bit vectors" that
  tremendously slow down subsequnet IR optimizations (due to large
  APInts) and impede the backend's lowering.

The new design takes an approach that fundamentally is not susceptible
to many of these problems. It is the result of a discusison between
myself and Duncan Sands over IRC about how to premptively avoid these
types of problems and how to do SROA in a more principled way. Since
then, it has evolved and grown, but this remains an important aspect: it
fixes real world problems with the SROA process today.

First, the transform of SROA actually has little to do with replacement.
It has more to do with splitting. The goal is to take an aggregate
alloca and form a composition of scalar allocas which can replace it and
will be most suitable to the eventual replacement by scalar SSA values.
The actual replacement is performed by mem2reg (and in the future
SSAUpdater).

The splitting is divided into four phases. The first phase is an
analysis of the uses of the alloca. This phase recursively walks uses,
building up a dense datastructure representing the ranges of the
alloca's memory actually used and checking for uses which inhibit any
aspects of the transform such as the escape of a pointer.

Once we have a mapping of the ranges of the alloca used by individual
operations, we compute a partitioning of the used ranges. Some uses are
inherently splittable (such as memcpy and memset), while scalar uses are
not splittable. The goal is to build a partitioning that has the minimum
number of splits while placing each unsplittable use in its own
partition. Overlapping unsplittable uses belong to the same partition.
This is the target split of the aggregate alloca, and it maximizes the
number of scalar accesses which become accesses to their own alloca and
candidates for promotion.

Third, we re-walk the uses of the alloca and assign each specific memory
access to all the partitions touched so that we have dense use-lists for
each partition.

Finally, we build a new, smaller alloca for each partition and rewrite
each use of that partition to use the new alloca. During this phase the
pass will also work very hard to transform uses of an alloca into a form
suitable for promotion, including forming vector operations, speculating
loads throguh PHI nodes and selects, etc.

After splitting is complete, each newly refined alloca that is
a candidate for promotion to a scalar SSA value is run through mem2reg.

There are lots of reasonably detailed comments in the source code about
the design and algorithms, and I'm going to be trying to improve them in
subsequent commits to ensure this is well documented, as the new pass is
in many ways more complex than the old one.

Some of this is still a WIP, but the current state is reasonbly stable.
It has passed bootstrap, the nightly test suite, and Duncan has run it
successfully through the ACATS and DragonEgg test suites. That said, it
remains behind a default-off flag until the last few pieces are in
place, and full testing can be done.

Specific areas I'm looking at next:
- Improved comments and some code cleanup from reviews.
- SSAUpdater and enabling this pass inside the CGSCC pass manager.
- Some datastructure tuning and compile-time measurements.
- More aggressive FCA splitting and vector formation.

Many thanks to Duncan Sands for the thorough final review, as well as
Benjamin Kramer for lots of review during the process of writing this
pass, and Daniel Berlin for reviewing the data structures and algorithms
and general theory of the pass. Also, several other people on IRC, over
lunch tables, etc for lots of feedback and advice.

"8:35am. I want to say I am up, but when I first woke up it was quite dark. I probably spent 3h or more in bed thinking. Damn I am exhausted.

8:40am. But I've made a few decisions. A lot of my mental issues are due to the mismatch between the path I want to travel and the one I am on. Eventually though, I am going to wholly commit to the kind of value system that I want. Well, I'll leave that subject for another time.

First of all, let me say a few words about Hopac. I should not be studying it after all. Though it seems that given how the last few days have gone that I have time to spare, and given how much time I wasted chasing dumb things in the last five years, what would be a few months here or there.

But the truth is, everything I've done has always been aligned with my goals. I might have been incompetent in my approach, but even for example 2018 when I was trying out those papers and pestering people, that still had the side goal of developing Spiral. Right now, just dropping everything to study Hopac is not something I have the leeway of doing.

Instead if it is just as important as I say it is, then the chance to study it will come on its own.

8:50am. Remember, I did not want to make Spiral. I want to take the easiest route possible. But the circumstances forced me to. Because I did not want to compromise getting better at programming even a little, it was only a matter of time before the desire to master staged functional programming would be born in me. And since no languages supported such a style, the responsibility on it fell to me.

Right now I am best in the world at this.

Though I can wax poetic about fundamentals, the truth is that Spiral came to me. It was so alluring that I could not disobey the impulse to bring it into reality.

Concurrency on the other hand, what is that? It is not a challenge that I need to take on my own. It used to be a challenge, but it was conquered by Vesa Karvonen.

There will be other challenges too, and I won't begrudge other people if they don't build Spiral from the ground up in order to tackle them. I spent a very long time making it, Spiral will be there to be used.

I won't always have the leeway to do whatever I want.

NetMQ and Hopac I'll study on the side whenever opportunity presents itself. I've studied it in the last few days. It is not diving into-the-source kind of study, but in truth diving into the source is not a good way of learning anything.

Instead having a goal and wanting to accomplish it is the ideal way of learning something in programming. You care about the goal, and not so much about the tool. But that kind of way is ideal for learning about the tool itself.

When the tool is the goal, that is when boredom sets in. And that is the killer of learning.

9am. Given those last two sentences, I am reminded of my time in school. It is amazing I lasted so long.

Yeah, I regret it. Not only can I not live up to my young ideals, my young ideals could not live up to reality. The understanding of self improvement loop that came to me would in the past ages be described as divine inspiration. Though it became my ideal, the other ideals feel stiffed by it. They need to be kicked out rather than crowding in my head.

I'll see how it goes.

9:05am. For concurrency, I am simply going to believe in it.

Yesterday though I spent hours autistically fiddling with that Hopac functions, that is actually the ideal way to build up the structures needed for future memorization in addition to learning the thing being studied.

That was one chance to study. I am just going to believe that other chances will come.

The best way to learn both Hopac and ZeroMQ would not be to drop things and study them academically. Instead it would be to take on a project that requires great skill in concurrency.

Just like GPUs pressured me and in the end forced me to create Spiral, so would such a project force me to do a deep dive into concurrency.

9:10am. That is not going to happen. I can't expect to be good at everything. Competence in functional programming should be a requirement for everyone, but I do not have the leeway to be a true expert in anything more than Spiral.

I am under enormous pressure to perform here. In the last few days I loosen up just for a bit, but the intense burst of thinking reveal that to be a lie.

I absolutely must focus on the challenge in front of me. I've really gotten ambitious thinking I could make 30k per month or 60k per month eventually. I am on a clock here!

I need to absolutely tap into this opportunity in front of me as soon as possible.

And it does not matter how much I make. Even if it is only 1k per month, just get that! Even that much would be enough.

Thinking I have the leeway to start studying things on the side is the height of arrogance. I can't relax, as proven by the tense wakeup I had this morning.

9:15am. I need to play to my strengths. That means Spiral. That means finishing it.

For the kind of task in front of me, I've been thinking for too long how to do it. Today I am going to make a dent in the server.

Let me take my usual morning break for now.

11:10am. It feels bad weather is rolling in. I might have to run if that happens.

11:30am. I have to run.

12:15pm. I am back. Between the weather and myself, I do not know which is more fucked. There were a few loud cracks, but even though it is still pouring the thunder seems to have gone.

I'll have to run again if it comes back, but until then, let me get some work done.

Let me finally start. I want that monthly income even if it kills me. The time spent during the last few days feels like a gaping wound to me now.

This is the right mentality to have. Once I get my foot through the door, I'll be able to breathe a sigh of relief. The desparation is my friend here, urging me on.

```fs
let parser is_top_down req =
    let tokenizer req =
        let lines : LineToken [] ResizeArray = ResizeArray([[||]])
        let mutable errors_tokenization = [||]
        let mutable blocks : Block list = []

        let res_text = Src.create()
        let replace edit =
            errors_tokenization <- Tokenize.replace lines errors_tokenization edit // Mutates the lines array
            blocks <- block_separate lines blocks edit
            Src.value res_text {blocks=blocks; errors=errors_tokenization}

        req |> Stream.consumeJob (function
            | Put text -> replace {|from=0; nearTo=lines.Count; lines=Utils.lines text|}
            | Modify edit -> replace edit
            | GetRange((a,b),res) ->
                let from, near_to = min (lines.Count-1) a.line, min lines.Count (b.line+1)
                vscode_tokens from (lines.GetRange(from,near_to-from |> max 0).ToArray()) |> res
                Job.unit()
            )
        Src.tap res_text

    let parser is_top_down req =
        let dict = System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary(HashIdentity.Reference)
        req |> Stream.keepPreceding1 |> Stream.mapFun (fun (a : TokRes) ->
            let b =
                List.map (fun x -> {
                    parsed = Utils.memoize dict (block_init is_top_down) x.block
                    offset = x.offset
                    }) a.blocks
            dict.Clear(); List.iter2 (fun a b -> dict.Add(a.block,b.parsed)) a.blocks b
            let bundles, parser_errors = block_bundle b
            {bundles = bundles; parser_errors = parser_errors; tokenizer_errors = a.errors}
            )

    let x = tokenizer req in x, parser is_top_down x
```

This is what I did yesterday. This is the right way to do it.

In the option parser I could add interrupts as well, but that would just make things even more complicated. It would not be hard to add them later.

By interrupts I mean sending None's as soon as the parser gets inputs.

Let me do a quick demo.

```fs
    let parser' is_top_down req =
        let dict = System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary(HashIdentity.Reference)
        let res = Src.create()
        let r = Src.tap res
        req |> Stream.keepPreceding1 |> Stream.consumeJob (fun (a : TokRes) ->
            Src.value res None >>= fun () ->
            let b =
                List.map (fun x -> {
                    parsed = Utils.memoize dict (block_init is_top_down) x.block
                    offset = x.offset
                    }) a.blocks
            dict.Clear(); List.iter2 (fun a b -> dict.Add(a.block,b.parsed)) a.blocks b
            let bundles, parser_errors = block_bundle b
            Src.value res (Some {bundles = bundles; parser_errors = parser_errors; tokenizer_errors = a.errors})
            )
        r
```

This is what I meant by interrupts. I'll do the package to package interrupts like this. Pretty much the whole complicated thing in the typecking server is to maximize the degree of concurrency like that.

12:20pm. But it is stupid. It is something an amateur would do. I am doing extremely complicated optimizations without even considering whether I need them.

The inputs to the typechecker is ivar of ivars of list of ivars, something crazy like that. And the return is also 3 nested ivars once again.

That is not good programming. That is an amateur given control of the car.

Forget the interrupts for now.

It is easy to add option types. What I should focus on right now is doing it right initially.

I know I said I would do the package typechecker, but forget that for a bit. Instead of doing the whole thing all at once, how about I first make the whole thing work again.

12:25pm. I botched the design of the typechecker, but if I had done it right from the start, I would not be having troubles adding extra stuff to it.

Streams are powerful. I need to express as much as possible in terms of them.

```fs
let server_typechecking (uri : string) = Job.delay <| fun () ->
    let req = Ch ()

    let rec waiting data = req ^=> extracting data
    and extracting data req' =
        waiting data <|> (IVar.read req' ^=> fun (req' : TypecheckingReq) ->
            let rec loop = function // Does memoization by fetching previous computed values.
                | [], bundle -> List.map (fun _ -> IVar()) bundle
                | (a, ivar) :: a', (b :: b' as bundle) -> if a = b then ivar :: loop (a',b') else loop ([], bundle)
                | _, [] -> []
            let x = loop (data, req'.bundles)
            Hopac.start (IVar.fill req'.res x)
            let x = List.zip req'.bundles x
            processing Infer.default_env x x
            )
    and processing state data = function
        | [] -> waiting data
        | (x,res) :: x' ->
            waiting data <|> Alt.prepareFun (fun () ->
                if res.Full then IVar.read res ^=> fun x -> processing x.top_env data x'
                else
                    let x = bundle x |> infer state
                    Hopac.start (IVar.fill res x)
                    processing x.top_env data x'
                )

    Job.server (waiting []) >>-. req
```

Let me start work on this ridiculous thing.

```fs
    let typechecker (req : ParserRes Stream) =
        let req = Stream.values req
        ()
```

Let me just play with this a bit more. It does not make sense that `values` would throw away the stream values.

12:35pm.

```fs
open Hopac
open Hopac.Infixes
open Hopac.Extensions
open Hopac.Stream

let s = Src.create()
let add a b =
    Hopac.queue (Job.delay (fun () ->
        let rec loop i =
            if i <= b then Src.value s i >>= fun () -> loop (i+1)
            else Job.unit()
        loop a
        ))
let x = Src.tap s |> Stream.values
add 1 10
System.Console.ReadKey()
let y = x
let loop = y >>= fun x -> timeOutMillis 50 >>= fun () -> printfn "%i" x; Job.unit()
Job.foreverServer loop |> Hopac.start
System.Console.ReadKey()
```

Regardless if I do it like the above or...

```fs
let x = Src.tap s
add 1 10
System.Console.ReadKey()
let y = x |> Stream.values
```

I get the same result. It definitely does not depend on when the alternative has been created.

Let me try something else.

```fs
let x = Src.tap s |> Stream.values
add 1 10
System.Console.ReadKey()
let y = x
Job.foreverServer (y >>= fun x -> timeOutMillis 50 >>= fun () -> printf "*%i\n" x; Job.unit()) |> Hopac.start
Job.foreverServer (y >>= fun x -> timeOutMillis 50 >>= fun () -> printf "/%i\n" x; Job.unit()) |> Hopac.start
System.Console.ReadKey()
```

Yes, as expected this prints each element of the stream only once.

```fs
let y = x
Job.foreverServer (Stream.values x >>= fun x -> timeOutMillis 50 >>= fun () -> printf "*%i\n" x; Job.unit()) |> Hopac.start
Job.foreverServer (Stream.values x >>= fun x -> timeOutMillis 50 >>= fun () -> printf "/%i\n" x; Job.unit()) |> Hopac.start
System.Console.ReadKey()
```

This prints each element of the stream twice.

Everything is as expected. I needed this as a sanity check before I start. In the typechecking server I am going to be using values.

12:40pm. ...And it is thunderiiing!!!

Yeah, today is not a day for programming. Let me turn off again."

Unique int node ids; implement #84 dupe node soln

This is notably kinda funky. In particular, it's possible for
dupe edges to compound in weird ways, as shown in the test case.

i think it might also be possible for frayed ropes to infinitely
create new ones...?

I think the way around this is having dupe edges temporarily? keep
track of the pattern that caused them to be created, and disallowing
patterns being constructed where all edges are dupe edges
created from the same pattern.

This would address the most egregious cases, although this would
"break" some things in the sense that the current bubble-finding /
frayed rope finding algorithms assume that chains have already been
collapsed -- so if we have something like

    2
   / \
  1   4
 / \ / \
0   3   6
 \     /
  \-5-/

then it'll get turned into

  7=B=8
 /     \
0       6
 \     /
  \-5-/

... and then this won't get tagged as a bubble, even though it really
should be!!! We could modify the bubble/frayed rope code to check for
chains, though. that would honestly not be too bad, although it might
start to be weirdly inconsistent............. maybe we'd ONLY allow
chains in bubbles when all of the edges in the chain are duplicates?

Or here's a better idea. When we create a chain, if all of the edges
within it are duplicates arising from the same pattern, then we mark
it specifically as a "temporary" chain. This means that, when it would
come time to create a pattern containing this chain, we wouldn't include
the chain itself -- we'd just include the contents of the chain
directly, as if the chain had never existed.
OH, and if we get to the end of the decomposition and the temporary
chain is still around, then we can also just remove the temporary chain
and leave its contents uncollapsed.

We may even be able to remove the duplicate nodes in this case -- since
it'd be clear that they aren't being used for anything meaningful.

Yeah i thiiiink this might be the way forward? i'm uncertain if removing
the duplicate nodes in the tmp-chain-case will be always possible, but
at the very least marking this as a tmp chain and removing it is ok.
ACTUALLY if we mandate that duplicate nodes are ONLY created for
bubbles, then that'll mean that there can only be two duplicate edges
per bubble: so if both are included in a chain then we know for a FACT
that the duplicate edges are useless in this case.

Other poss solutions:

1) disallow starting duplicates to be used as start of another pattern,
   and disallow ending duplicates to be used as end of another pattern
   (would need to keep track of starting vs ending duplicate status, ez)

2) disallow patterns being created where the start and end nodes are
   both duplicates.

both of these two are bad, because there are legitimately useful
   cases where this could happen -- e.g.

    dupe == bubble == bubble == dupe

Chef and Girlfriend 

One day Chef is waiting his girlfriend on the bus station. The girlfriend said that she will be at time1. Chef went to the bus station at time2. When Chef has reached the bus station he realized that he forgot a gift for his better half in his home.
Chef knows that someone can reach his home in dist minutes (his girlfriend also needs dist minutes to get Chef's home after she arrived at the bus station). So, Chef came up with two plans for present the gift:

i. The first one is to wait for his girlfriend at the bus station. And then go to the home together with her. When Chef and his girlfriend will reach the home he will present his gift.

ii. The second one is to call the girlfriend and ask her to go to his home when she will reach the bus station. And after calling he will go to the home, take the gift, and go towards the girlfriend. When they meet each other he will present his gift (they can meet at any position of the road or at the bus station). It's known that girlfriend and Chef uses the same road between bus station and Chef's home.

Please, help Chef to estimate the time in minutes for each of his plans.

Revert "World: do not group broadcasted packets by chunk, broadcast directly instead"

This reverts commit b172c93e45e60ee3dbfd8a2efbede60b894673a3.

I made a significant mistake with this change: the scaling factor of
batch-by-chunk is O(nSendBytes), while the scaling factor of sending
directly to players is O(nSendBytes * nActivePlayers). It seems like the
real problem is that this system isn't getting enough usage.

While it does reduce compression efficiency in some cases, it falls back
to letting the sessions do individual compression when the amount of
data is less than 256 bytes anyway (compression-threshold in
pocketmine.yml).

My motivation for scrapping this system was to reduce the broadcast
system's complexity to make it easier to thread the living shit out of
compression, but it seems like this change was a step in the wrong
direction for performance.

A few steps can be taken to improve the usefulness of this system (and
also improve output bandwidth):
- Make general entity updates use this system. Movement and velocity
  already kinda used this system, but crucially, players did not,
  because we couldn't prevent the player from receiving its own movement
  updates if we did that, which caused all kinds of problems.
  - Therefore, we need to reintroduce static "self" entity IDs, like we
    had in the shoghi days when entity ID 0 referred to the "self"
    player.
  - However, since entity ID 0 has a variety of interesting bugs since
    it usually refers to "no entity" in MCPE, it would be better to use
    1 (or 2, like MiNET does).
  - The fixed ID used should be close to zero to maximize varint
    encoding efficiency.
  - We assumed that changes to player's position and velocity would be
    ignored by the client. This assumption depends on the client and
    could be broken at any time, so it's best not to rely on it.
- Make block updates use this system (when chunk updates are not sent).
  Currently, block updates use a separate mechanism which creates a
  second batch for every active chunk, which wastes CPU, and decreases
  bandwidth efficiency on multiple fronts (reduced compression
  efficiency, more cross-thread interactions, more bytes wasted on
  RakNet packet headers).

Tweak our Copy until it's _just_ right

Let's take an interesting idea, and do it in least surprising way that
we can.

Storing translations outside of `config/locales/en.yml`
---

Under the hood, Rails relies on the [`ruby-i18n/i18n`
gem][ruby-18n/i18n] for determining translations' text. Without any
additional configuration, Rails employs an instance of
`I18n::Backends::SimpleBackend`. In this case, <q>simple</q> is
analogous for reading from the filesystem. The definitions we've
declared thus far have been made in our project's
`config/locales/en.yml`. During the application's boot process, the
`SimpleBackend` reads the contents of that file, parses the YAML into an
instance of a [`Hash`][Hash], and stores it in-memory.

Let's imagine that we'd like to change a key's translation.

> No problem! Let's write a new value to that key in the `Hash`.

This seems appealing at first, but there are some unfortunate quirks to
consider. Since the value is store in-memory, modifications to that
value would be lost on server restarts, and would be inaccessible from
_other_ server processes.

In the world of [horizontally scalable
infrastructure][horizontal-scalability] and [load balancing][], servers
are restarted constantly, and there are no guarantees that subsequent
requests are served by the same [application process][process].

> If the value is stored on the filesystem, let's change the
> contents of the file.

Unfortunately, the `I18n::Backends::SimpleBackend` eager-loads the
contents of the translation file once (and only once) during the
application's boot process, so subsequent changes to the file go
un-read.

Calling `I18n::Backend::SimpleBackend#reload!` re-parses the YAML file,
but any changes would be local to that server process, which runs afoul
of horizontal scalability and load balancing.

> This sounds like a problem for some sort of data persistence layer…

Fortunately, the [ruby-i18n/i18n][] project provides integrations for
alternate backends. [I18n::PostgresJson][] is an `I18n::Backend`
implementation that reads from and writes to [Postgres JSON and JSONB
columns][]:

> [PostgreSQL's][pg] support for storing objects as [JSON and JSONB
> columns][pg-json], integrated with `ActiveRecord` column-aware
> models makes it an ideal candidate to store dynamic, editable

continue to transparently call `translate` in our views, oblivious to

The `Translation` model
---

The `I18n::Backend::Chain` adheres to the same interface as other
`I18n::Backend` classes. Its `store_translations(locale, data,
**options)` implementation adheres to the same order of precedence as
when writing values as its `#translate` method does when reading values.
In our case, a call to `I18n.backend.store_translation` will write to
the `I18n::PostgresJson::Backend` first.

Reading and writing values to and from a database (SQL or otherwise) is
something that Rails (`ActiveModel` and `ActiveRecord`, specifically)
excels at.

This commit introduces the `Translation` class. It's a model class that
_is not_ backed by `ActiveRecord::Base`. The `I18n.backend` instance
provides a means of writing to the correct data source with the exact
structure needed. With this access to this method, there's no value in
interfacing directly with PostgreSQL via `ActiveRecord`. However, there
is value in an `ActiveRecord`-like interface for reading, writing, and
validating attributes. To get the best of both worlds, the `Translation`
class mixes in the [`ActiveModel::Model`][am-model] and
[`ActiveModel::Attributes`][am-attributes] modules.

The data integrity of our translations is crucial. To preserve that
integrity, the `Translation` model declares several `ActiveModel`
validations.

For example, reject `nil` or empty values. Since the PostgresSQL-backed
translations are layer _on top of_ the translations declared in the YAML
file, reject any `Translation#key` value that _does not already exist_
in our set of resolvable keys.

Once deemed valid, calls to `Translation#save` will persist the changes
by invoking `I18n.backend.store_translations` &emdash; with one final
quirk. To keep the scope of our first foray into copyediting tight and
to limit exposure to various Cross-Site Scripting (<abrr

The `TranslationsController` class
---

Backed by our `I18n::Backends::Chain`, our `Translation` class serves as
a Model  (the <abbr title="Model>M</abbr> in Rails'
Model-View-Controller <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>)
paradigm. The remaining two-thirds of the work will be done in our
application's View (the <abbr title="View">V</abbr>) and Controller (the
<abbr title="Controller">C</abbr>) layers.

We'll be managing changes to our Model by responding to HTTP requests
that are routed to our Controllers.

The new `TranslationsController` class draws inspiration from an example
in the [i18n-postgres_json README file][i18n-edit-example] and
transforms `locale`, `key`, and `value` parameters into `Translation`
instances. Once the model instance is constructed, the controller
attempts to update the translation by calling `Translation#save`.

[i18n-edit-example]: https://github.com/seanpdoyle/i18n-postgres_json#writing-to-the-tables

The <abbr title="View">V</abbr> of <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>
---

The final missing piece of the puzzle is our View layer. The `<form>`
element that we construct submits a `POST /translations` request with
all the constituent parts of a `Translation`: its `locale`, `key`, and
`value`.

When passed a block, Rails' `translate` helper [yields the translation
_and_ the fully qualified translation key][translate] as [block
arguments][].

For example, when calling `translate(".hero.title")` with a block from
the `marketings#index` template, the value of the `key` block parameter
is `marketings.index.hero.title`. When we render our translations using
the "lazy" keys, we can access their fully-qualified counterparts
through block arguments.

For calls to `translate` that we want to be able to edit, invoke them as
a call to `editable.translate`. The `editable.translate` helper
delegates to an instance of the `Editable` class, which decorates calls
to `#translate` so that they accept a block.

Within the block, use the fully qualified translation key to construct a
`<form action="/translations" method="post">` element that contains the
`key` encoded as an [`<input type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden].

The submission's `locale` value can be inferred from the [current
request-local value of `I18n.locale`][i18n-locale], and is also encoded
as an [`<input type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden], invisible to
the user.

Ideally, the `<form>` elements for `value` would serve double duty:
presenting an field to edit the translation text when in focus, and
rendering the contents of the translation text otherwise.

Visual parity between those two modes is achievable, but due to the
subtle differences in how CSS rules are applied to certain [Flow Content
elements][flow-content] and [Form-associated Content
elements][form-associated-content], it could become tedious to do so.

Luckily, browser support for the [`[contenteditable]`
attribute][contenteditable] renders controls for editing content in the
same context and styles it's rendered within normally.

Trix-powered Rich Text
---

[Trix is <q cite="https://github.com/basecamp/trix#trix">a Rich Text
Editor for Everyday Writing</q>][trix]. It serves as a progressive
enhancement to `[contenteditable]`, and is a tool under the Ruby on
Rails umbrella [since the introduction of the ActionText portion of the
framework][action-text].

While Trix is a fully-featured, HTML-capable <dfn id="wysiwyg">What you
See is What you Get (<abbr title="What you See is What you
Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>) editor</dfn>, it's utility comes in the form its
ability to edit already styled content in-context.

Under the hood, [calls to `rich_text_area_tag`][rich_text_area_tag]
produce a `<trix-editor>` element along with a corresponding [`<input
type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden] that serves as its form-local
value storage.

On initialization, `<trix-editor>` elements construct their own
`<trix-toolbar>` elements to wrap a set of `<button>` elements that
can modify the `<trix-editor>` selected contents.

In our use case, we _don't_ want to support anything more sophisticated
than plain text, so we add `trix-toolbar`-specific CSS rules to style
those elements with `display: none;`.

<trix-editor>
  * <trix-toolbar>, hide default toolbar with element-level CSS rule
  * inject custom buttons into toolbar with Stimulus Controller
  * hide toolbar when element does not have focus, focus exclusively
    with document-global trix event listeners otherwise
  * reject file uploads

"7:05pm. Outside it is still pouring like a dam broke, but the thunder has stopped. After spending an entire worth of energy, the storm should be pettering out now.

Today is wash. I spent all this time in bed.

Just now I had a few ideas. I realized that even without Hopac, that I could emulate most of what it offers for my use case using `Observable`s and `Agent`s. Even I am transported and those aren't there yet on the .NET, I could make do using concurrent queues. Lightweight threads would be a problem though, but if I got trucked that far, hopefully I'd also have time to figure that.

Hopac on the other hand I have no idea how I would reimplement in a time travelling mishap. In the 00s things would be manageable, but the 90s the processors were single core. Maybe I'd have to do my own editor in that era - or I'd pick something like Emacs to save time.

7:15pm. Right now the Singularity is near, but 20-30 years extra would pretty much cement my victory. It seems even though I started as early as 2015, that will still be a tight fit. I am going to have to economize my time.

Forget studying Hopac. It is just like I said, I need to do what I can with the goals ahead of me.

7:20pm. Though I had the whole day to do it, I am still thinking about things.

Even though I could do it using observables and agents, Hopac is the best tool for the job right now. Since I have it, I should use it. I'll use the benefits of living in 2020 as much as I can. That is the way to go.

Ok...

Now, I will add one more principle to the mix - forget about taking advantage of the laziness of Hopac streams. That is one thing that seems like it will hinder me.

Today it was a surprise to me that I could do everything with observables and agents, but that just shows how I am inexperienced I am at this. Every step I need to make seems to require huge effort."

delegates to an instance of the `Editable` class, which decorates calls
to `#translate` so that they accept a block.

Within the block, use the fully qualified translation key to construct a
`<form action="/translations" method="post">` element that contains the
`key` encoded as an [`<input type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden].

The submission's `locale` value can be inferred from the [current
request-local value of `I18n.locale`][i18n-locale], and is also encoded
as an [`<input type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden], invisible to
the user.

Ideally, the `<form>` elements for `value` would serve double duty:
presenting an field to edit the translation text when in focus, and
rendering the contents of the translation text otherwise.

Visual parity between those two modes is achievable, but due to the
subtle differences in how CSS rules are applied to certain [Flow Content
elements][flow-content] and [Form-associated Content
elements][form-associated-content], it could become tedious to do so.

Luckily, browser support for the [`[contenteditable]`
attribute][contenteditable] renders controls for editing content in the
same context and styles it's rendered within normally.

Trix-powered Rich Text
---

[Trix is <q cite="https://github.com/basecamp/trix#trix">a Rich Text
Editor for Everyday Writing</q>][trix]. It serves as a progressive
enhancement to `[contenteditable]`, and is a tool under the Ruby on
Rails umbrella [since the introduction of the ActionText portion of the
framework][action-text].

While Trix is a fully-featured, HTML-capable <dfn id="wysiwyg">What you
See is What you Get (<abbr title="What you See is What you
Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>) editor</dfn>, it's utility comes in the form its
ability to edit already styled content in-context.

Under the hood, [calls to `rich_text_area_tag`][rich_text_area_tag]
produce a `<trix-editor>` element along with a corresponding [`<input
type="hidden">` element][mdn-input-hidden] that serves as its form-local
value storage.

On initialization, `<trix-editor>` elements construct their own
`<trix-toolbar>` elements to wrap a collection of `<button>` elements
that are wired-up to modify the `<trix-editor>` selected contents.

In our use case, we _don't_ want to support anything more sophisticated
than plain text, so we add `trix-toolbar`-specific CSS rules to style
those elements with `display: none;`.

It's important that we don't _entirely_ disable the `<trix-toolbar>`
element, since there are two custom actions we'd like to support:
canceling an edit and saving an edit. To implement these actions, we'll
declare the `<button>` elements in the [`translations/form` partial's
HTML](#app/views/translations/_form.html.erb) as descendants of the
`<trix-toolbar>` element, and ensure that the `<trix-editor
toolbar="...">` attribute references the `<trix-toolbar id="...">`
attribute. On the initial page load, ensure the toolbar is hidden by
declaring it with the [`[hidden]` attribute][hidden].

To handle interactions withing the `<trix-editor>` element and its
`<trix-toolbar>`, declare the [`trix-form` Stimulus
Controller](#app/javascript/controllers/trix_form_controller.js), and
ensure that our [`<form>` element declares it as part of its
`[data-controller="trix-form"]` attribute][data-controller].

When [the controller attaches behavior to the `<form>`
element][connect], ensure that the `<trix-toolbar>` is visually hidden
by ensuring it declares [`hidden = true`][hidden-property].

To declare the rest of its behavior, build the `<form>` element with
various [Stimulus-specific `data-action` values][data-action]:

```diff
--- /dev/null
+++ b/app/views/translations/_form.html.erb
@@ -0,0 +1,44 @@
+<%= form_with model: translation, class: "relative", data: {
+  controller: "trix-form",
+  action: "
+    trix-file-accept->trix-form#reject
+    trix-focus@document->trix-form#dismissDismissUnlessFocused
+    click@document->trix-form#dismissUnlessContained
+    focusout->trix-form#dismissUnlessContained
+    reset->trix-form#dismiss
+  "
+} do |form| %>
```

Each line routes a DOM event to an action declared in the `trix-form`
controller:

```diff
+    trix-focus@document->trix-form#dismissDismissUnlessFocused
```

The `@document` portion of the action routing declaration declares a
[`trix-focus` event listener][trix-focus] on the `document`, instead of
the `<form>` element. This means that whenever any of the
`<trix-editor>` elements receive focus, _all_ of the `trix-form`
controllers will respond to the event. This means that we can hide all
the `trix-toolbar` elements _except for the editor with focus_ within a
single action declaration.

```diff
+    trix-file-accept->trix-form#reject
```

This `trix-file-accept` event listener routes events to an action that
invokes [`event.preventDefault()`][preventDefault], effectively
cancelling any file attachment attempts.

The other routing declarations will dismiss the toolbar when the
`<form>` element is reset (via the `reset` event), focus
leaves the editor (via the `focusout` event), or a mouse `click` event
fires anywhere outside of the `<trix-editor>` or `<trix-toolbar>`
element.

Testing the interactions
---

For each concept introduced here (i.e. the `Translation` class, the
`TranslationsController` class, the `translations/form` view partial,
and the Trix editor integration) is tested in turn at its corresponding
layer of the [Testing Pyramid][]:

![The Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/testPyramid.png)

The `Translation` model is covered by a unit test, the
`TranslationsController` is covered by a [service-level integration
test][ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest], and the `translations/form` view
partial and the rest of the Trix behavior is covered by an [end-to-end
System Test][System Test].

In order to ensure that each test is run with test-specific data, the
`#with_translations` test helper accepts a set of translations and a
block, and ensures that those translations are only available _within
the block's scope of execution_.

[Testing Pyramid]: https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid

Our progress so far

I wonder, what would it take to edit HTML translations?
