Bug 1665455 - Animate the Skeleton UI r=agashlin

For a better user experience during slow startups (and to match the design
by Markus Jaritz), we want to animate the placeholder elements (the grey
rectangles which hold the place of text and icons) with a light moving
gradient.

A question may arise regarding whether the performance cost of running this
animation is worth the improved user experience. My claim is yes, hinging
mostly on the observation that the performance cost is small.

On my machine, one frame of the animation takes at most 0.15ms, and runs
every 16.15ms. This means we eat less than 1% CPU time on one core of the
system. It should also be noted that this animation runs primarily during
the window wherein we are prefetching dlls, AKA while we are blocked on IO
and the CPU is more likely to be idle.

On slower systems, one frame may take longer - however, on slower systems
we should also be blocked *more* by IO, making the trade favorable.

For further anecdotal evidence of this being okay, when I run this on slow
reference hardware shortly after OS startup, I do not see any dropped frames,
indicating that this has very little trouble completing, and is thus quite
cheap.

Regarding testing, I will invoke the same logic as for the rest of the
skeleton UI patches - it would involve quite a bit of work to test this in
automation given our existing frameworks. It may be worth it at some point,
but certainly not while this is a feature that we are just experimenting
with and which is not enabled by default.

Now you can assign tasks

I fucken did it, Hell yeah bitcheeeeesss. There is a small bug (you can place more than one task in the same slot) but other than that it works deliciously

version 1.01 Release.

Fobs, Intel updates, Changes to the handling of some DCS-TCP link items.  Adjustment of AI responses to threats. Etc. There's a lot...

- Reenabled Blue Air AI Cap items.
- Added Some Dynamic Spawns that happen if Blue takes Red Bases.
- Added a number of new slots for Heli's
- Added 4 new slots at Kish for A10's.

Persia Aflame Version 1.01
"FOBS R US" Update.

Dan's Discount Military Hardware has recently found an abundance of farp pads and at the low low cost of $$$$$$$ from you to him, has arranged for the installation of many in the persian gulf.. more specifically IRAN!

That's right, Dan's quality engineers hired from Hercules Merow Construction for the low low cost of a few grams of KatNip have pilled their kitty litter and cat shit up into nice new pads that you can now fight over..

Doing so will:
A. Unlock UH1 and KA50 slots.
B. Unlock the ability to rearm and refuel at these locations.....

it does not add Logistics to the places and Until I add every one of these damned slots to CTLD (I'm doing that after this post......... god help me.. I was only 19 once.. 20 years ago)..  You'll be able to if you bring a damned FOB with you when you capture them.. pick up ctld shit as well.

Patch Notes:

1. about 8 or so new FARPs added ot he map.
2. about 24 - 48 new heli slots added.. I ain't in the mood to do math.
3. Bunch of units and code to support the above.

Marker points for the new FOBs showing owner/location.
New FOB's sent to the Webmap as Airfields.
- Intel will now give you a time stamp for WHEN it was created on the marker point.
- Troops Dropped by GM now can show up as part of the intel dump for SCUD, ARTY, ARMY sites making at least getting base info on them easier.
