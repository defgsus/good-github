Colorscheme -> sorcerer and popups and ...

Visuals
==============
Sorcerer scheme looks a lot better to my eyes. I have been looking for a
pure black background theme for a while now and suddenly today I
stumbled upon [puremourning](https://github.com/puremourning)'s choice:
apprentice.
(https://git--hub.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe/issues/3667#issuecomment-623003745)
Digging further, apprentice was a modified version of sorcerer and
I just loved sorcerer at the first glance.

I've disabled cursorline to highlight entire line. It just didn't make
sense and also used to mess up the syntax highlighting at the current
line. Now it rather highlights only the `:number` and it's way better.

Airline now uses `bubblegum` because yellow yellow dirty fellow, blue
blue by favourite glue.

YCM
======
YCM again proved to be the best plugin available. So many features.
We've recently got `popups` in vim and they're amazing ! Now YCM
utilizes them to show semantics help. It's way cooler and visually no
less than an IDE.

I've edited my ~/.ycm_extra_conf to be make more sense for now. It's
useful for only python on my system. I'd grow it as required.
ycm_extra_conf:

```
def Settings( **kwargs ):
  client_data = kwargs[ 'client_data' ]
  return {
    'interpreter_path': client_data[ 'g:ycm_python_interpreter_path' ],
    'sys_path': client_data[ 'g:ycm_python_sys_path' ]
  }
```
Now all imported modules in python are recognized in YCM completion.

YCM now brings `hover` feature, it shows documentation about the token
under cursor if idle for >4s. It's AWESOME!

Misc
==========
Error navigation is easier in ALE now. C-n and C-b are for next and
previous items in loclist and <F9> toggles the loclist.

Errors, now no longer bring an earthquack in a sudden appearing loclist
but are simply marked on the relevant line. To view errors use <F9> or
navigate using C-n C-b
