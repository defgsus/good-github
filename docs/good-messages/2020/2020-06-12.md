Update and obosolete motes of artifice

* With thanks to Kenan for sending me fixed versions of the items,
corrects the issues with JSON changes to lockpicking items.
* However, moved them to obsolete.json since Magic Sign: Opening and its
Arcane Blessing counterpart have used ter-transform for a while, and I
kinda forgot to move these to the obsolete file. Keeping them for now in
case of old saves.

More Tinkers' Materials: v1.3.0.6-1.12.2

+ Added more materials to be compatable with Tinkers' Construct

+ + Brightsteel, Reforged Gold, Magic, Mithril, Mortium, Mysterious, Mystic, Sky Iron, Terrium, Vividium, Extranetium

- - Balanced these materials

+ Added 2 new modifiers for Tinkers' Construct

+ + Ameliorating - when dealing damage to living creatures, you are granted regeneration for a few seconds

+ + God of Thunder - strikes lightning onto the ground in front of you where your enemy is (or was), deals damage to everything nearby, including you, and including fire

+ Added tool mining levels for Tinker's Construct including the proper colors (this may be auto-compatable with WAILA, but if not it will be added there soon)

+ Added texture for upcoming alloy, Dream, a mixture between Manyullyn and Magic (which will only be accessable when Tinkers' Construct is installed). Will be alloyable in both the Smeltery and the Alloy Furnace.

+ Re-added the machines to the Creative Tabs

+ Cleanup a lot of code related to GUIs to make it easier for me to manage everything and, in theory, a lot easier for someone to make a mod extension (which, while encouraged, would be very difficult right now because there is no API or easy utils).

Known Bugs:

- Missing textures for 2 armor sets, stone gear, and block forms of the liquids

Notes:

- Please report any bugs found in these Alpha Versions so I can fix them, any crashes please include the crash report.

Enjoy :)
