mm: ratelimit PFNs busy info message

commit 75dddef32514f7aa58930bde6a1263253bc3d4ba upstream.

The RDMA subsystem can generate several thousand of these messages per
second eventually leading to a kernel crash.  Ratelimit these messages
to prevent this crash.

Doug said:
 "I've been carrying a version of this for several kernel versions. I
  don't remember when they started, but we have one (and only one) class
  of machines: Dell PE R730xd, that generate these errors. When it
  happens, without a rate limit, we get rcu timeouts and kernel oopses.
  With the rate limit, we just get a lot of annoying kernel messages but
  the machine continues on, recovers, and eventually the memory
  operations all succeed"

And:
 "> Well... why are all these EBUSY's occurring? It sounds inefficient
  > (at least) but if it is expected, normal and unavoidable then
  > perhaps we should just remove that message altogether?

  I don't have an answer to that question. To be honest, I haven't
  looked real hard. We never had this at all, then it started out of the
  blue, but only on our Dell 730xd machines (and it hits all of them),
  but no other classes or brands of machines. And we have our 730xd
  machines loaded up with different brands and models of cards (for
  instance one dedicated to mlx4 hardware, one for qib, one for mlx5, an
  ocrdma/cxgb4 combo, etc), so the fact that it hit all of the machines
  meant it wasn't tied to any particular brand/model of RDMA hardware.
  To me, it always smelled of a hardware oddity specific to maybe the
  CPUs or mainboard chipsets in these machines, so given that I'm not an
  mm expert anyway, I never chased it down.

  A few other relevant details: it showed up somewhere around 4.8/4.9 or
  thereabouts. It never happened before, but the prinkt has been there
  since the 3.18 days, so possibly the test to trigger this message was
  changed, or something else in the allocator changed such that the
  situation started happening on these machines?

  And, like I said, it is specific to our 730xd machines (but they are
  all identical, so that could mean it's something like their specific
  ram configuration is causing the allocator to hit this on these
  machine but not on other machines in the cluster, I don't want to say
  it's necessarily the model of chipset or CPU, there are other bits of
  identicalness between these machines)"

"8:10am. I hope nobody answered the SO question from yesterday, because I've figured it out. The reason why you need two channels is to force the users to go through the server. You'd be able to tell what the problem with using just a single channel is if you removed the server entirely.

...Nobody answered it, great. Let me try my hypothesis.

8:25am. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62327130/why-are-two-bidirectional-channels-needed-to-implement-the-server-protocol-for-a/62338633#62338633

I did it. Great.

```fs
let cell x =
    let c = Ch ()
    Job.start (put c x) >>-. c
```

I wonder why this `Job.start` is needed here?

...Is it because it blocks the main thread otherwise? That could be it.

```
module HopacExample2

open System
open Hopac
open Hopac.Infixes

let get c = Ch.take c
let put c (x: 'a) = Ch.give c x

run <| job {
    let c = Ch ()
    let print () = Job.start (get c >>- fun i -> printf "%i\n" i)
    let put i = Job.start (put c i)
    for i=1 to 6 do
        do! print()
        do! put i
    }

Console.ReadKey()
```

That has to be it. Yeah, I get it.

8:35am. I am quite pleased that I managed to figure it out on my own. The answer came to me in the morning as soon as I woke up. That this is happening gives me hope.

Let me do my usual morning reading and then I'll start after that. The plan is to both study Reppy's book and prototype the language server side by side. To start things off, I think I will study even though I really should be prototyping."

[READY] Adds Medical Wounds: Bamboo Bones and the Skin of Your Teeth (#50558)

About The Pull Request

This PR adds medical wounds, new forms of injuries that people can suffer that cause debilitation and complications, and often require more than what can be found in a medkit to treat. But let's be honest, big complicated walls of text about medical changes make people's eyes glaze over easily- so I created a handy infograph to explain the basics!

Also there's a full guide here!

dreamseeker_2020-04-18_20-42-19.png

The infograph may not be fully up to date with the specifics of the PR's status, but it'll be updated along with major changes so people have something to use as a crash course for familiarizing themselves with how wounds function. I also have another infograph with all 9 of the possible initial wounds coming, and will be up soon. You can also find the longform design doc here with more info on the broad details, including descriptions of treatments: hackmd whee
What this does

There's a lot to cover, but here's the bullet points of the main features and changes:

    Getting lots of damage on a limb can result in wounds, with more damage causing worse wounds. These can range from dislocated joints and minor cuts to compound fractures and fourth degree burns, and can affect you in different ways depending on what bodypart they're applied to (namely with broken bones).
    You can damage individual bodyparts on clothing (only jumpsuits for now) through the use of lasers and sharp weapons. Bodyparts that reach max damage are considered "shredded" and will not apply any protection for that zone until it is repaired with cloth. If all zones are disabled, the entire piece of clothing is shredded and unwearable until repaired with 3 cloth. Jumpsuits give a small amount of wound protection, and since sharp weapons and lasers generally get extra wound bonuses against bare flesh, even a plain jumpsuit provides decent protection from a few laser shots or scalpel stabs.
    Lasers gain a powerful niche versus unarmored/lightly armored carbons! As noted above, lasers can shred clothing and burn away zones of jumpsuits in 2 shots each, after which the target's bare flesh is exposed (barring other clothing), and lasers excel at dealing burn wounds against uncovered skin. Think big, nasty charring!
    Bleeding is now totally limb based, and gauze is as well. Bleeding is also 95% cut wound based, meaning sharp weapons make you bleed rather than just having 40+ brute on a limb.
    The more wounds and damage you get on a bodypart, the easier it'll be to gain more severe wounds. Wounds are arranged from Moderate, to Severe, to Critical in increasing severity, and you'll generally have to suffer the lesser ones before getting the worse ones.

Above: Scars from healed wounds

ShareX_2020-05-15_06-55-20.png
Above: Actual combat involving someone's head getting cracked

Here's a quick, if non-exhaustive, list of things I have left to do before I consider it feature complete

Finish adding treatments for each wound type/severity (mostly surgeries/triage for critical wounds)
Add second winds for bad injuries to give the victim a chance to get away
Flesh out severe & critical injuries in general
Find sprites for the bonesetter, bone gel, and anything else that might be needed
Add the medical items for treating the less severe wounds to the station
Polish code and remove any redundancies I left behind

    Quick balance pass to make sure nothing is horribly abuseable

Why It's Good For The Game

Adds a flexible new system for representing damage on carbons with injuries that can be treated in different ways. Moderate wounds from getting toolboxed or sliced with a scalpel can usually be treated by a buddy or even by yourself with the right tools, but getting flayed with a fireaxe or a laser gun emptied into your bare skin may require extra attention or even surgery in bad cases! Also makes laser guns cooler and more like 40k lasguns that can flash fry people (cool!)

This should also make spessmen more resilient and harder to kill outright, while still adding consequences and complications to getting hurt. Wounds aren't immediately fatal, but they can do things like slow down interactions, deal damage over time through infections, and generally make you more fragile until fixed. They can also give you a "second wind" on being applied that gives you a small adrenaline boost (or whatever) to help disengage and escape immediate danger.
Changelog

ðŸ†‘ Ryll/Shaps
add: Introduces medical wounds, new injuries that can happen to fleshy carbons when they sustain lots of damage on a bodypart. There's quite a lot of change here, but you can read the guide at: https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Guide_to_wounds and an extended changelog is available here: https://hackmd.io/l_FI9b3tSqa_woDadewJXA
add: Introduces scars and temporal scarring! Healing a wound leaves a scar behind that can be seen by examining someone twice rapidly, and if Temporal Scarring is enabled in character prefs, surviving a round with scars will save them to be granted at roundstart another round! Let your body tell stories!
tweak: Bleeding is now fully bodypart-focused, and 95% of bleeding comes from cut wounds from sharp weapons. Gauze is applied on a limb-by-limb basis, and helps staunch bloodflow rather than totally stop it. Notably, you no longer bleed just from having 40+ brute damage on a limb.
del: Organic bodyparts are no longer disabled at maximum damage, but are easier to cause wounds to
add: O2 medkits in emergency lockers have been replaced with new emergency medkits with basic tools for diagnosing and treating wounds and basic damage
tweak: Herapin now rapidly increases bleeding on all open cuts, rather than causing bleeding by itself. The more cuts on the target, the more it will affect them.
tweak: Neckgrab table slams now hit the targeted limb rather than just the head, with a large chance to dislocate or break a bone
tweak: Sharp weapons and burning weapons can now shred zones on jumpsuits, disabling protection on that limb. Damaged clothes can be repaired with cloth.
tweak: Slaughter demons now deal less raw damage, but gain the ability to cause cut wounds, which becomes more powerful with each attack on a humanoid but resets when bloodcrawling.

Fix loading levels saved with 2.2 or earlier

2.2 and earlier had this god-awful thing where it put the closing tag of
an edentity onto the next line, and then kept the indentation the same.
This requires parsing the XML in an extremely specific way (i.e.
ignoring the whitespace) so the newline and indentation isn't taken as
part of the actual contents of the tag.

2.3 removed this awful whitespace entirely to make it easier on parsers.
When I tested #270, I tested against a 2.3 re-save of Dimension Open and
diffed the two, because I thought testing against the original version
of the level would result in a bunch of noise I didn't want due to the
whitespace change. Well, I did exactly what I intended, and ended up
ignoring the whitespace change so much that levels saved in this stupid
format ended up getting broken.

Luckily, we can just tell TinyXML-2 to parse a document exactly like how
TinyXML-1 would've parsed it, by supplying the COLLAPSE_WHITESPACE enum
to it (by default it's on PRESERVE_WHITESPACE).

More Tinkers' Materials: v1.3.0.6-1.12.2

+ Added more materials to be compatable with Tinkers' Construct

+ + Brightsteel, Reforged Gold, Magic, Mithril, Mortium, Mysterious, Mystic, Sky Iron, Terrium, Vividium, Extranetium

- - Balanced these materials

+ Added 2 new modifiers for Tinkers' Construct

+ + Ameliorating - when dealing damage to living creatures, you are granted regeneration for a few seconds

+ + God of Thunder - strikes lightning onto the ground in front of you where your enemy is (or was), deals damage to everything nearby, including you, and including fire

+ Added tool mining levels for Tinker's Construct including the proper colors (this may be auto-compatable with WAILA, but if not it will be added there soon)

+ Added texture for upcoming alloy, Dream, a mixture between Manyullyn and Magic (which will only be accessable when Tinkers' Construct is installed). Will be alloyable in both the Smeltery and the Alloy Furnace.

+ Re-added the machines to the Creative Tabs

+ Cleanup a lot of code related to GUIs to make it easier for me to manage everything and, in theory, a lot easier for someone to make a mod extension (which, while encouraged, would be very difficult right now because there is no API or easy utils).

Known Bugs:

- Missing textures for 2 armor sets, stone gear, and block forms of the liquids

Notes:

- Please report any bugs found in these Alpha Versions so I can fix them, any crashes please include the crash report.

Enjoy :)
