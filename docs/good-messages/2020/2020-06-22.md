Slightly improved

Now clicking on a folder will restart the browser in that folder. I know that's hacky as sin, but this browser needs replacing anyhow.
Oh yeah, and now it fills the whole screen if you're not using a 51x19 resolution.

Revert "kernel/printk: add kmsg SEEK_CUR handling"

This reverts commit 8ece3b3eb576a78d2e67ad4c3a80a39fa6708809.

This commit broke userspace. Bash uses ESPIPE to determine whether or
not the file should be read using "unbuffered I/O", which means reading
1 byte at a time instead of 128 bytes at a time. I used to use bash to
read through kmsg in a really quite nasty way:

    while read -t 0.1 -r line 2>/dev/null || [[ $? -ne 142 ]]; do
       echo "SARU $line"
    done < /dev/kmsg

This will show all lines that can fit into the 128 byte buffer, and skip
lines that don't. That's pretty awful, but at least it worked.

With this change, bash now tries to do 1-byte reads, which means it
skips all the lines, which is worse than before.

Now, I don't really care very much about this, and I'm already look for
a workaround. But I did just spend an hour trying to figure out why my
scripts were broken. Either way, it makes no difference to me personally
whether this is reverted, but it might be something to consider. If you
declare that "trying to read /dev/kmsg with bash is terminally stupid
anyway," I might be inclined to agree with you. But do note that bash
uses lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR)==>ESPIPE to determine whether or not it's
reading from a pipe.

Create README.md

<!-- NOTES on my dim sum project -->
<!-- I began with this project https://betweenbrackets.github.io/recipe-card-static-page/ -->
<!-- and redesigned it to this project to express and manifest my deep love of and faith in all things dim sum. Nom! Nom!-->
<!-- I updated the pallette, the images, and the text. -->
<!-- 1st issue: the dim sum recipes were longer than the previous recipes and exceeded the styling: there was no white background, just gray text on the pale yellow background. -->
<!-- I updated the style rules to address this. -->
<!-- 2nd issue: I updated the styles so that the recipes' overflow scrolled, but did not like the clunky user-side experience. -->
<!-- I updated to an overlay after searching for what might be available in hover, display: block, and display: none. I discovered w3schools how to. What a great find!-->
<!-- 3rd issue: the overlay called only the first recipe. -->
<!-- I updated the id = "overlay", the functions, and the styles to be dish specific. -->
<!-- 4th issue: the overlay for steamed pork buns exceeded the browser due to the length of the directions. -->
<!-- I added a height property to the styles to enable a scroll bar. -->
