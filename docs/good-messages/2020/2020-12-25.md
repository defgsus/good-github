If you're reading this, I hope you're having at least a decent 3rd weekend of December. Hopefully next year won't be such a trashfire. #miracles ; Thanks to all the people who have helped make this year be not a _complete_ clusterfuck; small update. more backlog clearing. Next will hopefully be exec/evasion cleanup, then the redteam page and adding actual 'team' content to it. Shoutout agin to S for the much appreciated criticism. Here's to hoping for no new pandemics/genocides/wars/complete collapse of society for at least the next year. #smallmiracles

Upgrade to wxPython 4.1

Upgrading for a few reasons:
 - Allows us to drop the PNG optimization step before running a wizard.
   Note that I kept pngcrush around - it's stuck in our history either
   way, so I'd rather put it to use by adding an option for optimizing
   PNGs to BAIN projects.
 - Allows us to add high DPI support (ref #555).
 - Keeping up with breaking wx changes is a good idea (e.g. the
   alignment flags change).
 - wx.ListCtrl (which is probably the most important widget we use) got
   a major rework in 4.1.x by becoming native. It looks quite different
   and we should get testing done to see if anything breaks with it.

Note that 4.1.0 is the last py2 version of wxPython, 4.1.1 is already
py3 only.

wx4.1 build fixes

Whew, adding yet more DLLs to this stupid field...

Fix the hideous white background on wx4.1

These came back from wx2.8 - I guess wx.NullColour was changed?

Add PyMuPDF to requirements.txt

Still completely optional, but recommended since it allows the Doc
Browser to display PDFs as well. The wxPython pdfViewer was broken on
wx4.0, but works fine on wx4.1.

Note: newer versions of PyMuPDF advertise that they are compatible with
py2 on pypi, but 1.18.0 is the last version for which wheels are
available - and manually building this lib is an absolute pain.

Note2: see ugly CI workaround in requirements.txt/setup.py

Closes #553

Merge branch '460-prefix-settings-keys' into dev:

Trickier than it seems merge that adds prefixing to settings keys - those
will need some backwards compatibility code when we hit python 3 as users
updating from older versions will have byte keys that won't be recognized
In Py2 as all those keys are ascii decodable the automatic conversion to
unicode saves us from breaking Bash - b

Also quite a few plain old prefixing - I tried to split this in a logical
way (not per file) in the hoped that we may catch not trivial cases that
we need to revisit in py3. Such cases are:

- chardet returns encoding in bytes so actually the encodings dict and
co should remain bytes - I bet in py3 they are unicode though so except
if we run in some undecodable encoding name we're fine and future proof
- CsvReader goes into pains decoding/encoding/recoding - all this to
handle BOM (which we should not use anywhere anyways - #260)? another one
to revisit in py3

And a general note - I was not so much fun of all this prefixing but it's
the only way to really trace down what should be bytes - also settings
keys were already mixed type, too late to leave them bytes, which is also
not the RightThing - the only reason we may have bytes in here is because
we directly deal with binary files otherwise everything should be unicode

We do *not* want to remove the prefixes in py3 initially - will help with
various stuff - style refactorings, translations and what not - but we
may eventually when the dust settles. So some lines that exceed 79 chars
by one or two chars stayed.

Final reason for merging is that I want to get on with the inspiration
part - this is 101% perspiration here (countless rebases, " vs ', ...)

Thanks @GandaG for initial prefixing!

Under #460.
