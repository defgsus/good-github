Auto merge of #67016 - lqd:placeholder_loans, r=matthewjasper

In which we implement illegal subset relations errors using Polonius

This PR is the rustc side of implementing subset errors using Polonius. That is, in
```rust
fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a u32, y: &'b u32) -> &'a u32 {
    y
}
```
returning `y` requires that `'b: 'a` but we have no evidence of that, so this is an error. (Evidence that the relation holds could come from explicit bounds, or via implied bounds).

Polonius outputs one such error per CFG point where the free region's placeholder loan unexpectedly flowed into another free region. While all these CFG locations could be useful in diagnostics in the future, rustc does not do that (and the duplication is only partially handled in the rest of the errors/diagnostics infrastructure, e.g. duplicate suggestions will be shown by the "outlives suggestions" or some of the `#[rustc_*]` NLL/MIR debug dumps), so I deduplicated the errors.

(The ordering also matters, otherwise some of the elided lifetime naming would change behaviour).

I've blessed a couple of tests, where the output is currently suboptimal:
- the `hrtb-perfect-forwarding` tests mix subset errors with higher-ranked subtyping, however the plan is for chalk to eventually take care of some of this to generate polonius constraints (i.e. it's not polonius' job). Until that happens, polonius will not see the error that NLL sees.
- some other tests have errors and diagnostics specific to `'static`, I _believe_ this to be because of it being treated as more "special" than in polonius. I believe the output is not wrong, but could be better, and appears elsewhere (I feel we'll need to look at polonius' handling of `'static` at some point in the future, maybe to match a bit more what NLL does when it produces errors)

I'll create a tracking issue in the polonius repo to record these 2 points (and a general "we'll need to go over the blessed output" issue, much like we did for NLLs)

The last blessed test is because it's an improvement: in this case, more errors/suggestions were computed, instead of the existing code path where this case apparently stops at the first error.

The `Naive` variant in Polonius computes those errors, so this PR also switches the default variant to that, as we're also in the process of temporarily deactivating all other variants (which exist mostly for performance considerations) until we have completed more work on completeness and correctness, before focusing on efficiency once again.

While most of the correctness in this PR is hidden in the polonius compare-mode (which of course passes locally), I've added a couple of smoke-tests to the existing ones, so that we have some confidence that it works (and keeps working) until we're in a position where we can run them on CI.

As mentioned during yesterday's wg-polonius meeting, @nikomatsakis has already read through most of this PR (and which is matching  what they thought needed to be done [during the recent Polonius sprint](https://hackmd.io/CGMNjt1hR_qYtsR9hgdGmw#Compiler-notes-on-generating-the-placeholder-loans-support)), but Matthew was hopefully going to review (again, not urgent), so:

r? @matthewjasper

(This updates to the latest `polonius-engine` release, and I'm not sure whether `Cargo.lock` updates can easily be rolled up, but apart from that: this changes little that's tested on CI, so seems safe-ish to rollup ?)

Sound: Added EqualizerAPO Tutorials

- Typos
- Added useful tutorials to work with EAPO

Why EAPO over let's say OBS Studio integrated "sound enhancer" VST's? 

EAPO works in real-time and takes no pressure on the CPU (only the program itself uses some CPU cycles while running), it inserts BEFORE the Windows own sound API which makes it "low-latency". Aka no delay or other problems. Compared to OBS Studio "plugins" (or whatever you want to call them) it can be configured individually per device or for ALL devices (speakers/mic/headset etc). You also can work with actual profiles which is not (yet?) possible under OBS Studio, let's say you open a specific game (.exe) then it switches automatically (if you want to) to your profile (.peace file) which makes it incredible useful.

EAPO has some quirks, however, there are workarounds within the GUI given which you can re-check after you installed/updated/re-installed the Realtek/Sound driver.

EAPO also can EQ, reverb, correct specific sound frequencies which makes it really easy since there are sliders which you can use and test right as you change the settings. 

There is much more to mention but it's way too complex to cover and that's why I decided to add some "none bullshit" tutorials (most tutorials regarding OBS or Sound in general on YouTube are copy & paste, which means one guy does something and everyone do exactly the same just to get the clicks, however, these videos are different and they are worth your lifetime).

"12:50pm. Done with breakfast and chores. Let me slack a bit more and then I will resume.

For 2020 and 2021, I do not want to behave the same as in the last 5 years. I am tired of the stress and the chasing of impossible goals. I just want to waste time and let the things come to me on their own terms.

I did well enough given the capabilities I had. I have no shame over the last 5 years. Mistakes were made and they were learned from.

All the stupid worries...just why did I try so hard at trading and now programming?

I could have just dedicated myself to this scientist life. Let the other people think about the world.

I will just think about Spiral.

12:55pm. Let me finish the chapter I am reading and then I will start.

1:05pm. Whatever. Let me slack for a while longer.

1:30pm. That was satisfying. Now let me start for real.

I mean who could be enthusiastic about redoing the damn parser for the 100th time. How many times did I do this back in 2017?

Way too many.

Yet, I must do this.

I am not mathematician so I can't just come up with a design, write a glossy paper and call it a day. I have to roll up my sleeves and get dirty. I am a real programmer. Not some poseur that did not get the memo that computation is the essence of proof.

1:40pm.

```
let pat_type pattern = pattern .>>. opt (colon >>. (pat_expr <|> (lit_ |>> lit))) |>> function a,Some b as x-> PatTypeEq(a,b) | a, None -> a
```

I am thinking about this.

Though I removed the regular `type_eq` and made the restriction that only variables can have type annotations, I can still do the whole fragments using `(a : int, b : int) & (_ : int * int)`.

So it is not a big deal.

What is a big is deciding whether to box or not. Also...

```
int * int
```

How am I going to parse this? Even before I can parse the patterns, I need a parser for type expressions.

1:45pm. Type expressions have their own precedence for operators. I cannot treat them like a normal thing.

That was not the case in the previous versions of Spiral.

So type expressions is where I in fact need to start.

1:50pm. Ok, before I do that, let me take a break. I want this orange.

After that I will finally do some novel coding. Hopefully that will get me into the swing of things."

    Allowed the msdos implementation to build with curses and PDCurses
    Over 100 other fixes and improvements

All of the fixes have been incrementally published on the public Git repository
for the game. A more complete list can be found in the game's sources in
doc/fixes36.3. As usual, a warning that some entries in that file may also be
"spoilers".

As with all releases of the game, we appreciate your feedback. Please submit
any bugs using the problem report form. Also, please check the "known bugs"
list before you log a problem - somebody else may have already found it.

Happy NetHacking!
