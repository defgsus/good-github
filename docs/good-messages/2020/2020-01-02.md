Initial version of gui package

Infernio: Had to squash a whole bunch of these together in order to have
the resulting commit not break dev. Introduces a decent first design for
the GUI package featuring layouts, buttons and some text components.

Move layouts to new gui package with fully wrapped classes

The goal is to replace balt with this, fully encapsulating the wx
classes inside.

Add regular buttons to new gui package

The onButClickEventful argument is not yet implemented, but it's only
used in one class (the ColorPicker dialog) so it isn't a massive concern.
It's waiting for better event handling before it can be implemented.

Add ToggleButton and CheckBox to gui, plus more

The main widget API now uses properties instead of getters and setters.

Add text edit fields to gui

Still to do:
    * styles (no border, sunken border)
    * fonts (mostly monospace)
    * event binding (on_lose_focus)
    * a lot of documentation

WIP - Add labels to gui

again, this is not even close to done. barely more than a stash

Cleanup some leftovers from nycz's initial work

Rename abstract classes to fit WB style

We use 'A' instead of 'Abstract'. Also renamed Widget to _AWidget since
instantiating that class doesn't seem useful.

Import directly in balt

Leads to slightly cleaner looking code. Also deleted the remnants of the
StaticText class.

Create gui.DeselectAllButton

Make TextCtrl wrappers more consistent

There is no reason for anything but TextArea to ever have a 'wrap'
parameter. However, the 'modified' property is useful for both TextAreas
and TextFields, so let's move it to the abstract class.

Remnants of balt.StaticText -> gui.Label transition

Rename abstract classes in layouts.py to fit

Carry over wx3 SendSizeEventToParent edit

Was the only actually needed one from the wx3 TEMP commit

layouts: Use SetSizer by default

Fixes dialogs opening way too small and not remembering their size

Add docstrings and typing

Also removed some obsolete labels in patcher_dialog.py.

Rename 'text' and 'name', both forbidden names

Get rid of all 'text' usages in the new GUI code

Forbidden name, see wiki.

Get rid of all 'name' usages in the new GUI code

Fobidden name, see wiki. I almost definitely missed some here.

Rename some setter parameters

To avoid forbidden names etc.

Reintroduce support for some missing features

1. Hiding text input borders

Also turns the INI details name back into a read-only text area again
(works better for small screens).

2. StaticText.Rewrap (now Label.rewrap)

Cut out some parts of this that I don't think are needed, but we'll have
to see.

Drop noAutoResize

When in doubt, leave it out - can't find any breakage from not
supporting this, so dropping it.

Remove HideNativeCaret() usage

Doesn't even seem to work, and why are we even doing this in the first
place??

Split into modules earlier

gui/__init__.py should become a central import point, will significantly
reduce commit noise and simplify the API usage (in exchange for a *very*
painful conflict resolution that I'll now have to slug through...).

Notes for these squashed modules:

Move text-related classes into gui/text_components.py

gui/__init__.py is starting to become pretty large and there's no reason
to limit ourselves to one file anyways.

Also randomly noticed that the copyright dates were still from 2015
here.

Move button classes into gui/buttons.py

Since these are going to expand soon (BitmapButton), now felt like a
good time to do it.

Some minor improvements to layouts.py

Fix 'Modified' field not being editable

Got the incorrect assignment (False instead of True), but I dropped the
entire assignment instead. Don't know why it was there in the first
place.

Includes today's 50k more or less.

I accidentally cut the lower first half of the course short by about 2
miles.  However, on the second half, I deliberately ran east toward
the mountains in a place where I was pretty sure I should have been
running north, parallel to them.  My reasoning was if I was running
the wrong way it would help make up the distance I inadvertently cut
earlier and if I was running the right way, well, I *should* be running
that way.

Unfortunately, when I was in navigation mode on my Ambit 3 I
accidentally stopped and discarded my tracks.  I'm not at all happy
with the UI that led me to do that, although part of the issue is I'm
too vain/lazy/forgetful to have reading glasses with me and I pushed
the wrong button.  However, I *NEVER* want my sports watch to throw
away data like that and I only went in to navigation mode to see if I
was on the trail (by that time I had already headed back west and had
indeed gotten back on the trail).

So, my numbers for today's run are approximations.  Of the 50k
finishers, I came in 4th out of 5.  Jason, who came in 5th, definitely
did the whole course, so perhaps he beat me, although I do suspect
that I went off course (uphill!) for at least three quarters of a
mile, perhaps more, and did about the same amount coming back.

Oh well, there's always next year.

Oh, and I'm *still* recovering from flu and *that* kicked me in the ass
pretty hard.  I simply couldn't cough out all the junk that was
collecting in my lungs as I ran, so eventually I did a bunch of
walking just so my lungs would feel better.

Fixes from A Golden Gun: Technology now provides more sensible benefits and has fixed localization. Dreadnought stat boosts are still fiddly, but I'll work on that.
- Traits have been cleaned up and brought up to par with updates where needed. Zealous and Cynical have been removed (and painstakingly gutted from the code.) due to redundancy with Spiritual/Skeptic and Radical/Pragmatic.
- Flags now display as intended. Turns out having missing flags mucks up the flag assignment for everything else.
- Some minor localization fixes
- Building lists have cleaned up and localized.
- Hospital buildings were moved to the 'Medicine' category.
- I think I fixed one of the lover events. I can't recall which.
- Astrist, Bio-Directionist, Neo-Feudalist, Space Pirate, and Terran Imperialist now have five holy/historic sites.
- Redundant or unfitting laws have been dummied out. The Coalition-Unitary law track now provides an increase to demesne size.
	- I am aware that the Feudal Obligations law has unfitting localization. I just have no idea where its localization even is, so I can't fix it.

Fixes from Zombaxx: Enabled building new holdings.
-various localization and GFX updates

All sorts of refactoring!

There are some pretty cool changes here. First, I went all out on
pattern synonyms and view patterns. Previously, you had to manage the
Fix/unfix functions all over the code. Now, the Tiler constructors are
smart and automatically apply Fix or unfix as needed. Sometimes I still
find myself coercing but it's a lot better than it was before.

Also, there's some Template Haskell in the project now. Those smart
constructors would have been tedius to right by hand so I wasted a few
hours learning how to automate creating them.

In theory, you can use Complete pragmas to control the exhaustiveness
checker. This lets pattern synonyms act closer to real patterns.
Those pragmas work great in the Tiler.hs file but cause the compiler to
panic in the Actions.hs and Core.hs files. I think this bug is fixed in
a later version of GHC but that version hasn't been released yet.

Also, GHC 8.8.1 uses up all of my laptop's memory trying to compile
Base.hs so that's kind of scary. Maybe I should split that module up.
For now I just use 8.6.5 and deal with the lack of Complete pragmas.

Create Hacking_the_fender

The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access to The Fenderâ€˜s systems, you must update his "passwords.txt" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.

Use your knowledge of working with Python files to retrieve, manipulate, obscure, and create data in your quest for justice. Work with CSV files and other text files in this exploration of the strength of Python file programming.

If you get stuck during this project, check out the project walkthrough video which can be found at the bottom of the page after the final step of the project.

Tasks
20/20Complete
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Reading In The Passwords
1.
Are you there? Weâ€™ve opened up a communications link to The Fenderâ€˜s secret computer. We need you to write a program that will read in the compromised usernames and passwords that are stored in a file called "passwords.csv".

First import the CSV module, since weâ€™ll be needing it to parse the data.

2.
We need to create a list of users whose passwords have been compromised, create a new list and save it to the variable compromised_users.

3.
Next weâ€™ll need you to open up the file itself. Store it in a file object called password_file.

4.
Pass the password_file object holder to our CSV reader for parsing. Save the parsed csv.DictReader object as password_csv.

5.
Now weâ€™ll want to iterate through each of the lines in the CSV.

Create a for loop and save each row of the CSV into the temporary variable password_row.

6.
Inside your for loop, print out password_row['Username']. This is the username of the person whose password was compromised.

Run your code, do you see a list of usernames?

7.
Remove the print statement. We want to add each username to the list of compromised_users. Use the listâ€™s .append() method to add the username to compromised_users instead of printing them.

8.
Exit out of your with block for "passwords.csv". We have all the data we need from that file.

Start a new with block, opening a file called compromised_users.txt. Open this file in write-mode, saving the file object as compromised_user_file.

9.
Inside the new context-managed block opened by the with statement start a new for loop.

Iterate over each of your compromised_users.

10.
Write the username of each compromised_user in compromised_users to compromised_user_file.

11.
Exit out of that with block. Youâ€™re doing great so far! Weâ€™ve got the data we need to employ as insurance against The Fender.

Notifying the Boss
12.
Your boss needs to know that you were successful in retrieving that compromised data. Weâ€™ll need to send him an encoded message over the internet. Letâ€™s use JSON to do that.

First weâ€™ll need to import the json module.

13.
Open a new JSON file in write-mode called boss_message.json. Save the file object to the variable boss_message.

14.
Create a Python dictionary object within your with statement that relays a boss message. Call this boss_message_dict.

Give it a "recipient" key with a value "The Boss".

Also give it a "message" key with the value "Mission Success".

15.
Write out boss_message_dict to boss_message using json.dump().

Scrambling the Password
16.
Now that weâ€™ve safely recovered the compromised users weâ€™ll want to remove the "passwords.csv" file completely.

Create a new with block and open "new_passwords.csv" in write-mode. Save the file object to a variable called new_passwords_obj.

17.
Enemy of the people, Slash Null, is who we want The Fender to think was behind this attack. He has a signature, whenever he hacks someone he adds this signature to one of the files he touches. Here is the signature:

 _  _     ___   __  ____             
/ )( \   / __) /  \(_  _)            
) \/ (  ( (_ \(  O ) )(              
\____/   \___/ \__/ (__)             
 _  _   __    ___  __ _  ____  ____  
/ )( \ / _\  / __)(  / )(  __)(    \ 
) __ (/    \( (__  )  (  ) _)  ) D ( 
\_)(_/\_/\_/ \___)(__\_)(____)(____/ 
        ____  __     __   ____  _  _ 
 ___   / ___)(  )   / _\ / ___)/ )( \
(___)  \___ \/ (_/\/    \\___ \) __ (
       (____/\____/\_/\_/(____/\_)(_/
 __ _  _  _  __    __                
(  ( \/ )( \(  )  (  )               
/    /) \/ (/ (_/\/ (_/\             
\_)__)\____/\____/\____/
Save that as a multiline string to the variable slash_null_sig.

18.
Write slash_null_sig to new_passwords_obj. Now we have the file to replace passwords.csv with!

19.
What an incredible success! Weâ€™ll take care of moving the new passwords file over the old one in case you want to practice hacking The Fender in the future.

Thank you for your service, programmer.

18.2.Activating Timestampable{The TimestampableEntity Trait}

The TimestampableEntity Trait
I love Timestampable. Heck, I put it everywhere. And, fortunately, there is a shortcut! Yea, we did way too much work.
Check it out: completely delete the createdAt and updatedAt fields that we so-carefully added. And, remove the getter and setter methods at the bottom too.
But now, all the way on top, add use TimestampableEntity.
Yea! Hold Command or Ctrl and click to see that. Awesome: this contains the exact same code that we had before! If you want Timestampable, just use this trait, generate a migration and... done!
And, talking about migrations, there could be some slight column differences between these columns and the original ones we created. Let's check that. Run:

php bin/console make:migration
No database changes were detected

Cool! The fields in the trait are identical to what we had before. That means that we can already test things with:

php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
Thank you TimestampableEntity!

Up Next: Relations!
Ok guys! I hope you are loving Doctrine! We just got a lot of functionality fast. We have magic - like Timestampable & Sluggable - rich data fixtures, and a rocking migration system.
One thing that we have not talked about yet is production config. And... that's because it's already setup. The Doctrine recipe came with its own config/packages/prod/doctrine.yaml config file, which makes sure that anything that can be cached easily, is cached:

32 lines  config/packages/prod/doctrine.yaml
doctrine:
    orm:
        metadata_cache_driver:
            type: service
            id: doctrine.system_cache_provider
        query_cache_driver:
            type: service
            id: doctrine.system_cache_provider
        result_cache_driver:
            type: service
            id: doctrine.result_cache_provider
services:
    doctrine.result_cache_provider:
        class: Symfony\Component\Cache\DoctrineProvider
        public: false
        arguments:
            - '@doctrine.result_cache_pool'
    doctrine.system_cache_provider:
        class: Symfony\Component\Cache\DoctrineProvider
        public: false
        arguments:
            - '@doctrine.system_cache_pool'
framework:
    cache:
        pools:
            doctrine.result_cache_pool:
                adapter: cache.app
            doctrine.system_cache_pool:
                adapter: cache.system
This means you get nice performance, out-of-the-box.
The other huge topic that we have not talked about yet is Doctrine relations. But, we should totally talk about those - they're awesome! So let's do that in our next tutorial, with foreign keys, join queries and high-fives so that we can create a really rich database.

16.1.Sluggable & other Wonderful Behaviors

We're using Faker to generate a random slug for each dummy article. Thanks to this, back on the homepage, look at the URLs: they're truly random slugs: they have no relation to the title.
But, really, shouldn't the slug be generated from the title? What I mean is, if I set the Article's title, something should automatically convert that into a slug and make sure it's unique in the database. We shouldn't need to worry about doing that manually.
And... yea! There's a really cool library that can do this, and a bunch of other magic! Google for 'gedmo doctrine', and then click into its documentation.
Ok, let me explain something: there is a normal, PHP library called DoctrineExtension, which can add a lot of different behaviors to your entities, like sluggable, where you automatically generate the slug from another field. Other behaviors include Loggable, where each change to an entity is tracked, or Blameable, where the user who created or updated an entity is automatically recorded.

Create Flower.java

We saw the little game Marmot made for Mole's lunch. Now it's Marmot's dinner time and, as we all know, Marmot eats flowers. At every dinner he eats some red and white flowers. Therefore a dinner can be represented as a sequence of several flowers, some of them white and some of them red.

But, for a dinner to be tasty, there is a rule: Marmot wants to eat white flowers only in groups of size k.

Now Marmot wonders in how many ways he can eat between a and b flowers. As the number of ways could be very large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109â€‰+â€‰7).
Input

Input contains several test cases.

The first line contains two integers t and k (1â€‰â‰¤â€‰t,â€‰kâ€‰â‰¤â€‰105), where t represents the number of test cases.

The next t lines contain two integers ai and bi (1â€‰â‰¤â€‰aiâ€‰â‰¤â€‰biâ€‰â‰¤â€‰105), describing the i-th test.
Output

Print t lines to the standard output. The i-th line should contain the number of ways in which Marmot can eat between ai and bi flowers at dinner modulo 1000000007 (109â€‰+â€‰7).

"12:50pm. Done with breakfast and chores. Let me slack a bit more and then I will resume.

For 2020 and 2021, I do not want to behave the same as in the last 5 years. I am tired of the stress and the chasing of impossible goals. I just want to waste time and let the things come to me on their own terms.

I did well enough given the capabilities I had. I have no shame over the last 5 years. Mistakes were made and they were learned from.

All the stupid worries...just why did I try so hard at trading and now programming?

I could have just dedicated myself to this scientist life. Let the other people think about the world.

I will just think about Spiral.

12:55pm. Let me finish the chapter I am reading and then I will start.

1:05pm. Whatever. Let me slack for a while longer.

1:30pm. That was satisfying. Now let me start for real.

I mean who could be enthusiastic about redoing the damn parser for the 100th time. How many times did I do this back in 2017?

Way too many.

Yet, I must do this.

I am not mathematician so I can't just come up with a design, write a glossy paper and call it a day. I have to roll up my sleeves and get dirty. I am a real programmer. Not some poseur that did not get the memo that computation is the essence of proof.

1:40pm.

```
let pat_type pattern = pattern .>>. opt (colon >>. (pat_expr <|> (lit_ |>> lit))) |>> function a,Some b as x-> PatTypeEq(a,b) | a, None -> a
```

I am thinking about this.

Though I removed the regular `type_eq` and made the restriction that only variables can have type annotations, I can still do the whole fragments using `(a : int, b : int) & (_ : int * int)`.

So it is not a big deal.

What is a big is deciding whether to box or not. Also...

```
int * int
```

How am I going to parse this? Even before I can parse the patterns, I need a parser for type expressions.

1:45pm. Type expressions have their own precedence for operators. I cannot treat them like a normal thing.

That was not the case in the previous versions of Spiral.

So type expressions is where I in fact need to start.

1:50pm. Ok, before I do that, let me take a break. I want this orange.

After that I will finally do some novel coding. Hopefully that will get me into the swing of things."

lib/list_sort: Optimize number of calls to comparison function

CONFIG_RETPOLINE has severely degraded indirect function call
performance, so it's worth putting some effort into reducing the number
of times cmp() is called.

This patch avoids badly unbalanced merges on unlucky input sizes.  It
slightly increases the code size, but saves an average of 0.2*n calls to
cmp().

x86-64 code size 739 -> 803 bytes (+64)

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of low-hanging fruit in a merge sort;
it already performs only n*log2(n) - K*n + O(1) compares.  The leading
coefficient is already at the theoretical limit (log2(n!) corresponds to
K=1.4427), so we're fighting over the linear term, and the best
mergesort can do is K=1.2645, achieved when n is a power of 2.

The differences between mergesort variants appear when n is *not* a
power of 2; K is a function of the fractional part of log2(n).  Top-down
mergesort does best of all, achieving a minimum K=1.2408, and an average
(over all sizes) K=1.248.  However, that requires knowing the number of
entries to be sorted ahead of time, and making a full pass over the
input to count it conflicts with a second performance goal, which is
cache blocking.

Obviously, we have to read the entire list into L1 cache at some point,
and performance is best if it fits.  But if it doesn't fit, each full
pass over the input causes a cache miss per element, which is
undesirable.

While textbooks explain bottom-up mergesort as a succession of merging
passes, practical implementations do merging in depth-first order: as
soon as two lists of the same size are available, they are merged.  This
allows as many merge passes as possible to fit into L1; only the final
few merges force cache misses.

This cache-friendly depth-first merge order depends on us merging the
beginning of the input as much as possible before we've even seen the
end of the input (and thus know its size).

The simple eager merge pattern causes bad performance when n is just
over a power of 2.  If n=1028, the final merge is between 1024- and
4-element lists, which is wasteful of comparisons.  (This is actually
worse on average than n=1025, because a 1204:1 merge will, on average,
end after 512 compares, while 1024:4 will walk 4/5 of the list.)

Because of this, bottom-up mergesort achieves K < 0.5 for such sizes,
and has an average (over all sizes) K of around 1.  (My experiments show
K=1.01, while theory predicts K=0.965.)

There are "worst-case optimal" variants of bottom-up mergesort which
avoid this bad performance, but the algorithms given in the literature,
such as queue-mergesort and boustrodephonic mergesort, depend on the
breadth-first multi-pass structure that we are trying to avoid.

This implementation is as eager as possible while ensuring that all
merge passes are at worst 1:2 unbalanced.  This achieves the same
average K=1.207 as queue-mergesort, which is 0.2*n better then
bottom-up, and only 0.04*n behind top-down mergesort.

Specifically, defers merging two lists of size 2^k until it is known
that there are 2^k additional inputs following.  This ensures that the
final uneven merges triggered by reaching the end of the input will be
at worst 2:1.  This will avoid cache misses as long as 3*2^k elements
fit into the cache.

(I confess to being more than a little bit proud of how clean this code
turned out.  It took a lot of thinking, but the resultant inner loop is
very simple and efficient.)

 NetHack 3.6.3 is the official release of NetHack that follows NetHack 3.6.2.
Here's a synopsis of over 190 bug fixes and over 22 game enhancements and
community contributions made since the release of 3.6.2 in May 2019:

    Fixed stale 'thrownobj' pointer for returning thrown aklys while engulfed
    Fixed uarmh null pointer dereference if a helm of opposite alignment came off due to being polymorphed
    Fixed 'object lost' panic when attempting to crawl of of the water during emergency disrobing/dropping
    Running now stops when moving over engravings so you can tell where they are
    Fixed detection of unseen/secret doors which failed to find monsters hiding under objects and failed to find monsters hiding at trap locations
    Ensured fatal status conditions made it to disclosure and/or dumplog

SSS Rework FOMOD GUI

Depends on inf-wx-begone, rewrites most of the GUI to use the wrappers
instead. Drops a whole bunch of wx usages, which is nice. RadioButton
needs wrapping, see all the ugly hacks at the bottom of gui_fomod. Also,
the design that uses __dict__ of wx objects to store group objects has
to go, it's fundamentally hacky and very fragile - e.g. imagine if the
wx guys decided to add __slots__ to their objects.

Also contains a bunch of fixes and misc improvements, e.g. user-facing
strings have been made translatable, some bugs that were carried over
from belt have been fixed, and the 'Back' button no longer works on the
first page.

Note the glaring TODOs - this is a straight up port of the original GUI,
but we currently don't have a way to change fonts, which the original
GUI relied on to differentiate its components. I added some
HBoxedLayouts as an alternative, which works fine for the main FOMOD
dialog and may even be an improvement in terms of visual clarity, but
doesn't help at all with the results screen, which is now an unreadable
mess.

MFC r354247, r355349: lualoader try_include improvement

r354247: lualoader: rewrite try_include using lfs + dofile

Actual modules get require()'d in, rather than try_include(). All instances
of try_include should be provided with proper hooks/API in the rest of
loader to do the work they need to do, since we can't rely on them to exist.
Convert this now to lfs + dofile since we won't really be treating them as
modules.

lfs is required because dofile will properly throw an error if the file
doesn't exist, which is not in the spirit of 'optionally included'.

Getting out of the pcall game allows us to provide a loader.exit() style
call that backs out to the common bits of loader (autoboot sequence unless
disabled with a loader.setenv("autoboot_delay", "NO")). The most ideal way
identified so far to implement loader.exit() is to throw a special
abort-style error that indicates to the caller in interp_lua that we've not
actually errored out, just continue execution. Otherwise, we have to hack in
logic to bubble up and return from loader.lua without continuing further,
which gets kind of ugly depending on the context in which we're aborting.

A compat shim is provided temporarily in case the executing loader doesn't
yet have loader.lua_path, which was just added in r354246.

r355349: lualoader: correct a typo from r354247

r354247 converted try_include to lfs + dofile with the loader.lua_path added
just before. Fortunately, there was a hardcoded /boot/lua fallback in case
loader.lua_path wasn't being set yet- I typo'd it as loader.lua_paths.

Fix the typo.
