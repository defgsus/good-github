Oh boy. Big Changes, I created a Floor Run Demo Game Instance. This is where we can store information level to level with points, games ect. Here We'll beable to add a bunch of other stuff as well. Just need to do some research. I also changed the BP for grass points and will do the same with fire (SurfaceDust) tmrw as well. I also changed the degrees in which you turn in the VR pawn. It's kinda funky though. Same with going between lvels. After we mess with the hall more we'll have to figure out a better way to do that.

Cheers.

terminal-unix: attempt to support more CTRL

Hysterically stupid inconsistent legacy garbage from the 70ies or maybe
even 60ies. What the fuck. I fucking hate computers so much.

Fixes: #8072
