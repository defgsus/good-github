Side note:
I guess nobody will ever read those update notes...
Why am I still trying to write them? I wonder...
Well...
If you should read this message:
Congratulations!
You wasted a minute of your life reading this useless message.

Anyways aside from that I hope - whoever you are - that you are doing fine.
I am bored...
I don't know what else to write...
Maybe I should just stop writing?
*He continued for he doesn't know*
I should probably be doing something prodoctive now but I am feeling so lazy...
Eventually I will get a better idea than continuing this message.

Well,
fare well...
