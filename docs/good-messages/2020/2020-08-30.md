Merged shadow collision with level

Used dynamic-creating collider script in the first theatre level. Fixed bugs concerning colliders not being created correctly in the right space.

I hate my life.

tinyexr.h: Add compile fix for Octave 5.2 / MinGW64 for MS-Windows.

For god knows what absurd reason, defining the variable
std::stringstream ss; defined in one if() scope of the subfunction
LoadDeepEXR() leads to linker failure with an undefined reference
to  std::__cxx11::basic_stringstream, despite the fact that the same
definition/reference is used in many similar places in the file.
Maybe some compiler/linker bug. Anyway, implement an alternative
solution to what that problematic code segment did.

Mixing C++ code with our C mex files just continues to be a frickin
pain in the ass...

Fixed chip label

Chip worked as a boatwright as his father and his gran
A' working in a boat yard building on the River Thames
One day Chip was hard at work, the Devil appeared from hell
He held a roll of copper and a bucket full of nails
The Devil said unto Chip, "take these nails and copper roll
But you also have to take this rat and I will take your soul"
Chip despised the rat, and the rat squealed and hissed
But the bucket of nails and copper were too much to resist
Chip went straight to work, he'd get rid of the rat
And there would no' be a problem with his death after the fact
But the devil rat wouldn't die, no matter how hard he tried
The rat attacked the boatwright and 'e bit him in the eye
It seemed as if the river rats fell under Satan's spell
They followed Chip around and made his life a living hell
He slowly lost his mind, he lost his family
He lost his job and had to join the King's Navy
A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I will get you, Chip
A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I'm gonna get you
The rats chased Chip up the gangplank of the ship
And they bit him and they tortured him until he finally flipped
He sniveled to the captain to turn around this rig
The captain spied his madness and they chucked him in the brig
The devil rat had his man, he knew just what to do
He'd command the rats and through the planks they'd chew
The water rushed in, and the ship went down
She was smashed upon the rocks on which the rats danced around
A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I will get you, Chip
A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I will get you, Chip
A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I will get you, Chip
A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I got you, Chip

Removed annoying .idea/ files. I code Rust in VSCode damnit.
Added some fun comments around the project because 1am Tamiyo thought it
was a good idea to make himself laugh in the morning. Non-degen tamiyo
is going to be mad that 1am tamiyo cluttered his codebase but its still
fun nonetheless.

Inception | Your mind is the scene of the crime

The Instructions

Brainfuck is tiny. It consists of eight different instructions. These
instructions can be used to manipulate the state of the Brainfuck
machine:

* `>` - Increment the data pointer by 1.
* `<` - Decrement the data pointer by 1.
* `+` - Increment the value in the current cell (the cell the data
pointer is pointing to).
* `-` - Decrement the value in the current cell.
* `.` - Take the integer in the current cell, treat it as an ASCII char
and print it on the output stream.
* `,` - Read a character from the input stream, convert it to an
integer and save it to the current cell.
* `[` - This always needs to come with a matching `]`. If the current
cell contains a zero, set the instruction pointer to the index of the
instruction after the matching `]`.
* `]` - If the current cell does not contain a zero, set the
instruction pointer to the index of the instruction after the matching
`[`.

That’s all of it, the complete Brainfuck language. Let's do this!

LIFE IS MAGIC, CODING IS ART.
