Arms APL Update

Update to the Arms APL. Very large DPS increases with Rend and Massacre, and a smaller DPS increase to Fervor of Battle. Changes to better account for a few different Major Essence choices, leading to a DPS increase for Condensed Life Force and Blood of the Enemy. Updated a few racial lines for the better. Most of these changes are larger increases the more Expedient you have.

Mostly comprehensive change list: 
1) Rewrote precombat lines for Memory of Lucid Dreams and Guardian of Azeroth to account for shorter fight timings, leading to large dps increases for 2 minute and 3 minute fights. 
2) Added conditionals to force certain potions for precombat based on essence choice.
3) Updated the second potion line.
4) Updated the usage of Ashvane's Razor Coral.
5) Updated Blood of the Enemy, Guardian of Azeroth, and Memory of Lucid Dreams lines.
6) Added Rend to the Execute section of the APL as well as changed its priority in the Single Target section.
7) Changed some conditionals for casting Execute.
8) Changed some conditionals for casting Whirlwind.

[7.x] Improve pull request template proposal (#56756) | Remove IE11 mention from PR template [skip ci] (#70486) (#70789)

* Improve pull request template proposal (#56756)

Looking through Kibana PRs many currently ignore the check boxes or just delete them. The goal here is to make the process easier, delete some unused options and align the checkboxes with what's most useful. We've had some discussions on the Uptime team about ways the PR template could be potentially improved. These changes are based on an extended discussion we had on the topic. We'd love to hear if other teams would be OK with these recommended changes.

The changes here are:

* Allow authors to just delete unnecessary items rather than strike through. Adding all the `~~` in markdown is painful
* Remove the unnecessary checkbox for release notes, the build bot catches this and blocks merges without that being set.
* Add a checkbox for testing in various browser sizes / mobile responsive devices
* Move IE checkbox to the bottom of the list since it's seldom checked and makes the checklist seem daunting

* Remove IE11 mention from PR template [skip ci] (#70486)

* Remove IE11 mention from PR template

* Add link to browser matrix
