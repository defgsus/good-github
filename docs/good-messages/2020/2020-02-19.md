AntiVPN v2.0.0
Refactored the shit out of this.
If you hate this then you love mixed types and manual type checking in places where it could have easily been avoided. Like okay dude, go love yourself somewhere in private.

Remove exe / com wrapper around openrct2.dll for Windows (#10727)

We get repeated reports of people saying the game is incorrectly reported as a virus. It is becoming more inconvenient for players and even myself, because when we attempt to download a build, it is immediately deleted by scanners (including the default for Windows: Windows Defender).

One scanner is not too much of an issue, but the game is flagged by almost half of available scanners as reported by VirusTotal.

So why is it being flagged?

Windows has a very annoying concept, the subsystem for a binary. The console subsystem allows stdin / stdout as you would expect, just like posix. Unfortunately if a user runs a console subsystem binary from the desktop or explorer, the game will be opened under conhost and thus you get a console showing alongside the game window. This is not a good user experience for most players. To resolve this, you can use the windows subsystem, but this will detach stdin and stdout immediately on launch. There are hacks that can be done in code to allocate a new console but I found this to not work very well with stdin or other terminal emulators.

My solution to the problem was to have two binaries: openrct2.exe and openrct2.com. Both are executable but openrct2.exe is windows subsystem, openrct2.com is console subsystem. The desktop shortcut opens openrct2.exe with no console window showing. Typing openrct2 on the command line will execute openrct2.com (as .com has higher PATH precedence than .exe by default) with working stdin and stdout. In order to reduce the size, I have the entire game inside openrct2.dll and then supply two tiny wrapper EXEs that simply route main(...) into the DLL.

These wrapper EXEs are the problem, they are very small and do nothing but call into a DLL, this must match virus signatures too closely and their size probably reduces the data available for the scanner to analyse.

So as I can not find any other way of achieving my goal of a cli and gui version of OpenRCT2, this changes the build to publish openrct2 as a single executable (rather than a DLL + wrapper EXE), and then duplicate the entire ~10MB exe again and flip the subsystem flag. The installer and zip size won't be affected as this extra size will be completely compressed out, but when unpacked will lead to an extra ~10MB on disc. But I think it is a fair compromise.

VirusTotal now reports all artefacts as safe, for now anyway.

Casino port

This is first phase of casino port where I have made my casino spaceship compatible with new chomp codebase. There isnt a connecting port at station yet due to changes being made to main map, but with second phase of casino port there should be one for casino shuttle to move back and forth to transfer visitors.

Non-casino changes
Port of:
purple assistant cap, wah!
wiggler hat, dont know if the sprite works fully yet.
The monocoole, every self respecting technomancer needs this! Also need this for casino rewards.
Snaps, can recommend for lunch, I prefer the licorice flavoured ones!
Space cleaner dispenser, yep any janitors dream, so far its only on casino spaceship.
Ported old modular sofa for station usage, is already on casino, future plans could involve making the modular sofa that can be built from steel be a little more pretty and made from wood as well and also get another overlay/color when added cloth for cushion.

also deleting a .txt file that I didnt get to delete before someone really wanted me to upload wip files so they could work off them, sorry about that but its fixed now!
deleted alienwhitelist and custom_items.txt since github doesnt seem to have those blacklisted

casino port:
Ported the map with the golden goose spacecasino
ported the deluxe edition bar and kitchen gear! Say hello to the good old deluxe dispenser, deluxe food vendor and deluxe drink vendor, perhaps one day they will be constructible by crew!
ported the casino stripper pole, casino roulette, slotmachine, poker/blackjack table, ported the casino wheel of fortune
casino wallet~
casino jukebox! And re implemented the system so the casino songs no longer are on the normal jukebox, sorry folks, hope you didnt like them too much :c
casino visitor and staff manual, might need a bit of revision depending on what event managers wants
Casino chips, gotta gamble with something!
fixed runtime errors from deluxe dispenser trying to add cartridges with reagents that have been renamed on new chomp

Be aware, there will be more casino changes in near future along with some other non-casino changes, including porting of pint metamorphic glass.

Here we go again, with all-new shit

Types are now first-class, because I don't hate myself just enough yet
Casting with `as` because <> sucks
Types are first class which means pointer modifiers are now... operators
Universalized function declaration syntax, no longer needs ()
Universalized all type declarations, actually
Tuples now exist because I thought they'd be neat
Not noticeable in the syntax, but templates!
Template selection! typeinfo! typeof and sizeof! Oh my!
Might have gone a little insane thinking of this ngl

Add support for PostgreSQL tablespaces

Tablespaces can be used to spread out PostgreSQL workloads across
multiple volumes, which can be used for a variety of use cases:

- Partitioning larger data sets
- Putting data onto archival systems
- Utilizing hardware (or a storage class) for a particular database
object, e.g. an index

and more.

Tablespaces can be created via the `pgo create cluster` command using
the `--tablespaces` flag. The arguments to `--tablespaces` can be passed
in via a command-separated list; each argument consister of two values:

- The name of the tablespace
- The type of storage to use for the tablespace

For example:

  pgo create cluster hacluster --tablespaces=ts=nfsstorage

All tablespaces are mounted in the `/tablespaces` directory. The
PostgreSQL Operator manages the mount points and persistent volume
claims (PVCs) for the tablespaces, and ensures they are available
throughout all of the PostgreSQL lifecycle operations, including:

- Provisioning
- Backup & Restore
- High-Availability, Failover, Healing
- Clone

etc.

Two additional values were added to the pgcluster CRD:

- TablespaceMounts: a map of the name of the tablespace and its
associated storage.

Tablespaces are automatically created in the PostgreSQL cluster. You can
access them as soon as the cluster is initialized. For example, using
the tablespace created above, you could create a table on the tablespace
`ts` with the following SQL:

  CREATE TABLE (id int) TABLESPACE ts;

Presently, tablespaces can only be added to a PostgreSQL cluster when
it is initialized. Based on usage, future work will look to making this
more flexible. Dropping tablespaces can be tricky as no objects must
exist on a tablespace in order for PostgreSQL to drop it (i.e. there is
no DROP TABLESPACE .. CASCADE command).

Added LSP support... again.

I had LSP working hunky dory! And then, well I guess I just up and
deleted some recovery files or something, cuz it all went *poof*!

This has been a very frustrating and instructive experience, as if I
needed any more reminders to religiously version everything in life...

On the plus side, I'm now aware that my poetry virtual environments
aren't registering in lsp-mode, which is a snafu that escaped me last
time.

So it goes.
