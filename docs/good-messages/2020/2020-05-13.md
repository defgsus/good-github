MORE SKILL CHANGES!!!!!

- lockpicking is now 25% faster by default! nimble values are unaffected, so you'll still pick locks at the same speed as in vanilla nimble!!

- replaced iron man with a new skill: BIG GUY!

- big guy is basically a cooler version of Iron Man. the ictv unlock has been moved to basic, and with basic you get an additional 30% more armor, with ace giving you an additional 20% armor.

- big guy ace was also supposed to reduce the armor movement speed penalty by 15%, but payday was a bitch and refused to fucking apply it for whatever reason.

vo_direct3d: rip out texture video rendering path

This isn't useful anymore. We have a much better d3d11 renderer in
vo_gpu. D3D11 is available in all supported Windows versions. The
StretchRect path might still be useful for someone (???), and leaving it
at least evades conflict about users who want to keep using this VO for
inexplicable reasons. (Low power usage might be a justified reason, but
still, no.)

Also fuck the win32 platform, it's a heap of stinky shit. Microsoft is
some sort of psycho clown software company. Granted, maybe still better
than much of the rest of Silly Con Valley.
