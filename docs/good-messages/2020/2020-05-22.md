In night mode, add a white background to latex's svg

Ideally, I'd love to port
dae/anki@1450d1ca078ed2578defdc54572296bda7cc9267.

It seems that our browser don't recognize the css command "filter";
it's hard to believe as it's far from new, according to
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_filter.asp but here it is.

Instead, I decided to imitate what LaTeX already does, put a white
background. That's not beautiful, but at least the content can be read.
