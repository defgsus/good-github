Prepare TodoMVC implementation

First of all, I needed a test framework. Because I like pain I thought I
shouldn't start using libraries now and rather implemented my own shitty
version of something that looks like mocha when squinting. Because mocha is
what I'm used to. Let's see how soon this breaks down. Together with colored
output from goheadless and livereload it at least looks fancy.

The list of test cases is taken from [1]. They do provide the test suite - but
I'd rather build it myself and learn something. I want to keep the tests
themselves close enough to their implementation to be compliant in the end.

Fix wrong binding code generation on some locales

The reason we set culture info (aka locale) here is because the binding
generator uses locale dependent string operations such as converting characters
to upper/lower case, case insensitive comparisons and float <-> string
conversions. This breaks in all kinds of nasty ways if you try to build the
project in parts of the world where upper case "version" is not "VERSION" but
rather "VERSİON" or lower case "VERSION" is 'versıon'. Obscure culture/language
conventions are among the things you will see that break software or make them
produce garbage output. This is a good examples of it and I suggest you study
it carefully. Theoretically this should be fixed by using overloads of those
string functions that take culture info parameters exclusively. This is
unfeasible however, more on that later.

You see, microsoft engineers thought that making all the relevant functions
such as float.Parse() locale dependent would make lives of programmers easier
since the functions would do the right thing™ by *default*. This is almost
NEVER what you want. Nobody in the right mind would ever think it is reasonable
for people write float.Parse(str, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture) every damn time
you don't want locale to be involved. It could've been an opt-in feature of the
library where you get locale dependent behavior if you _ask for it_ but no.
This shit is the reason your shitty csv/json parser crashes on a poor soul
living in some part of the world where comma instead of dot is used for decimal
numbers. This type of bullshit is the reason Visual Studio auto-complete used
to not show you "Invariant" when you enter "inv" because you happen to have a
tr-TR locale set on your computer. This right here is the reason some garbage
Asp.Net web page shows your purchase date in some retarded american format
because the server happens to be in USA.

Much can be said about how degenerate this global state dependent spooky action
at distance kind of nonsense is, to the point where you can convince anyone
that die-hard pure functional haskell fans were right all along. Things are
made worse by the fact that string interpolation and implicit string conversion
makes searching the problematic code rather inconceivable, and this cancerous
functionality is encouraged by the features integrated directly into the
language.

But the badness doesn't stop here. The people behind this glorious bullshit
were smart enough to make CultureInfo.CurrentCulture thread local (which btw
only prevents data races and retains all the disgusting ugliness a global state
can have), but not smart enough to make child threads inherit the locale from
its parent. Prior to .Net 4.5 every new thread would have its locale reset to
whatever the OS current is, which broke things even if you've set
CurrentCulture in the main thread but forgot to set it for each and every
thread you (or worse, a library you use) spawned!

At some point they must have realized how fucked up this whole situation is,
which resulted in an attempt to fix it by introducing _another_ property called
DefaultThreadCurrentCulture which determines what locale a new thread would get
initialized to. Don't be fooled into believing that this finally does solve
things sanely, as this is completely broken crap simply because it is an
application-wide global variable meaning that any thread at any time can change
it to facilitate subsequent threads they spawn to have a certain locale, except
of course it is not possible to do such thing in a multi-threaded environment
as you can not be sure if it changed just before you spawn a thread.
Unsurprisingly, the official docs for DefaultThreadCurrentCulture doesn't even
mention whether it is thread safe to mess with it as to keep you excited on
your coding journey.

So in order to avoid this utterly spectacular incompetence, we assign every
culture info setting to InvariantCulture and hope that no library under the sun
touches these abominations like CurrentCulture and its variants.

Add support for non-zero (but still not-None) out_axes in pmap

Previously `pmap` didn't have the `out_axes` parameter (unlike `vmap`),
but its semantics would match the specification of `out_axes=0` (i.e.
all outputs should be stacked along the first axis). This patch makes it
possible to specify non-zero values for out_axes, but more importantly
it lays down the groundwork for `xmap` which will have to use some
extremely similar (if not the same) code paths.

One thing to note is that when I started this implementation I was also
planning to add support for `out_axes=None`, which would allow us to
stop using the `unbroadcast` hack, and most of the code is written with
that in mind. Unfortunately it turned out that the correct
implementation of the transpose rule for maps that do allow unmapped
outputs would require me to pretty much simulate what avals-with-names
is supposed to achieve. Technically replicated outputs should work
today, for as long as the user does not do reverse-mode AD of `pmap`.
But I decided that it's better to just disable them altogether until we
can get the full and correct behavior.

* Implementation details *

This patch is significantly more involved than the one that implemented
general `in_axes` support. That previous one at least had the foundation
of `mapped_invars` which already behaved pretty similarly to general
`in_axes`. From a quick glance one might think that `out_axes` should
behave similarly to `in_axes`, but it turns out that this is not the
case, at least not if we're interested in keeping those primitives
final-style.

** Thunking **

The biggest difficulty with handling `out_axes` in final style
primitives is that we want to treat them as a prefix of the output
pytree, but we don't know the structure of the output pytree until the
user function is evaluated! And the user function is not evaluated until
we've applied all transforms and reached the impl rule! The solution to
this problem is "straightforward": instead of putting `out_axes` as a
primitive parameter, we bundle an `out_axes_thunk` which can only be
called successfully after the wrapped function has been executed. The
thunk returns a list of flat `out_axes`, expanded to the output pytree.
However, the thunking presents us with two problems:

*** Transformations ***

Each transformation that modifies the number of outputs needs to ensure
that the thunk is updated to reflect the new values. To make things
worse a lot of the transforms can learn the number of added outputs
_only after the wrapped function is evaluated_, which leads to the
following "time travel" pattern that can be found in most `Trace`s:
```py
@lu.transformation_with_aux
def compute_output_statistic(*args, **kwargs):
  outputs = yield args, kwargs
  yield outputs, compute_statistic(outputs)
wrapped_fun, output_statistic = compute_output_statistic(wrapped_fun)
def new_out_axes_thunk():
  old_out_axes = params['out_axes_thunk']()
  return compute_new_out_axes(old_out_axes(), output_statistic())
primitive.bind(wrapped_fun, dict(params, out_axes_thunk=new_out_axes_thunk))
```
The reason why we have to structure the code this way is that we can
only specify a new `out_axes_thunk` before we bind the primitive, but we
need the outputs of bind to know how to update the `out_axes_thunk`. To
make things worse, the implementation of `bind` is allowed to make a
call to `out_axes_thunk` _immediately after `wrapped_fun` is evaluated_.
This means that we cannot compute the output statistic in the
implementation of the transformation, but we have to use an extra
`lu.transformation_with_aux` for that (this populates the statistic
store immediately after `wrapped_fun` is evaluated).

The `compute_statistic` function depends on the transform in question.
E.g. in the JVP trace it counts the number of non-zero tangent results.

The situation is of course further complicated when we take
`post_process_map` into account. The new `process_env_traces` now always
sets up this funny time travel trampoline just in case it ends up being
necessary, and `post_process_map` is now expected to return `(outputs,
(todo, out_axes_transform))` instead of just `(outputs, todo)`.

*** Compilation cache ***

Because the `out_axes_thunk`s are now arguments to a _global_
compilation cache (in the form of `lu.cache` decorator on
`parallel_callable`), we have to ensure that they implement `hash` and
`==`. This is what forces us to add some slightly weird helpers such as
`_hashable_function` and `_ignore_elem_list`. The code that uses those
makes an assumption that the output pytree depends deterministically on
the identity of the wrapped function, which I think is in line with
general JAX assumptions. Otherwise the cache would depend on the
identity of the thunk, which changes with every function invocation.

Relaxing the global constraint on the cache (e.g. allowing each
`pmap(f)` instance to have a separate cache) would make this easier too.

* Why final style? *

Now, making the primitives initial-style would remove the necessity for
thunking, because we could have obtained the output pytree right when
the function is wrapped. I assumed there is a good argument for making
`pmap` pretend that it's a final-style primitive, but I'm not sure why
that is? I hope it's something better than just avoiding a single jaxpr
tracing.
