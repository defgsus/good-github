Migrate to use asyncio and aiohttp instead of fiber.py

The fiber.py code was a brilliant idea back before Python 3.4 introduced
its new asyncio model.  I am modernizing the code to use asyncio in order
to make use of the robust and well-maintained aiohttp package instead of
the somewhat fragile local implementation of the http protocol.

This fairly simple goal basically caused a complete rewrite of the code
(with no obvious "incremental steps"), so a "git diff" is close to useless
for understanding the changes.  Sorry about that, code spelunkers...

The migration to aiohttp will magically fix _some_ outstanding bugs (such
as the replicator's former inability to follow 3xx redirects), while no
doubt introducing some regressions and/or new bugs.  Hopefully the new
paradigm and its resulting in-tree code simplification will make future
maintenance easier, making the transition worthwhile...

*Note*
This commit includes one ugly hack that helps the code pass the test
suite, but almost certainly is just papering over a race condition which
still persists.  I am nevertheless making this a public release for any
feedback on the code as a whole, and hopefully for some interested party
to offer any insight about where the "stray" cancels are coming from and
how to avoid them correctly.  (See lines marked "hack" in replicator/Cache.py)
