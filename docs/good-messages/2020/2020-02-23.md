[android][home] 🤖 Add DevMenu on Android (#6829)

# Why

Fixes #6521 

# How

- Created unversioned `DevMenuManager` class which mostly just delegates calls to versioned `DevMenuModule` modules specific for SDK version. These modules are responsible for providing initial props, dev menu options and actions to run when these options are selected. The manager creates a new `ReactRootView` that bases on kernel's (home's) React instance manager and starts `HomeMenu` app which is registered as a second entry point in `home` and then, manager adds this root view to the currently used activity (it must implement `ExperienceActivity`). As I needed to know which experience activity is the current one, I've added `sCurrentActivity` static member to that class and just track it using activity's lifecycle methods.
- Backported `DevMenuModule` to all SDK versions included in the client. Including some changes between them - for example hot and fast reloading.
- Added support for back button and Android's menu press (which can be simulated by `adb shell input keyevent 82`).
- Removed some unused code related to `Nux` and replaced it with new onboarding screen (see #6793).
- Created new `ShakeDetector` which works more like on iOS. The one provided by React Native is annoying in most cases as it actually requires two shakes.
- Updated `ReactAndroidCodeTransformer` to turn off showing React Native dev menu in non-standalone apps.
- **To do after merging:** Rebuild versioned expoviews.

# Test Plan

- [x] Test on experience in debug mode
- [x] Test on experience in production mode
- [x] Test on snacks
- [x] Test on older SDKs
- [x] Test on simulators
- [x] Test that onboarding shows up once you open the experience for the first time or you didn't accept it yet (clicked `Got it` button).
- [x] Test that using dev menu still works once we kill home's activity.

12.1.Profile All Requests (Including Ajax){Debugging Mode; Distributed Profiling; Disabling Aggregation; Profiling All Requests; Checking out the Network Requests}

When you open the browser extension to create a profile, it has a few options that we've been... ignoring so far.

Debugging Mode
 Tip

Debugging mode is available via the Debugging add-on.

For example, "debugging mode" will tell Blackfire to disable pruning - that's when it removes data for functions that don't take a lot of resources - and also to disable anonymization - that's when it hides exact details used in SQL queries and HTTP requests. Debugging mode is nice if something weird is going on.. and you want to fully see what's happening inside a request.

Distributed Profiling
 Tip

Distributed profiling is available to Premium plan users or higher.

Another superpower of Blackfire is called distributed profiling... which you either won't care about... or it's the most awesome thing ever. Imagine you have a micro-service architecture where, when you load the page, it makes a few HTTP requests to some microservices. If you have Blackfire installed on all of your microservices, Blackfire will automatically create profiles for every request made to every app. The final result is a profile with sub-profiles that show you how the entire infrastructure is working together. It's... pretty incredible.
But, if you want to disable it and only profile this main app, you can do that with this option.

Disabling Aggregation
The last option is to "disable aggregation". That's a fancy way of telling Blackfire that you want to make & profile just one request, instead of making 10 requests and averaging the results.

Profiling All Requests
But what I really want to look at is this "Profile all requests" link. Hit "Record"... then refresh. Woh! Cool! It already made 2 requests! And if I scroll down a little bit... there's a third! Let's stop right there.
That jumps us to our Blackfire dashboard. These last three profiles were just created: one for the homepage and two others: these are both AJAX calls! Surprise! Without even thinking about it, we discovered a few extra requests that are part of that page.
This first one - /api/github-organization - is what loads this GitHub repository info on the right. This makes an API call for the most popular repositories under the Symfonycasts organization... which is kind of silly... but it was a great way to show how network requests look in Blackfire. We'll see that in a minute.
This other request - for /_sightings - is an AJAX call that powers the forever scroll on the page.
Basically... I like using "profile all requests" in 3 situations. One, to get an idea of what's all happening on a page. Two, to profile AJAX requests... though I'll show you another way to do that soon. And three, to profile form submits: fill out the form, hit "Record", then submit.

Checking out the Network Requests
Let's look closer at the /api/github-organization AJAX profile: https://bit.ly/sf-bf-github-org. As I mentioned, this makes a network request to the GitHub API to load repository information. The profile... is almost comical! Out of the 438 millisecond wall time - 82% of it is from curl_multi_select() - that's the time spent making any API calls.
It's kind of fun to look at this in the CPU dimension, which is only 74 milliseconds. curl_multi_exec() is still the biggest offender... but it's a lot less obvious what the critical path is. Compare that with the I/O wait dimension, which includes network time. The critical path is ridiculously obvious here. This is an extreme example of how different dimensions can be more or less useful depending on the situation.
One of the interesting things is that... this is not the full call graph. According to this, the code goes straight from handleRaw() - which is the first call into the Symfony Framework - to our controller. In reality, there are many more function calls in between. Switch back to the CPU dimension. Yep! This shows more nodes.
This is the result of that "pruning" I mentioned a few minutes ago. Blackfire removes function calls that don't consume any significant resources so that the critical path - from a performance standpoint - is more obvious. The call graph also automatically hides or shows some info based on what you're zoomed in on.
In this situation, the critical path is obvious. You can also see the network requests on top. There are actually two: one that returns 1.5 kilobytes and another that returns 5.
This shows the network time too... but at least if you're using the Symfony HTTP client like I am, these numbers aren't right - they're far too small... I think that's due to the asynchronous nature of Symfony's HTTP Client. That's ok - because the overall cost is showing up correctly in all the other dimensions.
So how do we fix this? Should we add some caching? Or somehow try to make only one API call instead of two? We're actually going to revisit and fix this problem later. For now, I wanted you to be aware of the "Profile All" feature. Next, let's check out the Blackfire command-line tool, which has two superpowers... one of which has nothing to do with the command line.

15.1.Timeline: Go Behind-the-Scenes with your Code

Click log in to find our super-secure login system. We not only give you a valid email address, but even the password! We're very generous to our users.
You can't tell, but now that we're logged in, a new piece of code is... silently running in the background on each request. Blackfire is going to help us notice this.

Back to the dev Environment
Before we profile this page, open up the .env file and switch back to the dev environment.
What I'm about to show you is more of a debugging tool than a profiling tool. We're switching back to the dev environment both to make our life a little bit easier - no need to clear the cache after changes - and because when your code executes more slowly, Blackfire tends to prune, or remove, less stuff. That's bad for trying to find performance issues, but good if your goal is to debug something... or understand how your app is working.
I'll refresh the page to make sure that it works. Yep! Our handy web debug toolbar on the bottom is back! Let's profile! I'll call this one [Recording] Homepage authenticated dev: http://bit.ly/sf-bf-timeline. Poetry.
When that finishes, as usual, click to view the call graph. Okay: there's not too much interesting here... especially because the DebugClassLoader stuff is once again adding noise that won't be there on production. It's not clear what the critical path is... and the page, at this point, is probably fast enough for me.

Hello Timeline
So let's look at something else: click the "Timeline" link. OooOOOOo. The timeline... other than just looking cool... is the place to go to... just... basically figure out how your app is working: how does the code flow through all the layers? What hidden things might be happening?
For example, this page apparently has 28 SQL queries. But where are these happening? Are they all in the controller? Are some in the controller and others are in the template? Are some coming from somewhere else we didn't even think of? That's something that the call graph can't really tell us.
I love the timeline... but I'll admit that the first few times I looked at this page... I didn't really understand what was going on... or how to make this useful. It looks simple enough - we can see the function calls and their child calls from left to right through the lifecycle of the request - but there's more to it.

Metrics
Let's start on the left: these timeline metrics. Metrics are basically a way that Blackfire groups function calls together and give them a label. For example, Blackfire knows that a specific function call means that an event is being dispatched. It finds those, labels all of them as symfony.events and give them this purple color so that they show up more clearly on the right. Here's one Symfony event right here... and there's another one.
It does the same thing for SQL queries: it knows that PDOStatement::execute(), PDO::query() and several other functions mean that an SQL query is being made. It groups them together, calls them sql and labels them as yellow. It's a great idea... and is just that simple.
Below this, there is another section called "Other Metrics". These are the same thing: meaningful groups of function calls. The only difference is that Blackfire does not give these a special color and they don't show up on the timeline. These are... just... raw data... that sit right here. If you're wondering why that would useful... I was too! For the purpose of the timeline, they are not useful. They'll come in handy later when we talk more about metrics. Metrics are their own big topic.

Finding Metrics in the Timeline
Let's look at one of the timeline metrics doctrine.entities.hydrated. What does this one mean? Sometimes the title of a metric will tell you a bit more... but often the metric name is all you really have. Most metrics are self-explanatory.
Depending on how well you know Doctrine, this might be obvious... or not. This metric refers to whenever one or more entities are hydrated into an object. Notice the count is 3. For this metric, it's not that there are only 3 objects being hydrated during this request, but that our code asks Doctrine to hydrate one or more objects on three occasions.
So where are the 3 times that we're hydrating objects? One of the cool things is that, when you hover over a timeline metric, it adds a border to the matching boxes on the right. It's... a little subtle... but it does the trick. I wish you could double-click and... maybe zoom to the matching boxes... but it's tricky because they may be spread out over the whole request.
If we hover over doctrine.entities.hydrated... hmm... I don't see those. You need to do a little bit of digging... I'll hover back over. There they are. It turns out that the 3 calls are not all in the same place: they're coming from three very different parts of our code. The first is part of the firewall... probably querying for the logged in user... and the other two are down in some template rendering... along with a few similarly-colored doctrine.dql.parsed items.
I want to look at what's happening inside of this template... but a lot of these things are really small. On top, we can see the entire timeline. Click where we want to start, move over, and let go! Zoom!
Much easier to see! In this spot, Doctrine parses its DQL, it makes an SQL query here... and a different query a bit later.
So as far as getting insight into what's really going on in your application, you can't get much better than this. You can even see our N+1 problem visually: it makes a query to count the comments little-by-little as the template renders.
Hit the "Home" icon to zoom back out. This is cool... but I mentioned that, as soon as we logged in, there was some new code that was now running in the background. Next, let's look a bit closer at the timeline to discover what that is and a hidden performance problem.

"1:55pm. Done with breakfast, chores and everything else. Let me finish ep 8 of the Toji No Miko game and then I am going to resume my harvest of employable skills. Though I have a lot of programming related skills by now, this webdev stuff is important. If I tried looking for a job, my prospects would be a lot poorer without what I am going to learn in the next few months.

Well, it is just a contingency plan in case my computer dies or something like that.

2:15pm. That was fun. Let me finally start. Really, so much of learning is setting up the right curriculum for oneself. Everybody wants to be a genius and learn without effort. It is unacknowledged how much time gets wasted in the process of finding the right path.

Now where do I start?

With the ASP.NET documentation.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/#pivot=core&panel=core_tutorials

Since the book is too much, let me start with this.

https://docs.microsoft.com/hr-hr/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio

Let me go with this.

2:25pm. https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie30

Thankfully the docs have plenty of tutorial material.

2:35pm. I am just daydreaming here rather that studying. I'll get a move on.

Yeah, I can get through this with some handholding. The docs should be exactly what I need. First come the docs, then come the books. And I will want to take a look at the source AST.NET when all is done, just like for VS Code. I am going to aim for complete mastery here. Rather than just learning a trick or two, it would be far better to completely shift my mindset to the next level.

Back in 2016 I did GUIs and that poker game. Originally I wanted everything to be graphical, but ended up being glued to the command line. The Windows GUI stuff turns out to be extremely tedious - the effort it takes to get GUIs to be a benefit is completely out of proportion. Maybe it would be different if I was working in Pharo, but that platform is too messy for me to be serious about it.

Back then and over the years, I'd get a thought that rather than looking down on webdev so much, that I should consider the browser as my platform of choice. I'd watched the videos on the browsers of the future being complete OSes.

So maybe I should have Spiral v0.2 target webassembly assuming it has GC (I read that it does not.)

Regardless, maybe after I am done with this I might conclude that the web is the platform that I need for my experiments.

2:45pm. It is not like I am completely doing this on a whim. I let the waves guide me, but I am the one that decided whether to move forward or stop.

Let me finally try that Razor tutorial."

Casino port

This is first phase of casino port where I have made my casino spaceship compatible with new chomp codebase. There isnt a connecting port at station yet due to changes being made to main map, but with second phase of casino port there should be one for casino shuttle to move back and forth to transfer visitors.

Non-casino changes
Port of:
purple assistant cap, wah!
wiggler hat, dont know if the sprite works fully yet.
The monocoole, every self respecting technomancer needs this! Also need this for casino rewards.
Snaps, can recommend for lunch, I prefer the licorice flavoured ones!
Space cleaner dispenser, yep any janitors dream, so far its only on casino spaceship.
Ported old modular sofa for station usage, is already on casino, future plans could involve making the modular sofa that can be built from steel be a little more pretty and made from wood as well and also get another overlay/color when added cloth for cushion.

also deleting a .txt file that I didnt get to delete before someone really wanted me to upload wip files so they could work off them, sorry about that but its fixed now!
deleted alienwhitelist and custom_items.txt since github doesnt seem to have those blacklisted

casino port:
Ported the map with the golden goose spacecasino
ported the deluxe edition bar and kitchen gear! Say hello to the good old deluxe dispenser, deluxe food vendor and deluxe drink vendor, perhaps one day they will be constructible by crew!
ported the casino stripper pole, casino roulette, slotmachine, poker/blackjack table, ported the casino wheel of fortune
casino wallet~
casino jukebox! And re implemented the system so the casino songs no longer are on the normal jukebox, sorry folks, hope you didnt like them too much :c
casino visitor and staff manual, might need a bit of revision depending on what event managers wants
Casino chips, gotta gamble with something!
fixed runtime errors from deluxe dispenser trying to add cartridges with reagents that have been renamed on new chomp

Be aware, there will be more casino changes in near future along with some other non-casino changes, including porting of pint metamorphic glass.

"2:50pm. Seriously, how do I disconnect from the Azure account? Every time I open a new project it remains connected to the old one.

...Uf I am not sure what to search for in Google. Well, forget that for now.

I'll deal with that later when I need to. For now focus on the tutorial.

3:10pm. Right now I am looking at various files including the bootstrap.js and jquery.js. Yeah, as bad as TS's OO stuff is, it is still a marked improvement over having a big library in JS with zero types.

```

This is actually readable unlike that the example from the book where it had machine generated content. Figuring this out should be doable.

I still have no idea what the bootstrap and jquery libraries are for. I'll get to that eventually.

3:15pm. Ok, ok, ok...

Stop reading random stuff. What does the tutorial say?

3:50pm. Had to take a break. Let me resume.

Today, my motivation and focus has been low. As expected, this is not my kind of programming and it will take a while till I get on track. But I will just keep plugging away at it.

Today, most of my effort has gone towards dreaming up what I will do with this webdev knowledge.

As long as proper ways of doing ML are still a mystery, I might as well focus on cleaning up all the auxiliaries. I'll do it. By the time 2022 arrives I will have something nice to show to the rest of the world.

4pm. https://docs.microsoft.com/hr-hr/aspnet/core/fundamentals/static-files?view=aspnetcore-3.1

Reading this stuff is beyond boring. Let me get back to the Razor tutorial. I'll figure the rest as I go along.

If it turns out that ASP.NET is not working for me, I'll ditch it for the time being and just study pure TS from one of the books.

At least with pure HTML and TS, I'll know where I stand and that will prepare me for this framework.

4:40pm. https://docs.microsoft.com/hr-hr/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/model?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio#test-the-app

I am getting a 404 error. This is not working for me.

My focus is dirt low.

I hate this.

I was prepared to learn HTML and TS/JS, but having these weird additions on the dotnet side, and having the IDE generate code is not my idea of programming. My immersion is horrible.

Ultimately, skill is something that is build from the ground up.

Forget learning complicated frameworks for the time being. I'll return to ASP.NET later. I can always look at the sample code for this to find out what is wrong.

I want and need to do this bottom up. Once you can trace what the program is doing every step of the way, then you can learn.

4:50pm. Incidentally, the inability to do this kind of learning is why I am so mad at modern math. Modern math is like these crappy framework tutorials. Do this, do that, magic happens and no whys are ever given.

The reason why Wildberger is a great lecturer is because he fundamentally understand what learning is about. He wants to integrate that understanding with what math itself should be. I am much the same. If I have a programming skill, I do want to generalize it. It is why I fell so hard for Spiral.

I am not just good at programming - I am programming. That is why I cannot abide by flaws in my technique. I am guessing math is the same for him.

4:55pm. Today seems like another botch. I should just move to a TS book, but tedium is really hitting me right now.

Once again, all this really shows how easy it is to go down the wrong path and cause time to be wasted. I really felt like I was getting flow back when I was reading the TS book. I need to get back to that.

5pm. Ouh...

But it really does seem like ASP.NET has a lot of what I would find useful. I need to level up first.

Uffff...this is the worst.

5:05pm. Let me do this - I'll give the first chapter of one of the TS books a try, so I can wisely spend whatever fuel I have left in me. "

        Top left of Brains to bottom right of Livers
        Outside edge is the border surrounding where you select the organs
    I scaled them by default, but you can adjust if its not correct

Adjust Globes GUI now displays Current Life, ES, and Mana %

    There is now a colorpicker on the right, load colors into it or copy from it

New delve openables string has been added to Loot Vacuum

    For anyone using non-1080 height, you will need to gather these captures

Improvements to the way the script loads, as well as how it will update
    You can now skip the update prompt without hanging the script
    There is now an option to use the Alpha branch as update source
        Use this with caution (This should be considered very unstable branch)
    Default branch is Master

New options to choose if and how often it will check for script updates
    The script will check for updates while the game is not found open
    Choose a timescale and interval to enable this option

Patch Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version .10.00 February/16/2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Save Files for the script are now all located in "save" folder
    If you want to migrate an old versions settings, you will need to move them
    This allows for users to easily understand which files are their settings
    I also cleared the main script folder of extrenuous files, just the main script
        Files required for the script are now located in data folder

Files you will need to move into the save folder:
    Settings.ini                  -->           /save/Settings.ini
    Profiles.ini                  -->           /save/Profiles.ini
    /data/Globe.json              -->           /save/Globe.json
    /data/LootFilter.json         -->           /save/LootFilter.json
    /data/LootFilterTabs.json     -->           /save/LootFilterTabs.json
    /data/Lootfilter.ini          -->           /save/Lootfilter.ini
    /data/IgnoredSlot.json        -->           /save/IgnoredSlot.json

New option to check for updates while the game is closed
    Configure the time scale, then the interval to automatically check for script updates
    Choose between Off, Days, Hours, or Minutes
        Choosing Off will disable automatically checking for updates
    Set the interval that you would like it to wait before checking
        Setting the interval to 0 will turn off checking for updates

Adjust Globes GUI now displays Current Life, ES, and Mana %
    MsgBox popups have been replaced with Notify panels
        The information is still copied to the clipboard for use
    There is now a colorpicker on the right
    Click any of the different areas "Colorbox" to load that color to the picker
    Use the Copy button get the current color, then paste into one of the color edit fields
    To get an average of colors, use the Coord button and select an area
        While active it will update the color picker to the mouse cursor
        This will take some time for large areas
        Once you are done paste into one of the color edit fields
    Reset button now reloads the values that were last loaded
        If you have saved settings, it will reset to the last loaded values
        If you have not saved to JSON it will load default scaled values

Game window is now bound when detected for further captures
    Logout and logic actions will happen while the game is in the background

A method of Pausing PoE-TradeMacro from parsing clipboard has been implimented
    Right click TradeMacro tray icon, > Edit Files > Custom Macros Example
    Copy the changes from the included txt file into your open editor, then save
    Essentially it adds a way for Wingman to send a message for it to pause

The script can now use predictive pricing from the PoEPrices.info API
    To enable this feature, select a pricepoint then the percentage of that price
    It defaults to 100 percent (the estimated values themselves)
    To enable using Predictive price while stashing, select the tab and tick the box
    The Item Info hotkey will now display the price and affixes influencing price
        they will appear inside the Prop list under PredictPrice and PredictPriceInfo
    It will save a copy of the results to an array
        Multiple queries to the same item will used Cached result
        Array is started fresh every script start

Loot vacuum has been improved with new openables list
    This is enabled only while in delve, and contains the items you find in the darkness
    If you are resampling these for another resolution:
        Copy the entire string to a document
        Follow the same naming pattern when making your sample, replace 1080 with your height
        If you want to have it become default option, submit your string and I can add to list

Utilities have been improved - new settings
    Can now support inversed Buff detection, will fire when buff is Found
    Can now use Mana as a triggered threshold
    Can now trigger utilities when pressing Primary or Secondary attack

Gamestates has been improved to allow for the game to be in the background
    tooltip no longer flickers because it will only update when there are changes
    OHB detection is now shown in the gamestates
    Colors of the display have been changed
        When everything shows green its all clear
        when anything is lit up red it will pause the script

Crafting tab has new option for filtering by item level
    Check the box to filter by ilvl, then set the minimum ilvl to stash

Globe scan areas are now scaled based on resolution
    it is still recommended to adjust these to ensure they work as expected

Bugfix for bulk vendor of flasks
    If the flask has been augmented it will use its actual quality value
    This is because quality 20 flasks only vendor on their own if not augmented
    This function still needs some more attention, not sure why random miscounts

Built new classes for use with the script
    PixelStatus is a simple class for managing pixel locations on the screen
    PanelManager is a wrapper class for groups of PixelStatus
        This class is a rewrite of the GuiStatus function
    ColorPicker is a class for inserting a new Color Picker GUI into windows
        This manages a group of Progress_Slider and associated text fields / buttons
    Progress_Slider was written by HellBent on the AHK forums, modified for my use

CLF menu adjusted to space the groups better

Hoard added to openable containers

Bugfix for PoE.Ninja json data being parsed incorrectly

Bugfix for Incubator items not being able to be sorted by the CLF

DC no longer requires to choose type of executable, it will auto find the active game
    If it cannot find the active game, it will attempt to dc every known process name

Autoupdate will no longer hang the script if you decide to close the window
    This will allow you to leave auto updates on, but skip the update by pressing esc
