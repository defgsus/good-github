We're moving to a `beta` ‚Ä∫ `latest` release pipeline, where all non-hotfix changes are first released in a beta before being promoted to a stable release.

We'd love it if you'd start using the latest betas and let us know early and often if you find any bugs or regressions!

v6.10.0-beta.1 ‚Äì Milk and Cookies ü•õüç™

Featured in this release is a new flag `--deasync` which enables users to synchronizes ganache server startup. It's useful in certain scenarios - see ganache-cli issue [#733](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/issues/733).

We've fixed a bug that caused the `--port` option to be ignored in forking mode. This mostly affects users developing in a remote environment.

We now gracefully handle SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGHUP on all applicable OS's.

And finally, we've included some changes to our deployment and automation:
 * We've gone ahead and update our webpack version to the latest stable version.
 * We're now using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate the deployment of ganache-cli updates. We hope this enables us to release more frequently to better support ganache-cli users!

Fix: T71040 / T58983 Ocean Modifier crashes at high resolutions

This is not as much a fix as a work around, but given the real
involves replacing how we build fftw, it is not eligible for 2.83
which is in BCON3 already.

The root of the issue lies with (how we build) fftw3

The first issue is: fftw does not build with MSVC, there are other
dependencies that are not compatible with MSVC and for those we
build the libraries required with mingw64, same for fftw

The second issue is: for reasons unknown we really really really
liked all deps to link statically so wherever possible we did so.

Now during the building of the fftw it linked a few symbols from
libgcc (which we do not ship) like __chkstk_ms, for which we passed
some flags to stop generating calls to it. Problem solved! There
is no way this could possibly turn around and bite us in the rear.

fast forward to today mystery crashes that look like a race condition.

What is happening is, we tell the linker that each thread will require
a 2-megabyte stack, now if every thread immediately allocated 2 megs,
that be 'rough' on the memory usage. So, what happens is (for all apps
not just blender), 2 megs are reserved but not backed by any real memory
and the first page is allocated for use by the stack, now as the stack
grows, it will eventually grow out of that first page, and end up in
an area that has not been allocated yet, to deal with that the allocated
page is followed by a guard page, someone touches the guard page it's
time to grow the stack!

Meanwhile in FFTW is it's doing substantial allocation using alloca
(up to 64 kb) on the stack, jumping over the guard page, and ending
up in reserved but not yet committed memory, causing an access violation.

Now if you think, that doesn't sound right! something should have
protected us from that! You are correct! That thing was __chkstk_ms
which we disabled.

Given we do not want a dependency on libgcc while building with MSVC
the proper solution is to build fftw as a shared library which will
statically link any bits and pieces it needs, however that change
is a little bit too big to be doing in BCON3.

So as a work around, we change the size the stack grows from 8k to
68k which gives fftw a little bit more wiggle room to keep it out
of trouble most of the time.

Note this only sidesteps the issue, this may come up again if the
conditions are just right, and a proper solution will need to be
implemented for 2.90.

Pulling the Alarms (#64)

OK this is thee alarm system.
might be easier to get an overview from the docs:
https://ventilator.readthedocs.io/en/gui/alarm.html

Overview (sorry this is all out of order i'm really really hungry and am racing to go eat):

    AlarmType - There a specific set of alarms that can be triggered, rather than any out-of-bounds value, so it's actually an alarm system.
    AlarmSeverity - Explicit enum allows alarm severity to be compared numerically
    Alarm_Rule s describe how an alarm behaves, including what triggers what severity of alarm. They consist of a tuple of (AlarmSeverity, Condition) tuples. They also define whether an alarm latches or not (persistent) alarms are not implemented
    Conditions have essentially one check method that takes SensorValues. They can be subclassed to add iteratively complex behavior (easier to just see for yourself i think), and can also be + added together to require multiple conditions to be true for a given alarm severity.
    Conditions can also declare dependencies like being some transformation (subtract, multiple, any callable) of a ControlSetting . eg 115% of PIP. (tests are not finished for this)
    An Alarm_Rule check s each of its conditions -- each 'multiple (added)' Condition terminates at its first False so they're not super wasteful -- and emits the highest severity alarm that is true
    The default Alarm_Rules are declared in /vent/alarm/__init__.py
    The Alarm_Manager handles all the logic of raising, suppressing, and storing alarms. There can only be one Alarm_Manager instance, so it is safe to use instantiation to get a reference to it. The alarm manager loads the default alarms on creation. The alarm manager accepts SensorValues in its update method, which then checks all of its rules.
    The Alarm_Manager is evented -- it doesn't poll, but can be updated with new SensorValues whenever needed. You are not supposed to poll the Alarm_Manager (like get_alarms) - instead you should add_callback and give it a callable that will be called with an Alarm anytime it is emitted.
    Alarms can be cleared - they won't be raised until the alarm state becomes OFF and back on again.
    Alarms can be snoozed - they wont' be raised until some time has passed
    Alarms can be latched - once an alarm is raised, it won't be turned off until its rule is OFF AND the user calls dismiss_alarm .
    Alarms that increase the AlarmSeverity are always emitted (unless they are snoozed or cleared). Alarms that decrease the AlarmSeverity are only emitted if the alarm is not latched.
    There is only one emit method, alarms are turned off by emitting an alarm with a severity of OFF.
    Alarms that are cleared are added to a list of logged_alarms but this needs to be integrated with whatever logging module @mschottdorf (i believe?) cooks up. Since the Alarm_Manager is evented, each Alarm object is self-descriptive, and turning alarms OFF is implemented using the same methods and objects (rather than by, say, deleting objects), logging should only need to be implemented in a single method that is added to the Alarm_Manager's callbacks.

Other stuff

    alarms added to the docs, i think most of it is ~75% documented
    all alarm tests in the coordinator and controller have been commented out, those will need to be rewritten but they shouldn't be radically different. This is also true of the control module and coordinator classes themselves -- the control_module now no longer needs to be involved with alarms, however, and the coordinator only needs to register a callback that will log alarms.
    AlarmSeverity enum has been renamed from GREEN, YELLOW, RED to OFF, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
    SensorValues now ensures that it is given a value for every item in values.SENSOR, and takes them as a dictionary rather than by unpacking **kwargs. as such no empty SensorValues objects can be instantiated
    SensorValues has __getitem__ and __setitem__ so sensor values can be accessed and set both as instance attributes but also like a dictionary (sensor['PRESSURE'])
    SensorValues now has an additional_values attribute that keeps track of the values that the controller generates and sends like timestamp, cycle counter, etc. there's certainly a better way of doing that but it works for now.
    SensorValues and the control_module have been updated to also track the current breath cycle (with itertools.count , otherwise just slipped into your existing code @mschottdorf ) -- this is useful for alarms that depend on, well, breath cycles. I'll need some help writing a test to make sure that number is actually accurate and i did it right
    also have added a few GUI tests, but since I'm about to rewrite the damn thing i figured i should wait on that.
    values now has all values in ValueName declared in VALUES. CONTROL and SENSOR are built from VALUE based on two new parameters, control and sensor.
    there's a real real janky mock of pigpio in vent/io/devices/base

~ TODO ~

    there is a skeletal alarm_manager that the gui still uses, i'll be replacing that with interactions with the real alarm manger, just ignore that for now.
    dependencies in conditions need to be tested
    gui needs to be brought to its final form

but otherwise ya what up

Started the frontend development.

logo, background and main salesman btn's in place.
NO FUNTIONALITY added.
had issues connecting to the stylesheet so for the time being the styles are within the html file.

not tested with localhost because of reacuring FUCKING issue with the packages or sm shit . btw i hate intelliJ. Hey we support css! But only if you have ultimate. fuck you. fall dead n die.

dont know if we use the thymeleaf to connect as well or what happened, but had issues with images being in the resource package so had to add them within the templates/home where the main html file was. sry, we fix later
