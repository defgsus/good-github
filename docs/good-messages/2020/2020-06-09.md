Fix and nerf hygienebots (#51307)

About The Pull Request

This is a three-part PR:

    Firstly, it fixes bugs for hygienebot construction. There were two present that mostly cancelled each other out: first, temporarilyRemoveItemFromInventory expects that the item passed to it will be deleted shortly after. It removes the item from mob's hands but keeps loc in the mob. Hygienebots are using a stack in their construction, so the assumption was not correct. The tubing stack appeared deleted (it was actually hidden). Second, do_after was written wrongly and would allow people to build hygienebots without consuming any tubing, if not for the first bug removing it. Their sprites were also moved to other bots.
    Secondly, I added a proximity sensor into construction. I know bots are powered by magic and coder tears, but building it out of two metal sheets, a hole, and a tube is ridiculous even for those standards. Also literally every single bot uses proximity sensors. This change will make them less spammable, because I've seen upwards of 10 being build for the funzies.
    Thirdly, I nerfed the hygienebots themselves. First, they no longer start slipping everything in their path when they're chasing someone for 5 seconds. This is stupid, no other bot is as disruptive as that, it doesn't make sense to give them slipping everything in their path as a part of normal operation. Combined with hygienebot spam, this was just shitty all-around. They still slip the tile they clean, but no more than that. Second, I made them less spammy; instead of a flat 60% chance to yell at people, it slowly increases to that number. I removed the vasectomy line (WTF?). Finally, they will now drop their target if it gets too far; previously they'd chase it forever.

Fixes #50159
#50191 - not fully fixed
Fixes #50339
Why It's Good For The Game

It requires about 0.7 brain cells and autolathe access to make slipper go brr, and there's no abundance of greyshirts in bloody shoes running around and turning station's hallways into a mass slip'n'slide.
