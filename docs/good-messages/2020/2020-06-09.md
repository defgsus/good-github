Koopa's Invaders! v1.0

It's here! The final major update to Koopa's Invaders! This project is an accumulation of the knowledge and skills I've gained while earning my computer science degree at UTSA. I've been working on this game for the past 5 years and finally am reaching an end to the journey. I've strengthened an enormous passion of mine for game design and development through this project and accomplished things I've only dreamed of accomplishing before.

This update comes equipped with XInput support, DirectInput support, controller mapping, more items/fireballs/songs, networking/online leaderboards, encryption, credits, help screen, playlist settings, data corruption prevention/data recovery, cheat codes, +so much more & countless bug fixes. I have worked intensely on this project since the last update a year ago which brings the project to a closing point. Here's a special thanks to Madi for giving me the idea to do this project and I encourage everyone to give the game a try and hop on the leaderboards! King Koopa is awaiting your arrival :)

"9:20am. I could have gotten up earlier, but there was some bad weather that I needed to wait for it to clear.

9:25am. Let me do my reading and then I will start.

And holy shit, nobody is answering my issues. What a load of crock. I might need to dive into the code myself at this rate.

10:10am. Let me start.

Today I somehow did not have enough time in the morning to enjoy myself properly, but that does not matter.

10:15am. Let me do some work. There will be plenty of time to lead the Overlord epilogue during the break.

10:20am.

```fs
type ClientMsgs =
    | ProjectFile of {|spiprojDir : string; spiprojText : string|}
    | File of {|spiprojDir : string; text : string|}
```

The first step is here.

10:25am. I need some time to think about it.

10:30am. Hmmm...forget the stuff on the VS Code side for a while. Already I am confronted with the full difficulty of doing that reactive pipeline.

```fs
        | ProjectFile x ->
            msg.Push(config x.spiprojDir x.spiprojText |> process_errors |> Json.serialize)
```

I won't worry about the exact way I want to pass the schema. Instead I need to do the result right now.

10:35am. This is going to be tough. Reactive combinators sort of give me what I need, but not completely. It is hard. I think that I might need to write my own combinators. And that means fully mastering them. Right now I am only at the intermediate stage. Doing the reactive pipeline won't be easy, but it will be something to separate the me of now from who I was before.

Spiral v0.2 is my message to the world that I am moving to the next stage.

10:40am. Now let me mop up some side stuff. I need to also ask how to dispose Req sockets.

10:45am. Writing that thing out is making me realize that the equivalent NetMQ version of the client would just block forever. So the way to do disposal would be to add timeouts.

```
const client = async (spiprojDir: string, spiprojText: string) => {
    const sock = new zmq.Request();
    sock.receiveTimeout = 30e3;
```

That should take care of that.

11am. I am thinking. I am thinking.

I am completely serious here.

What I need to do the reactive pipeline are reactive combinators, but they need to be completely hot everywhere.

I need to generalize that thing I did in the UI with the agent. I essentially want agents that are subscribable. And I do not need `onComplete` and `onError`. I also do not need every agent to have its own thread.

Actually, it is not that I do not need `onError`. It is more like I do not want it to mute the pipeline.

11:10am. Let me take a little break. What I should be doing here is prototyping.

After that I should study the Rx source again. I really should get to the bottom of each of the questions that I had for it.

11:40am. I am sitting in this chair just thinking. I need more - more skill. I know all the features that the pipeline should posses. That has been worked out.

Likewise, my technique and conceptual understanding when it comes to push concurrency is solid. But I am not all the way there yet. I need more knowledge.

11:45am. I need to think about it more. Right now I've yet to even form the basic goals on how to overcome this block.

It is fine. None of this is trivial. I am not going to rush this. I should take my time to attain complete and absolute mastery of push based concurrency.

Pretty much everything I want with this pipeline falls between the cracks that existing techniques do not cover.

While doing the UI I've really been hurt quite a bit by the library not having `mapFold` and better support for hot observables.

When it comes to doing hot observables, the first thing that comes to mind is `distinct` and its variants. I should definitely study that.

12pm. It is already this late. I am in a hot state where I cannot move forward, and I cannot move back. Doing this reactive pipeline will be another great challenge for me.

Yeah, 2020 is the year of concurrnecy for me, much like 2019 was the year of mathematics and 2018 the year of staged functional programming. Every year has its theme. I should take my time to savor it.

12:05pm. Let me force the off switch for a bit here. There will be plenty of time to wrack my brain once it is time to resume.

Today it does not look like I will be doing any programming. Maybe I will step away from the screen to just think. I should take this challenge slowly."

Fix and nerf hygienebots (#51307)

About The Pull Request

This is a three-part PR:

    Firstly, it fixes bugs for hygienebot construction. There were two present that mostly cancelled each other out: first, temporarilyRemoveItemFromInventory expects that the item passed to it will be deleted shortly after. It removes the item from mob's hands but keeps loc in the mob. Hygienebots are using a stack in their construction, so the assumption was not correct. The tubing stack appeared deleted (it was actually hidden). Second, do_after was written wrongly and would allow people to build hygienebots without consuming any tubing, if not for the first bug removing it. Their sprites were also moved to other bots.
    Secondly, I added a proximity sensor into construction. I know bots are powered by magic and coder tears, but building it out of two metal sheets, a hole, and a tube is ridiculous even for those standards. Also literally every single bot uses proximity sensors. This change will make them less spammable, because I've seen upwards of 10 being build for the funzies.
    Thirdly, I nerfed the hygienebots themselves. First, they no longer start slipping everything in their path when they're chasing someone for 5 seconds. This is stupid, no other bot is as disruptive as that, it doesn't make sense to give them slipping everything in their path as a part of normal operation. Combined with hygienebot spam, this was just shitty all-around. They still slip the tile they clean, but no more than that. Second, I made them less spammy; instead of a flat 60% chance to yell at people, it slowly increases to that number. I removed the vasectomy line (WTF?). Finally, they will now drop their target if it gets too far; previously they'd chase it forever.

Fixes #50159
#50191 - not fully fixed
Fixes #50339
Why It's Good For The Game

It requires about 0.7 brain cells and autolathe access to make slipper go brr, and there's no abundance of greyshirts in bloody shoes running around and turning station's hallways into a mass slip'n'slide.
Changelog

üÜë
fix: Hygienebot construction has been fixed.
balance: Hygienebots now require a proximity sensor between welding and tubing.
balance: Hygienebots no longer slip their path while chasing someone.

Lets you tip over medbots (you monster) (#51409)

About The Pull Request

dreamseeker_2020-06-01_03-34-53.png

A while ago I read a book about people and robots and emotions, Alone Together by Sherry Turkle, and there's one passage that talks about people's reactions to robots simulating distress, specifically with how Furbies cry when you hold them upside down.

    A person is asked to invert three creatures: a Barbie doll, a Furby, and a biological gerbil. [Freedom] Baird's question is simple: "How long can you hold the object upside down before your emotions make you turn it back?"

    People are surprised by how upset they get in this theater of distress. And then they get upset that they are upset. They often try to reassure themselves, saying things like, ‚ÄúChill, chill, it‚Äôs only a toy!‚Äù They are experiencing something new: you can feel bad about yourself for how you behave with a computer program. Adults come to the upside-down test knowing two things: the Furby is a machine and they are not torturers. By the end, with a whimpering Furby in tow, they are on new ethical terrain.

Ethics memes aside, the idea off people being caught off guard at their guilt for causing harm to inanimate objects is really funny to me, and feels extra relevant to SS13. Considering people already regularly get in fights and maim each other over harming station pets, I picture this being a great source of arguments and fights ICly over what torturing a cute lil' medbot says about you.

tl;dr this PR lets you tip over medbots which prevents them from moving or healing, and they'll slowly get more and more distressed and desperate asking for help from people around them. After a few minutes, if no one helps right them, they'll manage to right themselves up and snitch on whoever tipped them over to medical so the psychologist can keep an eye on them.

dreamseeker_2020-06-01_03-48-25.png
Why It's Good For The Game

Gives the psychologist more ammo to call people crazy, gives bored assistants another way to seek attention, provides source of minor IC conflict
Changelog

üÜë Ryll/Shaps
add: You can now tip over medbots!
/üÜë

I'd like to get voicelines for these as well, but I wasn't sure of a good TTS generator, and also wanted to see if people think this is worth doing before devoting too much time to it.

Tramadol

Form of Tramadol:-
In the form of an oral tablet, tramadol is available. Patients who buy Tramadol receive instructions on how to use the drug. Tramadol is usually taken for pain every 4 to 6 hours. To determine the tolerance of a patient, doctors can start the patient on a low dose and, if appropriate, gradually increase the dose. Due to the habit-forming aspect of this drug, patients will take the prescription as directed.Thus, avoid taking too much of the drug, and avoid taking the drug for long periods.
Side Effects of Tramadol:-
Tramadol's most common adverse effects include nausea,dizziness, dry mouth, indigestion, abdominal pain, vertigo, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, and headache. Respiratory depression and constipation are thought to be less ofa Tramadol problem compared to other opioids. 
Longterm use of high doses of Tramadol 50mg causes physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. These include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with removal of serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; symptoms include numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and tinnitus. Psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and co-operative symptoms.

Use a sticky nav (instead of the builtin bulma fixed one)

Yes, this was fiddly to eventually decide on. It's not ideal, as sticky
positioning is perfectly supported on everything, however, for now it'll
work. Also, even it fails, the default fallback will just be to not have
a sticky header at all, so it'll be fine.

The official bulma solution is really difficult to pull off, mostly
because, it's an incredible pain in the ass to add classnames to the
body or html elements well. It can be done, but with a bunch of annoying
caveats.

Update example to use friendly error messages

Dearest Reviewer,

Right now if you can not load a file it says something like fopen failed. Adding an expects with which file failed would help a beginner out greatly. 

I have also personally changed the output file name to be the {base name of the source}-{base name of the content}-{step_id}  to help me save all my amazing images. That can be another change or an exercise  for the reader.

Thanks again for the amazing example.

Becker

Changes:
Moved from `?` to `expect` with a message when loading the inputed files.

Inference annotations that can be read by an external tool

This builds on top of #35831, letting inference emit a custom message
whenever it gives up on infering something. These messages are intended
to be displayed by external tools, either to debug what inference is doing
(e.g. for Cthulhu) or, if an external compiler needs to disallow certain
kinds of missing information (e.g. no dynamic dispatch on GPUs), can be
used to improve diagnostics. This is mostly a proof of concept, I think
these messages/hooks need to be a bit richer for a full solution, though
I think this can be already useful if we hook up something like Cthulhu.
As a proof of concept, I hacked up a 10 line function that reads these messagse.
It works something like the following:

```
function bar()
    sin = eval(:sin)
    sin(1)
end
foo() = bar()
```

```
julia> Compiler3.analyze_static(Tuple{typeof(foo)})
In function: bar()
ERROR: The called function was unknown
1| function bar()
2|     sin = eval(:sin)
=>     sin(1)
4| end

[1] In foo()
```

The reason this needs to sit on top of #35831 is that it needs to run
with a completely fresh cache, which #35831 provides the primitives for.
Otherwise, while you could still get the annotations out, that would
only work the first time something is inferred anywhere in the system.
With a fresh cache, everything is analyzed again, and any messages like
these that are opted in to can be collected.

Remove unnecessary references to slavery

The horrible effects of human slavery continue to impact society.  The
casual use of the term "slave" in computer software is an unnecessary
reference to a painful human experience.

This commit removes all possible references to the term "slave".

Implementation notes:

The zpool.d/slaves script is renamed to dm-deps, which uses the same
terminology as `dmsetup deps`.

References to the `/sys/class/block/$dev/slaves` directory remain.  This
directory name is determined by the Linux kernel.  Although
`dmsetup deps` provides the same information, it unfortunately requires
elevated privileges, whereas the `/sys/...` directory is world-readable.
