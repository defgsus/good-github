sched/core: Implement new approach to scale select_idle_cpu()

Hackbench recently suffered a bunch of pain, first by commit:

  4c77b18cf8b7 ("sched/fair: Make select_idle_cpu() more aggressive")

and then by commit:

  c743f0a5c50f ("sched/fair, cpumask: Export for_each_cpu_wrap()")

which fixed a bug in the initial for_each_cpu_wrap() implementation
that made select_idle_cpu() even more expensive. The bug was that it
would skip over CPUs when bits were consequtive in the bitmask.

This however gave me an idea to fix select_idle_cpu(); where the old
scheme was a cliff-edge throttle on idle scanning, this introduces a
more gradual approach. Instead of stopping to scan entirely, we limit
how many CPUs we scan.

Initial benchmarks show that it mostly recovers hackbench while not
hurting anything else, except Mason's schbench, but not as bad as the
old thing.

It also appears to recover the tbench high-end, which also suffered like
hackbench.

Plasmeme support baybee

SOOOOOO, what this does is:
Adds two new uplink items: Plasmaman Syndicate Hardsuits.
They are more costly, however they provide innate space protection and no slowdown.
Also adds a paper that warns plasmemes that the normal hardsuits won't work.
Oh yeah and also unfucks my adding it on the .dme using / instead of \

Build webui from multiple components into a single bundle ...
...
and embed it in application's main binary file directly: well,
partial success. Webview-rs uses MS Edge as a web engine on Windows,
and... where do I begin.

* You can't run local web server and get
assets from there because Microsoft's security policies concerning
Edge sandboxing directly prevent this.

* You also can't use file:// URLs in Edge for the same reason.

So, what CAN you actually do if you want to embed a whole web
frontend into your application?

Well. You can bundle all of your assets into a single file,
embed it using Rust's preprocessing directives (god I'm starting
to love these), and inject them as a uu64enc'd text directly
through URL using WebView's navigate() function, yay!

1. That's quite a hack here.
2. And it's also quite slow (Openlayers library is like 900kb
and it load time is near 30 seconds on my machine).

...

So, okay, we're embedding everething besides it, and we continue
to download openlayers library from web cdn each time we
initialize.

Yeah, this is far from ideal, but for a hobby project that already
uses internet connection for OSM data?..

I don't like this approach, but let's leave things as they are for
now. At least now we can bundle something resembling a modern UI
framework into the application, let's start from there and return
to our issue with resource embedding sometime later.
