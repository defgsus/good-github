Adding a lot since my last commit. Have developed the growth mechanics. Different climates generate different food yields. Food storage is in effect. Bands will always prioritize moving into tiles with highest food yields. Also updated the UI to be prettier and better at conveying information I need. I really need to commit more because I am struggling to remember everything I did here. My next steps are adding rivers, refining growth mechanic, deciding when bands evolve, incorporating variations in growth rate based on lifestyle, and creating a map of the Middle East. Rivers will enhance yields for the tile. They will be a type of Terrain for the Region. This is coming along nicely. I am prett exicted. Oh yeah! I am planning on doing multiple instances of the map in the essay to model populations in different maps e.g. single tile versus whole Middle East. I would also like to get someone to draw me some art for it.

mm: replace TIF_MEMDIE checks by tsk_is_oom_victim

TIF_MEMDIE is set only to the tasks whick were either directly selected
by the OOM killer or passed through mark_oom_victim from the allocator
path.  tsk_is_oom_victim is more generic and allows to identify all
tasks (threads) which share the mm with the oom victim.

Please note that the freezer still needs to check TIF_MEMDIE because we
cannot thaw tasks which do not participage in oom_victims counting
otherwise a !TIF_MEMDIE task could interfere after oom_disbale returns.

Move to maven (#9)

* Move back to maven

Fuck that shit: Bin müde. IntelliJ will nicht, wie ich will. Compiler springt nach jedem IntelliJ-Neustart zurück auf Java 13 und jammert dass er nicht mit 13 compilen kann...

In maven kann ich schön sagen Java 8 und alles UTF-8 und er hält seine Fresse und macht einfach... Hätte Gradle genommen aber kb auf was fremdes. Nazi halt und so.
Ich weiß das Gradle auch maven repo etc. nutzen kann. Ich weiß dass Android Studio gradle nutzt. Aber juckt. Fremd = Böse hat uns die gute AFD beigebracht also done.

BACKPORT: signal: add pidfd_send_signal() syscall

The kill() syscall operates on process identifiers (pid). After a process
has exited its pid can be reused by another process. If a caller sends a
signal to a reused pid it will end up signaling the wrong process. This
issue has often surfaced and there has been a push to address this problem [1].

This patch uses file descriptors (fd) from proc/<pid> as stable handles on
struct pid. Even if a pid is recycled the handle will not change. The fd
can be used to send signals to the process it refers to.
Thus, the new syscall pidfd_send_signal() is introduced to solve this
problem. Instead of pids it operates on process fds (pidfd).

/* prototype and argument /*
long pidfd_send_signal(int pidfd, int sig, siginfo_t *info, unsigned int flags);

/* syscall number 424 */
The syscall number was chosen to be 424 to align with Arnd's rework in his
y2038 to minimize merge conflicts (cf. [25]).

In addition to the pidfd and signal argument it takes an additional
siginfo_t and flags argument. If the siginfo_t argument is NULL then
pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to kill(<positive-pid>, <signal>). If it
is not NULL pidfd_send_signal() is equivalent to rt_sigqueueinfo().
The flags argument is added to allow for future extensions of this syscall.
It currently needs to be passed as 0. Failing to do so will cause EINVAL.

/* pidfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
The pidfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of
rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and parts of the functionality of kill(2), Namely, when a
positive pid is passed to kill(2). It will however be possible to also
replace tgkill(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) if this syscall is extended.

/* sending signals to threads (tid) and process groups (pgid) */
Specifically, the pidfd_send_signal() syscall does currently not operate on
process groups or threads. This is left for future extensions.
In order to extend the syscall to allow sending signal to threads and
process groups appropriately named flags (e.g. PIDFD_TYPE_PGID, and
PIDFD_TYPE_TID) should be added. This implies that the flags argument will
determine what is signaled and not the file descriptor itself. Put in other
words, grouping in this api is a property of the flags argument not a
property of the file descriptor (cf. [13]). Clarification for this has been
requested by Eric (cf. [19]).
When appropriate extensions through the flags argument are added then
pidfd_send_signal() can additionally replace the part of kill(2) which
operates on process groups as well as the tgkill(2) and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2) syscalls.
How such an extension could be implemented has been very roughly sketched
in [14], [15], and [16]. However, this should not be taken as a commitment
to a particular implementation. There might be better ways to do it.
Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
possible (cf. [4]).

/* naming */
The syscall had various names throughout iterations of this patchset:
- procfd_signal()
- procfd_send_signal()
- taskfd_send_signal()
In the last round of reviews it was pointed out that given that if the
flags argument decides the scope of the signal instead of different types
of fds it might make sense to either settle for "procfd_" or "pidfd_" as
prefix. The community was willing to accept either (cf. [17] and [18]).
Given that one developer expressed strong preference for the "pidfd_"
prefix (cf. [13]) and with other developers less opinionated about the name
we should settle for "pidfd_" to avoid further bikeshedding.

The  "_send_signal" suffix was chosen to reflect the fact that the syscall
takes on the job of multiple syscalls. It is therefore intentional that the
name is not reminiscent of neither kill(2) nor rt_sigqueueinfo(2). Not the
fomer because it might imply that pidfd_send_signal() is a replacement for
kill(2), and not the latter because it is a hassle to remember the correct
spelling - especially for non-native speakers - and because it is not
descriptive enough of what the syscall actually does. The name
"pidfd_send_signal" makes it very clear that its job is to send signals.

/* zombies */
Zombies can be signaled just as any other process. No special error will be
reported since a zombie state is an unreliable state (cf. [3]). However,
this can be added as an extension through the @flags argument if the need
ever arises.

/* cross-namespace signals */
The patch currently enforces that the signaler and signalee either are in
the same pid namespace or that the signaler's pid namespace is an ancestor
of the signalee's pid namespace. This is done for the sake of simplicity
and because it is unclear to what values certain members of struct
siginfo_t would need to be set to (cf. [5], [6]).

/* compat syscalls */
It became clear that we would like to avoid adding compat syscalls
(cf. [7]).  The compat syscall handling is now done in kernel/signal.c
itself by adding __copy_siginfo_from_user_generic() which lets us avoid
compat syscalls (cf. [8]). It should be noted that the addition of
__copy_siginfo_from_user_any() is caused by a bug in the original
implementation of rt_sigqueueinfo(2) (cf. 12).
With upcoming rework for syscall handling things might improve
significantly (cf. [11]) and __copy_siginfo_from_user_any() will not gain
any additional callers.

/* testing */
This patch was tested on x64 and x86.

/* userspace usage */
An asciinema recording for the basic functionality can be found under [9].
With this patch a process can be killed via:

 #define _GNU_SOURCE
 #include <errno.h>
 #include <fcntl.h>
 #include <signal.h>

 {
 #ifdef __NR_pidfd_send_signal
         return syscall(__NR_pidfd_send_signal, pidfd, sig, info, flags);
 #else
         return -ENOSYS;

 }

 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 {
         int fd, ret, saved_errno, sig;

         if (argc < 3)
                 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

         fd = open(argv[1], O_DIRECTORY | O_CLOEXEC);
         if (fd < 0) {
                 printf("%s - Failed to open \"%s\"\n", strerror(errno), argv[1]);
                 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

         sig = atoi(argv[2]);

         printf("Sending signal %d to process %s\n", sig, argv[1]);
         ret = do_pidfd_send_signal(fd, sig, NULL, 0);

         saved_errno = errno;
         close(fd);
         errno = saved_errno;

         if (ret < 0) {
                 printf("%s - Failed to send signal %d to process %s\n",
                        strerror(errno), sig, argv[1]);
                 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

         exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

Q-01: (Florian Weimer [20], Andrew Morton [21])
      What happens when the target process has exited?
A-01: Sending the signal will fail with ESRCH (cf. [22]).

Q-02:  (Andrew Morton [21])
       Is the task_struct pinned by the fd?
A-02:  No. A reference to struct pid is kept. struct pid - as far as I
       understand - was created exactly for the reason to not require to
       pin struct task_struct (cf. [22]).

Q-03: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the entire procfs directory remain visible? Just one entry
      within it?
A-03: The same thing that happens right now when you hold a file descriptor
      to /proc/<pid> open (cf. [22]).

Q-04: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Does the pid remain reserved?
A-04: No. This patchset guarantees a stable handle not that pids are not
      recycled (cf. [22]).

Q-05: (Andrew Morton [21])
      Do attempts to signal that fd return errors?
A-05: See {Q,A}-01.

Q-06: (Andrew Morton [22])
      Is there a cleaner way of obtaining the fd? Another syscall perhaps.
A-06: Userspace can already trivially retrieve file descriptors from procfs
      so this is something that we will need to support anyway. Hence,
      there's no immediate need to add another syscalls just to make
      pidfd_send_signal() not dependent on the presence of procfs. However,
      adding a syscalls to get such file descriptors is planned for a
      future patchset (cf. [22]).

Q-07: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      This fd-for-a-process sounds like a handy thing and people may well
      think up other uses for it in the future, probably unrelated to
      signals. Are the code and the interface designed to permit such
      future applications?
A-07: Yes (cf. [22]).

Q-08: (Andrew Morton [21] and others)
      Now I think about it, why a new syscall? This thing is looking
      rather like an ioctl?
A-08: This has been extensively discussed. It was agreed that a syscall is
      preferred for a variety or reasons. Here are just a few taken from
      prior threads. Syscalls are safer than ioctl()s especially when
      signaling to fds. Processes are a core kernel concept so a syscall
      seems more appropriate. The layout of the syscall with its four
      arguments would require the addition of a custom struct for the
      ioctl() thereby causing at least the same amount or even more
      complexity for userspace than a simple syscall. The new syscall will
      replace multiple other pid-based syscalls (see description above).
      The file-descriptors-for-processes concept introduced with this
      syscall will be extended with other syscalls in the future. See also
      [22], [23] and various other threads already linked in here.

Q-09: (Florian Weimer [24])
      What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?
A-09:
      pidfds opened as O_PATH fds cannot be used to send signals to a
      process (cf. [2]). Signaling processes through pidfds is the
      equivalent of writing to a file. Thus, this is not an operation that
      operates "purely at the file descriptor level" as required by the
      open(2) manpage. See also [4].

"1:10pm. Wow, I am wasting time. Well, let me do it for a bit longer, do the chores and then I will start this thing.

2pm. Breakfast done, chores done. It is time to start studying Typescript. Let me go through that course. Then I will stop wasting time and try that demo plugin in Typescript itself.

I want to get this done rather than getting buried in APIs.

I am a programmer, so what I should be doing is programming. Studies are for the students.

Now where was I?

2:15pm. https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV273x+1T2019a/courseware/dbe869f1929d4e46b3b03e60361b9a24/7d6a7660b2544bfabc5d1bd7987aec44/?child=first

This is really boring. I should just skim this and learn as I go along.

This is super boring. Let me watch the video.

3:15pm. This is ultra super boring!!!

Let me finish module 2 and I will reconsider my path.

3:30pm. Let me go through section 3.

This is such a waste of time, but on the other hand, it is super basic so I have to do it to get a passing familiarity with Typescript.

3:55pm. I am taking a little break right now. The tedium of this is really doing me in.

4:30pm. Oh, TS compiler will automatically do the import statements as well. That is nice.

4:55pm. Finally done with section 3. Yeah, the tedium of going through this shit is definitely high. It seems easy tasks have a way of making up for it by being boring.

5pm. Ok, ok...

Let me just go through this last thing and then I'll quickly peek at the TS documentation.

5:10pm. Uf, let me take a break here. I need a break.

6:05pm. Done with lunch. Let me finish up the section 4 videos and then I am done for the day.

6:30pm. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html

This OO lingo for what should be simple function composition is getting to me.

Instead of trying to read through that course, I should have gone for the documentation instead.

6:35pm. But honestly there is no way I can do that right now. I am dead here.

This was so tedious, I was barely paying attention. Yet, I did my best. Tomorrow I will give the documentation a brush and after that I will jump straight into programming.

6:45pm. I need to start playing around with some basic plugins. I need to start establishing control over the editor. Once I do that, everything will be much easier.

7:05pm. When things get hard, it is easy to forget what your goals are. Constant remainders are needed to remain on course."

This commit re-implements the memory model used by macaw symbolic

There are two major changes:
- The interface to memory models in Data.Macaw.Symbolic has changed
- The suggested implementation in Data.Macaw.Symbolic.Memory has changed

The change improves performance and fixes a soundness bug.

* `macawExtensions` (Data.Macaw.Symbolic) takes a new argument: a `MkGlobalPointerValidityPred`.  Use `mkGlobalPointerValidityPred` to provide one.
* `mapRegionPointers` no longer takes a default pointer argument (delete it at call sites)
* `GlobalMap` returns an `LLVMPtr sym w` instead of a `Maybe (LLVMPtr sym w)`

Users of the suggested memory model do not need to worry about the last change,
as it has been migrated.  If you provided your own address mapping function, it
must now be total.  This is annoying, but the old API was unsound because
macaw-symbolic did not have enough information to correctly handle the `Nothing`
case.  The idea of the change is that the mapping function should translate any
concrete pointers as appropriate, while symbolic pointers should generate a mux
over all possible allocations.  Unfortunately, macaw-symbolic does not have
enough information to generate the mux itself, as there may be allocations
created externally.

This interface and implementation is concerned with handling pointers to static
memory in a binary.  These are distinguished from pointers to
dynamically-allocated or stack memory because many machine code instructions
compute bitvectors and treat them as pointers.  In the LLVM memory model used by
macaw-symbolic, each memory allocation has a block identifier (a natural
number).  The stack and each heap allocation get unique block identifiers.
However, pointers to static memory have no block identifier and must be mapped
to a block in order to fit into the LLVM memory model.

The previous implementation assigned each mapped memory segment in a binary to
its own LLVM memory allocation.  This had the nice property of implicitly
proving that no memory access was touching unmapped memory.  Unfortunately, it
was especially inefficient in the presence of symbolic reads and writes, as it
generated mux trees over all possible allocations and significantly slowed
symbolic execution.

The new memory model implementation (in Data.Macaw.Symbolic.Memory) instead uses
a single allocation for all static allocations.  This pushes more of the logic
for resolving reads and writes into the SMT solver and the theory of arrays.  In
cases where sufficient constraints exist in path conditions, this means that we
can support symbolic reads and writes.  Additionally, since we have only a
single SMT array backing all allocations, mapping bitvectors to LLVM pointers in
the memory model is trivial: we just change their block identifier from zero
(denoting a bitvector) to the block identifier of the unique allocation backing
static data.

This change has to do some extra work to ensure safety (especially that unmapped
memory is never written to or read from).  This is handled with the
MkGlobalPointerValidityPred interface in Data.Macaw.Symbolic.  This function,
which is passed to the macaw-symbolic initialization, constructs well-formedness
predicates for all pointers used to access memory.  Symbolic execution tasks
that do not need to enforce this property can simply provide a function that
never returns any predicates to check.  Implementations that want a reasonable
default can use the mkGlobalPointerValidityPred from Data.Macaw.Symbolic.Memory.
The default implementation ensures that no reads or writes touch unmapped memory
and that writes to static data never write to read-only segments.

This change also converts the examples in macaw-symbolic haddocks to use doctest
to ensure that they do not get out of date.  These are checked as part of CI.

basically reverse-engineering javafx's word wrap algorithm

my latest theory is the few remaining discrepancies (in the number of rows
I think we need vs the rows the wrapped text actually takes up)
are being caused by my algo not accounting for the word boundary-preservation
that the javafx wrapping algo does.

I wish I could just find the algorithm that JavaFx uses somewhere in its
codebase, but although it's technically open source it may as well not be.

The JavaFx source incredibly difficult to navidate,
 and I haven't anything remotely related to the actual wrapping or layout
  functionality's implementation.

Just want to take a moment to vomit about how utterly shite the design is.
Everything is coupled to everything else, meaning nothing can be
pulled out or reused, without it also requiring seemingly the rest of JavaFx.
Nothing can be subclassed.
300 line classes are embedded inside other 400 line classes,
hiding them from the world.

Such an ugly piece of shit codebase.

Even from an outside perspective, so much essential functionality is
hidden behind a failed attempt to use CSS for styling.
So many missing Java APIs.
Using CSS Strings removes Java's biggest advantages:
 compile-time checking and type safety.
What a stupid idea.

They didn't even manage to fully implement CSS.
They've got neither a complete Java API to their components,
nor a compliant or complete CSS interface.

I deeply, deeply dislike the design decisions made.

The only excuse is that this code was probably written around 2006,
and was only originally intended to be closed source.

The saving grace is the ubiquitous javadoc.

C3M0_A: Brainstorming

@afadoomer - I am currently rethinking the gameplay in this map as I am not sure what the best decision is. That's why I want to ask you as well for your thoughts.

Currently we added the day-night cycle to the map, making it partially a really stresful job beating the map. No time to tell the story, no time to "discover" everything. On the other hand it's a nice feature in general to have the cycle. But is it really necessary?

I am thinking about stripping the whole day/night cycle from the map and turning it in a horror-survival with a lot of puzzles, a lot of story, resembling the gameplay of Resident Evil somehow.

What do you think of this decision? What would you suggest?

tests: check calls to yyerror from the user actions

This revealed a number of things I had not realized:

- the Java location tracking was aliasing the same pair of positions
  for all the symbols (see previous commit).

- in impure parsers, it's quite easy to use incorrect locations for
  diagnostics, since yyerror uses yylloc, which is the location of the
  lookahead, not that of the current lhs.  So we need something like

    {
      YYLTYPE old_yylloc = yylloc;
      yylloc = @$;
      yyerror (]AT_PARAM_IF([result, count, nerrs, ])[buf);
      yylloc = old_yylloc;
    }

  Maybe we should do that little yylloc dance in the skeleton instead
  of leaving it to the user?  It might be costly...  But that's only
  for users of the impure parsers, which are asking for trouble
  anyway.

- in glr.cc invoking yyerror is somewhat cumbersome: the C++ interface
  is not available as we are in yyparse (which in C), and yyerror is
  used by glr.cc itself to bind it to the user's parser::error.  If we
  call yyerror, we need:

    yyerror (]AT_LOCATION_IF([[&@$, ]])[yyparser, ]AT_PARAM_IF([result, count, nerrs, ])[msg);

  However calling yy::parser::error is easier, once we know that the
  current parser object is available as 'yyparser'.  Which also saves
  us from having to pass the parse-params ourselves:

    yyparser.error (]AT_LOCATION_IF([[@$, ]])[msg);

* tests/calc.at: Invoke yyerror by hand, instead of using fprintf etc.
Adjust expectations.
