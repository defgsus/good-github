Greatly reduce allocations in the conhost/OpenConsole startup path (#8489)

I was looking at conhost/OpenConsole and noticed it was being pretty
inefficient with allocations due to some usages of std::deque and
std::vector that didn't need to be done quite that way.

So this uses std::vector for the TextBuffer's storage of ROW objects,
which allows one allocation to contiguously reserve space for all the
ROWs - on Desktop this is 9001 ROW objects which means it saves 9000
allocations that the std::deque would have done.  Plus it has the
benefit of increasing locality of the ROW objects since deque is going
to chase pointers more often with its data structure.

Then, within each ROW there are CharRow and ATTR_ROW objects that use
std::vector today.  This changes them to use Boost's small_vector, which
is a variation of vector that allows for the so-called "small string
optimization."  Since we know the typical size of these vectors, we can
pre-reserve the right number of elements directly in the
CharRow/ATTR_ROW instances, avoiding any heap allocations at all for
constructing these objects.

There are a ton of variations on this "small_vector" concept out there
in the world - this one in Boost, LLVM has one called SmallVector,
Electronic Arts' STL has a small_vector, Facebook's folly library has
one...there are a silly number of these out there.  But Boost seems like
it's by far the easiest to consume in terms of integration into this
repo, the CI/CD pipeline, licensing, and stuff like that, so I went with
the boost version.

In terms of numbers, I measured the startup path of OpenConsole.exe on
my dev box for Release x64 configuration.  My box is an i7-6700k @ 4
Ghz, with 32 GB RAM, not that I think machine config matters much here:

|        | Allocation count    | Allocated bytes    | CPU usage (ms) |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Before | 29,461              | 4,984,640          | 103            |
| After  | 2,459 (-91%)        | 4,853,931 (-2.6%)  | 96 (-7%)       |

Along the way, I also fixed a dynamic initializer I happened to spot in
the registry code, and updated some docs.

## Validation Steps Performed
- Ran "runut", "runft" and "runuia" locally and confirmed results are
  the same as the main branch
- Profiled the before/after numbers in the Visual Studio profiler, for
  the numbers shown in the table

Update Bataille navale 0.1

CLion decided to stop working, my mouse also decided to stop working properly and the minGW sent me errors I'm unable to troubleshoot continue the code without a new variable error every build although the concerned variables worked fine 5mn before then.... I'm currently contemplating despair for having seen too deep into the abyss of this crippled mine after realizing I'm gonna have a shitty grade for not being able to have a proper stuff to work with.... good job me u can now wish to be able to work properly enough during these holidays and successfully pass this year.

readability improvements and some structural improvements that allow (basic) automatic data validation for any data type that is constructed like the current parts of the map. I think apart from some out-of-bounds accesses right now, this SHOULD be extensible to allow for writing something like the 'strings' function, but for arbitrary blocks of game data - which, given the absolutely weird ROM layout of pokemon gen 1 MAY actually turn out to be the best way to find certain kinds of data in ROMs, regardless of region or version. Right now we have to hardcode base addresses for lists of important game state, and finding these base addresses often isn't all that easy. Given thorough enough data validation, I think it'll be possible to just linearly scan through the whole ROM to identify these data structures, with some degree of certainty, and if it were combined with a reverse pointer search, which is not that hard in a Gameboy ROM if we're being honest, assuming we can code in all the variants that pointers and lists are being stored in the ROM (I was genuinely surprised by the 'zipped' version used for the map data pointers, for instance, it wouldn't have occurred to me that there would be a static list of offsets in bank 0, AND a static list of banks in bank 0 at a completely unrelated location) - assuming we can code these, we can just throw some CPU and RAM at any gen 1 ROM, and we should at least never use any data structures that would crash our program, or Pokemon for that matter, if used in a certin way. That means we wouldn't need any magic lists, which I would like a lot better - apparently the common way of distributing these is through .ini files that SOMEONE has crafted SOMETIME in the past, with no real attribution or understanding going on... and that's not good. Let's do it right.

Launcher3: Restart with change only on exit

This change allow the user to change everything they have to inside the
homescreen activity and only restart on exit. Previously this was a pain
in the fucking ass because you had to go in and set each option one by one
with a restart inbetween. At least now is not that big of a pain.

- Restart on destroy (hitting the back button, actionbar arrow)
- Restart when a chance is made and the home button is pressed

** Thanks "Jack" for code to detect home button
https://stackoverflow.com/a/27956263

- Cleaned up restart code

eyosen adapted to 10
