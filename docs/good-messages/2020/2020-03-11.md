modpost: file2alias: go back to simple devtable lookup

commit ec91e78d378cc5d4b43805a1227d8e04e5dfa17d upstream.

Commit e49ce14150c6 ("modpost: use linker section to generate table.")
was not so cool as we had expected first; it ended up with ugly section
hacks when commit dd2a3acaecd7 ("mod/file2alias: make modpost compile
on darwin again") came in.

Given a certain degree of unknowledge about the link stage of host
programs, I really want to see simple, stupid table lookup so that
this works in the same way regardless of the underlying executable
format.

[MIRROR] New scientist traitor item: Australian Slime Mutator / Spider Injector (#1396)

* New scientist traitor item: Australian Slime Mutator / Spider Injector (#1307)

* New scientist traitor item: Australian Slime Mutator / Spider Injector (#44559)

cl Floyd / Qustinnus
add: New scientist traitor item: Australian Slime Mutator / Spider Injector, use it on a gold slime extract to create 3 neutral broodmother spiders, make them sentient and start your own hive.
/cl

'ello mates, Me and my syndicate expedition team have recently returned from my journey to the Australicus sector and crikey the spiders are big there. Fucking the size of a bear. Luckily one of my fellow expeditioners managed to knock one of the fuckers out with a boomerang and we took 'er to our labs. We managed to extract some of their extract which is known to create tame offspring when injected into a gold slime core.

However, if you give it sentience and tell it to do whatever you want, maybe you can use it for a useful purpose?

10 TC item, lets you inject a gold-slime core for some midwife/broodmother spiders that can help you start a spider army. Price can be raised if people think 10 is too little. It spawns 3 instead of 1 to keep consistent, but it can be lowered to 1 spider.

* Removed duplicate mob

Casino port

This is first phase of casino port where I have made my casino spaceship compatible with new chomp codebase. There isnt a connecting port at station yet due to changes being made to main map, but with second phase of casino port there should be one for casino shuttle to move back and forth to transfer visitors.

Non-casino changes
Port of:
purple assistant cap, wah!
wiggler hat, dont know if the sprite works fully yet.
The monocoole, every self respecting technomancer needs this! Also need this for casino rewards.
Snaps, can recommend for lunch, I prefer the licorice flavoured ones!
Space cleaner dispenser, yep any janitors dream, so far its only on casino spaceship.
Ported old modular sofa for station usage, is already on casino, future plans could involve making the modular sofa that can be built from steel be a little more pretty and made from wood as well and also get another overlay/color when added cloth for cushion.

also deleting a .txt file that I didnt get to delete before someone really wanted me to upload wip files so they could work off them, sorry about that but its fixed now!
deleted alienwhitelist and custom_items.txt since github doesnt seem to have those blacklisted

casino port:
Ported the map with the golden goose spacecasino
ported the deluxe edition bar and kitchen gear! Say hello to the good old deluxe dispenser, deluxe food vendor and deluxe drink vendor, perhaps one day they will be constructible by crew!
ported the casino stripper pole, casino roulette, slotmachine, poker/blackjack table, ported the casino wheel of fortune
casino wallet~
casino jukebox! And re implemented the system so the casino songs no longer are on the normal jukebox, sorry folks, hope you didnt like them too much :c
casino visitor and staff manual, might need a bit of revision depending on what event managers wants
Casino chips, gotta gamble with something!
fixed runtime errors from deluxe dispenser trying to add cartridges with reagents that have been renamed on new chomp

Be aware, there will be more casino changes in near future along with some other non-casino changes, including porting of pint metamorphic glass.
