requirements: Bump python-social-auth version.

We had a bunch of ugly hacks to monkey patch things due to upstream
being temporarily unmaintained and not merging PRs. Now the project is
active again and the fixes have been merged and included in the latest
version - so we clean up all that code.

Reorder my life, please

Implemented operator precedence as ast tree reorderings
Accidentally reinvented some tree structure, can't remember the name
Holy shit, it works?
Added a proper precedence doc
Precedences hardcoded for now
Fixed small issue with mangling and demangling of types
Modules now own their own symbol table, which acts as the root
Fixed SELECT ::[] operator acting on non-identifiers
Program AST now printed conditionally based on args
