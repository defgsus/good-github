Day/Night Rework (pls read desc, this is big)

Removed B3M
Added Extended Days
Added Nyx

Harvest Moons have a 50% chance to occur on full moon nights (include the first night). No hostile mobs (except incontrol mobs) will spawn and crops grow faster.

Full moons spawn more mobs.

You can't enchant during the day with the regular table (needs tooltips)

New lunar enchantments have varying affectiveness depending on the moon phase (cool af)

Lunar water that cures most negative affects (not plague) (needs tooltip) (<nyx:lunar_water_bottle>)

Added more HUD options

CONS:
The sun and moon in the sky will freeze and mid day and mid night for 10 minutes. We can fix this, but it will mean shaders will NOT work at all.
Harvest moons can occur on the first night (since the first night is a full moon, though this could be a cool gameplay feature for rebn. Like ooooo will i get a harvestmoon first night and make my first night easy? or will i not get one and be fucked by the increased spawn rate during a full moon??)
ExtendedDays MIGHT have issues with entities that rely on day/night cycles (none atm afaik, millienare as an example which wont work)
No sun/moon declination from b3m i think?? idk i barely noticed

PROS:
No stupid fucking b3m crash anymore!!
Sponge servers might work now!
The Wings mod can work now!
Harvestmoon and the lunar stuff is cool af
There is a chance that the Harvest moon and Bloodmoon both occur at the same time. No fucking clue what will happen when it does occur
Better UI for days/time

Extra Information
The purpose of this talk is to offer more information regarding pairing practices for Product Managers to to help:

those who have not heard of pairing for PMs, learn more about it;
those who have heard about it but have not considered pairing in their product teams: start considering it and weigh options around benefits for their products/business;
those who have tried it: open a conversation about advantages/disadvantages and exchange knowledge.
I have over 10 years of international work experience in digital marketing and product management. I have contributed to both small and large scale product initiatives to bring business value and worked closely with engineering teams, UX designers, localisation specialists as well as business stakeholders across regions.    I am passionate about what I do, the products I've built and the people I work with.  Since I have learned a lot throughout my career and benefited from great colleagues and mentors, I am looking to share my knowledge and give back to the community through talks, events & mentoring.

Speaker : Mihaela Draghici
Available : first day, second day, third day
Length : 45 minutes

Description
Just as, for engineers, pair programming means two engineers working together, PM pairing refers to two Product Managers working together as part of the same product team. 

However, there are little resourcesÂ available regarding pairing for ProductÂ Managers. That's because it's not too common.

What does pairing really mean for PMs? How is it different from pair programming? Why is it great? Why does it suck? When is it good to pair? And more than that, how to make the most of it when you do pair?

"11:10am. 381/551. My focus is not that high here, but I am not completely confused here unlike with the ASP.NET tutorials.

Though OO, this kind of code has a link to the root that I can follow. I can imagine myself writing something of this level of complexity.

11:25am. I am distracted with thoughts of Spiral.

I am thinking about functions, more specifically the way they can be returned from join points, if statements and put into arrays.

The fact this, though this use is allowed, there is not much utility to it. In fact, many times returning functions from join points happens by accident and it is usually a mistake.

...Hmmm...I remember. I think that in v0.09 I wanted to preserve the ability to put things like tensors into arrays.

11:25am. In that case why not `dyn` it and turn it into a reified join point?

That would make sure that I am not making any mistakes.

Ah, no wait. Right now the dyn behavior does memoization.

Drat. Really, functions are so troublesome.

I am going to restrict their use. In v0.2 I do not need to be as permissive as I was before.

11:30am. Yeah, in v0.09 I wanted to do as much experimentation as possible, but in v0.2 I am going to tighten the leash on the language. The focus is not power anymore, but ease of use. I need to be truthful to my design priorities.

11:35am. Let me add this TODO. That will put my heart at ease. I'll go with the assumption that functions will be restricted from here on out."

[android][home] ðŸ¤– Add DevMenu on Android (#6829)

# Why

Fixes #6521 

# How

- Created unversioned `DevMenuManager` class which mostly just delegates calls to versioned `DevMenuModule` modules specific for SDK version. These modules are responsible for providing initial props, dev menu options and actions to run when these options are selected. The manager creates a new `ReactRootView` that bases on kernel's (home's) React instance manager and starts `HomeMenu` app which is registered as a second entry point in `home` and then, manager adds this root view to the currently used activity (it must implement `ExperienceActivity`). As I needed to know which experience activity is the current one, I've added `sCurrentActivity` static member to that class and just track it using activity's lifecycle methods.
- Backported `DevMenuModule` to all SDK versions included in the client. Including some changes between them - for example hot and fast reloading.
- Added support for back button and Android's menu press (which can be simulated by `adb shell input keyevent 82`).
- Removed some unused code related to `Nux` and replaced it with new onboarding screen (see #6793).
- Created new `ShakeDetector` which works more like on iOS. The one provided by React Native is annoying in most cases as it actually requires two shakes.
- Updated `ReactAndroidCodeTransformer` to turn off showing React Native dev menu in non-standalone apps.
- **To do after merging:** Rebuild versioned expoviews.

# Test Plan

- [x] Test on experience in debug mode
- [x] Test on experience in production mode
- [x] Test on snacks
- [x] Test on older SDKs
- [x] Test on simulators
- [x] Test that onboarding shows up once you open the experience for the first time or you didn't accept it yet (clicked `Got it` button).
- [x] Test that using dev menu still works once we kill home's activity.

Secure Cell passphrase API: ThemisPP (#588)

* themispp::impl::input_buffer utility

This is how you say "AsRef<[u8]>" in C++. Yes, really.

We are going to use this bunch of templates to accept anything that
can be converted into a byte slice in new Secure Cell interface.

Public interface:

- themispp::input_buffer() templates

Application code is allowed to invoke these freely. They are resilient
to silly values, but until C++20 it is impossible to detect contiguous
iterators reliably. Therefore is is technically possible to pass, say,
std::deque<uint8_t> with inevitable probable segfault. Don't do that.
(Thankfully, std::list and everything non-random-access is ruled out.)

Private interface:

- themispp::impl::input_buffer struct
- themispp::impl::input_bytes() templates
- themispp::impl::input_string() templates

These functions are going to be used by ThemisPP internally. There are
dummy identity conversion to handle themispp::input_buffer() results.
String functions are used only by passphrase API constructors. They are
not available to general users so that they don't pass std::string
wherever they want.

However, it is possible for users to provide specializations of all
template functions in order to support their own custom containers.
Tests provide an example of how this can be done.

Note that the implementation is hidden in themispp::impl namespace
which itself is mirrored in "themispp/impl" directory. This should
prevent users from accidentally including and using these definitions.

Also note the "compat" headers which are used to polyfill newer features
of C++ when available. They are meant for internal use and should be
used in pairs to avoid leaking magic macros to application code.

* themispp::impl::secret_bytes utility

We are going to use this little class to store secret data inside
Secure Cell. It is a wrapper over std::vector equipped with autowiping.
The interface is restricted by design, limiting out own stupidity
when coding ThemisPP.

Use of soter_wipe() in ThemisPP in any form has a drawback: it makes
application code dependent on Soter library directly. Previously only
themispp::secure_rand_t (mostly unused) caused this, but now all new
Secure Cell classes will trigger this. It's not an issue on Linux with
its flat linker spaace, but virtually every other OS has nested linkage.

* themispp::secure_cell_seal API

Implement Seal mode of Secure Cell, in both master key and passphrase
flavors. The implementation is more or less straightforward, but there
is one thing which must be commented. Initially I expected that
allocator-aware templates can be placed directly into "themispp"
namespace:

    auto cell = themispp::secure_cell_seal_with_passphrase("secret");

However, it turned out that C++ grammar requires (until C++17) the
template brackets to be present at all times, even if all template
arguments can be inferred. This results in silly-looking:

    auto cell = themispp::secure_cell_seal_with_passphrase<>("secret");

As a result, the actual implementation goes into "impl" subnamespace and
proper name is reexported via a typedef. Well... it's C++, what can I do?
Assuming that we do want to keep allocator awareness.

New implementation gets a bunch of new test which verify both API and
some behavior. In particular, they can be somewhat of a usage guide now.
Though, they are still very much incomplete.

Note that some tests are templated over "master key"/"passphrase" type.
I really don't want to duplicate this code (it's enough KLOC here) *and*
this ensures that both Secure Cell flavors have identical API. Win-win.
(Actual implementation could be templated too, but that does not save
much lines of code while making the implementation *much* more complex.)

Also note a whole lot of "// NOLINT" comments. If we were not bound by
C++03 compatibility we could have used modern alternatives, but C++03
makes it hard to write code that compiles with every standard so we use
the greatest common denominator. Hence we need clang-tidy to shut up.

* themispp::secure_cell_context_imprint API

This one is easy to do: there are no overloads, simple API, there will
never be a passphrase API for Context Imprint. So it's mostly copy-paste
of the Seal mode. Just pay attention to the argument order in Core API.
It's slightly different for Context Imprint mode.

Since Context Imprint mode does not verify message validity, there is
not much that we can verify in tests. But at least we check the GIGO
behavior.

* themispp::secure_cell_token_protect API

Ah! Token Protect API! The foster child of APIs in Themis which usually
does not get enough attention and ends up as a second-class citizen.
ThemisPP has specially obnoxious API for it, which is unique across all
Themis wrappers. Well, not anymore.

Instead of doing all that "set_token()"/"get_token()" we now return the
encryption results as std::pair (with a couple of better accessors
bolted onto it). This also gives us nice destructuring API which has
finally arrived in C++17.

Other than that, the implementation is pretty unremarkable. Mind the
argument order and you'll be fine.

The tests are templatized like Seal mode to make it easier to add
passphrase support later. Note that we very message and token
separately.

* Mark old Secure Cell API deprecated

Yes, placement of attributes is... questionable but that's how you do it
in C++. Don't ask me, I have no clue and don't want to know. There is
probably a 75-page paper in C++ committee proceedings which explains in
great detail why it must be done this way and absolutely cannot be done
in a different, more sane way.

clang-format does not make it look pretty either. Oh well... At least
this code looks ugly and *definitely* deprecated.

* Update clang-format rules

- Autodetect C++ standard version to prevent clang-format from fixing
  "> >" into ">>" in template usage like "foo<bar = <baz> >" which
  does not parse correctly in C++03

* Note new API in changelog

* Use wording "key" with old master key API

Replace whatever we were calling 'passwords' with something that looks
like a key and is named like one.

* Use passphrase API in example project

Well... project... The code style here leaves much to be desired, but
I'm not going to fix it up right now. Just update it to use the latest
API which is appropriate here.
