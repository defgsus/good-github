fixed rations

it ajusts to the number of living settlers which is manually accounted for

BTW IT FUCKING SUCKS. We need things to be based off of removal from settler list later but that's just not what it is right now. I want this shit playaabbbllleeeee

"9:25am. I am up. I am still thinking about it.

Actually, I should not assume that req/res are synchronous. Thinking about it more them having no send buffers does not mean that their sends won't be async, since the receivers do have buffers. If they really were synchronous both sides would not have buffers. Instead what is synchronous is the loop for a single socket.

So having two sockets, one req and the other res would still result in async communication.

Instead of thinking about those lines, what I should assume is that the other in which messages are sent are the order in which they are received.

This would hold for both dealer and the router sockets.

There is one thing I must avoid at all cost:

If the client makes a request B, I need to avoid sending it stale data for the previous request.

9:35am. It is really giving me a headache trying to imagine how that would all fit together. My mind is just not good at reasoning out concurrent models. Right now I am putting in a lot of effort into reasoning out the simplest things and failing.

9:50am. The solution for various problems is to use memory, but this is not the kind of thing I've had much practice in.

I guess I'll just have to start. I need the determination to master this and the belief that I can once I get into it.

Let me chill for a while first though.

10:20am. Let me slowly start here. Though it might not seem like I did anything yesterday, it does feel like I am making slow progress in my mental modeling. Still, I am blocked once again.

I need more experience to get through this.

10:35am. Let me finally do some programming. Forget about those difficult concurrency problems and focus on the task at hand.

Ok, first of all, let me change `FileChanges` so that I get back the removal range and the insertion text. I'll move from there.

```fs
let uri_editor = "tcp://localhost:13806"
let uri_lang_serv = "tcp://*:13805"
```

I am not going to go with this after all.

I'll go with a dealer socket in the editor later.

```fs
| FileChanged of {|spiPath : string; spiChangedLines : (int * string) []|}
```

Let me change this.

```fs
| FileChanged of {|spiPath : string; spiChangedLines : {|range: Config.VSCRange; text: string|} []|}
```

This should hack it. But now I need to go back to tokenization and redo it.

For the time being, let me just focus on doing it in the above format, but without tokenization edits. I'll get rid of that part for the initial phase as it would be too difficult to do all at once.

```fs
let server = Job.delay <| fun () ->
    let lines = ResizeArray([ [||],[] ])
    let token_sum = ResizeArray([0]) // Scan add of token counts at the start of the ith line.
    let tokenize_and_set (i,x) =
        let x = tokenize x
        if fst x |> Array.length <> i then
            while i < token_sum.Count-1 do token_sum.RemoveAt(token_sum.Count-1) // Forget the offsets after the ith line since they have to be recalced.
        tr_set lines (i, x)
        x
    let token_count i = lines.[i] |> fst |> Array.length
    let token_sum i =
        while token_sum.Count <= i do token_sum.Add(Seq.last token_sum + token_count (token_sum.Count-1))
        token_sum.[i]
    let line_delta i =
        let rec loop i = if i = 0 || 0 < token_count i then i else loop (i-1)
        if i = 0 then 0 else i - loop (i-1)

    let open' = {|req=Ch(); res=Ch()|}
    let change = {|req=Ch(); res=Ch()|}
    let loop =
        (Ch.take open'.req ^=> (Utils.lines >> Array.map tokenize >> fun x -> lines.Clear(); lines.AddRange(x); Ch.give open'.res (tr_vscode_view lines)))
        <|> (Ch.take change.req ^=> fun (changes : (int * string) []) ->
            assert (let x = Array.map fst changes in x |> Array.distinct |> Array.sort = x)
            Array.mapFoldBack (fun (i,x) () -> tr_fill lines i; {|token_sum=token_sum i; token_count=token_count i; data=tokenize_and_set (i,x); line=i|}, ()) changes ()
            |> fst |> Array.map (fun x ->
                let line = x.line
                let toks,_ =
                    x.data |> fst |> Array.mapFold (fun (line_delta,from_prev) (r,x) ->
                        [|line_delta; r.from-from_prev; r.near_to-r.from; token_groups x; 0|], (0, r.from)
                        ) (line_delta line, 0)
                (x.token_sum*5, x.token_count*5, Array.concat toks), process_error line (snd x.data)
                )
            |> Array.unzip
            // The edits should be applied in the reverse order they have been received.
            |> fun (a,b) -> Array.rev a, Array.concat b
            |> Ch.give change.res
            )
    Job.foreverServer loop >>-. {|open'=open'; change=change|}
```

Let me back this up here. I'll be doing this from scratch, so I do not want to be bothered with it just yet.

10:50am.

```fs
type SpiEdit = {|range: VSCRange; text: string|}
type SpiEdits = SpiEdit []
let server = Job.delay <| fun () ->
    let lines = ResizeArray()
    let token_sum = ResizeArray()

    let apply_change (edit: SpiEdit) =
        let
```

This is so complicated. Rather than doing a whole server, let me pare down my ambitions and simply do the text document server. In other words, something which I can update with the changes given. It is not really a trivial thing to apply the changes using the range given.

11am.

```fs
type SpiEdit = {|range: VSCRange; text: string|}
let server_text_document = Job.delay <| fun () ->
    let lines = ResizeArray()
    let rec loop (edit : SpiEdit) i =

```

Holy shit, actually this is quite difficult. Technically it should be possible to apply the changes to the lines directly, but the user might copy paste over a selection. How do I apply a range over a range.

If I had...

Well, an idea came to me. Actually on the VS Code side the change object does have the offset and the length into the actual string in addition to the range. So I've been considering it, but what if instead of it I took the lines in the range and deoptimized them.

Take several lines, concatenate them, replace the subset of them with the given text and then split them up again.

That seems like it could be doable.

11:10am. Ok, focus me. Let me just make a function that calculates the offset lengths.

11:20am.

```fs
type SpiEdit = {|range: VSCRange; text: string|}
let server_text_document = Job.delay <| fun () ->
    let lines = ResizeArray()
    let length (edit : SpiEdit) =
        let rec loop s (x : VSCPos) =
            if x.line < (snd edit.range).line then loop (s + (lines.Count - x.character + 1)) {line=x.line+1; character=0}
            else s + (snd edit.range).character - x.character
        loop 0 (fst edit.range)
```

This is good. It is better to do it this way rather than pass the offset for the reason that in the original file newlines are not guaranteed to be '\n'. They might be the unix '\r\n'.

11:25am. Focus me, focus. What is next?

Let me do that line replacement thing.

11:40am.

```fs
let server_text_document = Job.delay <| fun () ->
    let lines = ResizeArray()
    let length (edit : SpiEdit) =
        let rec loop s (x : VSCPos) =
            if x.line < (snd edit.range).line then loop (s + lines.Count - x.character + 1) {line=x.line+1; character=0}
            else s + (snd edit.range).character - x.character
        loop 0 (fst edit.range)
    let replace (edit : SpiEdit) =
        let b = StringBuilder()
        let rec loop line =
            if line < (snd edit.range).line then b.AppendLine(lines.[line]); loop (line+1) |> ignore
            else b.Append(lines.[line]) |> ignore
        loop (fst edit.range).line
        b.Remove((fst edit.range).character,length edit)
        b.Insert((fst edit.range).character,edit.text)
        lines.RemoveRange((fst edit.range).line,(snd edit.range).line-(fst edit.range).line+1)
        lines.InsertRange((fst edit.range).line,b.ToString() |> Utils.lines)
```

This is a fairly complex piece of code isn't it?

Let me fold the length in. I do not need it as a separate function...

No having it right dab in the middle of that is making things hard to read. Calling `length` is nice and descriptive.

11:45am. What is next?

11:50am. Meh, a break. I think what I have so far is enough to update a document, but I still haven't worked out how I should be connecting this to the tokenizer.

12:50pm. Let me resume. This is so annoying. This is the opposite of how things should go...is what I want to say, but maybe this breathless struggle is the true essence of programming. Not knowing, being confused, perplexed and in search of clarity.

12:55pm. It is weird, because this is so stressful is exactly why I want to go through this. I want to program right now. I want to spend then next 5h doing this.

Let me do it.

```
let server_text_document = Job.delay <| fun () ->
```

Let me make this a regular function instead of a Hopac job.

1:05pm.

```fs
type SpiEdit = {|range: VSCRange; text: string|}
let server_text_document (lines : string ResizeArray) (edit : SpiEdit) =
    let edit_length =
        let rec loop s (x : VSCPos) =
            if x.line < (snd edit.range).line then loop (s + lines.Count - x.character + 1) {line=x.line+1; character=0}
            else s + (snd edit.range).character - x.character
        loop 0 (fst edit.range)

    let b = StringBuilder()
    let rec loop line =
        if line < (snd edit.range).line then b.AppendLine(lines.[line]) |> ignore; loop (line+1)
        else b.Append(lines.[line]) |> ignore
    loop (fst edit.range).line
    b.Remove((fst edit.range).character,edit_length) |> ignore
    b.Insert((fst edit.range).character,edit.text) |> ignore
    lines.RemoveRange((fst edit.range).line,(snd edit.range).line-(fst edit.range).line+1)
    let replaced_lines = b.ToString() |> Utils.lines
    lines.InsertRange((fst edit.range).line,replaced_lines)
    replaced_lines
```

Hmmm, I forgot to commit earlier. Let me do it now."

Change local repo name from avl to avl_repo

If the name of the repo stays as "avl", when AVLWrapper tries to execute "avl" it will fing the repo folder "avl" instead of the the "avl" executable on the bin subfolder. This will them give a PermissionDenied error as the program will be trying to execute a folder.

It took me a total of three hours and a night of bad sleep dreaming with spiders to figure that out.

Fuck.

mononoke/virtually_sharded_blobstore: spawn before taking semaphores

Summary:
I canaried this on Fastreplay, but unfortunately that showed that sometimes we
just deadlock, or get so slow we might as well be deadlocked (and it happens
pretty quickly, after ~20 minutes). I tried spawning all the `get()` futures,
and that fixes the problem (but it makes gettreepack noticeably slower), so
that suggests something somewhere is creating futures, polling them a little
bit, then never driving them to completion.

For better or worse, I'd experienced the exact same problem with the
ContextConcurrencyBlobstore (my initial attempt at QOS, which also used a
semaphore), so I was kinda expecting this to happen.

In a sense, this nice because I we've suspected there were things like that in
the codebase for a while (e.g. with the occasional SQL timeout we see where it
looks like MySQL responds fast but we don't actually poll it until past the
timeout), and it gives us a somewhat convenient repro.

In another sense, it's annoying because it blocks this work :)

So, to work around the problem, for now, let's spawn futures to force the work
to complete when a semaphore is held. I originally had an unconditional spawn
here, but that is too expensive for the cache-hit code path and slows things
down (by about ~2x).

However, having it only if we'll query the blobstore isn't not as expensive,
and that seems to be fine (in fact it is a ~20% p99 perf improvement,
though the exact number depends on the number of shard we use for this, which I've had to tweak a bit).

https://pxl.cl/1c18H

I did find what I think is one potential instance of this problem in
`bounded_traversal_stream`, which is that we never try to poll `scheduled` to
completion. Instead, we just poll for the next ready future in our
FuturesUnordered, and if that turns out to be synchronous work then we'll just
re-enqueue more stuff (and sort of starve async work in this FuturesUnordered).

I tried updating bounded traversal to try a fairer implementation (which polls
everything), but that wasn't sufficient to make the problem go away, so I think
this is something we have to just accept for now (note that this actually has
some interesting perf impact in isolation: it's a free ~20% perf improvement on
p95+: https://pxl.cl/1c192

i think there is an error in the par, i enter values -9,+4,0 and the true par ends up being 120, 121, 124 (note i'm not sure on the order of these) doesn't seem right
par 1 and 2 are always 1 and 2 respectively,
fixed that

put the amend par at the start of resolve par, this works much better

i'm having a bit of trouble selecting the player to work on in resolve par

honestly i think i can just do it in order now though,

after amending the par, find the total diff again, if it's -1 or 1
for each player go through all the cards and try and find one 1 higher or lower than the undealt card , swap them, then the handdifftotal should be 0

this seems to work and it should give the rest of the resolve par method a better chance to reduce all player's hand diff to 0 without entering into the more complicated methods

needs more testing really, if par is unable to be resolved in a deal, and the handDiff is positive i think it will shuffle and deal again, but i've not tested this
if par is unable to be resolved and the handDiff is negative, then instead of shuffling it uses teh closest apporx cards to get as close to 0 as possible, thoretically, neither of these things should ever happen

need to test different pars, test 2 players

had the ConcurrentModificationException in the hash map for friednly players agian in the MyServer class
for(HashMap.Entry<String, Player> entry : friendlyPlayers.entrySet()){
line 227 approx in the new Player listener
so my method to fix that didn't work
this error does not seem to have had any negative effects

got an infinite loop when testing a 2 player deal because one player's highest card was of equal value to the other's lowest card, pip value 6, amended the if statement so that can't happen again, but i think it only happened because the 2 player deal is wrong, one player have card total 96 the other 220 odd so something's gone wrong there
think i've fixed all this now

seems to be working quite well, and the deal is emitted and received ok

Now with more mystery!

- Actions now use classes
- Discovered typing and optional return declarations
- Engine has its own file now
- We can make rooms and connect them now! (occasionally only an room, RNG)
- Field of View works now (although magic numbers)

Add the hypergen feature.

This feature is not something I'd really recommend that anyone else
use because I'm not really confident with it. Hence I'm leaving it
undocumented. I personally feel like the code for this feature is
pretty messy and hackish; I'm not really proud of it (I feel
rather ashamed about it actually). But it works and it's useful so
might as well commit it.

One thing this made me realize is that in the long run all of the
stations' data should be loaded into, and maintained as, one large
dictionary in memory instead of having this silly list nonsense.
Just because the PSD has ugly and inconsistent formatting shouldn't
mean that I have to let their messiness screw with my code. For
example for industry, I can have two elements in each station dict
entry - one would be a "clean" version of industry and one would be a
messy un-stripped version.

But since this probably won't be used after this year I don't want
to invest in the time to refactor it. Even if it is used later, I'll
let someone else do it. As things stand I have little to nothing to
gain from it (mainly because this is a niche tool used only by a few

[READY] Smart Cables (#44265)

Cables now autoconnect on cardinal directions. All cable placement has been completely stripped out and replaced with simple single cable per tile logic.
Low effort demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXp8s6ORWbA
Yes I am aware that cutting it is not dropping wire, that version was bugged.
Cables no longer need a knot specifically placed to link to power objects. The sprite is automatically changed to represent this.
The only exception to this logic is that on smes units, due to the terminal being next to the output, they will not link there.
On a technical powernet side, this is the same as old cables once actually placed. They still use the existing powernet system, just the placement and connection works differently.

Old cables have been turned into "pipe cleaners" for wire art purposes. they work just like the old ones, just missing all the powernet functionality, and also you can put them on top of the floor.
Why It's Good For The Game

How obnoxious cables were to both map and work with in game has been something that has annoyed me for a really long time now.
This is both easier for new players to learn, and easier for experienced players to work with.
Along with making in game much more intuitive and easier, it makes mapping much easier as well. Mad lad wjohn was able to rip out all the mapping conversion in one day because of how much faster it is to work with.

cl actioninja and wjohn
add: Cables have been completely reworked. Simple per tile connection logic, automatically connects to things above it. Think minecraft redstone.
add: Old cables have been kept as pipe cleaner. They are non-functional in terms of power, but otherwise have the same connection logic. Also can go on top of tiles.
remove: mech cable layer has been removed because it was terrible shitcode nobody used
tweak: (sort of balance) cable stack sized has been reduced to 15.

Properly fixes smart cable lag issues and also fixes the awful connection issues. (#44945)

About The Pull Request

I ended up just rewriting propagation logic entirely. This needs a bit of cleanup but this is a really high priority fix.
Actually tested this time. I can confirm for sure this is working in all situations that were previously broken.
Closes #44940
Closes #44936
Closes #44935

Abstracted stuff and fixed some painful spring boot errors
I don't even know what the hell happened here, it took so long to try and fix this shit. I don't even really know what I added in this commit before the problems started occurring, I'm just glad it's done

I'm absolutely done with this.

God damn it, this just made me remember how much I hate doing unnecessary effort for no payoff. I am done with this script. It kinda works and it kinda doesn't.

Currently known issues:

*Avatars won't de-round.
*After browsing repos, the style will reset until the next page load.
*Old style will be visible for a split second after loading the page.

If you want to fix any of that - go right ahead. But I'm not maintaining this or fixing this myself (for now at least), because I hated every second of writing this, and I just had enough. 

I miss those 15 minutes of my life that I spent on writing this...

okr: final scores for q2 (#25)

* okr: final scores for q2

* okr: rvagg final scores 2020q2

* warped fork okrs

With remarks:

- I'm simply not scoring the `go-ipfs`-related OKR.  To the best of my
  understanding, the efforts to roll go-ipld-prime forward into more of
  the go-ipfs codebase are currently stalled because those efforts were
  deprioritized during the go-ipfs v0.5 release cycle for reasons that
  had to do with go-ipfs and are unrelated to IPLD.  (And yes, that is
  the reason why I insisted on phrasing this OKR the way it's phrased;
  this was fairly predictable.)  We did do a fair amount of work to
  chart out how this migration could be performed, and I'm at least
  happy with that; but I wouldn't say it's on track to go further until
  we have go-ipfs increasing prioritization and consistently carrying a
  baton on that side (particularly considering that the main result of
  our how-to-migrate research was confirming that yes, the internal
  package graph of go-ipfs is such that this change is very likely to
  either require acting in a very large and decisive sweep (which
  requires maintainer energy and active engagement); or, requires
  prolonged efforts in advance to break things down into smaller and
  less densely inter-related pieces (which might be the way to go, but
  again has a lot more to do with go-ipfs maintainer energy than any
  other limiting factor)).

- Codegen gets a partial score.  It's going along, but continues to be
  a massive task.  Some demo usage has been made, but we're still
  lacking a CLI and a finished end-user-accessible experience, so it's
  hard to call that complete.  The feature table of all schema features
  we intend to support is also still less than solid checkmarks
  (although, hey, we  *have* a detailed feature table now; that too is
  progress).  The good news is we're iterating and getting close enough
  to real demo usage that we're starting to get some interesting
  practical design feedback from that process.

- Link loading gets review: let's give that partial credit.
  It's gotten review!  There's a sizable writeup issue on it now.
  That was the goal; I suppose I could mark it 1.0 with no shame.
  I've also made a couple tries on drafting a better interface...
  however, none of that has born fruit yet; something definitively
  better remains illusive.  I'm refraining from making changes
  just for the sake of making changes without confidence that it would
  result in a better solution than the current situation.

- Traversal and link loading docs: yes, we have examples now.  They
  use the standard godoc example/test system.  Yay.  Done.
  Could also use more?  Definitely.  But we no longer have a void.

Final, typical disclaimer: none of these are really OKRs; they're not
really measurable; we don't separate objectives and results; and we
just plain don't have a team big enough and unitary enough that OKRs
make sense in the first place, so they degenerate to task lists, which
in turn they are spectacularly not good at being.  The same laments on
the inaccuracy-fermentation this process creates apply every quarter;
I note them duly.

Add clickable action buttons from /TG/, rework a lot of backend and other improvements. (#7315)

* Fix a typo in a verb.

* Add straffing to mechs. This took my entire morning goddamnit.
You now have a straffing verb. Very convenient to shoot while firing back.
Thanks to @drexample even if i didn't use all that much of the original code i stole.

* Change straffing to strafing.

* Correct an oversight.

* Add a variable that determines whether or not you are in a mech or fighter at the moment.

* Rework a lot of mech code backend and add clickable buttons.
- Gygax overload, Durand defence mode, phazon phase, marauder smoke, zoom and thrusters have been made into modular things. Just put the 'smoke_possible' var to get those actions.
- Move most abilities that aren't for default mechs to 'Mecha_actions.dm' for less huge of a file. Marauder abilities to be moved shortly.
- Lot of verbs have been broken into procs such as toggle_lights() now being a verb refering to a lights() proc for easier work later on.
- Delete some movement code duplications.
- Changed the smoke system to be more up to date, inspiration taken from the cooking machines.

* Space out some things for ease for reading.

* Improve the damage readout for mechs on examine

* Improve speed boost code to an easier to modify version.

* Deleting a couple few forgotten debug messages.

Update Depth3D.fx

Depth3D: Harden to help prevent cheating.                                                       -=let me know if I can do more=-

+Cursor Is now Bound to the 3D image only.
+Removed Depth Buffer Debug view to keep users from using this to cheat.
+Basic VR Compatibility added so that it can be used with VR Desktop apps.
+Basic Theater Mode added for Cellphone VR users.
+Renamed many items in the UI to help new users with controlling this shader.
+New Depth Detection Code.
+New Screen Boundary Detection added.
+Edge Handling added from SuperDepth3D

Fixed issues with the UI in Freestyle and automated many functions as I could to reduce UI clutter. The idea was to keep as much of the functionality as possible without sacrificing too much.

Fixed issues with NV System that was causing a black screen on my Testers PC. This was not easy, I had to remote into a user's pc halfway across the world since I needed someone with an NV Card that was able to help me. Seems like this may be an issue for me with porting my other shaders. Thank you, Durante - aka Dorinte & TheGordinho - aka Gordinho

The goal of Depth3D to allow users to experience the world of 3D Gaming by adding real depth to your game. -=This shader requires depth access to work=-

This shader will work with 3D TV, 3D Monitors, and the NEW VR HMDs. The VR Theater experience worth exploring in VR.
Here are two free applications for VR Headsets That I seen people use that anyone can try.
Virtual Space
https://store.steampowered.com/app/703480/Virtual_Space/
Big Screen
https://bigscreenvr.com/help/gettingstarted/sbs3d/

Older games and non-VR games can benefit from being played again with Stereo3D.
I have been working on My 3D Shader for some time now and learned how to improve things over time even with limitations. My hope is to share this experience with as many people as possible.
I would like this shader to be considered as a standard shader to be used as openly as NV discontinued 3DVision Stereo Software. Since I know many users in the 3D community still enjoy 3D gaming.

Please let me know if there is anything I can change. That can help. Thank you.

Noted Issues
One of the things that bug me with Depth3D It's hard to use for new users. So I will be making better tutorials when I have the hardware to do so for VR.
