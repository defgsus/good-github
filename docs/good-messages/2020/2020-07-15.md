Add a context menu entry to "Open Windows Terminal here" (#6100)

## Summary of the Pull Request

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18356694/82586680-94447680-9b5d-11ea-9cf1-a85d2b32db10.png)

I went with the simple option - just open the Terminal with the default profile in the selected directory. I'd love to add another entry for "Open Terminal here with Profile...", but that's going to be follow-up work, once we sort out pulling the Terminal Settings into their own dll.

## References
* I'm going to need to file a bunch of follow-ups on this one.
  - We should add another entry to let the user select which profile
  - We should add the icon - I've got to do it in `dllname.dll,1` format, which is annoying.
  - These strings should be localized.
  - Should this only appear on <kbd>Shift</kbd>+right click? Probably! However, I don't know how to do that.
* [A Win7 Explorer Command Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/master/Samples/Win7Samples/winui/shell/appshellintegration/ExplorerCommandVerb) which hasn't aged well
* [cppwinrt tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/author-coclasses) on using COM in cppwinrt
* [This is PowerToys' manifest](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/d2a60c7287eb5667b5282a519c92b759664c9e30/installer/MSIX/appxmanifest.xml#L53-L65) and then [their implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/d16ebba9e0f06e7a0d41d981aeb1fd0a78192dc0/src/modules/powerrename/dll/PowerRenameExt.cpp) which were both helpful
* [This ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-extensions#instructions) was the sample I followed for how to actually set up the manifest, with the added magic that [`desktop5` lets you specify "Directory"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-desktop5-itemtype)

* [x] I work here
* [ ] Tests added/passed
* [n/a] Requires documentation to be updated

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

This adds a COM class that implements `IExplorerCommand`, which is what lets us populate the context menu entry. We expose that type through a new DLL that is simply responsible for the shell extension, so that explorer doesn't need to load the entire Terminal just to populate that entry.

The COM class is tied to the application through some new entries in the manifest. The Clsid values are IMPORTANT - they must match the UUID of the implementation type. However, the `Verb` in the manifest didn't seem important.

after 3 hours of frustrating trouble shooting, removing a damn / key fixed the problem. locally there is no need to have a / in the file path and it works either ../ or / or nothing. but remotely at deploying face, file path can't have a /. frustrating issue fixed..
