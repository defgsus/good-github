Make CUDAFuture remember and restore current device in callback (#48789)

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48789

CUDAFuture aims to "capture" the current state of CUDA-related stuff when the future is marked complete (e.g., by looking at current streams and recording events on them) and then "replicate" a similar state when users synchronize with the result of the future (by synchronizing the current streams with these events).

However, one "contextual" aspect of CUDA that we weren't capturing/replicating was the current device. This diff tries to fix that. I must mention that we can only do this for callbacks, while we cannot do it for the wait() method. I don't know if such a discrepancy between the two actually makes the overall behavior _worse_. I'd love to hear people's opinions on this.

Update solr-drupal-8.md

At minimum the date should be updated to reflect the new End of Life date of December 2021 (click through to the Search API Solr page). Personally, I don't love the "should continue to work" wording as it doesn't instill confidence but technically it's accurate.

Doom: OMG Edition

Damn.

Still can't believe anything runs on this. As a big fan of both 2016 and
Eternal, this is indeed a glorious day.

There's a bug when loading a save, and the key press drops make the game
hard to enjoy reliably, but hell, it does work!

I had to supply an implementation for some rather obscure calls (such as
the now beloved `__divdi3`), and my initial naive attempts didn't quite
satisfy doom. This should explain the added `arith64.c` file; many
thanks to its author, linked within. Perhaps it'd be better to link with
libgcc, but right let's not.
