Update Horror story

Act 1 1900 Hours
The boy hid near the trees and shrubbery, unable to find his family. It was setting soon, the sun. Soon, darkness would be upon the land. "Hey kid, get up." The boy stared weakly at the blurred 
image of a big buff man looking at him. He got up, his body shivering nonstop from the frosty cold winter air. He got up feebly and held the man's hand. The man brought the 
boy back to his house. He fed him before giving him a warm coat to wear to keep warm. The man smiled. It had been quite a while. 
Act 2 2000 hours
"Keep an eye out, he has to be somewhere here." "We should go back g-guys, we are really in deep water if we don't go now!" "What do you think will happen to us if we do go back 
now? It'll be worse than going back without Jin later". Jared, Jill and Leonard climbed the ice cold mountain in the freezing cold frenzy, in search of their friend, that they so dearly, 
carelessly lost  in a game of hide and seek. "Come, I think I see a light from afar!" "Let's head towards it!" All trio could do was to cross their fingers and pray for the best. The three ran only to find a dying flame and something... burnt. "What is this? It looks
weird." Jared commented". "I don't know, but throw it away, its useless." "Wait!" Jill exclaimed. "That's Arthur's ring!""Wait, you mean the lost kid?" "Yeah."
Act 3 2300 hours
"Oh no, Jill's down!" Jared shouted. *thud* "Leonard?" Jared's eyes widened as he stared at his two best friends lying on the ground. He collapsed onto the floor, defeated and drained from all that had happened,,
his legs freezing cold and weak. "Hey kiddo, you alright?" Jared's eyes remained barely opened, his breath running short as the cold started getting to him. Come on,
let's get you to a safer place..." Jared's vision blurred and the last thing he saw was something he made out as the dead body of his friends...


Act 4. Finale, 3 Days later
"Hey Ronney, did you see the recent news?" "Yes. Poor things, stuck and lost in a winter night." "Didn't you see the news? The latest one. They were found. Well, not really found. 
They were in pieces. Scattered.

More sensible compiler (#38)

* Cleanup Compiler

This basically just removes a bunch of "Gotta make it work" style hacks
I did previously.

* Map First

This normalizes the oneOfs that exist, which make it marginally less
awful.

* Reduce OneOf Nesting

This basically adds a very stupid check to ensure you never have a oneOf
within a oneOf.

* Fix how Nullable Works

This is because we started using symbols for primitive types instead of
strings to avoid weird modify-the-string bugs.

I honestly don't remember what I changed. Hopefully it's not fucked.

Fixed a nanite issue that made nanites shit.

Fixed a nanite issue that made nanites shit. It caused more toxins than it could heal, causing an infinite loop of sadness for normal nanites and making the healing nanites kinda useless.
