command: add property to return text subtitles in ASS

See manpage additions. This was requested, sort of. Although what has
been requested might be something completely different. So this is
speculative.

This also changes sub_get_text() to return an allocated copy, because
the buffer shit was too damn messy.

Rework path parsing

Right now, there are two types of path parsing I want to do: either I
want parse a data path (which could possibly be one ending with a list
with no keys; this patch doesn't handle that), or, I want to parse any
path. All of the commands that can take a schema path can also take any
other type of path because a data path is just a "subset" of a schema
path. So, I changed the schema path parser to an "any path" parser.
This any path parser can then work more efficiently than a "dataPath |
schemaPath" parser: it will try to parse a data path and on the first
non-data node it will switch and continue parsing schema nodes. This has
the advantage that I don't have to do workarounds for completion. Before
this, if the parser tried to backtrack to the schema path it would
always have to clear ParserContext path and completions and do
everything again, and that would mean trouble, because I didn't really
have much control about where exactly the completions get created.
Example: the data path parser would create the completions I wanted, but
then fail. The parser would then backtrack to schema path, but it
wouldn't parse as much of the input as the other one and that would
create different completions.

There is a small caveat: I do have create my own local variables for
dataPath and schemaPath. Before this I never did have to create a
`dataPath_` or a `schemaPath_` instance. However, I think that the
control that I get over how nodes are parsed (and over the resulting
attribute of the parser) outweighs that.

Also, there was another attempt on this, which just used Spirit
backtracking. As was said before, more control over this backtracking is
better. Also, not having Spirit backtracking will hopefully allow me to
transition to new Boost version more easily.

Don't respond to emails by default

The respond to emails feature seems a little dangerous because it
currently only requires the user to set up email. Then any email
recieved with the wake word will cause Naomi to respond as if the
email is a command, sending back Naomi's response. For the most
part this is fine with the current News, weather, etc. but could
be used to either knowingly or accidentally get information that
the user might not want put out there.

For instance, if Naomi is connected to your google calendar, and
you get an email from your boss saying "Interesting to hear about
Naomi yesterday. Do you have tomorrow's meeting on your calendar"
Naomi might see "Naomi", "tomorrow" and "calendar" and respond with
"You have the following events scheduled on your calendar: 7:30 am
call in sick, 8:00 am meet friends, 9am hike to waterfall." As
Naomi becomes more connected and learns more about you, this would
become more of an issue.

This change makes it so that the user has to specifically enable
the "respond" functionality by creating a "respond_to_emails"
entry in profile.yml. This can contain a whitelist of email
addresses that Naomi is allowed to respond to.

The following rules apply:
No entry - Do not respond to emails. Simply announce when new emails
arrive.

Empty list - respond to any email containing the wake word.
```
respond_to_emails: []
```

List of addresses - respond to any email from the list of email
"from" addresses that contains a wake word:
```
respond_to_emails:
- aaronchantrill@projectnaomi.com
- 2125551212@vtext.com
```
