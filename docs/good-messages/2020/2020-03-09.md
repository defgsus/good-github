Improvements to spell mechanics

* Removed the feature where learning Arcane Blessings overrides the
relevent Magic Sign, while retaining the feature where it displaces
Sanguine Marks. While this will clutter up the mutation and spell menus
a bit more, it enables a fuckton of features I previously couldn't
utilize due to how finicky this mechanic was.
* Set pattern scrolls to grant the exact specific trait being targeted
via MUTATE_TRAIT, instead of pinging a custom category. While this
allows me to remove all those annoying one-note mutation categories and
makes pattern scrolls actually work 100% of the time instead of
sometimes randomly failing, by far the BIGGEST benefit to this is that
using the same pattern scroll more than once will trigger a levelup of
that spell (since the mutation grants the target spell at level 1),
meaning going through the expense of crafting more pattern scrolls can
be used to sidestep the tediousness of having to grind EXP via casting.
This helps with solidifying the intended balance where it's easier to
max out Magic Signs, but Arcane Blessings are more powerful when maxed
out.
* Shaved max level of Sanguine Marks down to 5 and tweaked their effect
scaling accordingly, since they're still the only spells that lack any
good way to quickly gain experience.
* Gave some of the major NPCs a selection of spells they can teach. This
feature isn't yet complete however.

The personality of an individual influences his thoughts, emotions and behaviors in different situations. The personality studies can be applied in different domains such as in education, in medicine, in company management, and in consumer research, in order to provide a suitable environment for individuals with different personalities. This first year master thesis consists of the personality detection in human-robot interaction(HRI), based on Nass’s postulate that the human communicates with a machine in the same way that with another human. 

In the first part of the thesis, we present the context of the personality detection, the existent personality theories and models as well as the current study of personality detection in the field of natural language processing. In the second part, we explain how we conduct the HRI experience, including the conversational system design, selection of participants, the multimodal information collecting, the personality questionnaire design, and the collection of participant’s feedback. The third part describe the processing of multimodal data obtained in the HRI experience, including the annotation of conversational strategies in the text data, the annotation of visual signals (facial expressions, gestures, posture, body and eye movement), the extraction of prosodic, spectral and voice quality features for speech emotion recognition, the features and classifiers(Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, k-means) selection and fusion of the multiple modalities using feature-level fusion. In the last part of the thesis, we indicate what points need to be improved in our approche, and the perspective of the personality detection in HRI.

The Families Gamemode. Home. At least it was 'til I fucked everything up. (#49274)

Adds the Families gamemode to the codebase. In this 1 hour showdown, 
multiple criminal families are placed onto the station with their goal 
to rack up the most points by the end of 1 hour. At which point, the 
Space Cops hit up the station to crack down on the family activity. The 
severity of the Space Cops is based on how much carnage and murder the 
families have committed.

## Why It's Good For The Game

With an actual official medium/heavy RP server, and the codebase taking 
a much harder swing towards heavier consequences for death, a more 
player focused gamemode with a unique swing on teamwork, the concept of 
what exactly is an antagonist, and trust/paranoia will do wonders to 
help improve that atmosphere.

Previous tests went extremely well(when administrators weren't 
intentionally sabotaging it by welderbombing families as the Head of 
Security every single round immediately with no escalation), but 
suffered from "this just isn't a gamemode for no RP servers like /tg/".

However, /tg/ is now an RP server.

Get ready to rep your family.

## Isn't this just Gang?
Heck no. Only thing similar is tagging turf and the fact criminal 
groups are involved. This mode is completely different otherwise.

## Heck yeah, where do I sign up?
Ask a family member where their Signup Point is, and then simply click 
on it with an open hand. You'll be signed up for the family instantly, 
and given some sick threads and a spraycan for tagging.

## How do I rep my family?
Wear your gang's uniform or colors similar.

## What does it mean to roll with a crew?
Travel in a group of four or more for bonus points towards your gang.
However, you receive less for having eight or more, so be careful. Try 
to spread your crews out!

## I'm an X, what do?
Gangster: Yeah, go do whatever. Wanna backstab your gang? Go for it. 
You can switch sides at any time by clicking on an enemy gang's sign up 
point. Wanna murder some snitch because they ratted you out to the 
pigs? Do it. Wanna pressure the locals into supplying you with goods to 
export? Emergent gameplay.
Civilians: Wanna join a gang? Go for it. Gangsters probably shouldn't 
be arbitrarily murdering you, but if you're repping someone else's 
colors, don't expect to be given a free pass. After all, uniforms are 
the only way to really identify a gang member.
SPACE COP: Get rid of all the gangsters. Secure the station. Protect 
the law. Uphold the law. Eat donuts.

## No huds? How can I tell if someone's part of my group?
Tough shit, man. I hope you like trust.

In short, this gamemode will be a fun exercise in how far the 
playerbase can go in regards to trusting eachother and unifying to meet 
a common goal for their group with no rules, gameplay mechanics, or 
anything actively forcing them to work together.

## How do I know if someone is a gangster?
1. Are they wearing a gang uniform/color?
   If yes, they're probably a gangster.
   If no, they're probably a civvie.
2. Are they attacking gangsters?
   If yes, they're probably a gangster.
   If no, they're probably a civvie.
