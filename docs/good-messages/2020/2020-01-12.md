Create Speed.c

Rash is known about his love for racing sports. He is an avid Formula 1 fan. He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Rash started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed. Formally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car will prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long. Count the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow. Description of each test case contains 2 lines. The first of these lines contain a single integer N, the number of cars. The second line contains N space separated integers, denoting the maximum speed of the cars in the order they entered the long straight segment.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the segment.

Numbered list shortcut and finish list logic working

This was really difficult. The Slate documentation is a little lacking and things that you may think would be easy can be non-trivial (i.e. lifting up and converting the newly created list item if the previous item had no text). I'm still not sure If my approach was optimal or just a hack. 

Essentially I run the insert action and then look at the result. This is made easy because editor.selection is moved to the new node by default after line break. Even without this it still isn't bad, we just need to look for the node in the next path. If the result shows we split something that should be reformatted then we do the reformatting manually at this point. 

I also added in logic so that a shift key + enter means to keep the formatting. This was a little annoying. This editor function is not passed event details so we don't know if the shift key is pressed. However I can use a little hack. I make use of a closure around the new insert break to have an event listener for keypress. It will set a variable both of these functions share if shift+enter is pressed and then I check this in insertBreak. This works because insertBreak is triggered by a beforeinsert event which fires after the key press (still need to test in many different browsers). Then I reset the flag in the new implentation of insertBreak for next time. 

I could have used onDOMBeforeInput which does receive the event, however then I would have needed to reimplement all the logic around splitting nodes which is annoying. So I took the approach of doing it with insertBreak.

I'm now thinking I could have made it so that I check before the line break is implemented. This would make bulleted lists easier to reason about because I'm just checking the current text node and lifting it up to a paragraph if empty. I wouldnt have to react to whatever inserting the line break did. However it makes splitting at a heading less intuitive as we can't lift and split in one action so there I would need to apply it beforehand and then lift up the newly split element. So actually I think this is fine. Maybe the optimal thing was to add a hook system so I could easily run some logic before and some after. But even then I have to split the logic behind manipulating nodes so that's not so great.

fs/sync: Make sync() satisfy many requests with one invocation

Dave Jones reported RCU stalls, overly long hrtimer interrupts, and
amazingly long NMI handlers from a trinity-induced workload involving
lots of concurrent sync() calls (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/23/369).
There are any number of things that one might do to make sync() behave
better under high levels of contention, but it is also the case that
multiple concurrent sync() system calls can be satisfied by a single
sys_sync() invocation.

Given that this situation is reminiscent of rcu_barrier(), this commit
applies the rcu_barrier() approach to sys_sync().  This approach uses
a global mutex and a sequence counter.  The mutex is held across the
sync() operation, which eliminates contention between concurrent sync()
operations.  The counter is incremented at the beginning and end of
each sync() operation, so that it is odd while a sync() operation is in
progress and even otherwise, just like sequence locks.

The code that used to be in sys_sync() is now in do_sync(), and sys_sync()
now handles the concurrency.  The sys_sync() function first takes a
snapshot of the counter, then acquires the mutex, and then takes another
snapshot of the counter.  If the values of the two snapshots indicate that
a full do_sync() executed during the mutex acquisition, the sys_sync()
function releases the mutex and returns ("Our work is done!").  Otherwise,
sys_sync() increments the counter, invokes do_sync(), and increments
the counter again.

This approach allows a single call to do_sync() to satisfy an arbitrarily
large number of sync() system calls, which should eliminate issues due
to large numbers of concurrent invocations of the sync() system call.

Changes since v1 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/24/683):

o	Add a pair of memory barriers to keep the increments from
	bleeding into the do_sync() code.  (The failure probability
	is insanely low, but when you have several hundred million
	devices running Linux, you can expect several hundred instances
	of one-in-a-million failures.)

o	Actually CC some people who have experience in this area.

Named after the heart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Arsenal"> Royal Arsenal</a> complex, they took the name of the whole complex a month later. Royal Arsenal F.C.'s first home was Plumstead Common, though they spent most of their time in South East London playing on the other side of Plumstead, at the Manor Ground. Royal Arsenal won Arsenal's first trophies in 1890 and 1891, and these were the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_football_association"> football association</a> trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London. In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.</p> 	<p>Royal Arsenal renamed themselves for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Football_League"> The Football League</a> when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League, starting out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Second_Division"> Second Division</a> and winning promotion to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division"> First Division</a> in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910. Businessmen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_(businessman)"> Henry Norris</a> and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.</p> 	<p>In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Woolwich Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, North London. This saw their third change of name: the following year, they reduced Woolwich Arsenal to simply The Arsenal. In 1919, The Football League voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First Division, despite only listing the club sixth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of 1914â€“15. Some books have speculated that the club won this election to division one by dubious means.[b] Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping "The" in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.</p> </div> 		<hr> 		 <div class="copyright"> 		 	<footer align="center">             	<small>&copy; The text content of this site was borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.">the Wikipedia article on Arsenal Football Club</a> on <time> 05 January 2020</time> under the <br /><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License</a>.

Fixed bugs in scrolly-tile

In addition to fixing (I hope) the bugs that caused abrupt endings to passages I've deleted some dead code and improved code re-use.

I've also added little pools of water in the bottom of emergent passages. Looks kinda naff for now.

Converting this to high-res might be nice- it's hard to make a character sprite out of a handful of pixels. Althought the simple box is kinda endearing.

I'd also love to have a small back-buffer allowing you to fall back down passages a little way to explore- easy to make it work, but not sure how it'd feel mechanically.

SHREK
                         Once upon a time there was a lovely
                         princess. But she had an enchantment
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could
                         only be broken by love's first kiss.
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
                         Many brave knights had attempted to
                         free her from this dreadful prison,
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of
                         the tallest tower for her true love
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs)
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What
                         a load of - (toilet flush)

               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go
               after the ogre.

               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?

                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!

                                     MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that
                         thing can do to you?

                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's
                         bread.

               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse.
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly
                         peeled skin.

                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's
                         quite good on toast.

                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)

               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the
               men are in the dark.

                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away.
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.)
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted.
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)

To test:
 1 - You will need a valid library RBDigital account
 2 - Fill in the RecordedBooks system preferences
 3 - Open the catalog, perform a search with RBDigtal resuls, 'love' often works
 4 - Click to the results
 5 - Note if not logged you don't see availability
 6 - Log in with a patron with no email, note you do not see any notice that you must register your email with RBDigital
 7 - Apply patch
 8 - Reload results, you now see a notice to register with rbdigital, do so unless you already have an account
 9 - Add your associated email to the koha account
10 - Reload results, note you see availability
11 - Log out, reload results
12 - Note you see a promp to login to see availability

Switch to argparse for command-line parsing

I do not like argparse. In fact, you could say I hate it. It works well
enough if all you do is assign values to variables, but as soon as you
want to do something more advanced (e.g. slightly customized help
messages or - god forbid - custom actions) it gets tedious to work with.
But I also have to be realistic here. Manual parsing just doesn't scale
well, especially with a language that doesn't provide case statements.
Of course the always looming threat of a forgotten value check in
check_options() wasn't great either.

So I bit the bullet and switched to argparse.

The original Options class (now with a different name) is still present,
mainly because I want all defaults at the very beginning of the script,
so that they are readily available. The advanced option defaults are now
in parse_cli() though.
Unfortunately I still have to do some additional option checking, since
some pitfalls can only be detected after all options are set. Sometimes
it's also not worth it to introduce a new type function, so that
argparse can check on assignment, when it only applies to one option.
Wouldn't it be amazing, if you could just pass argparse a condition,
instead of having to define a new type?

On a side note, this commit also removes the --no-color flag, as it
didn't disable colorized output for default error messages and would
leave your terminal output colorized in case of such a message.
