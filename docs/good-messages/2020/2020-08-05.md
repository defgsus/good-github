Continue Messing with the Death Message Scene (WHY)

I just couldn't stop messing with the death message scene. I don't
know why. It was just too hard to resist.

First, I updated the text, swapping my broken shader attempt for a
prebaked gradient texture, with world-triplanar mode enabled. The sum
effect sorta approximates what I wanted - it's as if there's pockets
of color that the text is offering us a window into. Like a rainbow
cake, or something.

Secondly, I made the text animate, which is what I wanted it to do to
start with. I used a Tween to animate a custom property, allowing our
values to change over time. I had to do some funky stuff - especially
since 3D rotation with angles is frowned upon in Godot. That meant
precalculating and caching the rotations in Basis objects, then
capturing those in Quaternions, and then 'slerping' (???) between
them. I really didn't see how that was explicitly better than angles
but I suppose that's why I haven't made a game engine yet.

Finally, I painstakingly made the text animate at a very specific
rate: 134 bpm ...or, animations per minute, I guess. See, it was music
that inspired this stupid death screen. I was listening to "Your
Secrets" by SUI UZI when the idea of the bouncing animated text as a
game over screen came to mind. Obviously I won't be including the file
here, but I only mention it because I want to a) give credit and
b) document how I found the BPM.

You see, Audacity has a metronome track generator - they call it a
"Rhythm Track". Originally I was trying to count the beats compared to
the song but that was driving me mad. In a fit, I realized that I
could just ZOOM IN and match the waveforms. If the rhythm track had
too long between points, then the BPM needed to be higher. If it was
too short, the BPM needed to be lower. And, by god, it worked!

With this dumb death message out of the way, I should be able to get
back on track - starting with those dang villager houses...

"9:30am. I am going to require foralls rather than doing it like F# does.

```
inl f (x : a) = ...
```

In this case, it makes it confusing whether `a` is a forall or a metavariable. Metavariables get generalized, but foralls don't. Sure it would be possible to do it like F#, but then I'd have to put in some special metavariable that also doubles as a forall. Screw that.

Yesterday, after I went to bed I had two other ideas.

* Make paired symbol type lowercase only.
* Op fields should be parsed as bottom up.

I've instituted the first one to make union cases more what they would be called, I just realized that the consequence of the first rule is that...

```
(a: 1) + 2
```

In a type error `a: 1`'s type would be printed as `A: i32`. Agh, that is not what I had in mind. So let me make paired symbol type what it actually is.

Regarding parsing the Op fields, I should have done this from the start, but simply forgot. I'd have realized my error once I try parsing a type variable and got a parse error.

```fs
            | (r,x) :: k', v ->
                if Char.IsLower(x,0) then
                    List.reduceBack (fun a b -> RawTPair(range_of_texpr a +. range_of_texpr b,a,b))
                        (RawTSymbol(r,symbol_paired_concat ((r,x) :: k')) :: v) |> Ok
                else
                    Error [r, SymbolPairedShouldStartWithLowercase]
```

Let me go with this.

```fs
| SymbolPairedShouldStartWithLowercaseInTypeScope -> "Paired symbol should start with lowercase in type scope."
```

Actually, let me name it like this.

9:45am. Now let me go for the other point. In top-down foralls, it might be good to support kind metavars and wlidcards. Instead of assuming that `forall a.` is the same as `forall (a : *).`, it might be better to give it a kind metavar since I know how to do that now.

Well, forget that for the time being. It is not too important, and I can always do it later. I'll save it for when it is time to do constraints.

Let me take care of the Op fields.

```fs
match a with
| "!!!!" ->
    (range (read_big_var .>>. (rounds (sepBy1 (fun d -> expressions {d with is_top_down=false}) (skip_op ","))))
```

There.

9:55am. Ok, let me try this out.

```
union option x =
    | some: x
    | None

inl f x =
    inl (+) (a : i32) (b : i32) = !!!!Add(a, `b) : i32
    1+2+3+X
```

Prasing type vars in op fields works now. It is awkward how `some:` is lowercase and `None` is upper, but it can't be helped. Nevermind this little thing.

This way of doing things is right, no doubt about it.

10:05am. Ok, I know that by this point am really vacilating on starting work on the term inference. Still if what I have in mind is right it won't be too much harder than anything else I've done. Given what an integral part of v0.2 it is expected to be you'd think it would take huge amounts of code, but I expect it go quite smoothly. It won't be particularly more complex than the prepass for example. And if I consider just the unification part, rather than filling out the implicits, it should be quite simple indeed, only somewhat more than validating bound variables.

10:20am. Let me do my morning reading and then I will get on with it. I missed the Satanophany raw yesterday."

"5:35pm. I am back.

5:40pm. Wow, this is really annoying. I only really need the types, but doing the open imports literally everything. The `+` operator does not work proper as a result.

5:45pm. No nevermind, I forgot to close a parenth in the parser and that broke everything.

Let me get my bearings, as if I wasn't confused enough without this.

5:55pm. Ok, let me decide on a few things.

```fs
| TyInl(a,b,c) -> TyInl(Map.map (fun _ -> term_subst) a,b,term_subst c)
```

Let me make this an error. Damn these things are so annoying. Type functions are just as bad as I expected. But by the time the compilation reaches unification they should been fully substituted away.

What I am missing right now in the unifying `eval`. That will be the `ty` function.

```fs
    let unify (r : Range) (got : T) (expected : T) : unit =
        let er () = raise (TypeErrorException [r, TermError(got, expected)])
        let rec loop = function
            | TyVar(a,_), TyVar(b,_) when a <> b -> er ()
            | TyVar(a,_), TyVar(b,_) when System.Object.ReferenceEquals(a,b) = false -> raise (TypeErrorException [r, ForallVarScopeError(a,got,expected)])
            | (TyVar(a,_), TyMetavar(i,_) | TyMetavar(i,_), TyVar(a,_)) when i < forallvar_scopes.[a] -> raise (TypeErrorException [r,ForallMetavarScopeError(a,got,expected)])
            | TyMetavar(a,_), TyMetavar(b,_) -> if a < b then term'.[b] <- got else term'.[a] <- expected
            | (TyMetavar(a,_), b | b, TyMetavar(a,_)) -> term'.[a] <- b
            | (TyPair(a,b), TyPair(a',b') | TyFun(a,a'), TyFun(b,b') | TyApp(a,a',_), TyApp(b,b',_)) -> loop (a,b); loop (a',b')
            | TyRecord l, TyRecord l' ->
                let a,b = Map.toArray l, Map.toArray l'
                if a.Length <> b.Length then er ()
                else Array.iter2 (fun (_,a) (_,b) -> loop (a,b)) a b
            | TyHigherOrder(i,_), TyHigherOrder(i',_) -> if i <> i' then er()
            | TyB, TyB -> er()
            | TyPrim x, TyPrim x' -> if x <> x' then er()
            | TySymbol x, TySymbol x' -> if x <> x' then er()
            | TyArray a, TyArray b -> loop (a,b)
            | (TyForall(a,b), TyForall(a',b')) -> failwith "TODO"
            | (TyInl _, _ | _, TyInl _) -> failwith "Compiler error: TyInl should have been substituted away by this time."
            | _ -> er ()

        try unify_kind r (tt got) (tt expected)
            loop (term_subst got, term_subst expected)
        with :? TypeErrorException as e -> errors.AddRange e.Data0
```

Let me go with this from the top. I should be unifying kinds as well.

```fs
| TyApp(a,a',ka), TyApp(b,b',kb) -> loop (a,b); loop (a',b')
```

I do not know. Does it make sense to have kinds in `TyApp` and such?

```fs
| TyApp of T * T // Regular type functions (TyInl) get reduced, while this represents the staged reduction of nominals.
```

```fs
| (TyPair(a,b), TyPair(a',b') | TyFun(a,a'), TyFun(b,b') | TyApp(a,a',_), TyApp(b,b',_)) -> loop (a,b); loop (a',b')
```

Actually, let me leave it as it was. I do not need to do unification as all the the items will be a part of the structure.

...ah, actually no. I won't.

6:10pm.

```fs
| TyHigherOrder(i,_), TyHigherOrder(i',_) -> if i <> i' then er()
```

Hmmm, I do not have to check the kinds here. If these two are equal so should their kinds be equal.

```fs
| (TyForall(a,b), TyForall(a',b')) -> failwith "TODO"
```

So surprisingly it turns out I only really have to check kinds in metavariables.

Ok...

```fs
| (TyForall(a,b), TyForall(a',b')) -> failwith "TODO"
```

Now this thing. Let me reason about it again. In order to unify them, the foralls need to be equal under renaming.

Ok, here is what I am going to do. I feel less confused now.

6:20pm. Actually I am confused still, but let me see if I can push this through.

...No forget it. I can't deal with this right now. Foralls will never really appear in strange places so I do not have to waste my time thinking. I'll only need to do this unification in instances. I will restrict foralls in the top down segment after all.

It is just too much work to implement renaming just for foralls. What annoyances they are.

```fs
        let case_forall d =
            if d.is_top_down then Error [] else
                (tuple3 forall (many root_pattern_pair) (skip_op "=>" >>. next)
                >>= fun (foralls, pats, body) _ ->
                    match patterns_validate pats with
                    | [] ->
                        List.foldBack (fun pat body -> RawFun(range_of_pattern pat +. range_of_expr body,[pat,body])) pats body
                        |> List.foldBack (fun a body -> RawForall(range_of_typevar a +. range_of_expr body,a,body)) foralls |> Ok
                    | ers -> Error ers) d
```

There once again. I do not have to worry about foralls showing up in strange places.

```fs
            | (TyForall(a,b), TyForall(a',b')) ->
                if fst a <> fst a' then er () // TODO: Implement renaming for foralls.
                unify_kind r (snd a) (snd a')
                loop (b,b')
```

Let me go with this.

I think this is one TODO that will stay there for a while.

6:30pm. Now, there is plenty of work to be done, but it is almost time to finish for the day.

```fs
unify_kind r (snd a) (snd a')
```

This bothers me. I need to fold this in and give this proper error terms.

```fs
    let unify (r : Range) (got : T) (expected : T) : unit =
        let unify_kind (a : TT) (b : TT) : unit =
            let rec loop = function
                | KindStar, KindStar -> ()
                | KindFun(a,a'), KindFun(b,b') -> loop (a,b); loop (a',b')
                | KindMetavar a & a', KindMetavar b & b' -> if a < b then kind.[b] <- a' else kind.[a] <- b'
                | KindMetavar a, b | b, KindMetavar a -> kind.[a] <- b
                | _ -> raise (TypeErrorException [r, KindError (got, expected)])
            loop (kind_subst a, kind_subst b)
```

Lexical scope is trully magical.

6:35pm.

```fs
| RawType(_,x) -> ty x env
```

Apart from `ty` and ...

```
        //| RawModuleOpen of Range * (Range * VarString) * (Range * SymbolString) list * on_succ: RawExpr
        //| RawRecordWith of Range * RawExpr list * RawRecordWith list * RawRecordWithout list
        //| RawMatch of Range * body: RawExpr * (Pattern * RawExpr) list
        //| RawFun of Range * (Pattern * RawExpr) list
        //| RawRecBlock of Range * ((Range * VarString) * RawExpr) list * on_succ: RawExpr // The bodies of a block must be RawInl or RawForall.
```

These 5 cases, I am actually quite deep into it. I wrote close to 150 lines today. I might be 40% done at this point. Maybe 50%.

```fs
| RawReal _ | RawOp _ -> fresh_var() // TODO: These two need to be validated for unbound vars.
```

Ah, yes, I need to validate these.

```fs
| Some x -> x // TODO: Forall pruning.
```

I need to apply the foralls here. This is what I thought to do for unifying foralls in the other case, but it is too much of a pain right now.

6:45pm. I am taking a little breather here, and I think I will stop for the day here as I am starting to feel dizzy.

Today my momentum was excellent. I was completely in the zone. Programming sessions do not get much better than this.

6:50pm. I have a good idea how to do forall substitution succinctly.

...Let me do some overtime then. Who am I to deny inspiration.

7:05pm.

```fs
    let rec forall_eval (m : Map<string,T>) x =
        let f = forall_eval m
        match x with
        | TyMetavar _ | TyHigherOrder _ | TyB | TyPrim _ | TySymbol _ -> x
        | TyPair(a,b) -> TyPair(f a, f b)
        | TyRecord l -> TyRecord(Map.map (fun _ -> f) l)
        | TyFun(a,b) -> TyFun(f a, f b)
        | TyArray a -> TyArray(f a)
        | TyApp(a,b,c) -> TyApp(f a, f b, c)
        | TyVar(a,_) -> m.[a]
        | TyForall(a,b) -> forall_eval (Map.add (fst a) (TyVar a) m) b
        | TyInl _ -> failwith "Compiler error: TyInl should have been dealt with."

    let forall_subst_all x =
        let rec loop (m : Map<string,T>) = function
            | TyForall((n,k),b) ->
                let v = fresh_var()
                unify_kind k (tt v)
                let m = Map.add n v m
                loop m b
            | x -> forall_eval m x
        loop Map.empty x

    let forall_subst_single ((n,k),b) =
        let v = fresh_var()
        unify_kind k (tt v)
        let m = Map.add n v Map.empty
        forall_eval m b
```

There. Apart `unify_kind` being red due to not being in scope, this is quite good.

```fs
    let inline forall_subst_all unify_kind x =
        let rec loop (m : Map<string,T>) = function
            | TyForall((n,k),b) ->
                let v = fresh_var()
                unify_kind k (tt v)
                let m = Map.add n v m
                loop m b
            | x -> forall_eval m x
        loop Map.empty x

    let inline forall_subst_single unify_kind ((n,k),b) =
        let v = fresh_var()
        unify_kind k (tt v)
        let m = Map.add n v Map.empty
        forall_eval m b
```

...Yeah, this is wrong. I should avoid having to unification. In that case then...

```fs
    let forall_subst_all x =
        let rec loop (m : Map<string,T>) = function
            | TyForall((n,k),b) ->
                let v = TyMetavar(term'.Count,k)
                term'.Add(v)
                let m = Map.add n x m
                loop m b
            | x -> forall_eval m x
        loop Map.empty x

    let forall_subst_single ((n,k),b) =
        let v = TyMetavar(term'.Count,k)
        term'.Add(v)
        let m = Map.add n v Map.empty
        forall_eval m b
```

This is much better.

Since I have this, I might as well make use of it.

```fs
            | (TyForall(a,b), TyForall(a',b')) ->
                unify_kind (snd a) (snd a')
                loop (forall_subst_single(a,b), forall_subst_single(a',b'))
```

Here is the renaming I sought for.

```fs
            match Map.tryFind x env.term with
            | Some x -> x // TODO: Forall pruning.
```

Now let me do the pruning as well.

```fs
            match Map.tryFind x env.term with
            | Some x -> forall_subst_all x
```

```fs
| RawReal _ | RawOp _ -> fresh_var() // TODO: These two need to be validated for unbound vars.
```

Should I validate these while I am at it as well?

Let me do it.

```fs
        | RawReal(_,a) ->
            try assert_bound_vars env.term env.ty (Choice1Of2 a)
            with :? TypeErrorException as e -> errors.AddRange(e.Data0)
            fresh_var()
```

The one one is just this in a list.

```fs
        | RawOp(_,_,l) ->
            List.iter (fun a ->
                try assert_bound_vars env.term env.ty (Choice1Of2 a)
                with :? TypeErrorException as e -> errors.AddRange(e.Data0)
                ) l
            fresh_var()
```

Piece of cake.

This leaves only `ty` and...

```fs
        //| RawModuleOpen of Range * (Range * VarString) * (Range * SymbolString) list * on_succ: RawExpr
        //| RawRecordWith of Range * RawExpr list * RawRecordWith list * RawRecordWithout list
        //| RawMatch of Range * body: RawExpr * (Pattern * RawExpr) list
        //| RawFun of Range * (Pattern * RawExpr) list
        //| RawRecBlock of Range * ((Range * VarString) * RawExpr) list * on_succ: RawExpr // The bodies of a block must be RawInl or RawForall.
```

...for tomorrow. I think I have a decent claim on being 50% done with this now. That means I am 2/3rds or maybe more done with the typechecker.

Let me finally stop here. It is lunch time."

sometimes!) so screw it.

* Fix misleading documentation

* Mention metadata in the readme

Thanks to @connorshea for this.

* No longer include Gemfile.lock

That's not needed because this is a gem.

* Allow default values

This provides default values (and thus fixes #20)

* Show how to use multi-file version

I believe this should thus actually fix #20.

* Autofix lints

* Allow complex query params

If we're actually going to use this with V3-style controllers, this is
kinda required!

* Update README.md

* Disable Bad Cop

I really hate the complexity cops. Especially when I get inconsistent
behavior between CI and local.
