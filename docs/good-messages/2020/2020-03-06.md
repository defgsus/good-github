iommu: rewrite device assignment

This was a mess.  The data structures and connections between processes,
pci_devices, and iommus were all a mess.  The pci device assignment
wasn't integrated with the iommu, etc.

The main thing is that processes now have lists of their iommus, which
will make things less painful when we do an IOTLB flush.  It's still
painful, but not as bad.

All of the assignment stuff was changed, so now you call the pci
functions, e.g. pci_assign_device(), which will internally deal with the
iommu.

When processes are destroyed, we tear down any assigned device.  In my
current code, all in-kernel device users hold the pdev qlock.  For
example, when #cbdma tries to use the IOAT driver, it qlocks the device.
I think we'd be OK if the device was unassigned out from under the
driver, in that the IOMMU would protect us from any wild writes, but the
kernel driver would likely get wedged.

I have a bunch of changes to #cbdma, but the easiest thing right now is
to just not build it briefly.

[CommitMetadataChecker] Handle exceptions

This a definitely "check to see if the reviewers are paying attention"
commit...

I mean... it would be kinda funny if they weren't, but also sort of not
surprising based on how often my PR descriptions and commit messages are
regularly ignored:

- https://github.com/ManageIQ/miq_bot/issues/414#issuecomment-375089647
- https://github.com/ManageIQ/miq_bot/issues/414#issuecomment-375090956
- https://github.com/ManageIQ/miq_bot/issues/414#issuecomment-375092758

*cough* *cough*

Oh... yeah, I am totally not bitter...

/me is definitely a little bit bitter...
/me definitely making this commit message longer than it needs to be...
/me wondering if anyone has noticed yet...
/me probably needs to push this change for that to be effective...
/me `git push -u origin ...`

Simplify BucketedSort (#53199)

Our lovely `BitArray` compactly stores "flags", lazilly growing its
underlying storage. It is super useful when you need to store one bit of
data for a zillion buckets or a documents or something. Usefully, it
defaults to `false`. But there is a wrinkle! If you ask it whether or
not a bit is set but it hasn't grown its underlying storage array
"around" that index then it'll throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
The per-document use cases tend to show up in order and don't tend to
mind this too much. But the use case in aggregations, the per-bucket use
case, does. Because buckets are collected out of order all the time.

This changes `BitArray` so it'll return `false` if the index is too big
for the underlying storage. After all, that index *can't* have been set
or else we would have grown the underlying array. Logically, I believe
this makes sense. And it makes my life easy. At the cost of three lines.

*but* this adds an extra test to every call to `get`. I think this is
likely ok because it is "very close" to an array index lookup that
already runs the same test. So I *think* it'll end up merged with the
array bounds check.
