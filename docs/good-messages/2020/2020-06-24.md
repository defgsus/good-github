I hate python. I hate cython.

Can't begin to tell you how much I hate these. If you had to
invent a language that was any more mind-melting, screwed up
and inoperable, you'd call it "brainfuck".

This stuff is just utterly opaque as mud, unpredictable,
never does what you expect it to do and is just plain confusing
every time you use it. I have no clue why people like python.
Its upside-down and backwards and has the toilet bolted to
the ceiling. Because that just makes going to the toilet so
much more interesting.

Sheesh.

warped fork okrs

With remarks:

- I'm simply not scoring the `go-ipfs`-related OKR.  To the best of my
  understanding, the efforts to roll go-ipld-prime forward into more of
  the go-ipfs codebase are currently stalled because those efforts were
  deprioritized during the go-ipfs v0.5 release cycle for reasons that
  had to do with go-ipfs and are unrelated to IPLD.  (And yes, that is
  the reason why I insisted on phrasing this OKR the way it's phrased;
  this was fairly predictable.)  We did do a fair amount of work to
  chart out how this migration could be performed, and I'm at least
  happy with that; but I wouldn't say it's on track to go further until
  we have go-ipfs increasing prioritization and consistently carrying a
  baton on that side (particularly considering that the main result of
  our how-to-migrate research was confirming that yes, the internal
  package graph of go-ipfs is such that this change is very likely to
  either require acting in a very large and decisive sweep (which
  requires maintainer energy and active engagement); or, requires
  prolonged efforts in advance to break things down into smaller and
  less densely inter-related pieces (which might be the way to go, but
  again has a lot more to do with go-ipfs maintainer energy than any
  other limiting factor)).

- Codegen gets a partial score.  It's going along, but continues to be
  a massive task.  Some demo usage has been made, but we're still
  lacking a CLI and a finished end-user-accessible experience, so it's
  hard to call that complete.  The feature table of all schema features
  we intend to support is also still less than solid checkmarks
  (although, hey, we  *have* a detailed feature table now; that too is
  progress).  The good news is we're iterating and getting close enough
  to real demo usage that we're starting to get some interesting
  practical design feedback from that process.

- Link loading gets review: let's give that partial credit.
  It's gotten review!  There's a sizable writeup issue on it now.
  That was the goal; I suppose I could mark it 1.0 with no shame.
  I've also made a couple tries on drafting a better interface...
  however, none of that has born fruit yet; something definitively
  better remains illusive.  I'm refraining from making changes
  just for the sake of making changes without confidence that it would
  result in a better solution than the current situation.

- Traversal and link loading docs: yes, we have examples now.  They
  use the standard godoc example/test system.  Yay.  Done.
  Could also use more?  Definitely.  But we no longer have a void.

Final, typical disclaimer: none of these are really OKRs; they're not
really measurable; we don't separate objectives and results; and we
just plain don't have a team big enough and unitary enough that OKRs
make sense in the first place, so they degenerate to task lists, which
in turn they are spectacularly not good at being.  The same laments on
the inaccuracy-fermentation this process creates apply every quarter;
I note them duly.
