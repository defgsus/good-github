Production setup is done!

PS. Am I gonna get hacked by publishing my nginx conf?

Nope. :)

What about my full docker-compose.yml file?

Nope, not that either.

Is there anything here I could be hacked over?

Possibly... if you were stupid and left some .env secrets lying around, or deleted a gitignore file and committed the build/certbot/conf/keys dir. So don't do that. :)

 - Changed membrane nameplate option to off by default on Carapace, since it'll be more common to use a weak aura that actually shows absorbs instead
 - Drycoded support for Absorbing Charge (new add) on Mythic ilgynoth, a mechanic they added on live that didn't exist in PTR testing.
 - Fixed Mythic Maut curse timer so it'll show at all times
 - Changed icon marking on hivemind to now mark both add events, and to now cycle through 6 icons on loop. the icon behavior is subject to change based on strategies and other addons/weak auras.
 - Changed behavior of no escape on Vexiona to display no escape timer instead of brutal smash timer. Also made timer about 0.6 second faster.
 - Removed pointless and spammy creeping madness target warning. entire raid gets it, no sense in announcing 20 names. Glad i caught that one in my review tonight :D
 - Changed creeping madness special warning from a "stop moving" warning to a "stack high" warning to avoid situatinos where DBM might tell a user to stop moving during cataclysm. This is one of those cases where DBM should give information, not tell you what to do with that information. In addition, changed it to only warn at 32, 40, and > 50 stacks (with an ICD of 4 seconds). Old behavior warned every 10 stacks and that was overkill, especially for 10 and 20 stacks which most of raid would get just naturally. Warning should be for TOO MUCH movement, not an annoyance.

Add life count view, but man this is not panning out so well

- I need a serious refactor of the space scene because my boy, it is not
  working out well
- I am imagining being able to set different states that a scene can be in,
  each with their own update() functions. That will help take a lot of the
  pain away

# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

![Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

If you would like the Sketch file in order to inspect the design in more detail it is available to [purchase here](https://bmc.xyz/l/uXWTfHQ53).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Practice using version control by creating your own GitHub repository for this challenge. This has the added benefit of being able to publish the site for free on GitHub Pages. Find out more about GitHub Pages here: [https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com).

Also, you could try building this project in a team. This is a great way to practice collaborative coding.

## Suggested workflow

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Submit it on the platform so that other users will see your solution on the site. Other users will be able to give you feedback, which could help improve your code for the next project.
2. Share your repository and live URL in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
3. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor** including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.

## Giving feedback

Feedback is always welcome, so if you have any to give on this challenge please email hi[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Have fun building!** 🚀

Hooking up with React Hooks
=================================================

* Speaker   : **João Dias** and **Mickael Costa**
* Available : **All days**
* Length    : **90 minutes**
* Language  : **English**

Description
-----------

In the last months, React Hooks changed how we write and think about reusable and straightforward code. This training workshop will cover the fundamentals of React Hooks, how to convert your codebase and also how to take advantage and create your own custom ones. All of this in simple, straightforward and understandable examples.

By the end of this workshop we will be able to do the following:

-   Use built-in React Hooks to create more reusable and straightforward code
-   Re-factor Class components into functional components using hooks
-   Create custom hooks and reuse them throughout a project
-   Know where React Hooks fall short and we should choose class components instead.

"10:40am. Making things continuous is really one of the greatest inventions of modern optimization. Even in discrete optimization, you can make things semi-continuous by postulating move probabilities and adjusting those.

It is not going to go away.

Though SL in terms of training on a static dataset as is done now will not be important, supervised learning itself will be used for administrative tasks such as knowledge transfer and distillation. So it will be quite important.

10:45am. Yeah, it is one thing to imagine how to be courageous and kill oneself in order to gain power, but if the issue was merely to play with the continuum of being, I would have long become the king of universe.

The issue in gaining power post-Singularity might be quite similar to the issues facing me today.

Right now I am here in this chair, and there a bunch of programs on the computer (outside my mind). How do I eat them?

10:50am. What I am writing here should be common sense, but programming is as much a matter of feeling as it is a matter of reason. It is difficult to get the feeling unless you really put yourself in that position of living in the future.

Post-Singularity - functional programming is not going to go away. All the algorithms that work well today, will work well in the future as well. Quicksort is not going to go away for example.

And I think the principles of deep learning as were discovered in the past decade will not necessarily be swept away just like that.

So it is not like I learned nothing. I can make inferences based on the current knowledge.

Of course, there will definitely be new things in the future, but knowledge I can use as a part of the foundation is definitely here today, and a lot of that knowledge was not there before the 10s (or was rediscovered there).

10:55am. Self optimization will play a role, but I blew up the importance of it.

The most important thing is to learn from perfected imagination.

11:15am. This is the right subjective perspective. And those are important. Programs are one thing, but the you do need to put yourself into the thick of things mentally to gain understanding.

11:35am. Right now I am just chilling, but I'll get breakfast pronto and then do the chores. After that I will do more programming.

I just really needed Spiral v0.09 to do the ML library, but now that it has come to this, I am not sure what I should aim for.

But if programs are understanding then I really should not be satisfied with semi-dynamic languages like F#. I need Spiral to do my thing properly.

Maybe I have failed at really understanding ML, but it might be possible to understand everything around it.

I really have learned a lot from Spiral haven't I?

Imagine if I had the brain cores - would I really want to program in F#? Or would I rather do it in Spiral?

Spiral really allows quite a lot of freedom that even DTLs do not, let alone F#.

Without a doubt, Spiral is the closest to the true language of computation.

11:40am. If programs are the meal of tomorrow, I certainly would not want to eat lesser ones.

11:45am. I really have been quite confused. I said I would like to create a poker agent and make money, but if this were the post-Singularity era, you'd really want to create an agent so you can do knowledge transfer.

The Inspired did their hacks in the stories, but...the way optimization works is that you impose continuity and then ride that. And this would hold even if you use evoalgos in combination with local updates like backprop or something to that effect.

The total expansion in capacity corresponds to architectural changes.

11:50am. Yeah, I am different from 6 years ago. I really did learn a bunch, and as a result I cannot really look at things the same way I have before.

Rather that the caricature of self improvement that Simulacrum described, I really should be able to see much more what it actually is. I can definitely see details that I haven't been able to before.

11:55am. I should make Spiral...if I believe it is the language I will be using 10 years from now.

In the post-Singularity era, I would expect that the programmers would have complete mastery of both the hardware and the software they are running themselves on. That in fact does mean making your own OS and language, in addition to having the ability to synthesize cores from residual material.

Fundamentally, other people giving you the hardware, the software and the language is no way to go about this.

Even short term - remember the Deep CFR episode?

If I was on the brain core, and had only access to some Python and C++ code, would I have tried translating that to my own language, or would I just tried hacking Python as the average code monkey would?

12pm. In 2018 I was really tired by the time the new year came around, but it does feel like growing your own thing is the way gains are accumulated in this area.

I do not really gain anything by having access to a large number of libraries done by other people.

That is because I am not trying to solve a problem. I am merely trying to make the power of these algorithms my own.

And isn't that really learning?

I am pissed at ML. I am pissed at classical math. I am pissed at not going everywhere in 5 years. I am pissed that despite all this effort I still do not really understand ML.

But what did I really expect? What should understanding even be in this situation? Because it is not like I did not know that I wouldn't be able to trace these float using algorithms with just the power of my mind.

It should been obvious to me - if understanding is really interaction, then the real way to understand these programs is to put them directly inside one's head and do knowledge transfer directly. This sort of fusion is the pinnacle of interaction.

12:10pm. If I am going to make v0.2, I need a real reason. The problem I am really trying to solve is one of interaction.

I might not be able to put stuff in my head directly, but just like before I should anticipate the future and act on it.

It is true that other languages exist that might get the job done, but if this sort of thing is really that important, then I should not allow more than one chef in the kitchen.

12:15pm. Languages are important. They really are.

12:20pm. What should I do here?

Adults look down on kids, but as strange as things might seem, the best thing for kids is to act as they are. Kids should act like kids rather than adults.

If I one day want to be a real post-Singularity tier programmer, I should just accept the cuts and the curses, and larp as one. It is not given that one day I am not going to grow up.

For the sake of one day attaining the power of the machines, I should strive for it. For I desire that power from the bottom of my heart.

12:25pm. Let me take that break here.

I want to take the time to internalize the full implications of the basic idea that the way to really understand complicated things is to put them inside the head. In fact, for simple algorithms that I can understand that is literally true. So really, why did it take me so long to understand this?

Well, one thing.

There are still some principles missing. That standard ML algorithms as they work now are not really generative. The way optimization work is quite primitive right now, so I could not connect the dots.

Without a doubt, the way living agents work is definitely more lifelike than current ML. So in the torrent of conflicting view and perspective I am not sure what I should believe.

But I should definitely believe this.

Math talent might be necessary to derive new algorithms, but I can be certain after my 2019 experiences - the reason why I can't understand these algorithms is definitely not because I am too dumb. Real understanding that I seek should be impossible for everybody right now.

12:30pm. If I really want that power, what I need to is to reduce the interactive distance.

Partial evaluation is the true foundation of computation.

But now I need to elaborate upon this.

12:35pm. It might turn out to be that to make ML really work, I do not need wholly new algorithms anymore that I need to replace Spiral's partial evaluation with something else. Instead what I really need is the equivalent of additional structure as would be afforded by top-down typing and unification.

12:35pm. Once again, let me take that break here."

lib/list_sort: optimize number of calls to comparison function

CONFIG_RETPOLINE has severely degraded indirect function call
performance, so it's worth putting some effort into reducing the number
of times cmp() is called.

This patch avoids badly unbalanced merges on unlucky input sizes.  It
slightly increases the code size, but saves an average of 0.2*n calls to
cmp().

x86-64 code size 739 -> 803 bytes (+64)

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of low-hanging fruit in a merge sort;
it already performs only n*log2(n) - K*n + O(1) compares.  The leading
coefficient is already at the theoretical limit (log2(n!) corresponds to
K=1.4427), so we're fighting over the linear term, and the best
mergesort can do is K=1.2645, achieved when n is a power of 2.

The differences between mergesort variants appear when n is *not* a
power of 2; K is a function of the fractional part of log2(n).  Top-down
mergesort does best of all, achieving a minimum K=1.2408, and an average
(over all sizes) K=1.248.  However, that requires knowing the number of
entries to be sorted ahead of time, and making a full pass over the
input to count it conflicts with a second performance goal, which is
cache blocking.

Obviously, we have to read the entire list into L1 cache at some point,
and performance is best if it fits.  But if it doesn't fit, each full
pass over the input causes a cache miss per element, which is
undesirable.

While textbooks explain bottom-up mergesort as a succession of merging
passes, practical implementations do merging in depth-first order: as
soon as two lists of the same size are available, they are merged.  This
allows as many merge passes as possible to fit into L1; only the final
few merges force cache misses.

This cache-friendly depth-first merge order depends on us merging the
beginning of the input as much as possible before we've even seen the
end of the input (and thus know its size).

The simple eager merge pattern causes bad performance when n is just
over a power of 2.  If n=1028, the final merge is between 1024- and
4-element lists, which is wasteful of comparisons.  (This is actually
worse on average than n=1025, because a 1204:1 merge will, on average,
end after 512 compares, while 1024:4 will walk 4/5 of the list.)

Because of this, bottom-up mergesort achieves K < 0.5 for such sizes,
and has an average (over all sizes) K of around 1.  (My experiments show
K=1.01, while theory predicts K=0.965.)

There are "worst-case optimal" variants of bottom-up mergesort which
avoid this bad performance, but the algorithms given in the literature,
such as queue-mergesort and boustrodephonic mergesort, depend on the
breadth-first multi-pass structure that we are trying to avoid.

This implementation is as eager as possible while ensuring that all
merge passes are at worst 1:2 unbalanced.  This achieves the same
average K=1.207 as queue-mergesort, which is 0.2*n better then
bottom-up, and only 0.04*n behind top-down mergesort.

Specifically, defers merging two lists of size 2^k until it is known
that there are 2^k additional inputs following.  This ensures that the
final uneven merges triggered by reaching the end of the input will be
at worst 2:1.  This will avoid cache misses as long as 3*2^k elements
fit into the cache.

(I confess to being more than a little bit proud of how clean this code
turned out.  It took a lot of thinking, but the resultant inner loop is
very simple and efficient.)

feat(setuptools): Integrate setuptools, install as development package

Most important feature.
Not that the intended target audience is more than one user, necessarily,
but nonetheless one of the primary motivations for this ordeal:
Namely, enabling code reusability via proper imports
(as opposed to pure git submodules or - god forbid - copy and paste),
while avoiding `sys.path` hacks, relative imports, and/or
shallow shell script wrappers modifying the `PYTHON_PATH` environment variable.
Neither feels particularily clean.

fix(declarative) schema validation in db-less mode

### Summary

This was reported with #5401. When I added DAO transformations,
for some reason I ended up writing stupid code that just broke
the whole schema validation on declarative. This commit is an
attempt to fix that. Sorry for all the pain caused.

While fixing this, I also found out that original validation
didn't work correctly when you had entity validations that relied
on values of foreign keys. This is now also corrected.

### Issues Resolved

Fix #5401

Implemented Particle BC approach + got load/save working!

Body.h, Body.cc: I wrote a new method, Apply_BCs, which simply applies BCs to each patticle in a body. This is done using a parallel for loop to optimize performance.

Body_IO.cc: Removed an intentional bug that I introduced yesterday (to test the whole exception thing) but forgot to remove... oops.

Update.cc: While getting the code to work, I ran into a bunch of problems with nan accelerations. I was able to quickly debug the problem by having the particle print its info if it gets nan.

Save_Simulation.cc: There was a bug in here. I wrote a line to print the "plus_x_BC" (an approach that I am NOT using any more), but forgot to remove it.. that line caused a bunch of problems. Also, I added some extra spaces to the "Has_BC" part of "Save_Particle" to improve readability.

Load_Simulation.cc: Oh boy, there were some bugs in here. The part that read in "Time_Steps_Between_Updates" only worked if a body was not a box... This line should be read in for ALL bodies, not just non-box ones. I have no idea why that if statement was there. I fixed it. There was also a strange typo in the sscanf lines (318 and 326)... I double typed something. For some reason, the compiler didn't comaplin about this one, idek.

Particle.cc: I updated the particle printing method to improve debugging.

Partice.h: Updated friend function prototypes.

Boundary_Conditions.cc: Made the BC functions work with the "Paritcles have BCs" approach. This involved renaming some functions and changing a few lines. Surprpsingly painless.

Simulation_Setup.cc: Renamed Free_Box_BC as FREE. Renamed Startup_Simulation as Setup_Simulation. Added BC setting to Setup_Box method.

Simulation.cc: Updated function names. Updated the way that BCs are applied (108-109) and fixed a REALLY ANNOYING bug. Before, time_update was an unsigned. this was a TYPO, it's suposed to be a double. This bug caused a ton of problems. Finding it took forever :-1:. Anyway, after fixing that (and encountering another bug with time_update when loading in files... Time_Steps_Between_Updat was not being set for box bodies, see my discussion on Load_Simulation.cc for more), I realized that this line should have some printouts for debugging. I added some (141-144), and defined a new variable, "SIMULATION_DEBUG" to toggle printing.

Simulation.h: Added SIMULATION_DEBUG definition (and commeted it out), updated some names, and played around with some settings.

With these changes, the code ran, saved, loaded, and ran again! Save/Load is finally working again, and BCs are fully implemented!

In the future, I want to implement the setup file.

Initial experiment porting RTS to TypeScript

For weeks now I have been building a small Real-Time Strategy game
using Ruby. My game is named `rts` and it has gone from a New Year
project into a sustained effort! https://github.com/46bit/rts

Ruby is excellent for experimenting and improvising. I wouldn't have
gotten to where I have if I hadn't used it. But Ruby isn't suited to
the demanding performance of a game with thousands of intelligent
agents. The game slows down to a few updates per second once there are
more than 250 units. `ruby-perf` profiler output has been discouraging
about optimising the game: there's no nasty surprises, the game just
does too much.

My experience is that JavaScript and WebGL have far better performance
than Ruby and the Ruby2D library I've been using for rendering. They
can also be used by almost anyone who visits a website, allowing me to
show my game without any effort.

Using Rust and WebAssembly might well have been faster but I wasn't
convinced that it can reliably do concurrency yet. I found someone I
respect had gotten Rayon working with Web Workers, but there were a
lot of issues and I expect an entire game is likely to hit a few of
them!

This commit reimplements the basic RTS Engine's types and a little of
the functionality into TypeScript. TypeScript is just a wrapper around
JavaScript with proper typing. I copied a lot of the TypeScript stuff
from https://github.com/alphagov/paas-admin, the only other TypeScript
project I know well.

The benchmark in `src/main.ts` is doing 2 billion Vector operations in
about 28 seconds. No doubt there's optimisation going on to do it, but
it is still quite encouraging. By comparison, Ruby took 26 minutes.

I plan to carry on this port to TypeScript and WebGL. I've named the
new project RTT: RTS with the last letter incremented, but also an
idea of where I want to take the game. In time I think the game will
be called RoTaTion, and it will regularly rotate through 90 degrees
out of plane so that unit's relative positions are changing. Hopefully
I don't do that because it sounds horrific for human players, but it's
an idea. I love being creative! <3
