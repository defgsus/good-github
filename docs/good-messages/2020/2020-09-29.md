Quality of Life Changes

        - Added flesh-to-leather capability without additional mods, via smelting only.
        - Added granite-to-cobble capability without additional mods, for those who don't want granite, diorite, or andesite, (aka the ugly & useless blocks).
        - Added cheap-arrow capability for those who hate flint. Now you can craft an arrow with cobblestone, albeit less efficient.
        - Changed the Enchanted Item Glint. Now looks epic as fuq
        - Changed "Tom Yum" to "Tom Yum Kong".
