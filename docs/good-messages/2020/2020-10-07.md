It has something to do with feeling like I'm there. I am the one being
chased, I am the one panicking, I am running for my life, feeling
terror.

For me, it's most easily activated by sound. When I watched (tried to
watch) Children of Men, the chase-through-the-forest scene was already
intense, plot-wise. But the peaceful, dreamlike hum that preceded,
contrasted against the long, drawn out sounds of her slowly bleeding to
death through her throat that extended far past the chase itself,
preventing any merciful release of tension, put my senses way, way over
the edge and I had to eject myself from the movie.

The hour or so that followed, I laid on the carpet in my living room. I
knew it was a quiet day, but every tiny little sound—a faucet being
turned on somewhere else in the building, or two people conversing as
they walked by outside—every sound was excruciating.

Despite knowing that it wasn't reality, my brain was allowing emotion to
bleed into reality, confusing the two for a time while it calmed down.

   A tiny bit of background about me: I turn 30 tomorrow. A close friend
   from our neighborhood died last month. I've been thinking about life
   and death a lot lately. This game is an expression of my recent
   thoughts and feelings.

   -Jason Rohrer, creator of Passage

Sometimes I think the best way to safely reflect is to pick a point in
time and ask: What brought me peace in the middle of the night?

---

Twenty years ago, I was in the winter of fifth grade.

I was a good student, I earned perfect grades, read constantly, and was
reminded by my peers on a daily basis that I was gay, and a loser, and
inferior. Finding no friends in them, I rather sought solace in the
non-real and abstract.

When Earth disappointed, there was Middle Earth, and Channelwood, and
Zebes to explore. When burned by people, I quipped with Milo, was
comforted by Hoo-Lan, and held hands with Tori.

It was the nights when my nose was buried between the pages of The Boy
Who Lost His Face, or when my glasses reflected the passages and
corridors of South Figaro that I was most at peace.

---

Ten years ago, I was in the winter of my freshmen year at an Ivy League
university.

I was a terrible student, I skipped class constantly, and avoided my
peers as much as possible. I slept through many days and spent countless
nights wandering through the suburbs surrounding campus. I climbed
cranes when no one would worry, self-injured during showers when no one
would hear, and wore sunglasses so people would have a harder time
reading my facial expressions.

Despite all this, I had a girlfriend back home that I was in love with.
Before leaving for college, I wrote:

   asleep in your arms
   the world is placid and warm
   everything is right

I felt that if I could just hold out long enough to see her again, I
would have nights like that again.

---

I'm now in the winter of my final year as a graduate student.

I'm an okay student I guess, but I have loving friends, healthy hobbies,
and a lot to look forward to. Any stressors are, once again, external:
school, deadlines, bills, etc. I've been sleeping somewhat poorly the
last month or so, but having more time to produce (code, words, music,
thoughts) as a result.

Tonight, I woke up at 4am and, unable to find sleep again, left my
apartment for a walk. Surrounded by darkness, I breathed in the 10F air,
and found peace in the sound of freshly-fallen snow crunching under my
boots.

Update on "Rewrite implementation of faithful cpp signatures"


This rewrite is as per my comments at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/44087#issuecomment-701664506
I did the rewrite by reverting #44087 and then reimplementing it on top.
You may find it easier to review by diffing against master with only #44087
reverted.

There are two main ideas.

First, we now factor cpp argument processing into two phases operating
on three representations of data:

1. `FunctionSchema` - this is the source from native_functions.yaml
2. `Union[Argument, ThisArgument, TensorOptionsArgument]` - this is
   the arguments after doing some basic semantic analysis to group
   them (for TensorOptions) or identify the this argument (if this
   is a method).  There is only ever one of these per functions.
3. `Union[CppArgument, CppThisArgument, CppTensorOptionsArgument]` -
   this is the arguments after we've elaborated them to C++.  There
   may be multiple of these per actual C++ signature.

You can think of (2) as common processing, whereas (3) bakes in specific
assumptions about whether or not you have a faithful or non-faithful
signature.

Second, we now have CppSignature and CppSignatureGroup representing
the *total* public C++ API signature.  So those dataclasses are what
know how to render definitions/declarations, and you no longer have
to manually type it out in the Functions/TensorMethods codegen.

Here is an exhaustive accounting of the changes.

tools.codegen.api.types

- CppSignature and CppSignatureGroup got moved to tools.codegen.api.types
- Add new CppThisArgument and CppTensorOptionsArguments (modeled off
  of ThisArgument and TensorOptionsArguments) so that we can retain
  high level semantic structure even after elaborating terms with C++
  API information.  Once this is done, we can refine
  CppArgument.argument to no longer contain a ThisArgument (ThisArgument
  is always translated to CppThisArgument.  Note that this doesn't
  apply to TensorOptionsArguments, as those may be expanded or not
  expanded, and so you could get a single CppArgument for 'options')
- Add no_default() functional mutator to easily remove default arguments
  from CppArgument and friends
- Add an explicit_arguments() method to CppArgument and friends to
  extract (flat) argument list that must be explicitly written in the signature.
  This is everything except (Cpp)ThisArgument, and is also convenient
  when you don't care about the extra structure of
  CppTensorOptionsArguments

tools.codegen.api.cpp

- group_arguments is back, and it doesn't send things directly to a
  CppSignatureGroup; instead, it moves us from representation (1) to (2)
  (perhaps it should live in model).  Here I changed my mind from my
  PR comment; I discovered it was not necessary to do classification at
  grouping time, and it was simpler and easier to do it later.
- argument got split into argument_not_this/argument/argument_faithful.
  argument and argument_faithful are obvious enough what they do,
  and I needed argument_not_this as a more refined version of argument
  so that I could get the types to work out on TensorOptionsArguments

tools.codegen.api.dispatcher

- Here we start seeing the payoff.  The old version of this code had a
  "scatter" mode and a "gather" mode.  We don't need that anymore:
  cppargument_exprs is 100% type-directed via the passed in cpp
  arguments.  I am able to write the functions without any reference
  to use_c10_dispatcher

tools.codegen.gen

- Instead of having exprs_str and types_str functions, I moved these to
  live directly on CppSignature, since it seemed pretty logical.
- The actual codegen for TensorMethods/Functions is greatly simplified,
  since (1) all of the heavy lifting is now happening in
  CppSignature(Group) construction, and (2) I don't need to proxy one
  way or another, the new dispatcher translation code is able to handle
  both cases no problem.  There is a little faffing about with ordering
  to reduce the old and new diff which could be removed afterwards.

Here are codegen diffs.  For use_c10_dispatcher: full:

```
+// aten::_cudnn_init_dropout_state(float dropout, bool train, int dropout_seed, *, ScalarType? dtype=None, Layout? layout=None, Device? device=None, bool? pin_memory=False) -> Tensor
 Tensor _cudnn_init_dropout_state(double dropout, bool train, int64_t dropout_seed, const TensorOptions & options) {
-    return _cudnn_init_dropout_state(dropout, train, dropout_seed, optTypeMetaToScalarType(options.dtype_opt()), options.layout_opt(), options.device_opt(), options.pinned_memory_opt());
+    static auto op = c10::Dispatcher::singleton()
+        .findSchemaOrThrow("aten::_cudnn_init_dropout_state", "")
+        .typed<Tensor (double, bool, int64_t, c10::optional<ScalarType>, c10::optional<Layout>, c10::optional<Device>, c10::optional<bool>)>();
+    return op.call(dropout, train, dropout_seed, optTypeMetaToScalarType(options.dtype_opt()), options.layout_opt(), options.device_opt(), options.pinned_memory_opt());
 }
```

Otherwise:

```
+// aten::empty_meta(int[] size, *, ScalarType? dtype=None, Layout? layout=None, Device? device=None, bool? pin_memory=None, MemoryFormat? memory_format=None) -> Tensor
 Tensor empty_meta(IntArrayRef size, c10::optional<ScalarType> dtype, c10::optional<Layout> layout, c10::optional<Device> device, c10::optional<bool> pin_memory, c10::optional<MemoryFormat> memory_format) {
-    return empty_meta(size, TensorOptions().dtype(dtype).layout(layout).device(device).pinned_memory(pin_memory), memory_format);
+    static auto op = c10::Dispatcher::singleton()
+        .findSchemaOrThrow("aten::empty_meta", "")
+        .typed<Tensor (IntArrayRef, const TensorOptions &, c10::optional<MemoryFormat>)>();
+    return op.call(size, TensorOptions().dtype(dtype).layout(layout).device(device).pinned_memory(pin_memory), memory_format);
 }
```

Things that I probably did not get right:

- The Union[Argument, TensorOptionsArguments, ThisArgument] and
  the Cpp variants are starting to get a little unwieldy.  Not sure if
  this means I should add a supertype (or at the very least an
  alias); in some cases I do purposely omit one of these from the Union
- Code may not necessarily live in the most logical files.  There isn't
  very much rhyme or reason to it.
- The fields on CppSignature.  They're not very well constrained and
  it will be better if people don't use them directly.
- Disambiguation.  We should do this properly in #44087 and we don't
  need special logic for deleting defaulting for faithful signatures;
  there is a more general story here.

Introduce Lazyplug

Other hotplugging methods including mpdecision and intelli_plug focuses
on how should we turn off CPU cores. They hotplugs the individual CPU
cores based on the current load divided by thread capacity.
Lazyplug takes a whole new approach on how we should do hotplugging
based on the foundation of the other side of the coin;
“Linux’s hotplugging is very inefficient.”

Current hotplugging code on Linux is a total waste of CPU cycles and
delays, so rather than hotplugging and hurt performance & battery life,
just leaving the CPU cores on might be a better choice. This kind of
approach is spreading out more and more.
Samsung has been using this method for a very long time with big.LITTLE
devices and recent Nexus 6 firmware also does the similar thing.

Lazyplug just leaves them on, most of the time. It also tries to solve
some problems with the “Always on” approach. On situations such as video
playback, turning on all CPU cores is not battery friendly. So Lazyplug
*does* actually turns off CPU cores, but only when idle state is long
enough(to reduce the number of CPU core switchings) and when the device
has its screen off(determination is done via earlysuspend or
powersuspend because framebuffer API causes troubles on hotplugging CPU
cores).

Basic methodology :
Lazyplug uses majority of the codes from intelli_plug by faux123 to
determine when to turn off CPU cores. If the system has been idle for
(DEF_SAMPLING_MS * DEF_IDLE_COUNT)ms, it turns off the CPU cores. And if
the next poll determines 1 core isn’t enough, it fires up all CPU cores
(instead of selective CPU cores; which is the traditional intelli_plug’s
method).
Lazyplug also takes touch-screen input events to fire up CPU cores to
minimize noticeable performance degradation.
There’s also a “lazy mode” for *not* aggressively turning on CPU cores
on scenario such as video playback. For example, if you hook up
lazyplug_enter_lazy() to the video session open function, Lazyplug won’t
aggressively turn on CPU cores and tries to handle it with 1 CPU core.

* TODO :
* Dual-core mode : YouTube video playback is mostly single-threaded.
* It usually hovers around 10% ~ 30% of total CPU usage on quad-core
* device. That means 1 CPU core might not be enough to handle it, but
* also turning on all CPU cores is unnecessarily wasting power.

Spoon in Matrix

Chef recently saw the movie Matrix. He loved the movie overall but he didn't agree with some things in it. Particularly he didn't agree with the bald boy when he declared - There is no spoon. Being a chef, he understands the importance of the spoon and realizes that the universe can't survive without it. Furthermore, he is sure there is a spoon; he saw it in his kitchen this morning. So he has set out to prove the bald boy is wrong and find a spoon in the matrix. He has even obtained a digital map already. Can you help him?

Formally you're given a matrix of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Your job is to find out if the word "Spoon" occurs somewhere in the matrix or not. A word is said to be occurred in the matrix if it is presented in some row from left to right or in some column from top to bottom. Note that match performed has to be case insensitive.

Create documentation.md

because the world needs to know.

also a quick favor. if you would go to labels and make one called hacktoberfest-accepted and assign it to this pr it would be enough to make some great strides in the world of open source. Also mr gill survived the ventilator so hes kind of a fucking god and i will worship him for all my life.

[kicker] Don't add invalid actions to the system action model

The system actions model recently changed behavior to always present all
possible actions, with `AbstractEntry::isValid` driving the model role
`Kicker::DisabledRole` so that views can e.g. grey out unavailable
actions.

This was perceived as a regression by users who are annoyed at e.g.
`Hibernate` being visible when their system setup precludes it more or
less permanently.

This patch reverts this behavior.

Note that the dynamic approach we had permanently wasn't very great
anyway, as the associated favorites models would remove entries when
they became invalid, and they wouldn't come back automatically when the
entry were to become valid again. In effect that means when you added one
of these actions to e.g. the Kicker sidebar and it became unavailable
it would disappear until re-added anyways.

I can imagine use cases where dynamic behavior would be useful to have -
let's say disabling Shutdown/Reboot while a critical system update is
being performed. But in that case we'd need to fix the favorites
behavior and add some way to inform the user why the action is disabled
for a good user experienced anyhow.
