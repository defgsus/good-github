Add messages from Nethack 2.3e

It's a damn shame those great rumors got taken out, probably just "because they're slightly sexist" or something. Bullshit. Here in SLEX, we'll re-add those since there's some real gems among them.

1) SQL DataPersistenceLayer now automatically creates the destination table if it does not exist [SQL server only, different syntax required for an oracle SQL database and a different syntax still (for a total of 3) required for a mysql database. Having one statement to check for the existance of a table accross all 3 RDBMS is simply impossible. Why? Because fuck you, thats why].

Box Colliders cleanup and package cleanup

Wow.

Box colliders are evil. It was just edge case bug after edge case bug trying to get box vs box to work correctly. I'm really glad to have something that seems to be working.
Is it fast? Probably not.
Does it break ties intuitively? No.
Does it break ties deterministically? Yes.
Does it have room for optimization? Absolutely!
Is optimizing it the next thing on my list?
...Yeah...NO!

I think I am going to wait until Burst 1.5 becomes stable before I try that.

Also, I fixed a bug with the injection workflow template. I'm surprised I was the first to discover it. Or maybe everyone else did and just modified it to work since it was template code and not package code. And while discovering that, I also realized that I should probably update all the other housekeeping things as well.

Anyways, I'm planning another collab session to try this stuff out. So my next step is to do some actual LSSS work. Then I have to clean up simdFloat3 and make my own math.select(bool4, bool4, bool4) so I don't have the crazy bitwise expression everywhere. Oh, and Audio at some point maybe.

Yeah, I keep myself busy.

implement online multiplayer

I decided to get around to this today. I'm adapting this code from https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/quiplibre, so it unfortunately inherits all the strengths and weaknesses of such. For instance, quiplibre seems to arbitrarily fail half the time in practice (mysterious network errors), so I've marked the feature as experimental. This code uses the peerjs library, and yoinks that at runtime from https://unpkg.com/peerjs@1.3.0/dist/peerjs.min.js. Due to the n-to-1 peer-host infrastructure, you can add more than one person to the 'room', and play incredible n-player, 2-color chess. I didn't implement any sort of multiplayer hiding in the fog of war chess because I felt that wouldn't be as funny. In fact, I didn't implement any per-player restriction at all. It's just like having an actual chess board in front of you: only the social contract prevents you from moving all the pieces at your whim. A less fragile implementation might transmit and sync the entire board state (and also the menu state) every time, but, I didn't do that.

Testing of this feature has unfortunately been limited to my local machine as I don't have any friends who like chess.

Finished day 7.

I hate that parsing takes most of the space. Also fuck recursion,hardest shit to debug.

Regex is bullshit, but I need it here.
Thanks to the Stack Overflow wizards for blessing us with magical expressions that solve our programming problems.

Refactor base classes for strict tree integrity guarantees

This is a pretty major overhaul of the entire way that nodes are added
to and removed from trees.

Essentially, the root inventory is used as an authoritative reference of
everything in the tree, and everything is updated and validated in the
setter.  So, rather than having a `parent` setter that sets the
`_parent` internal reference directly, the `parent` setter removes the
node from its root inventory, changes the path, and then calls the
`root` setter to figure out all the references.  The same with
`fsParent`, `target` and `linksIn` references between links and nodes,
and so on.

This avoids a number of hazards that have been biting us.

- Set a `x` node's parent, but don't properly connect it to nodes that have
  that parent as their `fsParent`, via
  `parent/node_modules/x/node_modules/y`.  Now, `y` will properly be
  detected as a child of `x`, and linked accordingly.
- Adding two link nodes to the same target resulting in two reachable
  nodes in the tree with the same `realpath`.  Now, it'll see that
  there's already a node with that `realpath`, and assign the link
  targets accordingly.

The list goes on and on.  This is why, for example, setting `.` as a
workspace caused some really weird data to show up in the
package-lock.json, and we had a snapshot where two `abbrev` links had a
target with a name as either `aaaaaa` or `zzzzzz`, depending on which
ended up getting added to the tree first.

The plus side is: way more consistency, with a much more forgiving API
as far as the order in which nodes get added to the tree.  The downside:
the `root` setter is a beast of delicate complexity.

Thankfully, `treeCheck(this)` is called after every call to the `root`
setter.  In debug mode, this performs an exhaustive check of the tree
and inventory, ensuring that every reachable node in the tree is present
in the inventory, that every node in the inventory is reachable, that
the entire tree has exactly one `root` node, that no nested dependencies
have `devDependencies` trying to get loaded, that no non-root nodes have
anything in their inventory objects, and so on.

This checking is of course painfully slow, and turns any error into a
fatal crash, _but_ we only run it in debug mode, which is something we
can ask users to do for debugging if they run into weird "impossible"
issues.

Caveats with this refactor:

- The root node is now included in the inventory
- The `node.location` (which is the inventory key) is the node's
  relative path based on the root's _realpath_, meaning that a Link node
  root will have a location other than `''`.

These two things together mean that we cannot test `node.location === ''`
to determine root-ness, which was done in a few places previously.  The
correct indicator is `node.isRoot`, which should always be the way to
determine whether a node is root.

This commit causes breakage in the higher level functions, which will be
fixed in subsequent commits.
