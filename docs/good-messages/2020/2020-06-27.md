[analyzer][MallocChecker][NFC] Communicate the allocation family to auxiliary functions with parameters

The following series of refactoring patches aim to fix the horrible mess that MallocChecker.cpp is.

I genuinely hate this file. It goes completely against how most of the checkers
are implemented, its by far the biggest headache regarding checker dependencies,
checker options, or anything you can imagine. On top of all that, its just bad
code. Its seriously everything that you shouldn't do in C++, or any other
language really. Bad variable/class names, in/out parameters... Apologies, rant
over.

So: there are a variety of memory manipulating function this checker models. One
aspect of these functions is their AllocationFamily, which we use to distinguish
between allocation kinds, like using free() on an object allocated by operator
new. However, since we always know which function we're actually modeling, in
fact we know it compile time, there is no need to use tricks to retrieve this
information out of thin air n+1 function calls down the line. This patch changes
many methods of MallocChecker to take a non-optional AllocationFamily template
parameter (which also makes stack dumps a bit nicer!), and removes some no
longer needed auxiliary functions.

[245] use socket pool in all signal writes

* replace `app.sock` with `app.socketPool`
* `socketPool.run` intializes 50 socket connections and returns a pool
  with a `stop` method that drains and clears the pool
* `getSocketConnection` subscribes to every open socket with `dispatch.dispatcher`
* to accomodate a cleaner signauture for `dispatch` (we want it to
  only have to handle the incoming message), move the `resendQueue`
  for the resendService to a private field on the resend module
* also move startup logic of subscribing to channels from dispatcher
  to signal module (so that dispatch becomes a module of pure functions)
* add `socket.write` which acquires a socket connection from the
  pool, writes to it, and releases it, use this in all signald command
  functions in signal module
* do some funny business with late require statement of socket module
  from `signal.run` (don't love it but import-time semantics are confusing!)
* NOTE: we descope (and actively break) all response-handling signald
  functions (that handle responses to verify, trust, and
  version). fixes for that are coming in the next commit!

makepkg: protect against unexpected whitespace in filenames

zipman:

read -r protects against those evil manpages whose filenames contain
backslash escapes, (muahahaha?)

IFS= read protects against filenames with:

- leading whitespace (but no one is actually stupid enough to configure
  their MAN_DIRS=() in makepkg.conf with such silly directories, *right*?)

- trailing whitespace (but likewise, no one should be stupid enough to
  write an uncompressed manpage for section '1 ' or something)

Also fix several other cases where we read filenames without protecting
against surrounding whitespace, or without using null-delimited
filenames when we could trivially do so.
