Fix bad thumbnails on hires displays

**Why thumbnails look pixelated or blurred on hi-res monitors**

It took some more time to understand what @parafin comments really mean for this problem
and to get me on the track.
Just what he wrote

Citation:
PPD is pixels-per-dot. All screen dimensions GTK/cairo/etc. operate on are in dots.
So let's say 3840 x 2160 monitor with ppd == 2 will have dimensions of 1920 x 1080 dots.
So full-screen cairo surface has width of 1920 and height of 1080, but if you want to render
a pixmap to it with full resolution, it needs to be 3840 x 2160 pixels.
The idea was that not high-dpi-aware application will work without any code changes
(so what was one pixel in size in low-dpi, automatically becomes 2 pixels with high-dpi).
But it results in this brainfuck to write high-dpi-aware apps.
P.S.
Also note that DPI is dots-per-inch, not pixels-per-inch, so with ppd=2, dpi is half the real DPI of the monitor.

This is of course right and means:
If we want to have a thumbnail with size wd*ht shown on the main surface/display, wd and ht both must be
doubled on a hires display, here ppd == 2.

BUT this is *not* happening in current dt code.

The underlying function is
`dt_view_image_get_surface(int imgid, int width, int height, cairo_surface_t **surface, const gboolean quality)`

width & height are both in dots and so we search for a a proper thumbnail via
`dt_mipmap_cache_get_matching_size` with ppd->pixel corrected size. (The double multiply there is of course wrong)

Later on we create the bitmap surface corrected using `const float scale`
This scale is wrong! I should be corrected also by *ppd to return the read thumbnail, as it is now
the bitmap surface for ppd==2 systems is not better than on ppd==1 systems.

This means: currently on ppd==2 we later have to upscale the small bitmap by 2; with best-neighbour rendering
this leads to pixelated, with good filter to blurred thumbs which can be clearly seen when pixelpeeping by
screenshot or viewing through an enlarging glass.

SO: Make sure dt_view_image_get_surface returns a proper/large thumbnail surface.

The next part is something i need more help (or other people might do it) as i have no gtk experience at all.

The thumbnails shown must **not** be scaled by gtk-default (the whole gtk stuff seems to be done in dots not
pixels) but needs scaling & positioning corrected for ppd (the current masters code does not need to do so).

I confess i don't know how to fix this at all places, never touched this part of dt code before.

At least - take this as a proof of concept -
1) Attached example show master and new pr code results
2) It explains the sometimes bad experiance of people on hires monitors and how we could tackle this.
