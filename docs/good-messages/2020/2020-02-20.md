Add some more info to tower dialogs.

Also:
I already found a fucked-up case where a train gets jammed because wind
blows you out of your imprinted location and then you try to go back to
it. Following towers can't also go to that location because the lead is
there again. Perhaps in that case I fall back to ignoring the imprint
and instead using the leading tower's current location?

But weird shit like that will make it frustrating to try to build a
mental model of what's going on. I'll think about it.

Remove exe / com wrapper around openrct2.dll for Windows (#10727)

We get repeated reports of people saying the game is incorrectly reported as a virus. It is becoming more inconvenient for players and even myself, because when we attempt to download a build, it is immediately deleted by scanners (including the default for Windows: Windows Defender).

One scanner is not too much of an issue, but the game is flagged by almost half of available scanners as reported by VirusTotal.

So why is it being flagged?

Windows has a very annoying concept, the subsystem for a binary. The console subsystem allows stdin / stdout as you would expect, just like posix. Unfortunately if a user runs a console subsystem binary from the desktop or explorer, the game will be opened under conhost and thus you get a console showing alongside the game window. This is not a good user experience for most players. To resolve this, you can use the windows subsystem, but this will detach stdin and stdout immediately on launch. There are hacks that can be done in code to allocate a new console but I found this to not work very well with stdin or other terminal emulators.

My solution to the problem was to have two binaries: openrct2.exe and openrct2.com. Both are executable but openrct2.exe is windows subsystem, openrct2.com is console subsystem. The desktop shortcut opens openrct2.exe with no console window showing. Typing openrct2 on the command line will execute openrct2.com (as .com has higher PATH precedence than .exe by default) with working stdin and stdout. In order to reduce the size, I have the entire game inside openrct2.dll and then supply two tiny wrapper EXEs that simply route main(...) into the DLL.

These wrapper EXEs are the problem, they are very small and do nothing but call into a DLL, this must match virus signatures too closely and their size probably reduces the data available for the scanner to analyse.

So as I can not find any other way of achieving my goal of a cli and gui version of OpenRCT2, this changes the build to publish openrct2 as a single executable (rather than a DLL + wrapper EXE), and then duplicate the entire ~10MB exe again and flip the subsystem flag. The installer and zip size won't be affected as this extra size will be completely compressed out, but when unpacked will lead to an extra ~10MB on disc. But I think it is a fair compromise.

VirusTotal now reports all artefacts as safe, for now anyway.

PWAs and Fighting Against App Stores

- Speaker : Gabriel Poça
- Available : first day, second day
- Length : 30 minutes
- Language : English

This talk is about what we can do with the open web. There are two parts to it.

The first part is smaller and philosophical. I'll talk about the open web and
its importance. My purpose is to show how broken the mobile world is, and how
dangerous the play store and app store are. How we've been in this situation
before, and what we should be doing to avoid getting into it again. These
stores are not open platforms, but most people cannot choose not
to use them. There have been plenty of antitrust lawsuits filed against Apple
and Google but nothing seems to change. Shouldn't we stop feeding the giant
before it gets too big?

The second part of this talk is more technical. I'll show what's available on
the web right now, and why it's probably enough for most of your apps. We'll
talk about deploys, notifications, offline support, media access, file system
access, etc. There's a lot in there. We will go over the good and the bad,
clarifying the limitations of each technology. I'll talk about what's to come
and to which platform. I also show what you can do right now to leverage both
web and native technology while you wait for support on the web.

The information in this talk is based on real life experience building PWAs for
many years now.

I don't have a fancy title to show of. I'm a developer and my work goes from
hiring to cloud infrastructure. For the past two years I've been focused on
building the infrastructure for UTRUST (https://utrust.com/), which is a
payment gateway for blockchains. I write a lot of Elixir and JavaScript. I care
about the social impact software has, and how the choices we make today impact
other people and the next generation.

Just too many changes to list, check description.

I'll just be as brief as possible since there are way too many changes to recall.

* Finally added some sort of machine learning driven AI. It's still stupid as all hell and doesn't work properly whatsoever, but this is very, veeeery early stages.

* Added new particle effects.

* Added menus.

* Added new music.

* Added a new stage inspired by Medieval times.

* Added a new actor component for debugging attacks.

* Fixed a ridiculous amount of bugs... So. Many. Bugs. Finally over...

* Made adjustments to gameplay: You can no longer move away from center indefinetly. You'll eventually be stopped.
