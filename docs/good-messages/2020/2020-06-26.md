remove Target::step in favor of Target::resume

Oh boy, this one tiny change resulted in a _massive_ refactor.

One big change is that there's no built-in support for software
breakpoints anymore. This is unfortunate, but truth be told, it's
not too difficult to implement software breakpoints manually, and
the performance gains of not having to single step the system will
be _massive_.

There is one fairly major regression in this commit though: I broke
support for "Interrupt" packets. I'll be addressing this in the next
commit for-sure, since that's a feature I personally use _a lot_.

Some other things of note:
- I've decided that for the time being, I'll be omiting the GDB-assigned
PID from the user-facing API, and only passing though the TID values.
This reduces API clutter, and given that I don't intend to support
extended mode / multiprocess debugging, I don't think including a
dead-weight PID in the API boundary is a good idea.
- This lays the groundwork to finally implement multi-thread support!
Just gotta un-hardcode those thread-query packets, plumb though some
callbacks, and theoretically things should Just Work TM.
- I've reverted back to using the `Option<Result<_,_>>` approach to
optional features for the time being.
- I added `kill` packet support lol

Some random thoughts:
- What's a nice way for the target to specify what vCont? features they
support? It'd be nice to plumb through things like range-based
stepping...

Merge pull request #11762 from SimonRichardson/error-messages

https://github.com/juju/juju/pull/11762

## Description of change

This brings in the new charm and charmrepo changes around error
messages, when reading and parsing bundle files. The charm repo
highlights and identifies each file that went wrong, so the charmer can
see easily how something isn't quite right.

There is one problem and that is the sad reality of the code though, we
now have 3 different error types that we have to negotiate between...

 - std error
 - gopkg.in/errgo
 - github.com/juju/errors

Considering this is in fact a juju project, we should drop the errgo one
and be done with it. The code path itself has to marshal and unmarshal
the errors from std err -> juju/errors -> errgo -> juju/errors and each one has
different semantics. Not to mention we actually lose the stack trace
from the marshalling and unmarshalling, which is a damn shame.

## QA steps

```yaml
# ./tmp/bundle.yaml
series: bionic

applications:
 dummy:
 charm: ../testcharms/charm-repo/bionic/dummy
 num_units: 1
```

Apply this diff to your repo.

```diff
diff --git a/testcharms/charm-repo/bionic/dummy/config.yaml b/testcharms/charm-repo/bionic/dummy/config.yaml
index a164f0a19a..204abf7489 100644

 username: {default: admin001, description: The name of the initial account (given admin permissions)., type: string}

#### Test

```sh
juju bootstrap lxd test
juju deploy ./tmp/bundle.yaml
```

#### Expected outcome:

```sh
ERROR cannot deploy bundle: issue parsing "config.yaml" file: yaml: line 2: found character that cannot start any token
```
