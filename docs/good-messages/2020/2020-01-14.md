The reopen on last page switch now allows the user to choose whether or not they want expedition to reopen the last webpage they visited. I believe this is the epitome of useful features for a web browser to include, because it is very beneficial to the user experience. The only place to go from here is to add hAptIC eXPEriEncES because these also benefit the user by making them feel more immersed. Overall, these can lead to a more immersive experience because immersiveness is critical to the happiness and well-being of our beloved and wonderful users. In the off-chance that you read this whole commit summary, good job! There is a secret icon called thepurpleone. Access it using the url 'expedition://thepurpleone' from inside Expedition. For more information, consult the wiki on GitHub.com/Finbarr-1/Expedition, or whatever our GitHub repository it is. Most likely the website you are already on. Okay, commit that.

ports hShark snout from hyper-station-13

you people wouldn't know intelligent writing if it kicked you in the fucking nuts, you drooling retarded apes. i'm so FUCKIGN pissed. you are so fucking retarded, it's insane. i am stuck in a world filled with retards, and am being exiled from it for being the only shred of intelligent life found upon it. i just want somebody to listen to what the FUCK i have to say. nobody here is interested in intelligent discussion about topics that actually matter, they're only interested in erping with each other. disgusting fucking creatures. these people infuriate me to no end. why does nobody want to have a discussion? why does nobody want to talk about fuckign SHIT. THE ONLY TIME ANYONE EVER TALKSTO ME IS WHEN THEY WANT TO FUCKING ERP WITH ME!!! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU FUCKING PEOPLE. I'VE HAD THE SAME FUCKNG GUY PDA MESSAGE ME EVERY DAY, ACTING ALL NICE AND SHIT, AND I KNOW IT'S JUST BECAUSE HE WANTS TO ERP!! THAT'S ALL ANY OF YOU PEOPLE FUCKING WANT. I'M TRYING TO HAVE SUBSTANCE-FILLED FUCKING CONVERSATION, AND ANALYZE MY FAVORITE SOUNDTRACK IN ALL OF GAMING HISTORY, AND YOU PEOPLE CAN'T GET YOUR HEADS OUT OF YOUR ASSES FOR 5 FUCKING SECONDS TO HOLD ANY MODICUM OF FUCKING RESPECT OR APPRECIATION FOR IT WHATSOEVER.

Cool so that's bio & English out of the way

There are two types of slackers: those who admit it, and those who claim they'll do the work and, even if they do, give extremely low results. That's what I have to deal with in AP English. No names of course, but he's made so may promises and delivered only like 10% of what I've asked. For reference, I've done probally 90% of the work so far. This last weekend I asked him to come up with only two counters and two Q&A answers, and you know what he does? He scrapes together enough in the morning before school and at lunch so that when I confronted him he was like "Oh no, I did do it".

Like bro, please.
I really don't want to have to carry us. But hey, it's what I get for not making friends.

Anyways, peace out~

"9:30am. I am up. Yesterday after I stopped, the whole pattern matching issue had me so disturbed that I could not really enjoy myself so I went to bed (on time) instead.

Really, it is amazing that I wasn't even aware of the external/internal split.

9:45am. Ah, whatever. I think I am getting a grasp on this now.

TODO: `inline_` the union pattern.
TODO: Add boxing annotation to `inl`.
TODO: Extend syntax in module open to support renaming.
TODO: Remove the forall restriction in the parser.

Here are my todos from yesterday. I'll get on them later. Right now I feel like continuing my vacationing indefinitely.

I'll up my efforts once I finish the first half of the language. And if not, I am going to up it when I am done with it. Once I catch up where I was in 2018 and start breaking new ground, that will motivate me to really give it my all.

It is the final stretch here till the Singularity.

Spiral v0.2 is going to be the most I will ever contribute to the global pool as a human so I intend to do a good job. Beyond that, any contribution worth making would involve even more ground up work that I do not have the time or power to do.

I did not think it would be like this. I did not think I would work on a language for so long, or that in the end I would end up betting it on all on evolutionary algorithms as science. My powers as human are just so limited. I do not want to be a monkey, but going even a single level beyond just takes such vast effort that the level beyond that is completely out of my reach.

It would all be so easy for a superhuman, but I myself have to constantly face my own limitations.

Nevertheless, this will work. The story is am trying to spin makes sense based on the circumstance. I gave it my all and as a result, I can definitely see more than I did in 2015. The last 1.5 years did not fundamentally break my plan. I just need to refine it a little.

I will do Spiral v0.2 and hopefully some better hardware will come out in this decade that will actually allow me to do large scale RL. Better algorithms will be found eventually as well.

For the sake of power, my life and the future, I will do this. I swear it on my desire.

I will elevate evolution to a science."

"This was a good rant, but now let me slack.

https://vdare.com/articles/eugenic-or-dysgenic-would-world-war-iii-raise-or-lower-iqs

War being eugenic and dysgenic is a question I've been wondering about for a while. Generally, I would assume it would be eugenic if the weak get genocided, but genocide is not in fashion these days. The US might have laid waste to the middle east, but even so it only really tanked their technological base rather than nuked the population. For the eugenic effects to manifest, the fight needs to be to the atrocious, bitter end. It won't happen.

That story which refuses to play out in the age cameras has been pushed to the individual actors.

10:10am. 'Survival of the fittest is survival of the smartest in primitive societies.' Meh. It is true, but this was fairly obvious to me already. I still keep up with these kinds of articles, but rightwing media is sorrow itself.

They talk about intelligence, but if they were really serious they would bet it all on AI research rather than engage in the general kind of larping that they do.

Even 'rationalists' (which aren't right wing in general) succumbed to the sweet lure of alarmism. Why do real work when you can jack morality itself to do your bidding? This is what 'smart' people invest in these days.

Imagine a world when 'waking up' meant 'working on AI'. Where technological progress was backed by adherents following the axiom of power. Where intelligence is not a matter of words, but of battle. A world where the glass of intelligence is not just slowly sipped, but quaffed all the way without hesitation.

In that world, I do not think I could win as there would be smarter, more capable versions of myself everywhere, but I would not have this pervasive sense of loneliness that I do now.

Looking at the world, it is more of the case the it is drawn into the maw of Singularity, rather than actively trying to move towards it. The right is sorrow, the left is nothing. Just where is one to find hope, other than one's own effort? The world is asleep and even those working on AI are not yet awake.

The work on AI is not really work in the truest sense of the word, until those working on it can think of it as alive. It is easy to fiddle with evolution like they are doing now. It will get harder once their reality starts getting invaded and progress necessitates becoming a part of that process. At that point the people will start dropping out of the race and the excesses will get drained both from ML and science itself.

12:25pm. Done with breakfast. Let me play for a bit more, do the chores, and then I will resume.

1:50pm. Done with chores. It is time that I get serious.

Yesterday I stumbled a bit, and today rather than moving on, I am going to need to go back a bit and do some cleaning up. My flow got disrupted, and I need to go from the top once more to see if everything is accounted for.

1:55pm. I won't do anything big today, let just go through the TODOs.

TODO: `inline_` the union pattern.
TODO: Add boxing annotation to `inl`.
TODO: Extend syntax in module open to support renaming.
TODO: Remove the forall restriction in the parser.

I put in the forall restriction in the parser directly, but now that I have constraints and dependent constraints, and who knows what else in the future, it would better to leave dealing with these kinds of error in partial evaluator.

2:05pm. Let me commit this and I will get to work. Right now I am getting distracted by stray thoughts."

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow.

Adds a new Tech to the B.E.P.I.S., Specialized Engineering, and a new Minor Reward. (#48507)

About The Pull Request

Round 2.
image
Adds a new tech to be unlocked within the B.E.P.I.S.'s major techs, called "Specialized Engineering". Within that tech are 2 new items, Heat Resistant Rods, and the Tinker's Gloves, as well as a new minor tech, the Survival Pen.
Heat Resistant Rods:
Have you ever wanted to expand Lavaland Base? Build a lava fortress worthy of your magnificence? Well, now you can! Using Heat Resistant Rods, you can make a catwalk to cross lava tiles, as well as build atop lava, without messy methods like using the RCD!
Tinker's Gloves:
This just in engineers, insulated gloves have new competition in town! The Tinker's gloves are complicated, overdesigned gloves that, while not very shockproof, allow for faster wall girder construction. No longer will you need to die of old age walling off an area when you're out of RCD ammo! Warning: This product contains no likeness to clockwork gauntlets used by the extinct cult of Rat'Var, and any such similarity is by no means intentional.

Survival Pen:
Have you ever been stuck on lavaland, trapped by your survival pod with just a few chairs, some titanium walls, and walls of ash closing in on you? Well THANK GOD you have your Rockbreaker brand Survival Pen! Allows for basic mining operations, and is portable like a standard pen!
BUT WAIT!
A watcher blocks your path. Thankfully, your expensive, diamond encrusted pen isn't just good for being the world's slowest pickaxe, it's ALSO coated in the one thing watchers crave: DIAMONDS. Toss the pen to draw the watcher's attention elsewhere.
Why It's Good For The Game

Starts to fill our B.E.P.I.S. Major Reward Techs, as intended, and fills a niche that doesn't get much play nowadays: Building on Lavaland. This was something I've had in the back of my mind since we did the first tests of the Disaster gamemode a few months ago, so each item here was made with the intention of improving the mining base should the station become un-livable. Lava-Proof Rods are beneficial in that you'll be able to cross and build over lava by the mid-end of the shift. RCDs still work as usual, but this way you won't have to worry about getting specialized engineering equipment as a member of cargo or science. The tinker's gloves are basically a variant of the nitrile gloves, but they grant a speed bonus to adding plating to metal girders, so that some kind of functional alternative to giving every engineer insulated gloves.
Survival Pens are quite honestly very niche, but getting dumb pens with extra functionality is a tradition of trade shows all over the world, so it feels right at home as a minor reward.

Also, does a tiny change to the doe sprites, just to look a little bit less old.
Changelog

cl
add: A new Technology has been implemented as a major reward in the B.E.P.I.S., Specialized Engineering, to appeal to engineering utility and new construction horizons.
tweak: Watchers will now actively consume diamond ore left lying around, alongside the new survival pens.
