09:08am - For weeks now PSP officers, former students from Colégio Militar, friend of Ivo Francisco and Gonçalo Bandeira Duarte, along with Miriam, her group of friends associated with the organization of the infamous trance festival BOOM (namely GOODMOOD event organization), and a large number5 of drug addicts recruited for the effect have been forcing me to hear a word repeated over and over all day long in order to force me to talk to myself n fronty of a large audience of people and provide content for the grand human degradation show in front of an audience. That word is "REBENTAR" which is not even a part of my personal lexicon, being forced to the bullshit focused on my hear repeated over and over again mand again to force me to talk to myself in front of a large number of people. The sentences I am forced to complete are stated in poorly spoken portuguese in a tone of self-emasculation and go along the lines "Rebentou com a policia, rebentou com a..."!

Merge #10271: Use std::thread::hardware_concurrency, instead of Boost, to determine available cores

937bf4335 Use std::thread::hardware_concurrency, instead of Boost, to determine available cores (fanquake)

Pull request description:

  Following discussion on IRC about replacing Boost usage for detecting available system cores, I've opened this to collect some benchmarks + further discussion.

  The current method for detecting available cores was introduced in #6361.

  Recap of the IRC chat:
  ```
  21:14:08 fanquake: Since we seem to be giving Boost removal a good shot for 0.15, does anyone have suggestions for replacing GetNumCores?
  21:14:26 fanquake: There is std::thread::hardware_concurrency(), but that seems to count virtual cores, which I don't think we want.
  21:14:51 BlueMatt: fanquake: I doubt we'll do boost removal for 0.15
  21:14:58 BlueMatt: shit like BOOST_FOREACH, sure
  21:15:07 BlueMatt: but all of boost? doubtful, there are still things we need
  21:16:36 fanquake: Yea sorry, not the whole lot, but we can remove a decent chunk. Just looking into what else needs to be done to replace some of the less involved Boost usage.
  21:16:43 BlueMatt: fair
  21:17:14 wumpus: yes, it makes sense to plan ahead a bit, without immediately doing it
  21:18:12 wumpus: right, don't count virtual cores, that used to be the case but it makes no sense for our usage
  21:19:15 wumpus: it'd create a swarm of threads overwhelming any machine with hyperthreading (+accompanying thread stack overhead), for script validation, and there was no gain at all for that
  21:20:03 sipa: BlueMatt: don't worry, there is no hurry
  21:59:10 morcos: wumpus: i don't think that is correct
  21:59:24 morcos: suppose you have 4 cores (8 virtual cores)
  21:59:24 wumpus: fanquake: indeed seems that std has no equivalent to physical_concurrency, on any standard. That's annoying as it is non-trivial to implement
  21:59:35 morcos: i think running par=8 (if it let you) would be notably faster
  21:59:59 morcos: jeremyrubin and i discussed this at length a while back... i think i commented about it on irc at the time
  22:00:21 wumpus: morcos: I think the conclusion at the time was that it made no difference, but sure would make sense to benchmark
  22:00:39 morcos: perhaps historical testing on the virtual vs actual cores was polluted by concurrency issues that have now improved
  22:00:47 wumpus: I think there are not more ALUs, so there is not really a point in having more threads
  22:01:40 wumpus: hyperthreads are basically just a stored register state right?
  22:02:23 sipa: wumpus: yes but it helps the scheduler
  22:02:27 wumpus: in which case the only speedup using "number of cores" threads would give you is, possibly, excluding other software from running on the cores on the same time
  22:02:37 morcos: well this is where i get out of my depth
  22:02:50 sipa: if one of the threads is waiting on a read from ram, the other can use the arithmetic unit for example
  22:02:54 morcos: wumpus: i'm pretty sure though that the speed up is considerably more than what you might expect from that
  22:02:59 wumpus: sipa: ok, I back down, I didn't want to argue this at all
  22:03:35 morcos: the reason i haven't tested it myself, is the machine i usually use has 16 cores... so not easy due to remaining concurrency issues to get much more speedup
  22:03:36 wumpus: I'm fine with restoring it to number of virtual threads if that's faster
  22:03:54 morcos: we should have somene with 4 cores (and ￼ actually test it though, i agree
  22:03:58 sipa: i would expect (but we should benchmark...) that if 8 scriot validation threads instead of 4 on a quadcore hyperthreading is not faster, it's due to lock contention
  22:04:20 morcos: sipa: yeah thats my point, i think lock contention isn't that bad with 8 now
  22:04:22 wumpus: on 64-bit systems the additional thread overhead wouldn't be important at least
  22:04:23 gmaxwell: I previously benchmarked, a long time ago, it was faster.
  22:04:33 gmaxwell: (to use the HT core count)
  22:04:44 wumpus: why was this changed at all then?
  22:04:47 wumpus: I'm confused
  22:05:04 sipa: good question!
  22:05:06 gmaxwell: I had no idea we changed it.
  22:05:25 wumpus: sigh ￼
  22:05:54 gmaxwell: What PR changed it?
  22:06:51 gmaxwell: In any case, on 32-bit it's probably a good tradeoff... the extra ram overhead is worth avoiding.
  22:07:22 wumpus: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6361
  22:07:28 gmaxwell: PR 6461 btw.
  22:07:37 gmaxwell: er lol at least you got it right.
  22:07:45 wumpus: the complaint was that systems became unsuably slow when using that many thread
  22:07:51 wumpus: so at least I got one thing right, woohoo
  22:07:55 sipa: seems i even acked it!
  22:07:57 BlueMatt: wumpus: there are more alus
  22:08:38 BlueMatt: but we need to improve lock contention first
  22:08:40 morcos: anywya, i think in the past the lock contention made 8 threads regardless of cores a bit dicey.. now that is much better (although more still to be done)
  22:09:01 BlueMatt: or we can just merge #10192, thats fee
  22:09:04 gribble: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10192 | Cache full script execution results in addition to signatures by TheBlueMatt · Pull Request #10192 · bitcoin/bitcoin · GitHub
  22:09:11 BlueMatt: s/fee/free/
  22:09:21 morcos: no, we do not need to improve lock contention first.   but we should probably do that before we increase the max beyond 16
  22:09:26 BlueMatt: then we can toss concurrency issues out the window and get more speedup anyway
  22:09:35 gmaxwell: wumpus: yea, well in QT I thought we also diminished the count by 1 or something?  but yes, if the motivation was to reduce how heavily the machine was used, thats fair.
  22:09:56 sipa: the benefit of using HT cores is certainly not a factor 2
  22:09:58 wumpus: gmaxwell: for the default I think this makes a lot of sense, yes
  22:10:10 gmaxwell: morcos: right now on my 24/28 physical core hosts going beyond 16 still reduces performance.
  22:10:11 wumpus: gmaxwell: do we also restrict the maximum par using this? that'd make less sense
  22:10:51 wumpus: if someone *wants* to use the virtual cores they should be able to by setting -par=
  22:10:51 sipa: *flies to US*
  22:10:52 BlueMatt: sipa: sure, but the shared cache helps us get more out of it than some others, as morcos points out
  22:11:30 BlueMatt: (because it means our thread contention issues are less)
  22:12:05 morcos: gmaxwell: yeah i've been bogged down in fee estimation as well (and the rest of life) for a while now.. otherwise i would have put more effort into jeremy's checkqueue
  22:12:36 BlueMatt: morcos: heh, well now you can do other stuff while the rest of us get bogged down in understanding fee estimation enough to review it ￼
  22:12:37 wumpus: [to answer my own question: no, the limit for par is MAX_SCRIPTCHECK_THREADS, or 16]
  22:12:54 morcos: but to me optimizing for more than 16 cores is pretty valuable as miners could use beefy machines and be less concerned by block validation time
  22:14:38 BlueMatt: morcos: i think you may be surprised by the number of mining pools that are on VPSes that do not have 16 cores ￼
  22:15:34 gmaxwell: I assume right now most of the time block validation is bogged in the parts that are not as concurrent. simple because caching makes the concurrent parts so fast. (and soon to hopefully increase with bluematt's patch)
  22:17:55 gmaxwell: improving sha2 speed, or transaction malloc overhead are probably bigger wins now for connection at the tip than parallelism beyond 16 (though I'd like that too).
  22:18:21 BlueMatt: sha2 speed is big
  22:18:27 morcos: yeah lots of things to do actually...
  22:18:57 gmaxwell: BlueMatt: might be a tiny bit less big if we didn't hash the block header 8 times for every block. ￼
  22:21:27 BlueMatt: ehh, probably, but I'm less rushed there
  22:21:43 BlueMatt: my new cache thing is about to add a bunch of hashing
  22:21:50 BlueMatt: 1 sha round per tx
  22:22:25 BlueMatt: and sigcache is obviously a ton
  ```

Fix awful page width on narrow displays; revert scrollable image

Some flex attrs were key to keeping the page width to 100vw.
Removing them enabled scrolling the image, so that's gone again and I'm
sad to see it go, but at least the site looks OK again on half-windows and
mobile devices.

Safari on iOS is pulling some bullshit by positioning the footer
at the bottom when initially drawn and keeping it there when you scroll down,
but fuck Safari on iOS. Firefox Focus on iOS does it properly, interestingly.

Checkpoint. Compiles but doesn't link (predictably).

Current hacks that I'm aware of:
- Need to restore minirunner and/or metrics functionality.
- Need to restore index scanning functionality.
- Might?? need to reapply my VPI changes, don't remember.
- Need to doublecheck the opcode frames (super mystery bugs otherwise).
- Need to implement ExecutableQuery.

"9:40am. Hell of a night x2. The less said about it the better.

Thankfully despite that, I feel rested enough.

9:45am. Let me do my morning reading and then I will resume the CML book.

10:15am. Let me resume the book.

It is time that I start getting it out of the way.

10:30am. 136/325.

> First, there is a real distinction between local and distributed communication

...

> For this reason, distributed programming is qualitatively different from concurrent programming, and requires a different programming model.

Interesting. Well, ZeroMQ which is for distributed programming is definitely different from CML. This is a good chapter.

10:40am. 141/325.

> The need for guards

> Consider a protocol consisting of a sequence of communications: c 1; c2; ··· ; cn. When this protocol is used in a selective communication, one of the ci must be designated as the commit point; i.e., the communication by which this protocol is chosen instead of the others in the select.

...So the `guard` is similar to `memo` in Hopac.

10:45am. But memoization seems overkill for this. Could I use `Alt.prepareFun` for this same purpose?

10:50am. I am getting lost in thought. On the plus side, I have decided how I am going to cache Spiral intermediates. Rather that writing my own pickler combinators, what I am going to do is use FsPickler. To be actually able to do that I am going transform the AST in order to replace the cyclical nodes with tags. That will be a lot easier course of action than doing my own pickling and will allow me to resuse the FsPickler machinery.

10:55am. I will want to do this kind of thing for library packages. Considering they won't be changed during the course of use, and can be prepassed in addition to being typechecked, they are a natural target for this kind of thing.

11am. This won't be hard at all.

Though I'll leave it for later. Since Spiral v0.2 compiler is going to have server semantics rather than be a CLI tool, just holding things in memory for longer will go a great deal to give me the benefits of all of that without the hassle of explicit caching.

11:05am. Now instead of getting lost in thought, let me finally test `prepareFun`.

```fs
Alt.choose [
    Alt.prepareFun (fun () -> Alt.always 1 ^=>. Alt.never ())
    Alt.always 1 >>=*. Alt.never () :> _ Alt
    Alt.always 2
    ]
|> run
|> printfn "%i"

System.Console.ReadKey()
```

Nope. It blocks.

11:15am.

```fs
Alt.choose [
    Alt.withNackFun (fun nack ->
        (nack ^-> fun () -> printfn "Aborted.")
        ^=> fun _ -> Alt.always 1 >>=*. Alt.never ())
    Alt.always 1 >>=*. Alt.never () :> _ Alt
    Alt.always 2
    ]
|> run
|> printfn "%i"

System.Console.ReadKey()
```

I am trying to figure out how nack works in this context.

```fs
Alt.choose [
    Alt.withNackFun (fun nack ->
        (nack ^-> fun () -> printfn "Aborted.")
        ^=>. Alt.always 1 >>=*. Alt.never ())
    Alt.always 1 >>=*. Alt.never () :> _ Alt
    Alt.always 2
    ]
|> run
|> printfn "%i"

System.Console.ReadKey()
```

Ah, when I do this it does get aborted.

```fs
    Alt.withNackFun (fun nack ->
        (nack ^-> fun () -> printfn "Aborted.")
        ^=>. (Alt.always 1 >>=*. Alt.never ()))
```

But not when I do this. Then...

```fs
Alt.choose [
    Alt.withNackFun (fun nack ->
        ((nack ^-> fun () -> printfn "Aborted.") ^=> fun () -> Alt.always 1) >>=*. Alt.never ())
    Alt.always 1 >>=*. Alt.never () :> _ Alt
    Alt.always 2
    ]
|> run
|> printfn "%i"

System.Console.ReadKey()
```

It needs to be like this. I need to pay attention to the precedence. Just commiting to one of the side is not enough to trigger this.

```fs
Alt.choose [
    Alt.withNackFun (fun nack ->
        ((nack ^-> fun () -> printfn "Aborted.") ^=>. Alt.always 1) ^=>. Alt.never ())
    Alt.always 1 >>=*. Alt.never () :> _ Alt
    Alt.always 2
    ]
|> run
|> printfn "%i"

System.Console.ReadKey()
```

This actually does not block, but even so, the nack does not get triggered. Strange.

11:25am. Let me get back to the book. With this I've gotten a bit familiar with negative acknowledgements.

11:30am. 145/325.

> One of the immediate conclusions from these results is that there is a real difference in the expressiveness of synchronous and asynchronous message passing (in the presence of general choice). A language based on asynchronous message passing, even if it supports first-class synchronous operations, cannot support abstract implementations of synchronous message passing.

Yeah, I thought a bit how I would implement synchronous operations using just message passing and came up empty. The breaking point is selective communication.

> For the programmer, this means that situations that require both synchronous message passing and selective communication will have to be programmed on a case-by-case basis.

The author says as much on the next line.

11:45am. 148/325. Done with the rationale chapter. This one is on software build systems. Definitely of interest to me. Let me start it now, and I will finish it after breakfast.

I think at this point in the book, all the essential elements of CML (select,wrap,guard,withNack) have been introduced. So I can afford to skim these parts and come back to them when I need them.

12:15pm. 154/325. My focus is quite low and I am getting lost in daydreams. Let me just go with this. It is obvious that the only thing I am going to get out of these chapters is general architecture. And I am already good at that.

So I should not spend too much time on the rest of this book.

12:25pm. 162/325. I did not study the code so I finished this relatively quickly. It seems the rest of the book will go the same way. At this rate, I should have no problem finishing the whole thing today. This will free tomorrow so I can do the update for the Simulacrum blog ahead of time. I deserve a break every now and then too. Tomorrow should give me time to mentally prepare to start work on editor support."

new project where a person can add new topics/titles/person,
also upload images as we become more usable.

also creating a timeline of hobbies and taste also see what others into based on categories, also subscribe to people based on categories. so you get the best content.

as per his added topic we search and recommend exact previously added titles or user get to add new titles,

not exaclty a social media in prototype just for personal use so user can get analysis based on his day to day topics what genres you watch or reflect what music what culture city food also we will be able to import user's rating from imdb,
user can also delete multiple rating at once from chillseverus account.

back your account to gdrive or manually export and save the copy to your fav. drive service.

create acc. from Google or fb or manually type email or phone no. and password

add "about me" information

also thinking of showing your recently added title, that you may wanna review.

"1:05pm. Let me resume. Somehow there isn't anything interesting out today, so let me just deal with the book.

1:25pm. 173/325. I don't like this nor the previous chapter very much. They are too brief of a treatment of what are complex subjects.

1:45pm. 189/325. I am just skimming this. No way can I translate these examples.

2:05pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf4VbP5q3P0
Michael Sperber - Concurrent ML - The One That Got Away - Code Mesh 2017

Maybe I will watch this talk after I am done with the book. I should not take too long.

I am done with the window system chapter.

Just two more left. I'll go through them quickly. I expect them to be technical, so I won't spend too much time on them.

2:35pm. 214/325. I am not following this at all. Let me get through it. I'll finish the book on the next hour and move on to the talk.

This chapter feels a bit like ZeroMQ. Since it deals with distributed programming, that guess might very well be accurate.

2:55pm. Focus. Let me just rush through this. Right now I am reading the /a/ archive instead of the book. If I am going to take a break, I should actually take it instead of cheating myself like this.

3:05pm. > There are many books about low-level network programming in general, and specifically programming with sockets.

Hmmm, really? I guess it makes sense, but I must have missed them.

238/325. Here is the last chapter. This one is how the CML primitives are actually implemented. Let me take a short break and then I'll go for it.

3:20pm. Let me resume. I'll try paying a bit attention to this chapter. Although I looked at Hopac's code, I did not get the essence of it as it was so convoluted. Hopefully this should go more smoothly.

3:25pm. 239/325. This chapter is a good intro to first class continuations.

3:30pm. 241/325. This code does remind me of what I saw in the Hopac library.

3:55pm. 251/325. Compared to the Hopac source this code is quite clear, but I do not have the steam to really dive into it anymore. Maybe at some point it would be worth it to try to reimplement it on the small on my own.

4:05pm. 258/325. So it does need a hacky mechanism for explicit unlogging in selective communication.

4:15pm. 266/325. And I am done! The rest is the appendix.

Also this talk is especially about Hopac. Let me post the CML talk on the PL sub.

Here he notes that workspace GC blocks all threads. So that is why I get that warning.

Actually, I had no idea that you can bind Async expressions in hopac workflows.

...It is almost 6pm and I feel like continuing.

https://youtu.be/mEB55MiiLdI?t=752

So `Alt.prepareJob` is like a `guard`. Actually I am still not sure what exactly does it do. This video is a good tutorial as it covers things not in the guide.

6:55pm. Done with lunch.

7:20pm. 3/12. These are primitives. Change of plans. I'll extend my studies into tomorrow. I am done with CML, but I want to study Reagents. Interesting that swap is the primitive rather than reads or writes. With swap you can indeed read or write. You can read by swapping an unit value, and you can write by swapping an actual value.

7:55pm. I am done with the Reagent paper, but it is honestly too sparse for me to make anything of it. Let me read the Ocaml slides by KC.

8:05pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRWTws_YPBA&feature=youtu.be
LDN Functionals #8 KC Sivaramakrishnan: OCaml multicore and programming with Reagents

I'll leave this talk for tomorrow. Though Reagents seem interesting, I can't just start chasing some new thing just because I saw it shine for a bit.

8:10pm. Done taking a look at the blog posts by KC. I am finally done for the day with this.

Reagents were an unexpected distraction, if it weren't for them I'd have finished an hour ago. I somehow ended up putting quite a bit of overtime in today.

Tomorrow I will watch those two talks and get on with the review. I will finally start the next phase after that. It will be time to do editor support for real. All the pieces are finally in place."

Introduction

About six months ago I've decided to create an open source, light module to use in Python. This is, how it ended. I wanted to share my work - NativePython.

Topics

List of topics touched by me here (on the bottom):

Policy of mine

Downloading the module

Helping me in NativePython improvements

A guide to using module

How to create JSON sprites and menu styles

Summary

Policy of mine

Since it is on open source, you can edit it and share your own modified version of NativePython with Reddit users. But I wanted to strict out one thing - sharing.

Now, you might be a bit confused, because I have told you, that i share my work on open source license, which means exactly, that you can modify my project and publish your own, modified version. But I wanted to make sure, you do respect my work, so, I just wanted to expect from you one thing, if you publish your work - include me as a part of credits.

Downloading the module

After you, hopefully, understand my policy, we can move on this thing and finally - download NativePython. So, there it is - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pgw-ZXIvSNWlUUE2h6V-urtzWOW3QMi7/view?usp=sharing

Helping me in NativePython improvements

Also, as a part of NativePython community, you can give me your own suggestions to improve official version of NativePython.

A guide to using module

Okay, that was the hardest part for me, because I had to make a complete list of things to cover in there, anyways, let's go.

Before the guide

Since NativePython uses different modules around, to actually make itself functional, I just wanted to say, that some of these modules are not automatically available for Python - you have to install them manually.

How to do this? Well, what you wanna do, is go to your CMD and execute following commands, to install all necessary modules:

pip install pywin32

pip install keyboard

pip install python-varname

pip install requests

Notice one more thing - I've built NativePython on Python 3.8, so if you're using older versions of Python, these modules might not be available/work correctly for you.

The right guide

JSON Files

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are type of documents, that are storing JSON objects, which are same as Python dicts.

To use functions for JSON files, you want to also use jsonFile class.

Functions of following class:

] imp(path) - reads JSON file from given path and returing it's object (Python's dict).

] exp(path, array) - takes given path and dict (array) and saves it into JSON file.

Console cursor (moovement)

Console cursor is a blinking rectangle, which is indicating where next character will be placed.

Class: cur

Functions:

] setCoords(X, Y) - sets x and y position of the console cursor.

Window stuff

Well, what can I say, I have added some functions, that modifies window.

Class name: thisWindow

Functions of this class:

] resize(W, H) - resizes your window.

] compactSize() - sets your window's size to compact, making it scorllable.

] close() - closes your window/exists from your Python app.

] cls() - clears your whole window (text).

] title(title) - sets your window's title to given one.

] pause() - pauses the Python script.

] sleep(delay) - your Python app is sleeping for given amount of time in ms.

Colors

There is nothing much to say about colors - I will just place here list of all colors (as variables):

Black

Gray

Red

Green

Yellow

Blue

Magenta

Cyan

White

Underline

Reverse

Def

Mouse (position)

Functions from this class (mouse) are setting/getting the current position of mouse cursor.

All functions:

] getCoords() - returns x and y position of mouse cursor, notice, that it is retriving mouse postition relative to Python's app window, which means, that it is not always accurate.

] setCoords(X, Y) - sets the x and y position of mouse cursor.

Keys

Since I've got many, many more things to cover in this post, let me just to put classes' names and their functions - of course, I will put functions descriptions but - not classes descriptions.

key (class)

] listenFor(name) - listens for a selected key press, remember, to put this function into if statement.

] press(name) - (not physically) presses selected key.

] hold(name) - holds selected key.

] release(name) - releases (always, not only if key is held) selected key.

Timers

createTimer(self, delay) (class)

] attach(self, name) - attaches a function to given timer.

] detach(self, name) - detaches a function (only if it's is attached)

] attached(self, name) - checks, if function is already attached to given timer.

] refresh(self, args = []) - (put into while loop) refreshes timer, runs all attached functions, with given arguments (args).

Text

caption (class)

] create(self, text, X, Y) - creates a text at given pos (x, y).

] get(self, text, X, Y) - creates an input on x and y coords.

] delete(self, X, Y) - deletes a caption at selected x, y.

] cls(self) - deletes all the captions created with caption class.

Menus

ui (class)

] ui.button

] ui.listsel

] ui.check

] createMenu(self, filename, title, dsc) (class) - creates a menu from a filename, which is JSON file style path.

]] refresh(self) - refreshes menu (put within while loop).

] createButton(menu, caption, handler, args) - creates a button with given caption, sets it's handler, also, arguments.

] createCheck(menu, caption, handler, boolean) - makes a list checkbox, with caption, handler and default boolean.

] createListSel(menu, caption, handler, llist, index) - this function is creating a list selector, with set caption, handler, base list and default index.

JSON models (sprites)

jsonModel(self, path) (class) - generates a model with given JSON file (path).

] show(self) - shows generated sprite.

Current user

thisUser (class)

] name() - returns name of current user.

A file exporer

fileExplorer (class)

] title = "File explorer"

] select = "Type file/folder index to select: "

] path = "Type " + Green + "$ " + Def + "to select current path"

] default = "Type " + Green + "% " + Def + "to go back to default dir"

] explore(path) - explores given directory.

(Custom) files

customFile (class)

] encode(path) - reads and ecodes file from given path; returns two values - name of the file, that has been selected and it's encoded value.

] decode(path) - decodes file from given path; useful when getting files from URL and exactly decoding encoded files.

] getFromURL(url) - requesting reading files from given url; also, returns two values - name of the requested file and automatically encoded value of it.

How to create JSON sprites and menu styles

Well, this one might be a bit tricky, because from my last updates, a structure of such a JSON file has been changed. So, let's go right into it!

Menu style JSON file

Structure of this JSON file looks like this:

{

"document\_type": "NPYUI-Style",

"document\_body": {

	"style\_body": {

		"theme": {
"accent_color": "Green",

"bordering_style": "White",

"normal_style": "Gray"

		},


		"margins": {
"xpos": 2,

"ypos": 2

		}

	}

}
}

And structure of a JSON sprite is looking like this:

{

"manifest": "sprite",

"model": {

	"namespace": "fx/subaru/",

	"margins": \[

		5,

		10

	\],

	"layers": \[

		{
"type": "file",

"source": "mdl1.txt",

"color": "Cyan",

		},

		{
"type": "file",

"source": "mdl2.txt",

"color": "Gray",

		}

	\]

}
}

Now, this structure might be a bit tricky, actually I mean, type. There are two types - "file" and "text".

Summary

Thank you for reading this whole document, I hope. I also hope, that you will enjoy using NativePython. I'm really happy, to finally share my work after 6 months of making it. Well, welcome to the community of NativePython!
