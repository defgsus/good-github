refactor: update dependencies + self host repository. (#132)

* refactor

This PR is a refactor of the codebase, but without changing (much) functionality. It may seem like a lot, but that's exaggerated by the fact that a lot of it is just moved round. Here are the details - 

- This updates `react-scripts`/`@craco/craco` to support `create-react-app@4.0.0`. As part of that, I've also disabled the in-browser linting experience (https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco/issues/205). *This is temporary*. I'll enable it when it's fixed on craco's side, but that shouldn't block this PR. This should fix https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/issues/125. 
- The refactor is mainly around making this repository self-hosted (https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/issues/120). The steps taken to achieve that were: 
  - e2e-tests were split up and inlined into `modular-scripts` / `create-modular-react-app`, as applicable. This also enabled removing verdaccio and associated complexity.
  - `cra-template-modular-typescript` was inlined into `modular-scripts`; this has the benfit of preventing one waterfall step when adding a new app to a project. 
  - We had a bug where we needed at least one app named `app` for all tests to run, I fixed that. We still need at least one app, but it can be named whatever. (I've named it `modular-site`, and we can use it for experiments, and maybe hosting documentation). In the future we dhsould fix it so it doesn't need any at all, but that's an edge case. 
- I've removed `modular-scripts/src/getModularViewMap`, and will instead implement `modular-views.macro` (https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/issues/59). I'm working on it right now, but it shouldn't block this PR. 

### caveats 

- I need to implement and write tests for the views macro, as mentioned above. 
- While this runs all tests on CI, it skips one test, the one that starts up a server and tests whether the app works as expected. This is because it still leaves hanging processes, and will eat up our github-actions minutes. Working on fixing it, it's a weird one. (probably related to https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/issues/54)
- I haven't verified builds yet, will do so. (EDIT: done, looks fine)
- I need to simplify the root configurations for babel/eslint so that it uses the `modular` configs. It's not critical to this PR so I figured it could wait. 
- all tests take about 550s on my 2015 macbook pro. That kinda sucks. A lot of the time is literally just fetching dependencies and installing. We should setup caches for our build, and further use cached versions of dependencies when installing. This is less of a problem now that the repo is public, but still. (EDIT: now under 4 minutes, not bad.)

Merge #739

739: Remove Peek-Poke r=cwfitzgerald a=kvark

**Connections**
Related to https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/738
Related to https://github.com/djg/peek-poke/issues/10

**Description**
As of #726 , the buffers have a minimum binding size that has to include the shader struct size. It, therefore, can't be zero.
We can remove the hacks we had previously and switch fully to the idiomatic `Option<NonZeroU64>`.

Peek-poke doesn't `NonZeroU64` and friends, so this made me reconsider the user of it entirely. Today, render bundles as well as the Player already represent command streams using a much rustier method. I tried to move everything to this method now, and I think this is going to work much better, and safer.

**Testing**
wgpu-rs works - https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/pull/396

Rollup merge of #78950 - khyperia:spirv-asm, r=Amanieu

Add asm register information for SPIR-V

As discussed in [zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp/topic/Defining.20asm!.20for.20new.20architecture), we at [rust-gpu](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu) would like to support `asm!` for our SPIR-V backend. However, we cannot do so purely without frontend support: [this match](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d4ea0b3e46a0303d5802b632e88ba1ba84d9d16f/compiler/rustc_target/src/asm/mod.rs#L185) fails and so `asm!` is not supported ([error reported here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d4ea0b3e46a0303d5802b632e88ba1ba84d9d16f/compiler/rustc_ast_lowering/src/expr.rs#L1095)). To resolve this, we need to stub out register information for SPIR-V to support getting the `asm!` content all the way to [`AsmBuilderMethods::codegen_inline_asm`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/traits/trait.AsmBuilderMethods.html#tymethod.codegen_inline_asm), at which point the rust-gpu backend can do all the parsing and codegen that is needed.

This is a pretty weird PR - adding support for a backend that isn't in-tree feels pretty gross to me, but I don't see an easy way around this. ``@Amanieu`` said I should submit it anyway, so, here we are! Let me know if this needs to go through a more formal process (MCP?) and what I should do to help this along.

I based this off the [wasm asm PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78684), which unfortunately this PR conflicts with that one quite a bit, sorry for any merge conflict pain :(

Some open questions:

- What do we call the register class? Some context, SPIR-V is an SSA-based IR, there are "instructions" that create IDs (referred to as `<id>` in the spec), which can be referenced by other instructions. So, `reg` isn't exactly accurate, they're SSA IDs, not re-assignable registers.
- What happens when a SPIR-V register gets to the LLVM backend? Right now it's a `bug!`, but should that be a `sess.fatal()`? I'm not sure if it's even possible to reach that point, maybe there's a check that prevents the `spirv` target from even reaching that codepath.
