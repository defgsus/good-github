Increase max ID length
Look, I like having nice, long, descriptive FIDs in my PLINK
files. Is that so wrong? Why should I have my aspirations
throttled to a meagre 39 characters? Why can't you let me
dream, Nick and Alkes? Do you enjoy seeing me suffer? Does
a twisted smirk creep over your face when you think of me
sat in front of my terminal, sobbing, as I take my beautiful
FID children, admiring their <COUNTRY>_<REGION1>_<REGION2>
frame one last time, behind the shed, turn my head, and pull
the shotgun's trigger?

I hope this doesn't break anything.

Remove support for redundant %_filter_GLIBC_PRIVATE mechanism

This was kinda ugly-but-necessary when added back in 2003 (commit
752cac72e220dcad4e6fce39508e714e59e3e0a1) but entirely redundant
since the "new" dependency generator in rpm >= 4.9.x with arbitrary
filtering support. The handful of packages using it can just as well
achieve the same (and more) without special hacks in rpm with:

	%global __requires_exclude GLIBC_PRIVATE
	%global __provides_exclude GLIBC_PRIVATE

Set scrollview on the power menu

So why? Because fuck you that's why...

No, you need this for if and when we decide to add more items to the power menu and the
density is too high. Previously if you had more than 5 items, it would cut you off. So
you either had to decide which 5 items you wanted or deal with the jank. That's no longer
the case.

- Added a landscape view so we can set a horizontal scrollview

- Made the power menu dialog all one color. Josh and I talked about this and I previously
made the case to keep it the same but after thinking it over, it looks better all one color.

Update modify_parameters to handle post-deprected APIs

I also removed the support for updating overrides. I realized, after I'd
started to implement it, that we can't capture enough information in the
text file to be able to update overrides. I have an idea for an
alternative, but would love to hear any thoughts you might have.

Fix CPU usage on OpenBSD

The current OpenBSD-specific CPU usage code is broken. The `cpu`
parameter of `Platform_setCPUValues` is an integer in the interval
[0, cpuCount], not [0, cpuCount-1]: Actual CPUs are numbered from
1, the “zero” CPU is a “virtual” one which represents the average
of actual CPUs (I guess it’s inherited from Linux’s `/proc/stats`).
This off-by-one error leads to random crashes.

Moreover, the displayed CPU usage is more detailed with system,
user and nice times.

I made the OpenBSD CPU code more similar to the Linux CPU code,
removing a few old bits from OpenBSD’s top(1). I think it will be
easier to understand, maintain and evolve.

I’d love some feedback from experienced OpenBSD people.
