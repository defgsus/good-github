Split Invent into three tags

All this started when someone on Discord noticed that Import Inventory
does not actually import changes, only additions and removals. However,
its documentation clearly stated that it would patch 'additions, changes
and removals'. So I took the opportunity to add that to PBash - but to
preserve backwards compatibility, I obviously couldn't change the
behavior of Invent.

So I decided to split the tag into three tags (Invent.Add, Invent.Change
and Invent.Remove) and introduce an alias that interprets the old Invent
tag as Invent.Add + Invent.Remove whenever it finds it in descriptions,
LOOT tags and BashTags files. I also updated CBash to use the new tags,
but didn't bother to try and make it understand Invent.Change. So CBash
behaves exactly like before. One ugly wart here is the local imports in
mods_metadata.py, but that file might as well be _mods_metadata.py for
all the rethinking it deserves :P

This introduces a framework to allow us to easily support indefinite
backwards-compatibility aliases for Bash Tags, so I went ahead and
refactored the old InventOnly and C.GridFlags tag to use this system.
Also documented all removed and deprecated tags in the Advanced Readme.

Note the addition of MelObject.__hash__, noticed way too late that my
set lookups wouldn't work. It's a bit hacky, but at least now any other
set usages of MelObject that might be hiding in the patchers won't break
anymore. Also dropped the weird 'removable' logic in there, was broken
at first but after fixing it it became a noop.

Chef 16 fixes

The require line here was never necessary.  Someone who knew java
at some point probably though you needed it, but due to duck typing
it doesn't matter.  All that matters is the symbols that are referenced.
Someone more familiar with Java probably wrote the deploy resource back
in 2009 or so.

The only symbol that was referenced was Chef::Provider::Git.
Theoretically it should require that, but it can rely on chef-client to
have required that via the `resources.rb` file.

The other fix is that the magical DSL wiring via the class name for
library based resources+providers has been removed in Chef-16, so had to
add that.

What is curious there is that the timestamped provider is declaring a
`provides :deploy` while the actual Chef::Provider::Deploy class is
getting the magical wiring to `provides :deploy` on the DSL.  I think
that this preserves backwards compatibility but I wouldn't bet my life
on it.  The alphanumeric sort order of the library loading code should
mean that the provider_deploy.rb file is loaded first, and that class is
wired up to the `deploy` DSL magically, then the provider_timestamped.rb
is loaded and that class is wired up to the `deploy` DSL explicitly, and
that seems to be the clear intent of the author.  In Chef-16 that
magical wiring is gone, but the behavior should be backcompatible due to
the sort order of the library resource loading.

And that paragraph largely explains why both of these changes need to be
made.  If you don't understand, offhand, what is going on there without
needing to be reminded of it and/or are still confused about that
paragraph, the point is to remove all the complexity.  Going forwards in
Chef-16 there is no magical class-name based load ordering to worry
about.  It becomes a thing nobody needs to care about.  Similarly
abstract base classes like Chef::Provider::Deploy here or the
Chef::Resource::Scm provider in core chef need to be removed and
replaced with partials, both to convert resources to custom resources
and to be clear that there is not a class there which can be
instantiated usefully.  This is also part of the march towards custom
resources everywhere and eliminating library resources+provides like
this one (which is why this one broke in Chef-16).

And the biggest reason why is that I'm the only person on the planet
that understands this stuff offhand and I don't scale and I can't be
called in as an airstrike on every situation that arises.  These changes
are necessary to remove all the sharp edges from using chef-client.

Added some more shit

Damage knockback doesn't work the way I want yet. It's honestly pretty fuckin wonky. I want it to kind of repel you back and kill your momentum. On the plus side if you turn off the damage on the lava traps they become trampolines. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
