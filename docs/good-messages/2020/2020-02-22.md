rust-summercash: I have no idea why I decided that I would be more productive working on a shitty butterfly switch 2017 macbook pro keyboard, so I'm going back to my desktop. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Knowing the failure I am, it'll probably only be TEDx anyway. Fucking disgrace.

Auto merge of #67330 - golddranks:split_inclusive, r=kodraus

Implement split_inclusive for slice and str

# Overview
* Implement `split_inclusive` for `slice` and `str` and `split_inclusive_mut` for `slice`
* `split_inclusive` is a substring/subslice splitting iterator that includes the matched part in the iterated substrings as a terminator.
* EDIT: The behaviour has now changed, as per @KodrAus 's input, to the same semantics with the `split_terminator` function. I updated the examples below.
* Two examples below:
```Rust
    let data = "\nMÃ¤ry hÃ¤d Ã¤ little lÃ¤mb\nLittle lÃ¤mb\n";
    let split: Vec<&str> = data.split_inclusive('\n').collect();
    assert_eq!(split, ["\n", "MÃ¤ry hÃ¤d Ã¤ little lÃ¤mb\n", "Little lÃ¤mb\n"]);
```

```Rust
    let uppercase_separated = "SheePSharKTurtlECaT";
    let mut first_char = true;
    let split: Vec<&str> = uppercase_separated.split_inclusive(|c: char| {
        let split = !first_char && c.is_uppercase();
        first_char = split;
        split
    }).collect();
    assert_eq!(split, ["SheeP", "SharK", "TurtlE", "CaT"]);
```

# Justification for the API
* I was surprised to find that stdlib currently only has splitting iterators that leave out the matched part. In my experience, wanting to leave a substring terminator as a part of the substring is a pretty common usecase.
* This API is strictly more expressive than the standard `split` API: it's easy to get the behaviour of `split` by mapping a subslicing operation that drops the terminator. On the other hand it's impossible to derive this behaviour from `split` without using hacky and brittle `unsafe` code. The normal way to achieve this functionality would be implementing the iterator yourself.
* Especially when dealing with mutable slices, the only way currently is to use `split_at_mut`. This API provides an ergonomic alternative that plays to the strengths of the iterating capabilities of Rust. (Using `split_at_mut` iteratively used to be a real pain before NLL, fortunately the situation is a bit better now.)

# Discussion items
* <s>Does it make sense to mimic `split_terminator` in that the final empty slice would be left off in case of the string/slice ending with a terminator? It might do, as this use case is naturally geared towards considering the matching part as a terminator instead of a separator.</s>
  * EDIT: The behaviour was changed to mimic `split_terminator`.
* Does it make sense to have `split_inclusive_mut` for `&mut str`?

Fix deep ocean structure layers

So WorldPainter is cool and doesn't let you set origin points for multiple objects even if they have the same dimensions. Smart, I know.

So, in order to avoid clicking at least 10,000 times over the course of 2+ hours, I spent at least 10 hours and clicked 100,000 times making this stupid little script. My god this literally has taken me 4 days just to add shipwrecks and ruins to the ocean.

Please, someone... anyone... save me from myself.

Update README.md

Hi, I love your program and how it reimagines the whole dynamic of creating diagrams and graphs, I also like the wit of the documentation, but I had some small trouble in initially figuring out what the application was about. 

I propose a few line changes to clarify the purpose of the application and an additional a link to the syntax section of docs to  hopefully decrease the friction and increase the interest in using the product.  
I changed:
-"__mermaid is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool. It generates diagrams flowcharts and more, using markdown-inspired text for ease and speed.__"
and I added:
-"__The following are some examples of the diagrams, charts and graphs that can be made using mermaid and the Markdown-inspired text specific to it. Click here jump into the [text syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/n00b-syntaxReference).__"


More power to you and your team.
-Neil

Improve lovr.filesystem.load errors;

Lua was happily compiling nil chunks and making them return empty
strings, which was not a good error experience in situations where
your file couldn't be loaded properly.  Now we return nil plus an
error message, which matches LOVE and other Lua conventions.

Cobbduceus: (Baby) C2 Additions (Rhig,Troph) and Changes (Helbital) (#49356)

It's the year of the rat sisters, and now it's time to cut out those pesky C3s in your life!

Why It's Good For The Game

Rhig and Troph are no brainers considering they're on the same level of ease2make as the C2s and have no downside. They will still be good but they have some C2 component now. Kinda minor compared to the others but I'll see how it plays out.
Changelog

ðŸ†‘
balance: Helbital now is more simple to use and is based off not crit/softcrit/hardcrit. You want to be in hardcrit for the best brute healing.
tweak: Troph has now been converted into a C2 with tweaks, now named Probital. Same recipe. Downside is stamina damage
tweak: Rhig has now been converted into a C2 with tweaks, now named Hercuri. Same Recipe. Downside is it can cool to dangerous levels.

Camera Fix, 1/2 Ping System, OldMouseClick Added

Sorry Cody I reworked your camera a bit. The angle is fixed, the camera follows the ghost. As it stands now the player can move the npc through the house by using right click pings. However the ray tracing for pings isn't in yet, so the NPC follows all pings. As it stands the player can easily move the NPC through the house. There is a ping bug where they player is able to do multiple pings at once, not sure if we want to keep that. The npc does move to the latest ping. I created a script called "OldClickMove" because Scripts fix for floating through walls wasn't really a fix. Yeah it can float through walls but I see no method of speeding up that movement. Honestly I don't feel like it matters much at all, if the Ghost follows the path its no skin off my back, just a time saver. The Old Click controls are currently on the player.

Partially working date generator

Not working for the SCI cert yet, but I just need to get a new PDF since this one is all fucky.

I started trying to make the disclaimer closer to the bottom of the screen to not have everything all ugly and bunched up but it isn't working yet. Committing what I have because it's easier than committing only some of the lines, honestly.

""9:20am. I am up. Let me chill for a while and then I will start.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/f7cp5k/conor_mcbride_type_inference_needs_revolution/

Maybe I'll try watching this as well.

9:30am. https://mangadex.org/title/26399/tobaku-datenroku-kaiji-24-oku-dasshutsu-hen

Oh, lol. The stuff in the latest chapters is way beyond what I expected. God tier writing as usual. Every arc in Kaiji is the best arc.

10:45am. Ah, I started arguing on /sci/ and wasted my time. Yes, non-constructive math put deep scars on my soul and now I cannot help myself but to get in random math foundation fights. I'll try to do better next time.

But I might as well take a real break here since it has come to that.

12:20pm. 10m more and then I'll do the chores. Then I'll resume.

Actually, let me give the talk by Conor a try. I'll leave the Toji game for later.

1:10pm. Done with chores. Let me finally start this shit. I do not really like the talk, between the poor audio quality and the awkward delivery, I have better things to do. Maybe I'll watch it at some later point if I feel like it.

Now...I have a couple of good hours ahead of me. Let me focus on the book. Here things finally start getting real.

1:20pm. 106/558. The first order of business is to open a project. I want to give making those work items a try.

1:25pm. I am confused. I opened a new project, but for some reason the Team Explorer is connected to the old one. What the hell?

1:35pm. Well, nevermind that. I'll just use the existing bare bones project since that is what book is doing. I've figured out how to use the backlog as well.

1:45pm. I am really getting distracted by my own thoughs. Let me go to the next step.

2:20pm. 115/558. I am making slow progress, but my focus is starting to deepen. Yesterday was a snoozefest, and now I am finally starting to get into the mood again. There are a bunch of differences between the newest VS version that I have and the screenshots in the book, but it is quite similar apart from that.

2:30pm. "This meant that every application was tied to be hosted as a web application. ASP.NET Core 2.1 introduced the generic host, which allows for applications that do not necessarily have to process web-based HTTP requests"

This is something I will definitely have to study, and no doubt the book will cover it.

3:10pm. 119/558. I am making very slow progress through this book. But I do not find it tedious in the usual sense. Rather as I read this, I am thinking about Spiral, and how I would do this in that language.

```
inl (A:B:C:) = A + B + C
```

I think it really might be a good idea to allow this kind of syntax. It might improve the readability of the language.

I was looking forward to it back in v0.1 with objects, but it might be possible to use it with modules as well.

3:15pm. ASP.NET is all about DSL building from small pieces. I am thinking to the situation where I have large libraries whose functions have many arguments. I want to grab some benefits from Smalltalk.

Just like with union types, I can go further here. Without a doubt, I am going to make v0.2 the best version of Spiral yet.

3:35pm. 121/558. Do I have to necessarily use the MVC layout page, or will the Razor one do?

Also the screenshot shows the `wwwroot` folder, but I haven't received any instructions to actually create it. I guess I'll leave it for later.

3:45pm. 124/558. I am just following instructions without really understanding what they do, so this chapter is not too motivated, but I'll practice this craft. The closest I've come to think kind of programming are GUIs back in 2016.

3:50pm. There is no going through this quickly. I am in a pleasant mindset, so I'll go through this slow as I am now. My focus is not too high, and I am getting lost in daydreams, but I am not particularly bored.

4pm. 126/558. Let me take a break here. I think I will put in some overtime today since things are going to slowly, but aren't too tedious.""

#### Saturday 2020-02-22 17:55:11 by Marko GrdiniÄ‡

"4:20pm. Let me resume.

4:25pm. 128/558. I put in npm file and the required packages. But I need to figure out what is going on with that `wwwroot` folder. Have I missed the instruction to create it somewhere?

4:30pm. Nope, there really is nothing about `wwwroot`. Let me create it then.

4:55pm. 130/558. So far I've been adding things by hand, but this is a bit over the line to input this way.

```
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn
 .com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
 asp-fallback-href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css
 /bootstrap.min.css"
 asp-fallback-test-class="sr-only" asp-fallback-test-

 /j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T"/></environment>
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />

```

I think I'll just paste this.

5:15pm. This is not working for me. I like short instructions that are explained, but now I am just getting long dumps that are scarcely touched upon.

Right now I have an issue, I added the NPM packages before I created the `wwwroot/lib` folder and as a result they go put somewhere else. What do I do?

Well, what I will do is study the sample code.

5:20pm. After I am done with this chapter, I will try recreating what I've learned in F#.

The truth, I really do appreciate this sample application. As I was saying, I do not want to challenge the gambling dens right away, so I am open to training agents and renting them for a price. Everything here is a vital skill towards enabling that kind of business.

5:25pm. 135/558. Just how long till the end of this chapter. I want to skim this and then I'll take a look at the code samples.

On one hand, this project is simple. It is not like proving theorems in Coq. On the other hand, there are shitload of details to go through. It will take me a while to convert what I am doing now into actual skill.

5:55pm. 145/558. I am not really studying this intently anymore, I am just trying to get a lay of the land so to speak.

I admit, I didn't think this chapter would be so difficult considering the task is to make a Tic Tac Toe app. There is really a lot of stuff in it, and I may have to study for a few days before I move on. The reason for this is that a lot of the complexity seems to be front loaded.

Yesterday I was not sure whether I was making the right choice to switch from studying TS since the book said it required only a minimal familiarity with ASP.NET, but I definitely made the right choice. This basic familiarity is not as easy as it seems, and I definitely do need to take the effort to do this. Had I continued with TS, I'd definitely have run into difficulties so I am glad that I am finally doing things in proper order.

I am sure that after I really get this chapter down the following ones will be easier.

6:05pm. I've gotten lost in thought. Let me skim the last ten pages and I will call it a day. I'll leave the code examples and rebuilding it in F# tomorrow.

6:30pm. Sheesh. Finally done. I am tired at this point.

Maybe more than a few days, it will take me quite a bit of study until I understand enough to recreate the Tic Tac Toe without the help from the book."

Version .10.00 February/16/2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Save Files for the script are now all located in "save" folder
    If you want to migrate an old versions settings, you will need to move them
    This allows for users to easily understand which files are their settings
    I also cleared the main script folder of extrenuous files, just the main script
        Files required for the script are now located in data folder

Files you will need to move into the save folder:
    Settings.ini                  -->           /save/Settings.ini
    Profiles.ini                  -->           /save/Profiles.ini
    /data/Globe.json              -->           /save/Globe.json

    Choose between Off, Days, Hours, or Minutes
        Choosing Off will disable automatically checking for updates
    Set the interval that you would like it to wait before checking
        Setting the interval to 0 will turn off checking for updates

Adjust Globes GUI now displays Current Life, ES, and Mana %
    MsgBox popups have been replaced with Notify panels
        The information is still copied to the clipboard for use
    There is now a colorpicker on the right
    Click any of the different areas "Colorbox" to load that color to the picker
    Use the Copy button get the current color, then paste into one of the color edit fields
    To get an average of colors, use the Coord button and select an area
        While active it will update the color picker to the mouse cursor
        This will take some time for large areas
        Once you are done paste into one of the color edit fields
    Reset button now reloads the values that were last loaded
        If you have saved settings, it will reset to the last loaded values
        If you have not saved to JSON it will load default scaled values

Game window is now bound when detected for further captures
    Logout and logic actions will happen while the game is in the background

A method of Pausing PoE-TradeMacro from parsing clipboard has been implimented
    Right click TradeMacro tray icon, > Edit Files > Custom Macros Example
    Copy the changes from the included txt file into your open editor, then save
    Essentially it adds a way for Wingman to send a message for it to pause

The script can now use predictive pricing from the PoEPrices.info API
    To enable this feature, select a pricepoint then the percentage of that price
    It defaults to 100 percent (the estimated values themselves)
    To enable using Predictive price while stashing, select the tab and tick the box
    The Item Info hotkey will now display the price and affixes influencing price
        they will appear inside the Prop list under PredictPrice and PredictPriceInfo
    It will save a copy of the results to an array
        Multiple queries to the same item will used Cached result
        Array is started fresh every script start

Loot vacuum has been improved with new openables list
    This is enabled only while in delve, and contains the items you find in the darkness
    If you are resampling these for another resolution:
        Copy the entire string to a document
        Follow the same naming pattern when making your sample, replace 1080 with your height
        If you want to have it become default option, submit your string and I can add to list

Utilities have been improved - new settings
    Can now support inversed Buff detection, will fire when buff is Found
    Can now use Mana as a triggered threshold
    Can now trigger utilities when pressing Primary or Secondary attack

Gamestates has been improved to allow for the game to be in the background
    tooltip no longer flickers because it will only update when there are changes
    OHB detection is now shown in the gamestates
    Colors of the display have been changed
        When everything shows green its all clear
        when anything is lit up red it will pause the script

Crafting tab has new option for filtering by item level
    Check the box to filter by ilvl, then set the minimum ilvl to stash

Globe scan areas are now scaled based on resolution
    it is still recommended to adjust these to ensure they work as expected

Bugfix for bulk vendor of flasks
    If the flask has been augmented it will use its actual quality value
    This is because quality 20 flasks only vendor on their own if not augmented
    This function still needs some more attention, not sure why random miscounts

Built new classes for use with the script
    PixelStatus is a simple class for managing pixel locations on the screen
    PanelManager is a wrapper class for groups of PixelStatus
        This class is a rewrite of the GuiStatus function
    ColorPicker is a class for inserting a new Color Picker GUI into windows
        This manages a group of Progress_Slider and associated text fields / buttons

Did a lot of cleaning up, I'm so tired of Qt and QML, an old issue that took me nearly an hour to fix has been re-introduced. Have to figure that out again. There's also naother stupid qml bug that I refuse to fix, the ListView and MVC is the most fragile thing I've ever encountered in my life. It's an annoying and more rare bug, I'ml eaving it, most may nto even notice it and it's only a bit annoying.
