wezterm: improve shaping of emoji

This is one of those massive time sinks that I almost regret...
As part of recent changes to dust-off the allsorts shaper, I noticed
that the harfbuzz shaper wasn't shaping as well as the allsorts one.

This commit:

* Adds emoji-test.txt, a text file you can `cat` to see how well
  the emoji are shaped and rendered.

* Fixes (or at least, improves) the column width calculation for
  combining sequences such as "deaf man" which was previously calculated
  at 3 cells in width when it should have just been 2 cells wide, which
  resulted in a weird "prismatic" effect during rendering where the
  glyph would be rendered with an extra RHS portion of the glyph across
  3 cells.

* Improved/simplified the clustering logic used to compute fallbacks.
  Previously we could end up with some wonky/disjoint sequence of
  undefined glyphs which wouldn't be successfully resolved from a
  fallback font.  We now make a better effort to consolidate runs of
  undefined glyphs for fallback.

* For sequences such as "woman with veil: dark skin tone" that occupy a
  single cell, the shaper may return 3 clusters with 3 glyphs in the
  case that the font doesn't fully support this grapheme.  At render
  time we'd just take the last glyph from that sequence and render it,
  resulting in eg: a female symbol in this particular case.  It is
  generally a bit more useful to show the first glyph in the sequence
  (eg: person with veil) rather than the gender or skin tone, so the
  renderer now checks for this kind of overlapping sequence and renders
  only the first glyph from the sequence.

[android] Migrate installation identifier to non-backed-up storage (#11005)

# Why

https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10261#issuecomment-725396140. Also fixes https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/11008 by making `expo-notifications` use the same installation ID as `expo-constants` and `expoview` (https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/11005/commits/f1ecd07d586094fb9494a5e6584e7d01e419aa48).

# How

Found a (in my opinion) nicer way to store a string in a non-backed-up storage (than defining a `<full-backup-content>` XML file and requiring developers to implement their own `BackupAgent` in some circumstances, etc.) — using [`getNoBackupFilesDir`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getNoBackupFilesDir()) to get a directory where we create a simple `.txt` file. The advantage it provides is not requiring developers to [modify any native files](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10261/files#diff-d8d19d8e0ef909f84b94eb86534e4dde2f0659b56c72ce5bcde12c5815e8b2fd) to incorporate this feature.

I wrote a class that tries to migrate the UUID from `SharedPreferences` to `noBackupFilesDir` on `getUUID` call. It should handle invalid UUIDs well (by ignoring it). Then I copied it from `expoview` to `expo-constants` and `expo-notifications` in case there are bare projects that use one and not the other (we don't want to depend on migration in `-constants` in `-notifications` and vice versa). It follows the implementation outline of https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10261#issuecomment-725396140 with the following modifications:
- instead of removing the `SharedPreferences/keychain` entry "so we recover from corrupt data" I decided to ignore it
- if we didn't read a valid ID and we wouldn't intend to create one if it wasn't present we don't immediately generate a new one. There are still parts of code that do not "get-or-create" the UUID, just "get". For them we need a sensible "just-get" implementation.
- instead of computing the v5 UUID from the Firebase Instance ID (as proposed by the main overview) I've decided to stick with a random v4 UUID since fetching the Firebase Instance ID [starts some kind of connection with Firebase servers](https://github.com/TheWizard91/Album_base_source_from_JADX/blob/e1d228fc2ee550ac19eeac700254af8b0f96080a/sources/com/google/firebase/iid/FirebaseInstanceId.java#L227-L231) — it may also require Firebase app configured (but I haven't verified that) and even though `installationId` is mostly used in `expo-notifications`, we don't say anywhere that accessing `expo-constants.installationId` requires Firebase configured.
- instead of using `SharedPreferences` I decided to save the file in `noBackupFilesDir` which seems less breakable than using `SharedPreferences` and configuring `full-backup-content`.

Another option I was thinking of was to create a new unimodule `expo-installations` (`expo-installation-id`) just for this class and depend on the new unimodule in `expoview`, `expo-constants` and `expo-notifications`. Since we intend to deprecate and eventually remove `.installationId` creating a unimodule just for half a year and deprecating it immediately doesn't seem like the best idea.

# Test Plan

I have verified that:
- `Constants.installationId` from running Expo client on `master` is the same as `.installationId` returned when running Expo client on this branch
- `expo-notifications`'s installation ID from running Expo client on `master` is the same as `installationId` returned when running Expo client on this branch
- removing and reinstalling Expo client sets a different `installationId`
- modifying the file so that is does not contain a valid UUID discards its contents and persists a new UUID

# Test approach #2

Test scenarios for installation identifiers:
- **on an experience running on SDK39 when Expo client upgrades**
  - SDK39 `ConstantsBinding` keeps using `mExponentSharedPreferences.getOrCreateUUID`. Unversioned `ExponentSharedPreferences` migrates UUID from unscoped `SharedPreferences` to unscoped non-backed-up storage. No change. ✅ 
  - SDK39 `InstallationIdProvider` keeps using scoped `SharedPreferences`. Migration isn't being added to versioned `InstallationIdProvider`s, **identifier keeps being backed-up** but it doesn't change. ⚠️ 
- **when an experience using SDK39 upgrades to SDK40 in Expo client**
  - Both SDK39 and SDK40 `ConstantsBinding`s use `mExponentSharedPreferences.getOrCreateUUID` which uses migrated non-backed-up storage. No change ✅ 
  - SDK39 `InstallationIdProvider` used scoped `SharedPreferences`, SDK40 `ScopedInstallationIdProvider` uses `mExponentSharedPreferences.getOrCreateUUID` if there is no existing ID (new project) or migrates legacy UUID from scoped `SharedPreferences` to scoped no-backup-dir if it exists and keeps using it in the future. All in all there's no change. ✅ 
- when standalone app using SDK39 upgrades to SDK40
  - Both SDK39 and SDK40 `ConstantsBinding`s use `mExponentSharedPreferences.getOrCreateUUID` which uses migrated non-backed-up storage. No change ✅ 
  - SDK39 `InstallationIdProvider` had ID saved in scoped `SharedPreferences`, SDK40 `InstallationIdProvider` migrates that ID to scoped `noBackupDir`. No change ✅ 
- when an SDK39 project ejects to bare
  - SDK39 `ConstantsBinding` was using `mExponentSharedPreferences.getOrCreateUUID` which persisted ID in unscoped `SharedPreferences`. Upon ejection we start using `ConstantsService` with unscoped `Context` which results in using the same `SharedPreferences`. No change ✅ 
  - SDK39 `InstallationIdProvider` uses scoped `SharedPreferences` to persist installation ID. Upon ejection we start using unscoped `SharedPreferences`, ID changes to one equal to `Constants.installationId`. ⚠️ [We can live with that.](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/11008#issuecomment-728769487)
- when an SDK40 project ejects to bare
  - SDK40 `ConstantsBinding` was using `mExponentSharedPreferences` which persisted ID in unscoped non-backed-up storage. `ConstantsService` uses the same storage location, ID doesn't change. ✅ 
  - SDK40 `ScopedInstallationProvider` was using either `mExponentSharedPreferences` which persisted ID in unscoped non-backed-up storage (in this case bare `InstallationIdProvider` uses unscoped common installation ID and there are no changes. ✅) or used ID migrated from scoped `SharedPreferences` to scoped `noBackupDir` in which case the ID changes, but [we can live with that](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/11008#issuecomment-728769487)). ⚠️
- when a bare project upgrades `expo-notifications` or `expo-constants`
  - Previous installation ID providers used unscoped `SharedPreferences`. Upon upgrade, the ID gets migrated to the same location by either `expo-notifications` or `expo-constants`. ID stays the same. ✅
