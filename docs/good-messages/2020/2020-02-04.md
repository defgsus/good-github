Update games library (#318)

Here's the delta from the official games library. I corrected some
typos and made some of the titles and annotations more consistent with
each other.

MFC r357103-r357104: unbreak local.lua, add a modules.loaded hook

r357103:
loader.lua: re-arrange to load local.lua *after* config loading

The major problem with the current ordering is that loader.conf may contain
all of the magic we need to actually setup the console, so loading local.lua
prior to that can make it excessively difficult and annoying to debug
(whoops, sorry Ravi & Warner).

The new ordering has some implications, but I suspect they are a non-issue.
The first is that it's no longer possible for the local module to inject any
logic prior to loading config -- I suspect no one has relied on this. The
second implication is that the config.loaded hook is now useless, as the
local module will always be included after that hook would have fired.

For config.loaded, I will opt to leave it in, just in case we add an early
point for local lua to get injected or in case one wants to schedule some
deferred logic in a custom loader.lua. The overhead of having it if no hooks
will be invoked is relatively minimal.

r357104:
lua: add modules.loaded hook

This may be used for the local module to hook in and load any additional
modules that it wants, since it can't modify the modules table internal to
config. We may consider adding API to do so at a later time, but I suspect
it will be more complicated to use with little return.

status is captured but ignored for the purpose of loading the hook. status
will be false if *any* module failed to load, but we typically don't let
that halt the boot so there's no reason to let it halt hooks. Some vendors
or setups may have expected fails that would be actively thwarted by
checking it.

We may, at a later date, consider adding an API for letting non-config
modules check which modules have successfully (or not) loaded in case an
unexpected failure *should* halt whatever they are doing.

"1:10pm. Done with breakfast. Let me watch ep 4 & 5 of Magia Record and then I will resume.

1:55pm. Let me do the chores now.

2:35pm. Done with the chores.

3:05pm. Let me finally start. Enough chilling.

```
type KeywordEnv =
    {
    to' : Dictionary<string,int>
    from : Dictionary<int,string>
    }
```

Ah, this thing. Let me change it so that it is a regular class.

3:40pm. Focus me, stop getting distracted. This always happens to me when I do a piece.

```
let compile env x =
    let env = modules env x
    match env.values.[x.name] with
    | Module l ->

            let d : LangEnv = {
                trace = []
                seq = seq
                cse = [Dictionary(HashIdentity.Structural)]
                i = ref 0
                env_global_type = [||]
                env_global_value = [||]

                env_stack_type_ptr = 0
                env_stack_value = Array.zeroCreate b.value.stack_size
                env_stack_value_ptr = 0
                }

            let _ : Data = partial_eval_value dex d a
            codegen dex (seq.ToArray())
        | Some(Forall _) -> raise <| CompilationError "main has to be a regular function, not a forall."
        | Some _ -> raise <| CompilationError "main has to be a function."
        | None -> raise <| CompilationError "main has to be present in the last module."
    | _ -> failwith "Compiler error: Module that has been compiled should always be in the environment."
```

```
let compile x =
    let env : CompilationEnv = {
        keywords = KeywordEnv()
        types = Map.empty
        values = Map.empty
        }
```

Rather than passing in that env, let me do it like so.

3:45pm. Uh, damn it. Let me just close the browser.

3:50pm. Now that I've done this what is next?

Let me look at the thing I had last time.

3:55pm.

```
        //|> fun x -> printfn "%A" x; x
        |> timeit env.timing.codegen Fsharp.codegen
        |> fun x -> Ok (env.timing.Elapsed,x)
    with
        | :? PrepassError as x -> Fail(env.timing.Elapsed, x.Data0)
        | :? PrepassErrorWithPos as x -> Fail(env.timing.Elapsed, show_trace {settings with filter_list=[]} [x.Data0] x.Data1)
        | :? TypeError as x -> Fail(env.timing.Elapsed, show_trace settings x.Data0 x.Data1)
        | :? TypeRaised as x -> Fail(env.timing.Elapsed, sprintf "Uncaught type raise.\nGot: %s" (Show.show_ty x.Data0))
        | :? CodegenError as x -> Fail(env.timing.Elapsed, x.Data0)
        | :? CodegenErrorWithPos as x -> Fail(env.timing.Elapsed, show_trace {settings with filter_list=[]} x.Data0 x.Data1)
        | :? CompileError as x -> Fail(env.timing.Elapsed, x.Data0)
        | :? CompileErrorWithPos as x -> Fail(env.timing.Elapsed, show_trace {settings with filter_list=[]} x.Data0 x.Data1)
```

This stuff. Timing and errors. Also before I can actually run anything, I need to make the core library.

Ufff...

Let me step away from the screen for a bit. I want a short nap while I think about it.

Maybe I will change the inbuilt op operator to something like `!!!!` as leaving `!` as an operator could be useful.

I've been thinking up various hacks I could do for tensor application, but really just something like `!` would be best. No need to fuss about it.

4pm. Ok, let me step back for a while to think. I need to charge my next attack. This is the final stretch. After I am done with this last bit of error printing and the core library, I will be able to move on to the testing."

Squashed commit of breakfast/brunch commands

We usually don't wan't all the devices in the lunch menu, so
we can now choose to pick up breakfast or brunch and get a
smaller selection of devices (i.e., those we support)

Make brunch more nutritious

* "breakfast device-name" will set up the environment, just like lunch.
* "brunch device-name" will actually do the whole setup and build :)

brunch: add a lazier mode

Since all of targets have a predictable PRODUCT_NAME and BUILD_VARIANT
(i.e., "aosp_$(PRODUCT_DEVICE)-eng"), brunch can now be invoked passing
just the PRODUCT_DEVICE ("brunch passion" for the N1 setup+build, for
example).
The "classic" long form of $(PRODUCT_NAME)-$(BUILD_VARIANT) can still be used
if desired ("brunch slim_passion-eng" still works).

breakfast in bed

breakfast in bed (aliased to "bib") is the baconless friend of lazy
brunch.
You can now use "breakfast passion", or "bib passion", to setup the
corresponding SLIM build without actually building it

Fix breakfast for the undecided

The menu presentation (i.e., giving no arguments to breakfast
or brunch) was broken, so if you didn't know the name of your
target you weren't given a list to choose from, just an error.

Festivals are an integral part of Indian culture. The traditions associated with the celebrations of these festivals reflect people’s deep rooted faith in deities. At the same time people are ignorant of the adversities they cause to the environment. For instance, the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Ashthmi are celebrated in different parts of India. On the last day of the festival the idols are taken out in a colorful and musical procession and traditionally immersed in water bodies. Since immersion is a community activity the place chosen is the one easily accessible like a pond, stream, river or sea. Most of these idols are made of plaster of paris and harmful chemicals. The Plaster of Paris does not easily dissolve in water. This results in the reduction of oxygen level in water. Apart, chemical paints used for decorating idols are hazard to marine life and people. These chemicals contain heavy metals and are bio-accumulative. These harmful substances get dissolved in water bodies in due course of time posing heavy threat to human life by negatively affecting the food chain. This paper focusses on the alternatives to plaster of paris and chemicals. It also reflects on the problems of the artisans, the government schemes and the need for adopting these alternatives so as to take a positive step towards sustainable environment.

mm: remove unused variable in memory hotplug

When I removed the per-zone bitlock hashed waitqueues in commit
9dcb8b685fc3 ("mm: remove per-zone hashtable of bitlock waitqueues"), I
removed all the magic hotplug memory initialization of said waitqueues
too.

But when I actually _tested_ the resulting build, I stupidly assumed
that "allmodconfig" would enable memory hotplug.  And it doesn't,
because it enables KASAN instead, which then disables hotplug memory
support.

As a result, my build test of the per-zone waitqueues was totally
broken, and I didn't notice that the compiler warns about the now unused
iterator variable 'i'.

I guess I should be happy that that seems to be the worst breakage from
my clearly horribly failed test coverage.
