main.cpp is currently a loopback test

troubleshooting i2s r/w; will most likely change
dataingestor to configure I2S as 32-bit and copy data directly
to <int_audio> ring buffer; it is padded automatically, methinks.

i think the problem it was having with pops and shit was that
the DMA buffer was not long enough.  even though it seemed to be
the correct size, the documentation is not entirely clear as to
whether it is shared when using both TX and RX on the same I2S bus.

next up is re-enabling sd card stuff, but have to hook it up physically,
first.  wanted to get a commit in before fucking everything all up again.

Add FlowControlledPipe RTL + test

This one's kinda funny in that I didn't add any unit tests (just the fuzz test) and I actually wrote some docs for it. I figured since it did a bit of "magic" things that it was worth going into how it works and how it's expected to be used. Overall, I think this pattern is pretty OK - maybe making some kind of pipeline abstraction that plays nicely with something like this to hook things up even more automatically might be worthwhile - or not.

This _did_ get me thinking about potentially wrapping some of these module generators into some kind of "instantiators" that would generate a specialized version of the model as well as instantiate it in some context and then instead of returning the `Module` directly, perhaps return some wrapper struct whose fields would represent the lower-level signals/ports (perhaps even collections of ports, eg. a `BusterReadPort<width>` or similar) and add some higher-level code to hook things up. This might be kinda annoying to also implement (and potentially test) these higher-level abstractions but I imagine they would be extremely powerful in many cases. Even just exposing buster ports would probably go a long way in terms of reducing the amount of RTL we have just to wire things together, and establishing a pattern for how this might be done (rather than try to actually make super generic structs) will still afford us the freedom of making appropriate abstractions on-the-fly for use cases that actually arise.

Update the My Account page to work with modern configforms styling.

The My Account page was written with legacy configforms styling in
mind. We worked around layout issues with custom styling, dynamically
altering some classes, and trying to make some parts of the UI line up
and blend together in somewhat hacky ways.

Djblets 2.0 switches configform pages over to a cleaner, more modern CSS
Component structure, with improved styling and layout. This definitely
breaks a lot of the My Account page, which this change fixes by
utilizing the new layout constructs and stripping away old hacks.

For the most part, this includes wrapping some elements in a
`djblets-l-config-forms-container` container element, switching to newer
class names, and removing unwanted styling to allow some of the fixes in
the core classes to work correctly.

There are a couple cases where we've had to alter some CSS to work
correctly in modern configforms. For instance, `rb-c-search-input` and
`rb-c-form-field__errors` needed to work around configforms taking
precedence and overriding some styling. These are unfortunate hacks,
currently. The plan, a bit further down the road, is to centralize our
styling in a more common component, but for now this is a necessary
evil.

Testing Done:
Unit tests pass.

Tested every subpage and form in the My Account page.

More efficient hospitalBed queries.

I've decreased the query/load time for cached hospital beds by
about 80-90% (from 373ms => 40-70ms). I also tried implementing a
potential efficiency reduction for all the 'first visit' page loads, but
the time difference for that was fairly negligible, so I scrapped it.

Unfortunately, this means that uncached data page loads can still take a
long-ass time. In some cases, several seconds long. At this point, the
only possible solution to that 'problem' is if we cached the larger data
sets on server start-up. But that's only a stop-gap, and not really a
great solution for the long-term.

I left the previous hospital bed query in the code, all you need to do
to switch back to it is remove /${state} from line 21 of the frontend's
HospitalBeds.js.

I decrease the initial, uncached loadtime of the hospitalBeds page by
caching the data only after sending it, but honestly redis works so fast
that it doesn't make much of a difference in to the overall loadtime
(especially in light of what I think is the main problem, that the api
sends over 200,000 lines in response to every query).

The way I went about the efficiency changes is by basically having redis
store bedUtilization for every individual state instead of all of them
together. Thus, the code only needs to parse through about 4,000 entries
insteadof checking (& performing string equivalence checks) on over
200,000 entries. The code now queries redis for a list of a state's
entries instead of all of them (and then searching response for
matches). Kind of repeated myself there.

I also added two other hospitalBeds' API-specific states to the end of
the dropdown, Puerto Rico & district of Columbia. Haven't tested them
though. So if they don't work, I'll remove them later.

We really need to have a group meeting with everyone sometime present
sometime soon.
