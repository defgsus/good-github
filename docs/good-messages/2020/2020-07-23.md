promql: Removed global and add ability to have better interval for subqueries if not specified (#7628)

* promql: Removed global and add ability to have better interval for subqueries if not specified

## Changes
* Refactored tests for better hints testing
* Added various TODO in places to enhance.
* Moved DefaultEvalInterval global to opts with func(rangeMillis int64) int64 function instead

Motivation: At Thanos we would love to have better control over the subqueries step/interval.
This is important to choose proper resolution. I think having proper step also does not harm for
Prometheus and remote read users. Especially on stateless querier we do not know evaluation interval
and in fact putting global can be wrong to assume for Prometheus even.

I think ideally we could try to have at least 3 samples within the range, the same
way Prometheus UI and Grafana assumes.

Anyway this interfaces allows to decide on promQL user basis.

Open question: Is taking parent interval a smart move?

Motivation for removing global: I spent 1h fighting with:


=== RUN   TestEvaluations
    TestEvaluations: promql_test.go:31: unexpected error: error evaluating query "absent_over_time(rate(nonexistant[5m])[5m:])" (line 687): unexpected error: runtime error: integer divide by zero
--- FAIL: TestEvaluations (0.32s)
FAIL

At the end I found that this fails on most of the versions including this master if you run this test alone. If run together with many
other tests it passes. This is due to SetDefaultEvaluationInterval(1 * time.Minute)
in test that is ran before TestEvaluations. Thanks to globals (:

Let's fix it by dropping this global.

rosy: Overlay DTS changes

With overlay:
- All stock .dts files are compilable.
- Rosy's code is isolated from other .dtsi files.

Note that, to successfully overlay rosy's changes specifically, we have to use
an ugly hack. It involves predefining essential nodes for msm8953 dtsi
(to evade "node not found" errors), and also involves deleting a node
that conflicts with msm-pmi8940. The true fix would be CAF fixing their own
shit to not conflict when some specific headers are included.
This patch improves 78f9bfa0b4e14b2f050b4675f0ff8aff22aad585.

[ADD] runbot_merge: indication of status states in the mergebot

Currently it can be difficult to know why the mergebot refuses to
merge a PR (not that people care, they generally just keep sending new
commands without checking what the 'bot is telling them, oh well...).

Anyway knowing the CI state is the most complicated bit because the CI
tag only provides a global pass/fail for statuses but not a view of
specific statuses, and sometimes either the runbot or github fails to
notify the mergebot, leading to inconsistent internal states & shit.

By adding a tag per status context per PR, we can more clearly
indicate what's what.

Fixes #389
