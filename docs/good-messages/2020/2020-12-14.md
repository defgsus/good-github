day 13 part 1 in SML

Due to real life yesterday I didn't do anything and now I'm too tired to write a program that terminates in a reasonable amount of time.
Anyway I wrote a silly program that does at least I/O in SML.
I really don't like writing it - some ideas are nice, but they drown in an infinite series of annoyances,
the diagnostic messages are terrible, and the syntax seems made to make silly things happen.
(eg "f a b c" vs "f(a,b,c)" generates terrible messages)

Hopefully tomorrow I will be able to catch up a little bit.
