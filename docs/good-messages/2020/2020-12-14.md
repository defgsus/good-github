Rough rider, no you don't want nada
None of this, six-gunnin' this, brother runnin' this
Buffalo soldier, look it's like I told yaAny damsel that's in distress
Be out of that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step, we'll flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at
With Artemus, from the start of this, runnin' the game
James West tamin' the west so remember the name

2020 Day 14

This was a good day, I liked the task. Been a while since I've done bit
twiddling.

I made a silly mistake on part one, doing 2 << i instead of 1 << i. This
cost me about 10-12 minutes :/

Part 2 I initially just did it the stupid way, but it was too slow, so I
ended up spending 2 hours making a variant that moves backwards, and
figures out which masks and addresses collide and so forth. This turns
out to be slow, but not super slow.

Once I finished, I looked at the comments and I see people have solved
it the stupid way. I go back and I see that the way I'm generating the
addresses for the mask is very stupid using permutations, and I should
instead just use binary numbers like I thought of first. With this and
some other minor tweaks, my first solutions is much faster than my
"smart" one, for these few Xs. Mine will scale better I think, but
still.

I ended up learning a lot here and I saw some truly nice solutions on
the forums that I will look more into. Especially a C++ one that used
https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pdep to do the mask thing. I'll be
stealing his solution and commenting it out to learn more.

Overall bad time today, but good learning :D

2020 d14 p2

This seems like an unusual AOC case where the *example* is not
computable with a naive approach, but the *input* (at least my input)
is.

When the mask has lots of wildcards ("X"), fully expanding it is a very
bad idea. But the masks in my input all had a pretty low number of
wildcards (the highest was 8, for 256 distinct expanded values). The p1
example program had 34 wildcards (17 billion expansions), although the
p2 examples were more reasonable.

I think the gold-plated solution here is to not actually expand the
wildcards, but to remember the stored values *with* the wildcard
addresses, and then count out how many expansions there would be at the
end & multiply the values. That's more challenging, though, because
later addresses can intersect with earlier addresses, so I think you'd
want to end up storing it as some kind of tree so you track the ordering
and which particular expansions of a given address were overridden
later.  That's an interesting problem to consider, but it's Monday
morning & I have actual work to do, so I'm taking my gold stars where I
can get them.

Godot networking RPC system fucking sucks

Seriously, what the fuck ? Why make something as simple as
client<->server communicaiton so OBNOXIOUS.
Here, the RPC system will sometimes send packet from a
node that he doesn't completely understand, and except that
the other client will do it, and EVERY PART of the node
path resolution is done INSIDE THE ENGINE. So it's INVISIBLE
to you ! And yet, when this part breaks, it breaks ON YOUR
FACE !

So, here, I'm doing something EXTREMELY complex :
- Clients send their local positions to the server
- Server send everyone position to everyone
- Clients parse the position of other players and show
  them on their screen

We're nearing rocket science over here ! But fortunately,
we got an overcomplex RPC system to save the day...

day 13 part 1 in SML

Due to real life yesterday I didn't do anything and now I'm too tired to write a program that terminates in a reasonable amount of time.
Anyway I wrote a silly program that does at least I/O in SML.
I really don't like writing it - some ideas are nice, but they drown in an infinite series of annoyances,
the diagnostic messages are terrible, and the syntax seems made to make silly things happen.
(eg "f a b c" vs "f(a,b,c)" generates terrible messages)

Hopefully tomorrow I will be able to catch up a little bit.
