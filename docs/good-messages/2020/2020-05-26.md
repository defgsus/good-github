vendor: notch-city: Add 3 mode display cutout handler [2/3]

[AgentFabulous - POSP]
- Introduces the HideCutout and StatusBarStock overlay used in the
  3 mode display cutout handler. The HideCutout overlay is necessary
  since we can't register a content observer in the display manager code.
  We only have access to resources during boot. Thus, leave this as an
  overlay and let the config and overlay change methods handle this.
  Though we can probably do statusbar stock height toggling in the
  SystemUI code without overlays, I kinda got lazy by the end, just
  live with it god damn it xD

Version 1.0 Final (EOL)

This is a formal change by merging all the recent changes from the already
old 'develop' branch into a new final 1.0 version on variants 'exynos',
'snapdragon' and 'desktop' which all totally can be considered as end of life.
After 'some time' of beta state and after many successful implementations
over the years, at it's 'best times' running on tousands of devices in
different kernels, beeing stable as it currently is (used it for years 24/7
on all my meanwhile 10 devices, and still do!) and as it can be (well i have
to admit sometimes it was a beast!! *gg*) im going to make the almost 3 years
old 'develop' version finally the version 1.0 and consider it as stable.
By doing this i'm also closing this old development chapter by making the
'exynos,snapdragon and desktop' versions final and EOL. The 'develop' branch
is now obsolete and gets deleted.

Finally stable, phew what a journey! :)

Thx to all contributing devs and ppl who contributed with their ideas, tests
and nervs when it did 'mock around'! Last but not least thx to all of those
which let 'the beast' running on their devices! I hope u all enjoyed it like i did!

NOTE: Despite me beeing not as active as some years ago with development i
want to let u know that there meanwhile exists a 'big Little brother' (poor
one even has NO version number at all yet) of ZZMoove governor which is still
happily hopping around on 'newer' devices. Checkout the 'bLE-develop-*' branches
in this repo for details. This newer version exists already since about 3 years
and were already running in (meanwhile also EOL) boeffla kernels for the OnePlus 3/5
and also can be found in some recent OnePlus 6 kernels (at least in the ones i
fiddled recently *g*). By the way i shamelessly take the opportunity: If u still
have a OnePlus 6/6T u really you should consider trying one of these builds, more
info can be found here: https://github.com/zanezam/ZZupreme-Builds
ZZMoove still rocks by significantly influencing speed and battery usage in a
positive way! Just saying. :)

Enjoy!

for the love of god plz work

my hypothesis is that now favicon will work on /cv/ permalink. yet still notion.so has to die because html rendered there is heavily unresponsive. look — i do get polyfills and all that — why don't you output html that is responsive like *your own* site. you're professionals for god sake! use your css grid magic and all the fancy w3c standards. ugh...

2020-05-26 3.1 Programmer's Notes

I've been pondering the issue of how to make money with this beast of mine, and
come to the conclusion that there isn't a way.  If people aren't using the tool
for free under the existing licenses, they're certainly not going to pay to use it.

I'm stuck with this disability lifestyle.  The hours may be great and I love the
lack of meetings and schedules, but the pay really sucks.
