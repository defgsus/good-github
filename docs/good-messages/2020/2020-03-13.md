I fucking hate my life

did some fucking bullshit and somehow found my code for this shit but you are fucking making the candy prefab because you are going to drag the sprite into unity and make the prefab and you are going to add the projectile code to the prefab and then add that prefab to the projectile slot in the movement code so that there are no issues with unity

Python: introduce NIX_PYTHONPREFIX in order to set site.PREFIXES

This is needed in case of `python.buildEnv` to make sure site.PREFIXES
does not only point to the unwrapped executable prefix.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This PR is a story where your valiant hero sets out on a very simple adventure but ends up having to slay dragons, starts questioning his own sanity and finally manages to gain enough knowledge to slay the evil dragon and finally win the proverbial price.

It all started out on sunny spring day with trying to tackle the Nixops plugin infrastructure and make that nice enough to work with.

Our story begins in the shanty town of [NixOps-AWS](https://github.com/nixos/nixops-aws) where [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) type checking has not yet been seen.

As our deuteragonist (@grahamc) has made great strides in the capital city of [NixOps](https://github.com/nixos/nixops) our hero wanted to bring this out into the land and let the people rejoice in reliability and a wonderful development experience.

The plugin work itself was straight forward and our hero quickly slayed the first small dragon, at this point things felt good and our hero thought he was going to reach the town of NixOps-AWS very quickly.

But alas! Mypy did not want to go, it said:
`Cannot find implementation or library stub for module named 'nixops'`

Our hero felt a small sliver of life escape from his body. Things were not going to be so easy.

After some frustration our hero discovered there was a [rule of the land of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/) that governed the import of types into the kingdom, more specificaly a very special document (file) called `py.typed`.
Things were looking good.

But no, what the law said did not seem to match reality. How could things be so?

After some frustrating debugging our valiant hero thought to himself "Hmm, I wonder if this is simply a Nix idiosyncrasy", and it turns out indeed it was.
Things that were working in the blessed way of the land of Python (inside a `virtualenv`) were not working the way they were from his home town of Nix (`nix-shell` + `python.withPackages`).

After even more frustrating attempts at reading the mypy documentation and trying to understand how things were supposed to work our hero started questioning his sanity.
This is where things started to get truly interesting.

Our hero started to use a number of powerful weapons, both forged in the land of Python (pdb) & by the mages of UNIX (printf-style-debugging & strace).

After first trying to slay the dragon simply by `strace` and a keen eye our hero did not spot any weak points.
Time to break out a more powerful sword (`pdb`) which also did not divulge any secrets about what was wrong.

Our hero went back to the `strace` output and after a fair bit of thought and analysis a pattern started to emerge. Mypy was looking in the wrong place (i.e. not in in the environment created by `python.withPackages` but in the interpreter store path) and our princess was in another castle!

Our hero went to the pub full of old grumpy men giving out the inner workings of the open source universe (Github) and acquired a copy of Mypy.
He littered the code with print statements & break points.
After a fierce battle full of blood, sweat & tears he ended up in https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/20f7f2dd71c21bde4d3d99f9ab69bf6670c7fa03/mypy/sitepkgs.py and realised that everything came down to the Python `site` module and more specifically https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/site.html#site.getsitepackages which in turn relies on https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/site.html#site.PREFIXES .

Our hero created a copy of the environment created by `python.withPackages` and manually modified it to confirm his findings, and it turned out it was indeed the case.
Our hero had damaged the dragon and it was time for a celebration.

He went out and acquired some mead which he ingested while he typed up his story and waited for the dragon to finally die (the commit caused a mass-rebuild, I had to wait for my repro).

In the end all was good in [NixOps-AWS](https://github.com/nixos/nixops-aws)-town and type checks could run. (PR for that incoming tomorrow).

"7pm. "Na Zagrebačkoj je burzi u četvrtak ujutro obustavljeno trgovanje na cijeli dan jer su, pod pritiskom negativnog raspoloženja na svjetskim burzama, Crobex indeksi potonuli više od 10 posto i zaronili na najniže razine od 2009. godine."

Oh lol, the Cro markets never saw a rise in over a decade. It actually sank below where it was in 2009.

7:45pm. https://github.com/purescript/purescript/blob/master/psc-ide/PROTOCOL.md

I am doing a little skim of Purescript, and in terms of size and organization, Purescript seems quite reasonable. It is not using the LSP.

Actually, on a deeper thought I think Purescript's source might be worth studying for its own sake. Given that after I figure out what I want for editor support I am going to be doing the typechecker - and Purescript has exactly the features that I want there - it might be a good idea to fit it into my schedule. The language itself does not seem to be too much.

Like the whole language is only 1.1Mb. `vscode-languageserver-node` is around half of that. The IDE stuff is 1/10th of that.

8:05pm. For comparison, what I have of Spiral v0.2 is 180kb.

One thing I want to look into before I make a decision is the VS Code plugin for Purescript.

8:10pm. I'll leave that for tomorrow. Right now, it really is too late for that.

Let me watch Dendro.

8:25pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AtyWgQ3vv0
PureScript: Tomorrow’s JavaScript Today

Actually, let me watch this first.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19983022

cryptica: "I don't buy this idea that the programming language you use determines the quality of your work. There is no evidence to support this. These extreme programming fads were invented to sell books.
If novelists followed the same approach as programmers and they kept trying to find the perfect language to write their books in, they wouldn't manage to publish a single interesting novel.

A language cannot prevent someone from making stupid mistakes. At best, it solves one set of familiar problems and replaces them with a new set of unfamiliar (but equally bad) problems; then you have to learn to cope with those new problems until the next hyped-up language fad comes along claiming to solve those new problems and then you repeat the cycle."

bcheung: "There's a concept known as linguistic relativity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) that states that the language affects what thoughts you are capable of having.
We don't program in assembly language because it is very tedious and error prone. Higher level languages absolutely do eliminate classes of errors that are only possible at the assembly language level (accidentally altering the stack and affecting the jump return address for example). Another example would be garbage collection making it impossible to create a certain class of errors.

Another example would be doing long division with roman numerals instead of Arabic. The human brain can only process so much before it becomes overloaded. By "compressing" thoughts using new vocabulary concepts you can reason about ideas that are beyond your normal cognitive limits."

In my opinion, mastering a better tool is the best way for a human to get better. Moving to guns from bows and arrows is a definite leap in killing power, and the same principle works in languages.

8:35pm. "Elm definitely has the better ecosystem and tooling. It's much easier to learn as well."

Hmmm...

3/13/2020

8:15am. Got up 15m ago and am just chilling. I slept well this time.

Now...as the entries from yesterday indicate, I am strongly leaning towards going in the Purescript direction. Not only are the VS Code examples thus far complete shit, but given that it has all the type system features that I want in Spiral studying Purescript would kill several other birds in one swoop as well. 1.1Mb comes to 20-25k LOC which is nothing for a language with its featureset. And the actual full IDE support is 3 times smaller than the shitty VS Code templates. I bet that F# plugin by Fraser is something like 10k which is ridiculous.

I am going to do this.

Rather than bashing my head while complaining about how shitty the VS Code samples are, I should just use Purs as a template.

8:20am. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPpIbiZFPRY

After I stop chilling, I think I'll start my Purs adventure with this.

9am. Ok, let me go for the video.

9:35am. Had to take a little break. Let me commit here.

Let me just focus on the video full out here."

File 94 just also uploaded

Dear All, one more file here above attached, book is going normally and will be finished as told you. I am glad being here offering you my services so far..and also in future..with more work.
Some recommendations also by the way, based on my total information so far from different reliable sources on Coronovirus:
NO PANIC, atmosphere first has always been plenty of microbes and several kinds of viruses going around, and nothing ever happened. Just follow strictly all medical instructions, like wash very well hands, antiseptic, avoid going out, stay at home as long as possible, also focus on washing after touching money for ex. ATM, avoid touching face, such as screatching nose, or if we want to first wash hands well, also no reuse for nose same handkerchief, when sneezing for ex. keep bath and WC clean, avoid going to Cafes, cinema, closed places generally and by no means to WC of them. Also, another potential medicine in adv. who helps not falling ill, even, we come close with virus, is alcohol drinking, for ex. any kind of alcohol, from wine, whiskey, vodka and generally acid, what containes acids, are against both microbes and viruses potentially..
And strong faith to God of course, as we are all subject to His will, He can only protect us or save us in the end if we catch. Old people by no means go out at night, 
BEST WISHES!!!..to All of us, optimism, creativity, and I'll be back soon with one more file..

wow lots of tests wow

- WeatherChangedEffect no longer passes the weather that was changed to (you can just figure it out your fucking self with the battle)
- Ice Face is now affected by Utility Umbrella (at first I was like hm yeah that's strange they don't interact I guess I'll just leave it like that BUT THEN I REMEMBERED that it's likely not an exception at all because the game weirdly only works with sun and rain for the umbrella even with it's super vague description and I changed that to all weather so Ice Face no longer restores in hail now with umbrella)
- Utility Umbrella no longer allows buffet damage from hail and sandstorm (see above rant for the same explanation)
- Not sure why I decided before to change Shore Up and Floral Healing to fully heal in Sandstorm/Grassy Terrain in the past but I reverted that back to 2/3 (instead of 1/2)
- added a new FAKE FREEZER move for testing which I have definitely considered before which is basically just there to consistently apply freezing status
- fixed the new bug with Air Lock not being able to remove weather conditions naturally (was always decrementing Clear Skies so weather was not being removed)
- Sand Veil, Sand Rush, Slush Rush, and Snow Cloak abilities were previously still allowing buffet damage from sandstorm or hail and now they don't
- added a bunch of tests for buffet damage from hail and sandstorm in EffectTest
- moved most logic from testInfo.statModifierTest to new assertStatModifier method on TestPokemon
- oh and also lots of utility umbrella tests for like every possible weather condition and effect

NEW
- Preload Scene
- Top Menu Scene
- Menu management script added
EDITS
- tweaked position of vehicle  and lighting in sample scene
- reorganized the scripts, prefabs, and scenes into properly organized folders
NOTES
- I lost a bunch of progress due to a dumb mistake, I think I made up most of it but I can't be sure.
- adding the universial render pipeline fucked the lighting and the flipped normals shader I was using, this may take some time to fix
- the car is not lit properly when loading the game from the preload scene, likley due to the URP. this might be an editor issue however and not present in a built version.
