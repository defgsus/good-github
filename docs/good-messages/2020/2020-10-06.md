Fix webpack crash on the build server.

This took hours and hours. I honestly hate life now, but this
seems to be the fix. Things went started to go south on me after
refactoring Services to TypeScript. I chased and chased so many things
and in the end this was the fix. I honestly don't know why Webpack was
dying because of this but my only theory is there was just too much
going on in this file.

Once I narrowed down to worker.ts I should have incrementally added
services dependencies in because that approach turned out to be what
led me here. Trying to import less and less.

Fixing the work of a moron.

Just.. Im just frothing with rage while looking at some of this stuff. Some polaris dude named Neerti did a bunch of half assed commenting five years ago, and has been causing a shit ton of warning messages because of it. I ended up fixing most of it out of pure rage.

Tell me if you guys need a CHOMPedit on these, because this is mostly just fixing really stupid commented out stuff that should have been fixed years ago by the person that did this. I wouldn't think it would need a CHOMPedit, but you never know.

Fix webpack crash on the build server.

This drove me insane. Suddenly, the build whenever run from Jenkins
would refuse to generate the webpack bundle.

Hours and hours later this is all I could come up with. I honestly
don't know what's special about this, but I moved so much around
trying to find the cause I just hate all things webpack now.
