rosy: dts: Overlay changes

With overlay:
- All stock .dts files are compilable.
- Rosy's code is isolated from other .dtsi files.

Note that, to successfully overlay rosy's changes specifically, we have to use
an ugly hack. It involves predefining essential nodes for msm8953 dtsi
(to evade "node not found" errors), and also involves deleting a node
that conflicts with msm-pmi8940. The true fix would be CAF fixing their own
shit to not conflict when some specific headers are included.
This patch improves 78f9bfa0b4e14b2f050b4675f0ff8aff22aad585.

Merge #1162 #1383

1162: DifferentialEquations.jl-Based ODE Solvers r=charleskawczynski a=ChrisRackauckas

This sets up "two" ODE solvers: DiffEqJLSolver and DiffEqJLIMEXSolver. These solvers allow taking in a `DEAlgorithm` which can be any DiffEq common interface ODE solver that satisfies the common integrator interface, which includes OrdinaryDiffEq, Sundials, and a few others. 

The only kernel calls are done through fused broadcasts, so in theory there shouldn't be any overhead on large problems as long as we are only using the right number of kernels. In practice, since this is our first super larger scale application since we plan to track, there may be an extra kernel call somewhere, and so I assume that after we get attempt 1 done here we may need to make an upstream change. The standard RK methods (including the SSP methods, which includes some methods with enhanced stability specifically for DG discretizations) should all be optimized already. I think we may need to do something special for the low-storage RK methods.

As for implicit and IMEX methods, I setup the interface for how to hook into them, though we may need to setup a linear solver for DiffEq. That can be done via https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/features/linear_nonlinear/#Linear-Solvers:-linsolve-Specification-1 , so we can just make the solvers call your linear solvers.

## Why?

There are a few things we're looking at for how this will benefit both our own research and Clima. To list a few:

- Our methods for [numerical uncertainty quantification](https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/analysis/uncertainty_quantification/) will allow for understanding the error induced by the time stepping methods. There's other (undocumented) UQ methods being published soon which could be useful too.
- [Checkpointed adjoint sensitivity analysis](https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/analysis/sensitivity/) for parameter fitting and UQ is probably a big feature Clima would gain from this. More work might be required to complete the integration of this, but I think there could be a lot of uses.
- Stochastic differential equation models would be pretty accessible from this form, so if there are reasonable extensions to SPDEs they can be considered and high order adaptive methods can be applied.
- [Generalized Physics-Informed Learning](https://youtu.be/SEhMWkgcTOI): you can see from this talk that I want to start taking this to climate models for developing surrogates.
- Tons of new methods. Specifically:
  - [A bunch of SSP methods](https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/#Explicit-Strong-Stability-Preserving-Runge-Kutta-Methods-for-Hyperbolic-PDEs-(Conservation-Laws)-1)
  - [A bunch of low-storage RK methods](https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/#Low-Storage-Methods-1)
  - [A bunch of IMEX methods](https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/split_ode_solve/#OrdinaryDiffEq.jl-1)
  - Whatever we build in the future.

The benefits to SciML are:

- We see that there's been some recent work in MRI methods. It would be nice to capture that momentum as something that can be added directly to OrdinaryDiffEq (or even just in SimpleDiffEq.jl or another common interface algorithm package) so that they can be used on an SplitODEProblem. This would enhance the Julia ecosystem beyond Clima and be something that can then be demonstrated as a benefit of the Clima project to other projects down the line. By creating this common interface ODE solver algorithm for Clima, I hope we can accelerate this effort because now, if the MRI methods are moved to a DiffEq interface compatible package, they should be usable in Clima without overhead which should be a good incentive to do so!
- We can start to use Clima as one of our canonical benchmarks, and hopefully overtime improve algorithm performance on Clima's type of problems and use it as a source of real-world problems in publications and grants (possibly we could look for a joint grant in this area).
- This serves as a good testing ground for MPI and GPU based array usage. It won't be perfect until we have a real test, so let's get a test!

So in short, this should help Clima get a few new features while improving SciML for large models to help out other PDE-based modeling projects beyond Clima.

## Current Issues

There are a few small issues noticed in this PR:

- What test case should I be using? I just grabbed what was in the ODESolver tests, but what's a good demo climate simulation I can start using to test out CPU usage, GPU usage, and MPI+GPU usage? I'd like to have these three cases for development and to add to [DiffEqBenchmarks.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqBenchmarks.jl).
- When is `p` defined? In the DiffEq solvers, we want `p` at the time of the construction of the `ODEProblem` so we can concretely type the integrator. We at least need to know and have something of its type. The test just has `nothing` parameters, so that works, but I wonder if this will be an issue. I added `p` as a keyword argument to the solver's constructor.
- The methods from Sundials and other C++/Fortran libraries are "technically" supported, but in reality they need the array type to be an `Array`, which I assume will almost never be the case with Clima. Sundials does have some good MRI methods that would be interesting to try out here, but making them work would require making NVector wrappers which, it might just be easier to make Julia versions of all of that (and that is a summer project for students).
- Is there any more structure in the ODEs that can be exploited? Semilinearity for exponential integrators or anything of that sort? Symplecticness or partitioning of the states? 
- Dependencies: are you open to a DiffEqBase dependency? That's a whole lot smaller than OrdinaryDiffEq or DifferentialEquations.jl. A user would need to `using DifferentialEquations` (or just `using OrdinaryDiffEq`) to actually get solver methods.

## What's Next?

If this is setup, then I would like to have some of our GSoC and MLH students optimize this interfacing and demonstrate results using it. That would then set the stage for less technical more mathematical students to just do pure algorithm development in OrdinaryDiffEq knowing that this would be efficient. I hope we can demonstrate that this connection ends up calling the optimal number of kernels by the end of the summer.

In 18.337 Scientific Machine Learning and Parallel Computing in the next fall, each student has final projects to do and, if this is all setup, I would like to point a few students towards implementing some new methods and demonstrating the results on Clima, so this is where new IMEX, MRI, etc. methods can get developed, improved, and tested.



1383: Add `flattened_tup_chain ` and chained getproperty/getindex methods r=charleskawczynski a=charleskawczynski

# Description

Debugging highly nested models (e.g., EDMF) is difficult because, at the moment, checking fields in all sub-models requires manually writing out all fields/subfields, or writing recursive `getproperty`/`getindex` methods, which is painful/overkill just for debugging. This PR adds a method `flattened_tup_chain`, along with a recursive and interleaved `getindex`/`getproperty`, to `VariableTemplates` so that users can iterate through every field in compute kernels in a convenient way, as demonstrated in a new test in the test suite:

```julia
    ftc = flattened_tup_chain(st)
    @test ftc[1] === (:ntuple_model, 1, :scalar_model, :x)
    @test ftc[2] === (:ntuple_model, 2, :scalar_model, :x)
    @test ftc[3] === (:ntuple_model, 3, :scalar_model, :x)
    @test ftc[4] === (:vector_model, :x)
    @test ftc[5] === (:scalar_model, :x)

    # getproperty with tup-chain
    for i in 1:N
        @test v.scalar_model.x == getproperty(v, (:scalar_model, :x))
        @test v.vector_model.x == getproperty(v, (:vector_model, :x))
        @test v.ntuple_model[i] == getproperty(v, (:ntuple_model, i))
        @test v.ntuple_model[i].scalar_model == getproperty(v, (:ntuple_model, i, :scalar_model))
        @test v.ntuple_model[i].scalar_model.x == getproperty(v, (:ntuple_model, i, :scalar_model, :x))
    end
```

If we change our initialization, as suggested by @trontrytel and discussed with @kpamnany, to initializing fields to `NaN`s, a very practical use-case of this might look like:

```julia
function init_heldsuarez!(balance_law, state::Vars{st}, aux::Vars{au}, coords, t) where {st,au}

    # Initialize fields...

    for tc in flattened_tup_chain(st)
        @assert getproperty(state, tc) ≠ NaN
    end
    for tc in flattened_tup_chain(au)
        @assert getproperty(aux, tc) ≠ NaN
    end
    # All fields in all balance_law submodels are now gauranteed to be initialized
end
```
