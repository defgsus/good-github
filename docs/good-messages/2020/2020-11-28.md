feature: add death animation

The animation will wait for the hurt animation to finish and the player to be on the floor before it starts.

Issue:
1. So... yeah, physics am I right? When you die they _kinda_ brake. At first I thought they were working as intended, but further testing proved otherwise :D 
But I'm tired, sorry my frend.
