add support for libvirt OVS networks

Thanks to my friend Nick Satsia (nsatsia) for his help with this!

This add support for creating OVS networks in libvirt and attaching VMs
to them. Note that the OVS bridge needs to already exist on the kvmhost
(see below).

This configuration is flexible, so how you configure it is up to you.
However, you might like to have one libvirt OVS bridge with multiple
portgroups (which are what guests connect to).

One portgroup could be a trunk where you include all if your VLANs,
perhaps with a native. This way you can create tagged interfaces in
Linux.

Then you can also create other portgroups which are specific to VLANs
and networks. This way you can attach the VM to multiple separate
networks directly without needing tagged interfaces in Linux.

If you don't use VLANs you can leave them off altogether and just use it
as a bridge to your native network.

Define the libvirt OVS bridge to create in the kvmhost YAML inventory
file. The bridge_dev is important, this is the ovs bridge to connect to.
As above, here's an example with a trunk and tagged networks.

  virt_infra_host_networks:
    present:
     - name: ovs-bridge
       type: ovs
       bridge_dev: ovs-bridge
       portgroup:
         - name: ovs-trunk
           trunk: true
           vlan:
             - 1
             - 2
         - name: ovs-vlan1
           native_vlan: 1
           vlan:
             - 1
         - name: ovs-vlan2
           native_vlan: 2
           vlan:
             - 2

Then in the YAML inventory for the VM, define the OVS portgroups you
want to the VM to connect to. Remember the first interface probably
should be something with a native VLAN so that DHCP works.

  test-vm:
    virt_infra_networks:
      - name: ovs-bridge
        portgroup: ovs-vlan1
        type: ovs
      - name: ovs-bridge
        portgroup: ovs-vlan2
        type: ovs

Note this requires openvswitch to be installed and running with a OVS
bridge *already* created. A physical interface should also already be
added if it needs to communicate to the rest of the network.

You can configure this easily with ovs-vsctl, but it doesn't survive a
reboot:

 $ sudo ovs-vsctl add-br ovs-bridge
 $ sudo ovs-vsctl add-port ovs-bridge eth0

Or configure persistently with NetworkManager:

 $ sudo nmcli con add type ovs-bridge conn.interface ovs-bridge con-name ovs-bridge
 $ sudo nmcli con add type ovs-port conn.interface port-ovs-bridge master ovs-bridge
 $ sudo nmcli con add type ovs-interface slave-type ovs-port conn.interface ovs-bridge master port-ovs-bridge

 $ sudo nmcli con modify id eth0 ipv4.method disabled ipv6.method disabled
 $ sudo nmcli con add type ovs-port conn.interface ovs-port-eth master ovs-bridge con-name ovs-port-eth
 $ sudo nmcli con add type ethernet conn.interface eth0 master ovs-port-eth con-name ovs-int-eth
 $ sudo ifup ovs-int-eth

Or some other way using your distro's configs.

fix(cli): can't bootstrap environment not in app

It used to be that if we had an `--app` argument, we would always glob
arguments to `cdk bootstrap <ENV>` through the environments of stacks
in the app.

This makes it super hard/annoying to run `cdk bootstrap
aws://1234/us-somewhere` in a CI/CD project; you have to add a stack
there first and compile before you're allowed to do that, which is
kinda silly.

Change behavior to only glob environment from the environments in the
app if it looks like the user is supplying a glob (if it contains `*`).

If the user is supplying a concrete environment name, just use it
directly.

Also in this commit:

- refactor: lots of places where we were passing around a pair
of `(account, region)`. Replace those by passing a `cxapi.Environment`
instead (most of the changes in this PR).
- refactor: the old and new bootstrapping experience had a lot of
copy/pasta between them. Refactored to make them share code.
- (prerelease) feat: add a version check to the bootstrapping operation,
so that users won't accidentally downgrade a bootstrap stack to an older
version (This happened to 2 devs already, and is an easy mistake to
make. Protect against it.)

Various QoL Changes / More
- - -
Bugfix:
 - Ascent drones can now actually speak ZAC, as was intended.
 - Vox TEG fix. This corrected the pipe issue, and now allows for players to actually have an active, working TEG.
 - Pathfinder given basic Research access. Because it didn't have it, for some reason, despite working alongside the Science department.
- - -
Additions:
 - Ascent Gyne given a mind batterer, to enable easier taking of captives. This affects everyone, and while the cooldown isn't absurd, having no IFF will provide hilarious results for bald Gynes.
 - Basic Ascent shield for individual use added, though not mapped in.
 - Ascent can now produce premade medications, in the same manner as the Skrell. This was intended, but never actually mapped in.
 - Ascent now have gloves for surgical procedures.
 - The Vox now have a bioreactor, which is quite literally just a reskinned Ascent reactor but garbage, until we get an actual bioreactor to replace it. It produces a measly fifteen kilowatts when active, and is primarily for show at the moment.
- - -
Balance:
 - Vox slugs are now much, much more deadly. They're an actual threat, rather than a minor annoyance, as they now inject VB, rather than CB.
 - Psyker for Command now spawns with initial equipment, rather than it sitting in their office. It slightly differs flavour wise depending on the alt title.
 - Jerraman removed from map, as it made no sense within the current lore. It remains in the files for future use, if required admin-wise/event-wise.
 - Vox ship given PDs for their exposed ship areas. They won't actually do much in a full storm, but they're good for random events. If ever. The remainder of the vessel retains its asteroid hull lining.
- - -
Re-additions:
 - Psykers are now once again present within Medical, with four different alt titles.
 - Command Psyker re-opened, though this may change, pending lore dev input.
- - -
Map:
 - Vox vessel given a touch up so it's now lore compliant. No longer are they mouth breathing rejects. Mostly. This change was made to reflect that they're an outer group, scavenging for the Arks and not necessarily pirates or raiders with lack of care for their crew.
