AI now relies on MOVE state for movement.

God damn every one of these changes takes so many tweaks. I definitely didnt factor in the time it would take to deal with Jeff and Tim's messy/broken/unfinished code when I estimate the time it would take to update this project. I should still be able to get the collision avoidance in there before midnight for sure.

+ Sound Effects!

Tonight's update has been a long time coming; sound effects!  Pat and I
took some time last weekend to bring a microphone around the house and
record various doors opening, water pouring, and other odds and ends,
and tonight I poured over Audacity isolating samples, boosting them to a
proper volume, and then importing them into the game.

To be honest, it wasn't as hard as I thought.

As far as Godot goes, the only real issue I ran into was for PickupItem
sound effects; they previously removed themselves from the scene on
pickup, but that _also_ removed their AudioStreamPlayer, meaning their
sound effect would play, but immediately the player would be removed.
It was somewhat perplexing, but after a while scratching my head I
realized what was wrong, and now PickupItems only hide themselves upon
collection (which is effectively the same).

I think the most eye-opening thing was how sounds that were recorded in
one context (a physical object doing something) can easily be given an
entirely different life in a new context; for example, the door opening
sounds I'd intended for the dresser in the bedroom just didn't sound
_right_, and using the squeaker kitchen cabinet samples just _felt_
better - even though the original samples were basically the same sort
of furniture!  For the next round of effects, I'm going to try to think
more creatively about what can produce the type of sound I want, instead
of trying to capture literally the sound a specific object makes.

OnDamageEffects no longer trigger by default for absorbed damage

- new OnDamageEffect interface for ApplyDamageEffect, OpponentApplyDamageEffect, TakeDamageEffect, and OpponentTakeDamageEffect
- by default, the effect will be ignored if the damage was absorbed by an effect like Substitute or Disguise
- all PhysicalContactEffects will not trigger
- Life Orb, Magician, Red Card, Gulp Missile, Rage, Color Change, Illusion, etc will not trigger
- Absorb Bulb and similar items will not trigger
- a Frozen Pokemon behind a substitute will not defrost when hit by a fire move
- some things like SapHealthMoves and Shell Bell already do nothing for no damage and are unchanged (but will not even check now)
- not relevant for effects that take place when the damage puts the Pokemon under half like Berserk or Emergency Exit (since no damage taken here that case is not possible)
- RecoilMoves are an exception to this and will still take recoil damage when damage is absorbed
- Air Balloon is another exception and it will pop
- added ignore conditions to interface gen so that it's easier to skip without creating an entire method that reduces the logic
- getInnerLoop method separated to include declaration by default so each subclass does not need to include that (only Contains sub overrides to not include) which seems MUCH better
- added a bunch of cases to the substitute test
- was originally checking if the damage dealt was zero to determine if damage was being absorbed but was very happy to find out FROM MY RIPEN TEST that this was actually flawed and would fail with things like False Swipe at 1 HP (does not count as absorbed damage and should definitely trigger effects) so that was pretty cool :D

üêõ Fixed night shift toggle in Firefox Nightly. (#1174)

Over in:

 * https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3840
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1281135

I'm trying to come up with a model for `<link rel="stylesheet" disabled>` in
which Blink / WebKit and Firefox can agree on.

See that HTML spec issue for all the inconsistencies of WebKit / Blink, and the
following post for more context:

 * https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/BdgNaChHnpY/mhXzCBwSCgAJ

---

Unfortunately, my change to Firefox breaks the Ghost Admin panel night-mode
switch (you can see it in Firefox Nightly).

This is because with my change, removing the `disabled` attribute from an
stylesheet behaves the same regardless of whether the `disabled` attribute is
added dynamically or not.

That means that adding the `disabled` attribute dynamically "unloads" the
stylesheet completely (just like when the attribute is there before inserting
the link in the document, or from the parser). Thus removing the attribute will
load the stylesheet again and fire a load event.

This is problematic for the code as-is, because it means that each time that the
load event fires when the disabled attribute is removed on an alternate, then
it's added again. :)

Prevent that from happening by removing the load event listener ASAP. What this
code wants is to only resolve the promise once after all.

Given this is so far the only regression from my change that has been reported
(over at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1546707), I think fixing
the Ghost-Admin panel is worth it.

If this pattern is somehow common, then we'll probably revert that patch and go
back to the sad current state of affairs regarding interop :(

Fixed crucial errors to where the package-lock.json needed extra brackets and a comma. Problem inherited from a pull. Fixed an issue I was facing where something about 'apply not being defined' was blocking me from working. After uninstalling and reinstalling NPM packages multiple times, I found the answer that I had to install redux dev-tools extentions for every browser I was using the app on. This is ridiculous and the corresponding packages need to be deleted off the face of the earth. Also inherited from pull. Lastly fixed an annoying CSS bug where the <div className = 'container' </div> in App.js was causing trouble with the grid. I replaced the code with a <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>. PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE UNTIL YOU TALK TO ME. MORE THAN LIKELY, THIS CHANGE HAS TO STAY IN ORDER FOR THE GRID SYSTEM TO WORK. I commented out some code in App.js as well and left a TODO in place so I can remind myself before pushing to master. I also created a styles folder in the pages portion of the src folder. STATUS UPDATE:  I WAS working on the socket.io chat application, however, it seems that the express npm package may be interfering with it's functionality. That has been placed on a small hold until further notice. It would be a wiser choice to figure out the streamers' mongoose models before proceeding with chat anyway.

modpost: file2alias: go back to simple devtable lookup

commit ec91e78d378cc5d4b43805a1227d8e04e5dfa17d upstream.

Commit e49ce14150c6 ("modpost: use linker section to generate table.")
was not so cool as we had expected first; it ended up with ugly section
hacks when commit dd2a3acaecd7 ("mod/file2alias: make modpost compile
on darwin again") came in.

Given a certain degree of unknowledge about the link stage of host
programs, I really want to see simple, stupid table lookup so that
this works in the same way regardless of the underlying executable
format.

op3: Support for OP3 camera modes

 * OnePlus decided that scene modes didn't really mean anything anymore
   and used them for mode switching in their camera HAL. That's fine,
   we can deal with it. And make new ones of our own.
 * This patch will set up a number of useful modes:
    - Auto: no magic besides lowlight fixups
    - ClearShot: the "Super" multi-frame composite algorithm
    - HDR: hipster shit
    - Best Shot: auto-HDR and scene detection
    - ChromaFlash: multi-frame night shot using flash
    - Burst: enables continuous shot mode by long-press shutter

:anger: docs: Add IRC channel + quotes issue to FAQ (closes #255)

This commit addresses the pain point that @Tjzabel hit this past week
when the IRC channel is not escaped by quotes in the `env` file. Since
he is probably not the first or last person this will happen to, this
documents it in our FAQ.

:anger: emoji because this was really frustrating. :joy:

Closes #255.
