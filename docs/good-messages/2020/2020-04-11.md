rebase: reinstate --no-keep-empty

Commit d48e5e21da ("rebase (interactive-backend): make --keep-empty the
default", 2020-02-15) turned --keep-empty (for keeping commits which
start empty) into the default.  The logic underpinning that commit was:

  1) 'git commit' errors out on the creation of empty commits without an
     override flag
  2) Once someone determines that the override is worthwhile, it's
     annoying and/or harmful to required them to take extra steps in
     order to keep such commits around (and to repeat such steps with
     every rebase).

While the logic on which the decision was made is sound, the result was
a bit of an overcorrection.  Instead of jumping to having --keep-empty
being the default, it jumped to making --keep-empty the only available
behavior.  There was a simple workaround, though, which was thought to
be good enough at the time.  People could still drop commits which
started empty the same way the could drop any commits: by firing up an
interactive rebase and picking out the commits they didn't want from the
list.  However, there are cases where external tools might create enough
empty commits that picking all of them out is painful.  As such, having
a flag to automatically remove start-empty commits may be beneficial.

Provide users a way to drop commits which start empty using a flag that
existed for years: --no-keep-empty.  Interpret --keep-empty as
countermanding any previous --no-keep-empty, but otherwise leaving
--keep-empty as the default.

This might lead to some slight weirdness since commands like
  git rebase --empty=drop --keep-empty
  git rebase --empty=keep --no-keep-empty
look really weird despite making perfect sense (the first will drop
commits which become empty, but keep commits that started empty; the
second will keep commits which become empty, but drop commits which
started empty).  However, --no-keep-empty was named years ago and we are
predominantly keeping it for backward compatibility; also we suspect it
will only be used rarely since folks already have a simple way to drop
commits they don't want with an interactive rebase.

+ Cutscenes

Time for another concept art post!

![cutscenes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dorthu/2019-christmas-adventure/master/meta/concept_6.jpg)

Tonight, we started on the cutscenes.  There'll be two; the first will
be at the very beginning, a dream of what happened right before the game
starts to frame the story.  The second happens when you get all the
items and finish the game, and it's already implemented!

The goal here was to take the existing objective framing and bolster it
with some plot.  The opening dialog says "Dad left last night and isn't
back yet" - who's Dad?  Where'd he go?  Why are we worried?  That's what
the dream will cover, at least partially.

When you finish the quests and leave, the exit cutscene is just you
leaving - this game leads into the story of the book Sara's writing, so
the ending cutscene doesn't cover much except giving more resolution
than a dialog box.

Implementing these wasn't actually that bad; I was worried that my
master controller wouldn't like sharing with a cutscene orchestrator,
but with a simple `cutscene_mode` I got it playing nice.

Once these are done, plus a few odds and ends and some mobile polish,
this game is finished.  Very exciting!

"10:05am. Let me resume.

First of all, let me set the expectations - I am not going to be drumming out code right away like I did for these examples.

It is back to the grind for me. I need to figure out the entry points and how the `vscode-languageserver-node` interacts with the editor. I need to go through this stupidly huge pile of boilerplate crap again, though thankfully not all the way from the beginning.

Still, it will take me a bit to grab a handle.

Well, thankfully most of the effort that I need to do this was already done back in February and March. This time it is the finisher.

10:10am. Ok, focus me, focus. Let me just do this.

```
 public listen(connection: IConnection): void {

  (<ConnectionState><any>connection).__textDocumentSync = TextDocumentSyncKind.Full;
  connection.onDidOpenTextDocument((event: DidOpenTextDocumentParams) => {
   let td = event.textDocument;

   let document = this._configuration.create(td.uri, td.languageId, td.version, td.text);

   this._documents[td.uri] = document;
   let toFire = Object.freeze({ document });
   this._onDidOpen.fire(toFire);
   this._onDidChangeContent.fire(toFire);
  });
```

Somehow this is the first thing that greets me when I boot the project up. This is from the `server`. I need the client.

10:25am.

```
export class LanguageClient extends BaseLanguageClient {

 private _serverOptions: ServerOptions;
 private _forceDebug: boolean;
 private _serverProcess: ChildProcess | undefined;
 private _isDetached: boolean | undefined;

 public constructor(name: string, serverOptions: ServerOptions, clientOptions: LanguageClientOptions, forceDebug?: boolean);
 public constructor(id: string, name: string, serverOptions: ServerOptions, clientOptions: LanguageClientOptions, forceDebug?: boolean);
 public constructor(arg1: string, arg2: ServerOptions | string, arg3: LanguageClientOptions | ServerOptions, arg4?: boolean | LanguageClientOptions, arg5?: boolean) {
  let id: string;
  let name: string;
  let serverOptions: ServerOptions;
  let clientOptions: LanguageClientOptions;
  let forceDebug: boolean;
  if (Is.string(arg2)) {
   id = arg1;
   name = arg2;
   serverOptions = arg3 as ServerOptions;
   clientOptions = arg4 as LanguageClientOptions;
   forceDebug = !!arg5;
  } else {
```

Is there anything worse than this style of coding? I doubt it.

What is even the point of overloading in JS? It is much worse at it than langs like C#.

10:30am.

```
 public stop(): Promise<void> {
  return super.stop().then(() => {
   if (this._serverProcess) {
    let toCheck = this._serverProcess;
    this._serverProcess = undefined;
    if (this._isDetached === void 0 || !this._isDetached) {
     this.checkProcessDied(toCheck);
    }
    this._isDetached = undefined;
   }
  });
 }

 private checkProcessDied(childProcess: ChildProcess | undefined): void {
  if (!childProcess) {
   return;
  }
  setTimeout(() => {
   // Test if the process is still alive. Throws an exception if not
   try {
    process.kill(childProcess.pid, <any>0);
    terminate(childProcess);
   } catch (error) {
    // All is fine.
   }
  }, 2000);
 }
```

I can abstract all of this using reactive combinators. The project is huge, but let me just go through `main.ts`. I think by the time this is done, I will get some inspiration.

I've definitely gone in the right direction with my decision to learn reactive programming. I can do this now. I will crush this.

11am.

```
import {
 languages as Languages, Disposable, TextDocument, ProviderResult, Position as VPosition,
 CallHierarchyItem as VCallHierarchyItem, CallHierarchyIncomingCall as VCallHierarchyIncomingCall,
 CallHierarchyOutgoingCall as VCallHierarchyOutgoingCall, CancellationToken, CallHierarchyProvider as VCallHierarchyProvider
} from 'vscode';
```

I am not getting very inspired just going from top to bottom...

No wait, is that cancellation token that I spy? So VS Code itself has it. He really did reimplement in the library for no reason at all.

11:05am.

```
Namespace for participating in language-specific editor features, like IntelliSense, code actions, diagnostics etc.

Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different programming languages.

The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function that can be called with a TextDocument and a Position returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
```

Wow, this really sounds great. It makes me wonder what the need for the thing I am going through even is.

...Enough of this. I am just wasting my time reading the source. This is not something somebody with an IQ of less than 300 can hope to build a model just by reading. I really signaled my will way too much in the last two months. Instead of that, how about use my brain a little and tackle it from a different angle.

```
import {
 languages as Languages, Disposable, TextDocument, ProviderResult, Position as VPosition,
 CallHierarchyItem as VCallHierarchyItem, CallHierarchyIncomingCall as VCallHierarchyIncomingCall,
 CallHierarchyOutgoingCall as VCallHierarchyOutgoingCall, CancellationToken, CallHierarchyProvider as VCallHierarchyProvider
} from 'vscode';
```

My study effort can be made much easier if I just go to reference for all of these and take a look at that. That will tell me what I need.

Let me do this, and then I will I will instead move to studying the `vscode` package.

11:25am.

```
import {
 workspace as Workspace, window as Window, languages as Languages, commands as Commands,  version as VSCodeVersion,
 TextDocumentChangeEvent, TextDocument, Disposable, OutputChannel,
 FileSystemWatcher as VFileSystemWatcher, DiagnosticCollection, Diagnostic as VDiagnostic, Uri, ProviderResult,
 CancellationToken, Position as VPosition, Location as VLocation, Range as VRange,
 CompletionItem as VCompletionItem, CompletionList as VCompletionList, SignatureHelp as VSignatureHelp, SignatureHelpContext as VSignatureHelpContext,
 SignatureHelpProvider as VSignatureHelpProvider, SignatureHelpProviderMetadata as VSignatureHelpProviderMetadata,
 Definition as VDefinition, DefinitionLink as VDefinitionLink, DocumentHighlight as VDocumentHighlight,
 SymbolInformation as VSymbolInformation, CodeActionContext as VCodeActionContext, Command as VCommand, CodeLens as VCodeLens,
 FormattingOptions as VFormattingOptions, TextEdit as VTextEdit, WorkspaceEdit as VWorkspaceEdit, MessageItem,
 Hover as VHover, CodeAction as VCodeAction, DocumentSymbol as VDocumentSymbol,
 DocumentLink as VDocumentLink, TextDocumentWillSaveEvent,
 WorkspaceFolder as VWorkspaceFolder, CompletionContext as VCompletionContext, ConfigurationChangeEvent, CompletionItemProvider, HoverProvider, SignatureHelpProvider, DefinitionProvider, ReferenceProvider, DocumentHighlightProvider, CodeActionProvider, DocumentSymbolProvider, CodeLensProvider, DocumentFormattingEditProvider, DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider, OnTypeFormattingEditProvider, RenameProvider, DocumentLinkProvider, DocumentColorProvider, DeclarationProvider, FoldingRangeProvider, ImplementationProvider, SelectionRangeProvider, TypeDefinitionProvider, WorkspaceSymbolProvider
} from 'vscode';
```

The `client.ts` which 3.6k LOC really imports everything from VS Code doesn't it?

Let me go through the references for this and then I will move to the next part of the plan. I don't need to study `vscode-languageserver-node`. It is the `vscode` package itself which I should have been studying.

Once I get through this all I'll need is to figure out how IPC works for Node which I mostly already know and then I'll be done.

11:40am. Enough. I am done with this.

As it turns out there is no point in going through the references either. `vscode-languageserver-node` is just a giant trap that made me waste weeks of my time. Nothing in there is worth in any way studying. The style is not worth imitating.

What I should set my sights on is `vscode` itself.

11:50am. I had a really good time revisiting WPF, so what I should work is with the editor rather than the incompetent 10k LOC boilerplate library draped over it.

  "test": "cd ../client-tests && npm test && cd ../client",
  "clean": "node ../node_modules/rimraf/bin.js lib",
  "preversion": "npm test"
 }
}
```

Hmm, it does not seem like `vscode` itself is imported like a library. Maybe I'll have to look at the samples again.

In February I started this off by watching those plugin videos. I should return to that again.

The very first thing I need to figure out is how to get basic interaction with the editor going. Just like with WPF, I need to figure out how to set up the project.

Once that is done, then I can start playing with it.

11:55am. Once I get a bit familiar with the API, at that point I can bring in the reactive combinators and start working my magic.

Today, I got off on the wrong foot. And that is exactly what I've been doing consistently for the past two months. I should be able to do much better now.

12pm. Let me take a break here. Today (and for the next few days) the chores will take a while longer than usual.

Once I master this, things will be great. Without a doubt, I will get the pleasure of putting this editor under my control."

BACKPORT: modpost: file2alias: go back to simple devtable lookup

Commit e49ce14150c6 ("modpost: use linker section to generate table.")
was not so cool as we had expected first; it ended up with ugly section
hacks when commit dd2a3acaecd7 ("mod/file2alias: make modpost compile
on darwin again") came in.

Given a certain degree of unknowledge about the link stage of host
programs, I really want to see simple, stupid table lookup so that
this works in the same way regardless of the underlying executable
format.

"12:45pm. Let me do the chores. I'll leave fun for later. Given how shitty my sleep was yesterday, maybe I should pick up another game?

2:40pm. I am back. Yeah, the chores will take a while, probably a week of this to go through left.

Let me catch my breath...

2:45pm. Ok, let me start with something simple - figuring out how to make a project with access to `vscode`.

I have a really low resistance to code monkey style programming. Back in February I tried that ASP.NET book, and in the end I could not even go through the Tic Tac Toe app because there were so many unknowns there.

Skills are built from the bottom up.

Somewhat ironically, the math of today is not like that. It more closely resembles code monkey style programming than anything else.

2:50pm. Let me start. First I'll open that project and then I can start playing with the editor. That is the first step to everything.

3pm. Ok, I refreshed my memory of how to do a regular project. What about `vscode`?

```
import 'vscode';
```

Yeah, this is not passing. Let me take a look at one of the samples. Here `package.json` for `helloword-minimal-sample`.

```
{
 "name": "helloworld-minimal-sample",
 "description": "Minimal HelloWorld example for VS Code",
 "version": "0.0.1",
 "publisher": "vscode-samples",
 "repository": "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/helloworld-minimal-sample",
 "engines": {
  "vscode": "^1.32.0"
 },
 "activationEvents": [
  "onCommand:extension.helloWorld"
 ],
 "main": "./extension.js",
 "contributes": {
  "commands": [
   {
    "command": "extension.helloWorld",
    "title": "Hello World"
   }
  ]
 },
 "scripts": {},
 "devDependencies": {
  "@types/vscode": "^1.32.0"
 }
}
```

Maybe to start with I need to add the `engine` field.

```
 "engines": {
  "vscode": "^1.32.0"
 },
```

The big boilerplate thing had this as well.

3:10pm. No, it is not that...

Let me try the TS version. I have no idea what the deal with this is.

3:15pm. Ok, it seems all I had to do was install the `@types/vscode` and that's it.

Let me try running this with the extension host.

3:25pm. Focus me focus. At any rate, I go to add configuration and it starts downloading C# files.

3:35pm.

```
{
  "name": "hello",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "engines": {
    "vscode": "^1.44.0"
  },
  "description": "",
  "main": "out/index.js",
  "activationEvents": [
    "onCommand:extension.helloWorld"
  ],
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "command": "extension.helloWorld",
        "title": "Hello World"
      }
    ]
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsc-watch --onSuccess \"node out/index.js\"",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/vscode": "^1.44.0"
  }
}
```

I figured out how to set up the task properly. It seems like the newer modules really don't work well with VS Code for some reason.

3:45pm. Ok, I've set up the starter project properly. I know roughly what the various knobs and dials do.

But it will be a long way from here to actually mastering the editor's functionality.

Last time I studied it somewhat nonsensically, but this time I will be able to do it in a more goal directed fashion.

How do I do something that is more like an actual language extension than a command? What do those things in the `vscode` project do? I need to start asking myself those questions for real.

As annoying as it is, I am going to have to go through all the samples from the top.

3:55pm. Actually, the stuff here is pretty interesting now that I have the bare grip on the basics. Even in the hello world example the command was a subscription that returned a disposable. This is a familiar ground to me now.

```
 "activationEvents": [
  "onLanguage:plaintext"
 ],
```

The way the activation for this sample works is quite interesting.

Let me take a little break here and then I'll dive into the sample.

4:35pm. Done with the break. Let me resume.

I've really wasted a lot of time today, but I get the feeling that things are going to get on track with with sample.

4:45pm.

```
 prepareCallHierarchy(document: vscode.TextDocument, position: vscode.Position, token: vscode.CancellationToken): vscode.CallHierarchyItem | undefined {
  let range = document.getWordRangeAtPosition(position);
  if (range) {
   let word = document.getText(range);
   return this.createCallHierarchyItem(word, '', document, range);
  } else {
   return undefined;
  }
 }
```

You know that thing in the boilerplate project where `TextDocument` and stuff with the `Range`s was reimplemented. I recall being impressed at finding something useful there for once, but it turns out that stuff is in the library already. Figures.

4:55pm.

```
class FoodPyramidParser {
 private _model = new FoodPyramid();
```

It escaped my notice, but you can declare variables like this in TS...

Would it also be possible to pass the parameters in the constructor at the top?

Let me check out the book. Or rather the online docs.

...Ah, right, no it is not possible, but what is possible is that special constructor form. I could put it at the top and get mostly the same thing.

5:10pm. I've studied this sample in depth. It is small, it runs fine, and demonstrates a particular functionality of the editor.

I really like this.

5:15pm. This is the introduction to VS Code that I should have had two months ago. I am finally at the level where I can start studying it.

What I want to do now might be a bit strange, but what I feel like doing is to get some practice by reimplementing this sample from scratch. Ideally in Fable or ReasonML. That would be great preparation for what is to come. I suppose TS might be an option as well, but with that the temptation to just copy paste is too much.

Wouldn't I like to do my client in F#/Ocaml? Then learning how to write bindings for the things I need is par the course.

Now...I could go with ReasonML since I have it set up nicely, but since F# is my primary language, I should strive to favor it. It will be a shootout between it and Ocaml in the web arena. I'll go with whoever does the best job with these samples.

5:20pm. Yawn. I can't be getting tired here, but I am.

Despite that, I am definitely going to be putting in some overtime. I am finally pushing through the blocks of the last two months. I had my rematch with WPF and came out victorious. Now come VS Code itself.

I am going to dominate all aspects of programming whether that be reactive programming for UIs, or web development or editor support. I won't make any compromises. The way I am going to program is from the comfort of the languages I like using the style that I've painstakingly developed over the years. That functional style is the most powerful that exists.

5:25pm. So let me forget these samples for a bit. Let me set up Fable, and then I'll try to get a helloworld app with VS Code going with it.

https://fable.io/docs/2-steps/your-first-fable-project.html

Ah, I do not think I need to install anything in particular. Let me try out the templates.

5:35pm. Yeah, the templates work sort of. I have no idea how to run anything from VS. Should I try VS Code + Ionide again? Last time that crash and burned, but the issues I had might be related to those encoding issues I had with Haskell's Stack.

Let me give it another chance.

5:40pm. Everything works great now.

```
module App

open Browser.Dom

// Mutable variable to count the number of times we clicked the button
let mutable count = 0

// Get a reference to our button and cast the Element to an HTMLButtonElement
let myButton = document.querySelector(".my-button") :?> Browser.Types.HTMLButtonElement

// Register our listener
myButton.onclick <- fun _ ->
    count <- count + 1
    myButton.innerText <- sprintf "You clicked: %i time(s)" count
```

Quite nice. The starter project comes with a server that does hot reloading on changes. Let me see what code it produces.

...Uf, I can't see the bundle anywhere.

5:45pm. I've decided. I am going to go with this unless I run into any big problems. Just like I did for everything else, I'll learn Fable and write all my editor support in it. That is the best way to go.

Since it will take me a while to get familiar with Fable, let me leave studying the samples aside for the time being. Just having that call hierarchy sample as a goal is good enough for now.

Let me study the project files just for a bit, and then I'll look at the tutorials.

That means doing webdev in Fable, but I am perfectly fine with that.

6pm. https://fable.io/docs/your-fable-project/project-file.html

Right now I am reading this. There is not much in terms of documentation on the main site, so I'll look for more material after I am done.

Let me finish this today and I will call it a day.

6:05pm. "Note that webpack-dev-server serves the generated files from memory and doesn't actually write to disk. We will do that in the next step: building for production!"

6:10pm. https://fable.io/docs/communicate/js-from-fable.html

This is something I am going to have to know.

6:35pm. https://fable.io/docs/dotnet/compatibility.html

It has all the most important stuff like Dictionaries and HashSets.

Great. Wouldn't get far without that.

6:40pm. https://github.com/kunjee17/awesome-fable

Hmmm, Ionide is built with Fable. It might be worth checking out then.

6:45pm. Maybe tomorrow I should give that Elmish book a try. I was not interested in it before as it was webdev, but now that might be right up my alley.

After that I should check out the Ionide source (since it is a VS Code plugin) and get to work on those samples. Maybe I'll have to ask a bit on how to set things up, but it should be possible without too much difficulty. Still, before I start that I should get more than 1h of experience in this.

It is lunch time. I am done for the day here."

Add cov2D model and list comparing the two current models

One annoying thing that took me a long time was in order to get the cov2d model working, I needed to change

Cov_model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                      optimizer="adam",
                      metrics=['accuracy'])

To :

Cov_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                      optimizer="adam",
                      metrics=['accuracy'])

Which was annoying because python was throwing errors about expecting something about an output? of 1 and it was receiving an output? of 10.
Because of this I thought the model was having issues with either the test and training
data, or the inputs/outputs of the model. Very Frustrating, as it took me all last evening and this morning to noon to figure out.

And now with this commit I find I have to run each model independtly. Or else the conv2D model will fail after its first epoch.

(Wooden Carrot)...
I fixed the absurd damage that the carrot gave you when you ate it and erased the possibility of it murdering you.
Now when you eat the carrot, instead of getting damaged, you get poisoned for a few seconds(ha, fuck you).
I added the possibility of logs into the alchemy recipe.
All of the other stuff Kirderf said up there are left to see later today, I'm tired.

Downgraded, it may work? If not, dependencies will die. I had to manually edit the Cargo.lock to get all the versions to line up, because apparently some of us like to be free spirits and use vastly incompatable versions of dependencies. The free spirits have been squashed for now, but I swear to god if they start doing their own thing again then someone will be in a world of pain, probably me.

v2.4.0.9 update

New:
o Inspiration "Enlightened" - increases consciousness by 50%

Tweaks:
o Inspirations Mining Frenzy, Farming Frenzy, Introspection, Outgoing and Champion have all been increased to last several days
o Champion Inspiration also increases damage mitigation and adds armor penetration
o Wanderer and Wayfarer will start with several random abilities

* Death Retaliation rework - death retaliation for mages was intended to maintain the value of mages by keeping a fully trained mage from being easily captured. This was implemented through a suicide explosion whenever a mage was downed. However, the way it was implemented was poorly depicted and could be frustrating as it gave the player few options. The new implementation keeps the intent for class value, increases the threat enemy mages pose, but gives the player options to evaluate the risk vs reward of capturing mages.
    o Death retaliation now applies to fighter classes and retaliation actions are unique between fighters and mages
    o Death retaliation is no longer instant but is an action a downed mage or fighter can attempt to perform
    o The act of preparing a retaliation ability is now visible and has a random timer that can be anywhere from several seconds to minutes
    o Capturing or killing the mage/fighter before they complete their retaliation will stop the action
    o There are multiple retaliation actions for each class type
        - Mages: death explosion, healing wave, berserk pulse, create Traps, create a small blizzard, create a small firestorm, stunning burst
        - Fighters: create traps, set themselves on fire, ingest dangerous drugs, cause fear
    o New mod options to accompany these changes

Bug fixes:
Priests will always be able to wear bracers of the pacifist
Adjusted criteria for magic circle to prevent new jobs only if the cell is occupied by a haulable resource
Fixed an error when snap freeze or ignite was used too close to the edge of the map
