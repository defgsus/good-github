Some grammar/spelling mistakes (+ Optional notes)

Please, for the love of god make this code more readable. 
1) You don't need an error handler (cooldowns mainly) for every single command.
2) There are SO many if-statements in this code, it's daunting. 
There's probably a bunch of spelling/grammar mistakes I missed, or maybe even made myself, but at least it looks a bit more readable now.

system tests: enable sdnotify tests

Oops. PR #6693 (sdnotify) added tests, but they were disabled
due to broken crun on f31. I tried for three weeks to get a
magic CI:IMG PR to update crun on the CI VMs ... but in that
time I forgot to actually enable those new tests.

This PR removes a 'skip', replacing it with a check that systemd
is running (so we don't try to run on Ubuntu). It also changes
the test image, from fedora:latest to :31, because (sigh) :latest
removed the systemd-notify tool.

WARNING WARNING WARNING: the symptom of a missing systemd-notify
is that podman will hang forever, not even stopped by the timeout
command in podman_run! (Filed: #7316). This means that if the
sdnotify-in-container test ever fails, the symptom will be that
Cirrus itself will time out (2 hours?). This is horrible. I
don't know what to do about it other than push for a fix for 7316.

Add disclaimer for idiot sysops

I pains me that I actually have to say this... but if you do something stupid with the tool, it's your fault, not mine.
