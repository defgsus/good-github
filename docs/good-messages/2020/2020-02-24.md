"4:10pm. That bath washed away some of the tedium. Let me resume.

Let me see if I can at least clear the theoretical parts of the book today, leaving the practical parts for tomorrow.

Then I will follow that video guide from beginning to the end.

4:20pm. 344/546. This async stuff might be of interest to me, but epub is such an awful format for code. I can't copy paste anything and all the formating is messed up. Also all the footnotes break up the flow.

Maybe I should have just gone with the other book.

4:40pm.

```
let url = window.location.href;
const input = document.createElement('input');
input.classList.add('input','URLInput');
input.addEventListener("change", () =>
    url = input.value.toUpperCase()
    );
```

Finally I am doing some actual programming, though I really do not need this book for that.

I am really impressed how autocomplete popped up when I was writing "change" on that last line. TS is using union types here to guide me and that is quite cool. This is some inspired language design.

4:45pm. Ok, the book by Boris Cheny is trash. I am almost through it, but no concrete example are to be found in it. I wasted my time on it. The framework chapter might as not be there at all. Ditto for the example code.

Let me move on to the book by Adam Freeman. If that fails me, what I will do is really start from the beginning and build up my skills that way.

```
export class TodoItem {
    public id: number;
    public task: string;
    public complete: boolean = false;
    public constructor(id: number, task: string, complete: boolean = false) {
        this.id = id;
        this.task = task;
        this.complete = complete;
        }
    public printDetails() : void {
        console.log(`${this.id}\t${this.task} ${this.complete
        ? "\t(complete)": ""}`);
        }
    }
```

Yeah, this seems a lot more promising. This actually starts from some sensible examples.

5:20pm. I am skimming the first chapter of this book and it seems a lot more promising. It does not treat me like a retard and starts with a concrete example that uses a class.

5:25pm. There are plenty of examples accompanying the repo from the book.

That having said, at this point I am honestly too tired. That bath gave me a second spurt, but the attempt I made today wasted most of my energy. I am out of focus.

5:30pm. Reading books is possible the worst way to learn programming. And all of this is tedious shit I mostly know from past experience in different languages. I am literally flushing my time down the drain.

But I'll give going through a book one more try. This time I will have a bunch of examples to chew on.

5:35pm. Hopefully once I get to HTML/CSS/JS that will give me leg up.

6:20pm. Done with lunch. Let me stop here as I said I would. It is time to slack."

Show overflow input values when typing or pulling cursor handle

SUMMARY
Issue: https://khanacademy.atlassian.net/browse/LP-7812

It turns out that if we remove the code that overrides Mathquil's native scrolling logic, the extra scrolly behavior we want (scrolling on cursor handle pull and when the user is typing past the edge of the box) just magically work. For some reason, we still needed to add the `overflow: "scroll"` styles in `override.less` to get manually scrolling to work, but Mathquil can handle the other stuff for us.

So this diff mostly just removes the code that overrides Mathquil's code. That also means removing the `scrollable` prop, which I really should have removed before anyway, since we're now making the input field always scrollable. (Should we be concerned about removing this prop since this is an open source project? I actually don't have any experience with open source, so I really don't know.)

I also updated my code for hiding the cursor handle on scroll since that currently messes up the feature of scrolling by pulling on the cursor handle (for obvious reasons). This isn't actually part of the ticket I set out to do, but since Mathquil is giving it to us for free, why not? It's not perfect though. It works pretty well when scrolling the input field left by pulling on the cursor, but scrolling it right is really janky. So I was thinking of taking the ticket I had for implementing the scroll-on-handle-pull feature and, instead of closing it, updating it to instead say to make this feature better. But since it's already a P3, I don't know if we'll ever get to it, so maybe it's better to just close it? https://khanacademy.atlassian.net/browse/LP-7695

TEST PLAN
Open the expression widget,
type in a whole buncha values,
when you pass the max width of the input field, verify the input field scrolls to show the new values you insert,
verify you can manually scroll left and right by using a track pad, scroll wheel, or by pulling the scroll bar,
tap into the input field,
verify the cursor handle appears,
scroll the field again,
verify the handle disappears,
tap into the field again,
grab the cursor handle,
verify you can pull it around the input field,
pull it off the side of the input field in a direction that has hidden values,
and verify the input field scrolls to show the hidden values.

Merge branch 'work.openat2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs

Pull openat2 support from Al Viro:
 "This is the openat2() series from Aleksa Sarai.

  I'm afraid that the rest of namei stuff will have to wait - it got
  zero review the last time I'd posted #work.namei, and there had been a
  leak in the posted series I'd caught only last weekend. I was going to
  repost it on Monday, but the window opened and the odds of getting any
  review during that... Oh, well.

  Anyway, openat2 part should be ready; that _did_ get sane amount of
  review and public testing, so here it comes"

From Aleksa's description of the series:
 "For a very long time, extending openat(2) with new features has been
  incredibly frustrating. This stems from the fact that openat(2) is
  possibly the most famous counter-example to the mantra "don't silently
  accept garbage from userspace" -- it doesn't check whether unknown
  flags are present[1].

  This means that (generally) the addition of new flags to openat(2) has
  been fraught with backwards-compatibility issues (O_TMPFILE has to be
  defined as __O_TMPFILE|O_DIRECTORY|[O_RDWR or O_WRONLY] to ensure old
  kernels gave errors, since it's insecure to silently ignore the
  flag[2]). All new security-related flags therefore have a tough road
  to being added to openat(2).

  Furthermore, the need for some sort of control over VFS's path
  resolution (to avoid malicious paths resulting in inadvertent
  breakouts) has been a very long-standing desire of many userspace
  applications.

  This patchset is a revival of Al Viro's old AT_NO_JUMPS[3] patchset
  (which was a variant of David Drysdale's O_BENEATH patchset[4] which
  was a spin-off of the Capsicum project[5]) with a few additions and
  changes made based on the previous discussion within [6] as well as
  others I felt were useful.

  In line with the conclusions of the original discussion of
  AT_NO_JUMPS, the flag has been split up into separate flags. However,
  instead of being an openat(2) flag it is provided through a new
  syscall openat2(2) which provides several other improvements to the
  openat(2) interface (see the patch description for more details). The
  following new LOOKUP_* flags are added:

  LOOKUP_NO_XDEV:

     Blocks all mountpoint crossings (upwards, downwards, or through
     absolute links). Absolute pathnames alone in openat(2) do not
     trigger this. Magic-link traversal which implies a vfsmount jump is
     also blocked (though magic-link jumps on the same vfsmount are
     permitted).

  LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS:

     Blocks resolution through /proc/$pid/fd-style links. This is done
     by blocking the usage of nd_jump_link() during resolution in a
     filesystem. The term "magic-links" is used to match with the only
     reference to these links in Documentation/, but I'm happy to change
     the name.

     It should be noted that this is different to the scope of
     ~LOOKUP_FOLLOW in that it applies to all path components. However,
     you can do openat2(NO_FOLLOW|NO_MAGICLINKS) on a magic-link and it
     will *not* fail (assuming that no parent component was a
     magic-link), and you will have an fd for the magic-link.

     In order to correctly detect magic-links, the introduction of a new
     LOOKUP_MAGICLINK_JUMPED state flag was required.

  LOOKUP_BENEATH:

     Disallows escapes to outside the starting dirfd's
     tree, using techniques such as ".." or absolute links. Absolute
     paths in openat(2) are also disallowed.

     Conceptually this flag is to ensure you "stay below" a certain
     point in the filesystem tree -- but this requires some additional
     to protect against various races that would allow escape using
     "..".

     Currently LOOKUP_BENEATH implies LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS, because it
     can trivially beam you around the filesystem (breaking the
     protection). In future, there might be similar safety checks done
     as in LOOKUP_IN_ROOT, but that requires more discussion.

  In addition, two new flags are added that expand on the above ideas:

  LOOKUP_NO_SYMLINKS:

     Does what it says on the tin. No symlink resolution is allowed at
     all, including magic-links. Just as with LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS this
     can still be used with NOFOLLOW to open an fd for the symlink as
     long as no parent path had a symlink component.

  LOOKUP_IN_ROOT:

     This is an extension of LOOKUP_BENEATH that, rather than blocking
     attempts to move past the root, forces all such movements to be
     scoped to the starting point. This provides chroot(2)-like
     protection but without the cost of a chroot(2) for each filesystem
     operation, as well as being safe against race attacks that
     chroot(2) is not.

     If a race is detected (as with LOOKUP_BENEATH) then an error is
     generated, and similar to LOOKUP_BENEATH it is not permitted to
     cross magic-links with LOOKUP_IN_ROOT.

     The primary need for this is from container runtimes, which
     currently need to do symlink scoping in userspace[7] when opening
     paths in a potentially malicious container.

     There is a long list of CVEs that could have bene mitigated by
     having RESOLVE_THIS_ROOT (such as CVE-2017-1002101,
     CVE-2017-1002102, CVE-2018-15664, and CVE-2019-5736, just to name a
     few).

  In order to make all of the above more usable, I'm working on
  libpathrs[8] which is a C-friendly library for safe path resolution.
  It features a userspace-emulated backend if the kernel doesn't support
  openat2(2). Hopefully we can get userspace to switch to using it, and
  thus get openat2(2) support for free once it's ready.

  Future work would include implementing things like
  RESOLVE_NO_AUTOMOUNT and possibly a RESOLVE_NO_REMOTE (to allow
  programs to be sure they don't hit DoSes though stale NFS handles)"

* 'work.openat2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs:
  Documentation: path-lookup: include new LOOKUP flags
  selftests: add openat2(2) selftests
  open: introduce openat2(2) syscall
  namei: LOOKUP_{IN_ROOT,BENEATH}: permit limited ".." resolution

[android][home] 🤖 Add DevMenu on Android (#6829)

# Why

Fixes #6521 

# How

- Created unversioned `DevMenuManager` class which mostly just delegates calls to versioned `DevMenuModule` modules specific for SDK version. These modules are responsible for providing initial props, dev menu options and actions to run when these options are selected. The manager creates a new `ReactRootView` that bases on kernel's (home's) React instance manager and starts `HomeMenu` app which is registered as a second entry point in `home` and then, manager adds this root view to the currently used activity (it must implement `ExperienceActivity`). As I needed to know which experience activity is the current one, I've added `sCurrentActivity` static member to that class and just track it using activity's lifecycle methods.
- Backported `DevMenuModule` to all SDK versions included in the client. Including some changes between them - for example hot and fast reloading.
- Added support for back button and Android's menu press (which can be simulated by `adb shell input keyevent 82`).
- Removed some unused code related to `Nux` and replaced it with new onboarding screen (see #6793).
- Created new `ShakeDetector` which works more like on iOS. The one provided by React Native is annoying in most cases as it actually requires two shakes.
- Updated `ReactAndroidCodeTransformer` to turn off showing React Native dev menu in non-standalone apps.
- **To do after merging:** Rebuild versioned expoviews.

# Test Plan

- [x] Test on experience in debug mode
- [x] Test on experience in production mode
- [x] Test on snacks
- [x] Test on older SDKs
- [x] Test on simulators
- [x] Test that onboarding shows up once you open the experience for the first time or you didn't accept it yet (clicked `Got it` button).
- [x] Test that using dev menu still works once we kill home's activity.
