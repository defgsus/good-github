Finishes unit tests for file_utils and adds unit tests for arc_runner.py

Just more unit tests, only one file left to add tests for then I can begin running the project.
My god though, adding the unit test for evaluate_articles was a huge pain though. I guess
its more of an integration test but it sucked baaaaaaad
