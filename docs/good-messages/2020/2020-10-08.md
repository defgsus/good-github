Update on "Rewrite implementation of faithful cpp signatures"


This rewrite is as per my comments at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/44087#issuecomment-701664506
I did the rewrite by reverting #44087 and then reimplementing it on top.
You may find it easier to review by diffing against master with only #44087
reverted.

There are two main ideas.

First, we now factor cpp argument processing into two phases operating
on three representations of data:

1. `FunctionSchema` - this is the source from native_functions.yaml
2. `Union[Argument, ThisArgument, TensorOptionsArgument]` - this is
   the arguments after doing some basic semantic analysis to group
   them (for TensorOptions) or identify the this argument (if this
   is a method).  There is only ever one of these per functions.
3. `Union[CppArgument, CppThisArgument, CppTensorOptionsArgument]` -
   this is the arguments after we've elaborated them to C++.  There
   may be multiple of these per actual C++ signature.

You can think of (2) as common processing, whereas (3) bakes in specific
assumptions about whether or not you have a faithful or non-faithful
signature.

Second, we now have CppSignature and CppSignatureGroup representing
the *total* public C++ API signature.  So those dataclasses are what
know how to render definitions/declarations, and you no longer have
to manually type it out in the Functions/TensorMethods codegen.

Here is an exhaustive accounting of the changes.

tools.codegen.api.types

- CppSignature and CppSignatureGroup got moved to tools.codegen.api.types
- Add new CppThisArgument and CppTensorOptionsArguments (modeled off
  of ThisArgument and TensorOptionsArguments) so that we can retain
  high level semantic structure even after elaborating terms with C++
  API information.  Once this is done, we can refine
  CppArgument.argument to no longer contain a ThisArgument (ThisArgument
  is always translated to CppThisArgument.  Note that this doesn't
  apply to TensorOptionsArguments, as those may be expanded or not
  expanded, and so you could get a single CppArgument for 'options')
- Add no_default() functional mutator to easily remove default arguments
  from CppArgument and friends
- Add an explicit_arguments() method to CppArgument and friends to
  extract (flat) argument list that must be explicitly written in the signature.
  This is everything except (Cpp)ThisArgument, and is also convenient
  when you don't care about the extra structure of
  CppTensorOptionsArguments

tools.codegen.api.cpp

- group_arguments is back, and it doesn't send things directly to a
  CppSignatureGroup; instead, it moves us from representation (1) to (2)
  (perhaps it should live in model).  Here I changed my mind from my
  PR comment; I discovered it was not necessary to do classification at
  grouping time, and it was simpler and easier to do it later.
- argument got split into argument_not_this/argument/argument_faithful.
  argument and argument_faithful are obvious enough what they do,
  and I needed argument_not_this as a more refined version of argument
  so that I could get the types to work out on TensorOptionsArguments

tools.codegen.api.dispatcher

- Here we start seeing the payoff.  The old version of this code had a
  "scatter" mode and a "gather" mode.  We don't need that anymore:
  cppargument_exprs is 100% type-directed via the passed in cpp
  arguments.  I am able to write the functions without any reference
  to use_c10_dispatcher

tools.codegen.gen

- Instead of having exprs_str and types_str functions, I moved these to
  live directly on CppSignature, since it seemed pretty logical.
- The actual codegen for TensorMethods/Functions is greatly simplified,
  since (1) all of the heavy lifting is now happening in
  CppSignature(Group) construction, and (2) I don't need to proxy one
  way or another, the new dispatcher translation code is able to handle
  both cases no problem.  There is a little faffing about with ordering
  to reduce the old and new diff which could be removed afterwards.

Here are codegen diffs.  For use_c10_dispatcher: full:

```
+// aten::_cudnn_init_dropout_state(float dropout, bool train, int dropout_seed, *, ScalarType? dtype=None, Layout? layout=None, Device? device=None, bool? pin_memory=False) -> Tensor
 Tensor _cudnn_init_dropout_state(double dropout, bool train, int64_t dropout_seed, const TensorOptions & options) {
-    return _cudnn_init_dropout_state(dropout, train, dropout_seed, optTypeMetaToScalarType(options.dtype_opt()), options.layout_opt(), options.device_opt(), options.pinned_memory_opt());
+    static auto op = c10::Dispatcher::singleton()
+        .findSchemaOrThrow("aten::_cudnn_init_dropout_state", "")
+        .typed<Tensor (double, bool, int64_t, c10::optional<ScalarType>, c10::optional<Layout>, c10::optional<Device>, c10::optional<bool>)>();
+    return op.call(dropout, train, dropout_seed, optTypeMetaToScalarType(options.dtype_opt()), options.layout_opt(), options.device_opt(), options.pinned_memory_opt());
 }
```

Otherwise:

```
+// aten::empty_meta(int[] size, *, ScalarType? dtype=None, Layout? layout=None, Device? device=None, bool? pin_memory=None, MemoryFormat? memory_format=None) -> Tensor
 Tensor empty_meta(IntArrayRef size, c10::optional<ScalarType> dtype, c10::optional<Layout> layout, c10::optional<Device> device, c10::optional<bool> pin_memory, c10::optional<MemoryFormat> memory_format) {
-    return empty_meta(size, TensorOptions().dtype(dtype).layout(layout).device(device).pinned_memory(pin_memory), memory_format);
+    static auto op = c10::Dispatcher::singleton()
+        .findSchemaOrThrow("aten::empty_meta", "")
+        .typed<Tensor (IntArrayRef, const TensorOptions &, c10::optional<MemoryFormat>)>();
+    return op.call(size, TensorOptions().dtype(dtype).layout(layout).device(device).pinned_memory(pin_memory), memory_format);
 }
```

Things that I probably did not get right:

- The Union[Argument, TensorOptionsArguments, ThisArgument] and
  the Cpp variants are starting to get a little unwieldy.  Not sure if
  this means I should add a supertype (or at the very least an
  alias); in some cases I do purposely omit one of these from the Union
- Code may not necessarily live in the most logical files.  There isn't
  very much rhyme or reason to it.
- The fields on CppSignature.  They're not very well constrained and
  it will be better if people don't use them directly.
- Disambiguation.  We should do this properly in #44087 and we don't
  need special logic for deleting defaulting for faithful signatures;
  there is a more general story here.

Add helper superclass type to ContentState

Summary:
Here's a fun one: `ContentStateRecord` is of type any, so subclassing `ContentState` from it means our new class can have essentially any method.

If its a method defined in the `ContentState`, its type will respected. If it's not, we'll just assume its there with in/out any. I'm assuming this applies to fields too.

I noticed this because I want to remove a method, but alas, I did and instead of pointing out where the uses are, flow returned the usually-great-but-today-stressful "No Errors!" message. Lovely.

In this diff I'm manually declaring a type for the superclass, so when I remove the method its pointed out by flow. It's full of anys, but it's still better than what we had before.

How do I know this? Because it outright already found bugs. There's callsites with the wrong number of argumetns, there's people calling this methods that don't exist, *sigh*. These are instant exceptions at best, deeply nested, obscure bugs otherwise.

Add the driver

This commit implements the `QldbDriver` and supporting acts. Here's
a high-level overview of what we have:

1. QldbDriver can be built with the QldbDriverBuilder
2. The main API is `transact`, which takes in a function
3. The function has one argument: a Transaction, with it's own API
4. Transactions can execute statements or commit/abort

The driver currently only supports an async API, partially because
that's what Rusuto wants to do under the hood anyways. There is a
BlockingQldbDriver that simply blocks on any futures. However, this
driver still exposes the async-Transaction API. As future work, it'd
be great to have a sync-Transaction API to expose
easy-to-use (blocking) C bindings.

The transact API has some subtleties in the type signature that are
worth flagging. First, the param takes a `Fn(Transaction)` as opposed
to `FnOnce` or `FnMut`. This is because we need to be able to retry
transactions (making 'once' not suitable) and want to encourage
idempotent functions (making 'mut' not suitable). Users *can* work
around idempotency with interior mutability, but that is discouraged.

The next subtly worth calling out is that the Fn must return a special
type that is hard to construct manually. Instead, users use an API on
`Transaction` to commit/abort. These methods take the Transaction by
value, making it hard to incorrectly use the transact method (you need
to call one of them, and you can't call them twice).

The commit digest is a bit of a dance due to ownership. Initially I
tried to have the lambda arg be `&mut Transaction` such that executing
statements could mutate a commit digest in the Transaction. That was a
very sad path to go down, given current limitations in the type
system (notably: GAT support). What I settled on is a model where the
transaction accumulates the digest internally and sends it to the
driver on Drop (via a channel). Beacuse the disposition methods take
the tx by value, this has the neat property of immediately making the
digest available to the driver (which has just await'ed the user fn).

The driver interacts with the pooling and retry functionality to
acquire sessions and retry transactions. Hopefully it does it
correctly because there aren't any meaningful tests yet other than the
example included with this commit, the doctest and my own personal
testing. The reason there aren't yet tests is I'm still thinking
through how I want to go about it. (Spoiler: I don't want mocks.)

A couple of other misc. notes:

1. We only support getting values back as Ion binary
2. Pagination is automatic and blocking (there is no async 'read ahead')
3. The User-Agent includes Rust but it is prepended not appended [1]
