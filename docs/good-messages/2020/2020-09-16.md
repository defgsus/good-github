mm: process_reclaim: Modified the driver to kill processes.

This is marked HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. Use at your own risk.

If you want to test this, ZRAM/SWAP must be enabled!

Background
==========
While playing around with various low memory solutions on Android, like
the stock Android LowMemoryKiller and Sultan's Simple LMK,
I was unsatisfied with the way with which they handled low memory.

Here are my reasons,but I may be wrong/unclear.Please do feel free to correct me.

- Android LMK is too aggressive,but setting minfrees/adjs help to an
  extent.During my testing,I found that LMK depletes swap-pages to 0,
  and a thrashing situation ensues.When this thrashing situation
  continues for a long time,OOM Killer comes into play,and starts
  killing tasks at random.This is undesirable.

- Sultan's SLMK is a bit better,but still aggressive,in the sense that
  it starts to kill tasks even if there is a short memory spike.This is
  undesirable, as there may be a situation wherein many swap pages are
  available,but since tasks are being killed when those memory spikes
  occur,swap pages may not be used as much as they are freed.These kind
  of situations are frequent when using SLMK during my testing.

In short,I was unable to keep many apps open as per the potential of my
device's RAM and ZRAM.The above-mentioned solutions also killed Android
services at random, which proved to be annoying, for example when I had a
music player and apps in the background,the music player would abruptly be
killed.

My objective is to:

- Keep important tasks like Android services running
  until they are closed by the user.

- Kill apps as little as possible,or specifically,killing apps based
  on the total time spent on it.This means that, apps with larger usage
  time get killed more rarely,and apps with lesser usage times get
  killed frequently.

Solution
========
This is my humble(flawed?) attempt at handling a low-memory situation in a
better manner.

I used the Process Reclaim driver as the base for this purpose.
The reason why I used this driver was that,its function was to reclaim
ANONYMOUS(MM_ANON) pages from each scanned task as much as possible(according to per_swap_size),
so that apps never get killed,and memory gets reclaimed in the end.

In theory,this sounds good.While testing though,I ran into a very
serious problem: system freezes.Too much memory pressure and less ANONYMOUS
pages to reclaim rendered the system unusable for a while,which was NOT cool.

Therefore,the only way to prevent these system freezes was to kill some
tasks,but at the appropriate time.This is the approach I took:

- We keep reclaiming pages if they are above defined threshold
  (free_swap_limit).

- Once the swap goes below a percentage(free_percent) above/below the threshold,
  we start to collect tasks to kill.

- We then sort those tasks based on their last accessed (stime+utime),
  and then start killing the tasks with the lowest (stime+utime).We stop
  killing tasks once the number of swap pages are above the threshold
  (free_swap_limit).
  I specifically sorted according to acct_timexpd,see kernel/tsacct.c for
  more details(CONFIG_TASK_XACCT).

So, in theory, this should reclaim ANONYMOUS pages more often, and kill
tasks less,depending on the memory pressure.

Other Changes
=============
- I've renamed some variables in the driver, so that their values don't
  get reset by the values set by the ROM, specifically,
  init.qcom.post_boot.sh

- Removed min_score_adj, I've now added a blacklist of OOM_SCORE_ADJ's
  so that the ones in the blacklist don't get their MM_ANON pages
  reclaimed.This is important,because some running services/apps may
  glitch(this happens rarely).For example, while playing music, I
  experienced crackling sounds at random intervals.

- Added functionality to wake up oom_reaper after killing a task,so that
  once the task is killed,all its pages(?) will be reaped.
  (Taken from the lowmemorykiller.c code)

- Added some code bits from SLMK(marked in the comments).

- Removed traces from the driver.

update SL Acknowledgments

That morning, xxxxxx and I went out together for the 9 AM smoke break.
Neither of us smoke, but she asked if I wanted to do that "thing where
you hold hands and spin around really fast."

Lying still on the ground with the blue and clouds and sun spinning
over me, I heard the attending nurse threaten something about Isolation
Time Out if we didn't settle down.

At lunch, yyyyyy gave me a letter.

    30 August
    Life without you Dan will be dull, because I look forward to seeing
    those beautiful light blue eyes.

    Must you go and leave me Dan?

    I just beginning to relax by hearing your sweet singing and playing
    of the guitar.

    Why Dan, you haven't even seen my son and he's coming sometime
    today. Why not meet him Dan? He'll idolize you. Even clown around and
    love for you to tickle him on his stomach.

    Peace be with you always.

    Love Always,
    yyyyyy

In that she had spent four hours the previous night laughing insensibly,
I considered this letter nothing less than miraculous and thanked her
for it.

xxxxxx and I exchanged lengthy goodbye letters that evening.

   Today's incident outdoors was atypical for me, to say the least.
   Although I pretended not to have enjoyed it (due to being reprimanded
   by the nurse) I was definitely laughing and smiling on the inside.
   For the short moment while we were spinning, I felt free, like I
   didn't have any problems in the world and I wasn't in a psychiatric
   ward. I felt totally at peace. Even the fall was splendid! Thank you!

I left that night feeling very light of spirit.

I'm home now. A few scars and a folder overflowing with the essays,
poems, and prose I wrote are my only tangible ties to those weeks.

While I'm happy with the things I wrote while there, there were surely a
million times I wished I had my camera with me. Sometimes a photo just
makes more sense.

For example, I wanted to take a picture of the nameplate on the door of
Dr. Looney's office. I wanted to take a black and white shot
highlighting the perfectly angular spider web on the black gatepost,
just as I wished I could have captured the scene of zzzzzz in front of
the outdoor smoking area, gazing into the dark night as moonlight poured
through the posts creating an intricate display of shadow around him.

After spinning and falling on Saturday, I laid on the ground for a while
to let my senses stabilize, and I saw a flower that had pushed its way
up between two bricks. It was the color of the sky and the clouds and
vivid August afternoon daydreams. It had the essence of friendship
formed from shared understanding. It felt aware of its evanescence and
knew that it still had so much to show the world. I wish I could have
taken a photograph of it.

I know that doesn't make sense; it's hard to explain, really. I wish I
could show you a photo, but my words will have to suffice for now.

use CRYPTMAN.SHA256String if it's available

Ugly demon creature without a soul wrestles alone in the dark.

     Of what value is a soul?

it keeps the color
within my flesh, without which
I am pronounced dead

    Vivaldi strings, then
    a picnic with strawberries
    under night's cover.

Can we?

    Only without souls.

I'd like that.
