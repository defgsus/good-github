Structural Updates

-Removed 'random shit that has nothing to do with ATTR' and replaced it with Booking/Contact Info.

-Added "Last Updated" thingamajigga as well as a Thank You to GitHub for hosting my sad little website. Lol serously, can't believe this is free. I was on FreeHosting.com before and it was just awful. Constant downtime, problems with the site builder, and then it said 'SSL error, please order THIS EXPENSIVE ASS SSL PACKAGE TO LET YOUR WEBSITE DISPLAY' and I said 'fuck that shit' and so I moved to GitHub. Gotta say, even plain HTML is better than that shit.

General Debugging (#239)

* Added process_completedprocess function

Added process_completedprocess(completedprocess, output) function
to naomi/run_command.py. This transforms a completedprocess object
into a success or error message. This will be used when setting up
a new pocketsphinx installation and for STT training.

* General debugging updates

These are general updates that seem to help Naomi run better for
me. The biggest updates are having the pocketsphinx plugin
automatically download and configure a language model, and a fix
that caused mpdcontrol to fail "I'm sorry, I had some trouble
with that operation..." if keyword is a list rather than a single
value.

Other than that, there are some tweaks to the intent parser. The
word "WHAT" in a request was strongly linked to the LIFE plugin
when using the naomi tti program, so I have reduced the weight
of a word by the number of intents that word appears in, causeing
Naomi to respond with "Life, don't talk to me about life" when
asked "Naomi, what is the weather". I also was having trouble
getting news to run instead of hacker news, so I added the word
"news" to every intent template in the News plugin.

* Move UTF-8 encoding

Instead of having to manually encode each line to UTF-8 as it is
added, which is difficult and error prone, just add each line as
a string, then convert the whole thing to UTF-8 as the response
is about to be returned to the web server.

* Intent Verification

In this commit, I am adding the ability to see and verify the
intent that Naomi selected to respond to your query.

I also have made a number of minor bug fixes as I am testing.

NaomiSTTTrainer.py - added the ability to view and verify the intent
selected by Naomi. This isn't currently used for training purposes,
but I envision adding templates based on what the user actually says
and possibly also modifying the intent weights.

naomi/__main__.py - added an option allowing the user to set Naomi
to "listen while talking". This is because I have a couple of
microphone hats that cause Naomi to react to its own voice. When
using headphones, this is not a problem. It also seems to be less
of an issue when using an integrated USB sound card like a USB
conference phone. But for right now, I am making the default to
not listen while talking. I have had a couple of thoughts, such as
only reacting to the keyword "stop" when talking.

naomi/app_utils.py - wrapped the "is_negative()" and "is_positive()"
regex in gettext so different filters can be set for different
languages.

naomi/application.py - use profile.set_arg() to store the state of
several settings, so I have access from any module without manually
passing the values through.

naomi/brain.py - store intent and score while processing a request.

naomi/mic.py - say() can be synchronous or asynchronous depending
on whether you want Naomi to listen while talking.

plugins/speechhandler/life/life.py - fix an issue with the Fourty
Two answer (return string instead of list)

plugins/speechhandler/shutdownplugin/shutdown.py - Clean up
correctly before exiting whether or not "mic.say()" is synchronous.

plugins/tti/naomi_tti/naomi_tti.py - added a list of words to ignore
when weighting intents. Cleaned up some debugging output.

plugins/vad/snr_vad/snr_vad.py - Changed the threshold for stopping
recording to 1/2 the distance betweeen mean and threshold. This was
because I notice that I usually start talking loudly, but then lose
volume towards the end of my request, causing the end to get cut
off. I think this is because my Naomi has an LED light that indicates
when it is listening, and when I can see that I have Naomi's
attention I stop speaking so forcefully. This sometimes resulted
in the last few words of a request not being heard.

* Codacy complaints

Fixed a few trailing whitespaces and naked excepts.

* Skipped plugin reporting

Report skipped speechhandler plugins, but don't report other types
of plugins that are probably being skipped because they just
haven't been set up.

## [mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language)@[c483ba5f8c...](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language/commit/c483ba5f8c572c0f328c722371122741e04eaa6c)
#### Thursday 2020-03-19 10:57:32 by Marko Grdinić

"8:30am. I have arisen from sleep. Let me rest for a bit before I start.

8:45am. Today I really want to put some effort into learning the typechecker.

9:05am. Ok, it is time to start. I am really out of things to entertain myself at this point, so I might as well take advantage of that to focus on my work.

9:15am.

```
typeCheckModule (Module ss coms mn decls (Just exps)) =
  warnAndRethrow (addHint (ErrorInModule mn)) $ do
    modify (\s -> s { checkCurrentModule = Just mn })
    decls' <- typeCheckAll mn exps decls
    checkSuperClassesAreExported <- getSuperClassExportCheck
    for_ exps $ \e -> do
      checkTypesAreExported e
      checkClassMembersAreExported e
      checkClassesAreExported e
      checkSuperClassesAreExported e
    return $ Module ss coms mn decls' (Just exps)
```

Let me see if I can crack this.

```
s { checkCurrentModule = Just mn }
```

This is Haskell's record update syntax I think.

9:20am.

```
-- |
-- Type check all declarations in a module
--
-- At this point, many declarations will have been desugared, but it is still necessary to
--
--  * Kind-check all types and add them to the @Environment@
--
--  * Type-check all values and add them to the @Environment@
--
--  * Bring type class instances into scope
--
--  * Process module imports
--
typeCheckAll
  :: forall m
   . (MonadSupply m, MonadState CheckState m, MonadError MultipleErrors m, MonadWriter MultipleErrors m)
  => ModuleName
  -> [DeclarationRef]
  -> [Declaration]
  -> m [Declaration]
typeCheckAll moduleName _ = traverse go
```

I do not know for how long will I feel like doing this - I already miss F#, but either way I am going to do my best here.

I have no intention of spending too long on studying how typechecking is done. Either way I am going to have to find my own spin on it, so it is not like I am reliant on this to figure out how it should be done. I am already getting sidetracked from my goal of figuring out how to do IDE support.

9:20pm.

```
  go :: Declaration -> m Declaration
  go (DataDeclaration sa@(ss, _) dtype name args dctors) = do
    warnAndRethrow (addHint (ErrorInTypeConstructor name) . addHint (positionedError ss)) $ do
      when (dtype == Newtype) $ checkNewtype name dctors
      checkDuplicateTypeArguments $ map fst args
      ctorKind <- kindsOf True moduleName name args (concatMap (fmap snd . dataCtorFields) dctors)
      let args' = args `withKinds` ctorKind
      addDataType moduleName dtype name args' dctors ctorKind
    return $ DataDeclaration sa dtype name args dctors
```

You know what, I really do not like this code. With the VS Code project, I could blame it all on Dirk for failing to take advantage of OO capabilities of TS, but here the problem is entirely Haskell.

This code is exceptionally ugly. 5/10 at most.

The best aesthetic quality of any code that I've seen is by Pharo.

9:30am.

```
  go (d@(DataBindingGroupDeclaration tys)) = do
    let tysList = NEL.toList tys
        syns = mapMaybe toTypeSynonym tysList
        dataDecls = mapMaybe toDataDecl tysList
        bindingGroupNames = ordNub ((syns^..traverse._2) ++ (dataDecls^..traverse._3))
        sss = fmap declSourceSpan tys

        checkDuplicateTypeArguments $ map fst args
        let args' = args `withKinds` ctorKind

```

...I do not feel like studying this at all.

```
-- | Run a computation in the typechecking monad, starting with an empty @Environment@
runCheck :: (Functor m) => StateT CheckState m a -> m (a, Environment)
runCheck = runCheck' (emptyCheckState initEnvironment)

-- | Run a computation in the typechecking monad, failing with an error, or succeeding with a return value and the final @Environment@.
runCheck' :: (Functor m) => CheckState -> StateT CheckState m a -> m (a, Environment)
runCheck' st check = second checkEnv <$> runStateT check st
```

`runCheck` is just this.

Yeah, I am at a loss here. This Haskell stuff is too much for me. I guess you can only learn so much by reading code.

Let me go back to my original plan - learning about IDE support.

That is what I should be doing.

9:45am. Typeclasses are such a pain in the ass. I need them, but they are troublesome. They will take some effort to figure out.

I am thinking about them in the background, and it is hell to get a handle on them.

Well, focus me. Let me go back to the commands and see what `ide server` is doing.

10am.

```
startServer :: Network.PortNumber -> IdeEnvironment -> IO ()
startServer port env = Network.withSocketsDo $ do
  sock <- listenOnLocalhost port
  runLogger (confLogLevel (ideConfiguration env)) (runReaderT (forever (loop sock)) env)
  where
    loop :: (Ide m, MonadLogger m) => Network.Socket -> m ()
    loop sock = do
      accepted <- runExceptT (acceptCommand sock)
      case accepted of
        Left err -> $(logError) err
        Right (cmd, h) -> do
          case decodeT cmd of
            Just cmd' -> do
              let message duration =
                    "Command "
                      <> commandName cmd'
                      <> " took "
                      <> displayTimeSpec duration
              logPerf message $ do
                result <- runExceptT $ do
                  updateCacheTimestamp >>= \case
                    Nothing -> pure ()
                    Just (before, after) -> do
                      -- If the cache db file was changed outside of the IDE
                      -- we trigger a reset before processing the command
                      $(logInfo) ("cachedb was changed from: " <> show before <> ", to: " <> show after)
                      unless (isLoadAll cmd') $
                        void (handleCommand Reset *> handleCommand (LoadSync []))
                  handleCommand cmd'
                liftIO $ catchGoneHandle $ BSL8.hPutStrLn h $ case result of
                  Right r  -> Aeson.encode r
                  Left err -> Aeson.encode err
              liftIO (hFlush stdout)
            Nothing -> do
              $(logError) ("Parsing the command failed. Command: " <> cmd)
              liftIO $ do
                catchGoneHandle (T.hPutStrLn h (encodeT (GeneralError "Error parsing Command.")))
                hFlush stdout
          liftIO $ catchGoneHandle (hClose h)
```

```
handleCommand cmd'
```

This last thing is what I should study. The rest seems to be random server stuff.

I can't believe I am going to say this, but I actually want to go back to studying Typescript code. Monadic code is not high quality code. It was fun for a bit, but reading this is just tedious.

The `handleCommand` is in the IDE folder. Let me go take a look at what it does.

```
-- | Accepts a Command and runs it against psc-ide's State. This is the main
-- entry point for the server.
handleCommand
  :: (Ide m, MonadLogger m, MonadError IdeError m)
  => Command
  -> m Success
handleCommand c = case c of
  Load [] ->
    -- Clearing the State before populating it to avoid a space leak
    resetIdeState *> findAvailableExterns >>= loadModulesAsync
  Load modules ->
    loadModulesAsync modules
  LoadSync [] ->
    findAvailableExterns >>= loadModulesSync
  LoadSync modules ->
    loadModulesSync modules
  Type search filters currentModule ->
    findType search filters currentModule
```

It goes on for another 40 lines. Actually I do gain something from this - as I thought having commands internally really is better than having a direct line to the JSON.

Where are those commands coming from though.

```
case decodeT cmd of
```

From here. It just decodes some text.

Very well.

Let me go back to studying `handleCommand`.

Once I am done studying the IDE stuff, I will study the Purescript VS Code plugins.

10:20am. Focus me, focus. Stop reading the Haskell sub.

```
  CaseSplit l b e wca t ->
    caseSplit l b e wca t
```

CaseSplit is a thing? I don't think that the VS Code plugin supports it.

...

It is long, but let me paste the whole thing here.

```
-- | Accepts a Command and runs it against psc-ide's State. This is the main
-- entry point for the server.
handleCommand
  :: (Ide m, MonadLogger m, MonadError IdeError m)
  => Command

handleCommand c = case c of
  Load [] ->
    -- Clearing the State before populating it to avoid a space leak

                    && identifierFromIdeDeclaration (discardAnn d) == ident) decls of
          Nothing -> throwError (GeneralError "Declaration not found")
          Just declaration -> do
            let sourceModule = fromMaybe moduleName (declaration & _idaAnnotation & _annExportedFrom)
            UsagesResult . foldMap toList <$> findUsages (discardAnn declaration) sourceModule
  Import fp outfp _ (AddImplicitImport mn) -> do
    rs <- addImplicitImport fp mn
    answerRequest outfp rs

    rs <- addQualifiedImport fp mn qual
    answerRequest outfp rs
  Import fp outfp filters (AddImportForIdentifier ident qual) -> do
    rs <- addImportForIdentifier fp ident qual filters
    case rs of
      Right rs' -> answerRequest outfp rs'
      Left question ->
        pure (CompletionResult (map (completionFromMatch . simpleExport . map withEmptyAnn) question))
  Rebuild file actualFile targets ->
    rebuildFileAsync file actualFile targets

    rebuildFileSync file actualFile targets
  Cwd ->
    TextResult . T.pack <$> liftIO getCurrentDirectory
  Reset ->
    resetIdeState $> TextResult "State has been reset."
  Quit ->
    liftIO exitSuccess
```

This whole thing is a lot more similar to a REPL than I thought it would be. I had this sense that IDE functionality is linked to the REPL functionality when I save the GHC Simple plugin, but now the evidence of a deeper connection is overwhelming to me.

Instead of IDE support, maybe I should be working on a REPL instead?

10:30am. Let me check out the REPL as well.

10:40am. My motivation to study this is quite low.

I am done with the Purescript compiler.

I am such an unreliable narrator it seems. I said I was going to do this for months, but I barely did it for two days. Instead what I will do here is start studying the plugins.

10:45am. That is what I really want to do. Let me take just short break. I need to gather my thoughts before I start studying `purescript-language-server`. Now that I know that the IDE just takes the above commands, I can move forward.

The REPL is more complex than the IDE support because it actually needs the capability to run the code written via Node.

10:50am. Ok...

```

```

Here are the dependencies on the JS side. What is `vscode-uri`.

11:45am. Let me stop here. My focus is low at the moment and I am just skimming the files rather than studying them. Let me build this thing so I have editor support.

At any rate, I've gone though all the files in the main folder, but it is tough going. I am not going to be able to go around needing to understand what the VS Code plugin does.

11:50am. So what I need to aim is to get a grasp for the rest.

So far, I hadn't gotten as much out of Purescript as I thought I would. I've already spent a week on it too.

I need to get going. I need to study the plugin itself.

11:55am. I am going to do this. I am going to absolutely master this and start work on Spiral in April.

As time goes, I am running out of patience. I am going to get what I can and run with it. The rest, I will make on my own."

Add ImageButton to style.kv

I essentially use this in ALL my projects. It would be a shame not to include it out of the box.
The only drawback in making it a dynamic class, is the lack of documentation/discoverability... If you think it should be a full-blown class then so be it!

More to the point of the "why" - I remember my early Kivy days (when behaviors weren't even a thing), I used the normal Button, set border to `(0, 0, 0, 0)` and changed `background_normal` and `background_down` to the SAME image. On all my buttons (until I discovered dynamic classes). You can see how it "feels" like excessive boilerplate for a framework like Kivy.
How hard can it be to make "an image as button" for a beginner who doesn't know about behaviors or dynamic classes?
How do you think they feel when their image is totally distorted because they didn't realize the Button background is a BorderImage and they need to set all borders to zero?
How do you think they feel when they find out the "complex" case (having a border image) takes as many lines to address as the simple one (just an image as button)?
When giving support to such users, wouldn't it be easier and faster to say "just use ImageButton, set the source, and do what you want in on_press"? :-)

Thanks for reading!

"1:15pm. Done with breakfast and chores. What is next on the list?

1:30pm. Let me start this thing.

First of all, let me go through all the files top to bottom.

That will give me an idea of what I need to do.

...

The editor support for Purescript is actually quite bad. What the hell?

1:35pm.

```
      startPscIdeServer = do
        liftEffect $ logError Info "Starting IDE server"
        rootPath <- liftEffect $ (_.root <<< unwrap) <$> Ref.read state
        settings <- liftEffect $ Ref.read config
        startRes <- startServer' settings rootPath logError logError
        retry logError 6 case startRes of
          { port: Just port, quit } -> do
            loadAll port >>= case _ of
              Left msg -> liftEffect $ logError Info $ "Non-fatal error loading modules: " <> msg
              _ -> pure unit
            liftEffect $ Ref.modify_ (over ServerState $ _ { port = Just port, deactivate = quit }) state
          _ -> pure unit
```

Hover the cursor over the locals and you won't get any type feedback. Actually the editor support here is worse than even for Haskell.

1:40pm.

```
  onCompletion conn $ runHandler "onCompletion" getTextDocUri (getCompletions documents)
  onDefinition conn $ runHandler "onDefinition" getTextDocUri (getDefinition documents)
  onDocumentSymbol conn $ runHandler "onDocumentSymbol" getTextDocUri getDocumentSymbols
  onWorkspaceSymbol conn $ runHandler "onWorkspaceSymbol" (const Nothing) getWorkspaceSymbols

  onReferences conn $ runHandler "onReferences" (const Nothing) (getReferences documents)
  onHover conn $ runHandler "onHover" getTextDocUri (getTooltips documents)
  onCodeAction conn $ runHandler "onCodeAction" getTextDocUri (getActions documents)
  onShutdown conn $ fromAff stopPscIdeServer
```

Ffffhhhhh...

1:45pm. Somehow the Purescript code seems cleaner, but `Main.purs` is killing me. Let me check out the other files. I'll conclude this thing very soon. I am at my limit here.

1:55pm. No, this is not going for me.

Once more let me switch to the next phase.

I can't use this as a template after all. It is too complicated.

I have gained something from this Purescript adventure, but I can't quite grab the thing that I want.

2pm. It is a struggle. I start playing with code and get into it, but now that I am just reading things I am out like a candle once again.

I guess it does not matter what the language is. It is too much to expect to learn just by reading. One has to develop on his own.

In terms of how complete my plan is - on the F# side, the details of the IDE implementation are well known to me. The server itself won't be the problem.

The thing that is still a problem for me is this thing I am writing on - VS Code.

Yes - I know I can just use those handles and move from there, but there is no way I could ever be satisfied with such a meager amount of understanding.

Understanding the PS plugin and compiler implementation might not be necessary, but I definitely need to understand the editor itself. Everything else I can wing.

2:05pm. Right now, let me stop here for a while. I need to do some more chores."

SUSE2013 CSS: End the negative margin insanity

It does feel good to close so many awful home-made margin issues at
once. Thank you, ::before. (IE 10 only knows :before, not the standard
::before, but at this point I am hoping nobody is using it anymore.)

This fix is not perfect (e.g. does not work properly for figures),
but much better than what we had before.

This kills the "scroll-to-ID" animation we used to have, leaving only
the animation for the "Top" (of page) button intact. It's not
super-compatible with the :target::before code and I did not want to
investigate too much more. Since this whole functionality was broken for
the past 2+ years anyway, I am guessing nobody will mind.

This also fixes :target highlighting in parts that were broken much
before.

"2:30pm. I am back. Let me resume.

Let me gather my thoughts. So I did gain some things like package management.

Why those wrappers are so complex is still a mystery to me, but no doubt I will run into that complexity when I start doing things. Once that happens, I am going to have to look into reactive programming in order to make things easier. If I do all the state management explicitly things will be very difficult.

Just note how shitty PS's editor support is. Or how long it took Haskell to reach even its current mediocre level.

In modern programming, editor support is the most important thing there is apart from the language itself and package management. Those 3 are the holy trinity of modern PL design.

Nothing less than perfection will suffice here.

2:35pm. But I need a break at this point, I've been reading code non-stop like a maniac.

Just for the kicks, let me do that HackerRank problem in Typescript. In TS I should have no problem getting that queue.

```
bignumber.js, jquery, lodash, underscore, request, axios
```

Here are the JS libraries HR allows. Hmmm...all of these sound like web libraries to me. That won't be useful.

https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v13.x/docs/api/

These things are mostly web stuff too.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1590247/how-do-you-implement-a-stack-and-a-queue-in-javascript

Oh, the arrays can be used as queues. This is nice.

```
I would advise caution in using queue.shift. IIRC it is not O(1), but O(n) and might be too slow if the queue gets large.
```

Ah, goddamit.

2:45pm. Forget this.

https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/bring-your-haskell-types-to-reason
"React was originally developed in StandardML (a cousin of OCaml), and React features like immutability and prop types feel a little foreign in JavaScript, but they are right at home in Reason."

Hmmm, really. I had no idea.

2:50pm. Let me read this and then I will propely move to the next step. I know I am being indecisive here, but pivoting is not that easy.

...And Kengan Omega...

2:55pm. Now let me start.

Let me go back to `vscode-languageserver-node`. I have a decent grasp of `rpcjson` and `protocol`.

I skimmed the `server` project. That means what I have to focus on would be `client`. And indeed that thing is the most important part of everything.

I have nothing better to do right now.

Let me study that.

3:05pm.

```
namespace Transport {
 export function isSocket(value: Transport): value is SocketTransport {
  let candidate = value as SocketTransport;
  return candidate && candidate.kind === TransportKind.socket && Is.number(candidate.port);
 }
}
```

It is up to its usual tricks here.

3:10pm.

```
 private checkProcessDied(childProcess: ChildProcess | undefined): void {
  if (!childProcess) {
   return;
  }
  setTimeout(() => {
   // Test if the process is still alive. Throws an exception if not
   try {
    process.kill(childProcess.pid, <any>0);
    terminate(childProcess);
   } catch (error) {
    // All is fine.
   }
  }, 2000);
 }

 protected handleConnectionClosed() {
  this._serverProcess = undefined;
  super.handleConnectionClosed();
 }
```

This stuff is so verbose compared to Haskell.

3:10pm. https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredly.reason-vscode

It might be worth looking into Ocaml plugins since Haskell is not my cup of tea.

I'll leave that for later. Right now, I should just focus on the Typescript extension. I do not want to waste anymore time.

3:20pm.

```
  let json: NodeModule | Executable;
  let runDebug = <{ run: any; debug: any; }>server;
  if (runDebug.run || runDebug.debug) {
   if (this._forceDebug || startedInDebugMode()) {
    json = runDebug.debug;
   } else {
    json = runDebug.run;
   }
  } else {
   json = server as NodeModule | Executable;
  }
```

I know that at this point one could expect me to throw mud at this code, but for all its faults this low level style of programming does have a lot of merit to it. If it were something like the style I usually use in F# or Spiral, they it would have the ideal tradeoff between verbosity and readability.

It just just impossible that monadic code Haskell favors is in any shape or form close to optimal. The fact that thing took off and got a reputation for reliability is nothing more than a bad meme.

```
 private _getServerWorkingDir(options?: { cwd?: string }): Promise<string | undefined> {
  let cwd = options && options.cwd;
  if (!cwd) {
   cwd = this.clientOptions.workspaceFolder
    ? this.clientOptions.workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath
    : this._mainGetRootPath();
  }
  if (cwd) {
   // make sure the folder exists otherwise creating the process will fail
   return new Promise(s => {
    fs.lstat(cwd!, (err, stats) => {
     s(!err && stats.isDirectory() ? cwd : undefined);
    });
   });
  }
  return Promise.resolve(undefined);
 }
```

I can hate that this is not written in SML family language, but I cannot be arrogant here. I can look down on other people, but I cannot forget - I cannot rival the collective effort of the programming community. There is only so much one person can do.

Had I been doing all this from the start, I might have been able to do a better job thanks to my talent, but can I really compare to the years of effort this guy put into it?

3:25pm. If you want to really crush other programmers, then you need a good idea. Will on its own is not enough.

Even I can't believe myself when I say I will cut this all down. Who has the time for all of this? I don't. The energy is not there. It is just my ego talking when I say I will.

The post-humans will have the power to do it all on their own though. For them toil won't be a curse, but a blessing. I envy them so much for that.

3:35pm.

```
super(id, name, clientOptions);
```

Damn, this thing leads to something big.

4pm. Right now I am still going through `client.ts`. The thing is 3.5k LOC long. At this point I can't tell at all whether the guy writing this is good or not. With `rpcjson`, things were more clear cut to me, but this thing...

Well, it is fairly well isolated from the rest, while being complete, so I do not necessarily have to understand the things under it.

4:15pm. Let me stop with `client.ts` file for a bit. It got me into the mindset of reading TS, but anymore of this and I am going to be here forever.

Let me take a look at the other files.

4:20pm. Done.

Let me gather my thoughts.

As I said, I can't make heads or tails of this. I might be able to use it, but modify it - never.

This thing is just a giant wrapper.

An idea is coming to me. I've really focusing on the vscode plugin, but if I were doing my own thing...should I not focus on the editor itself.

Even though I've been studying this for so long where do the editor events themselves come into the picture?

4:30pm. That is one question.

Eventually, when it comes to doing the trace, I will want to do that line thing similar to how DrRacket does it and I'll be in a bad position if I rely on the library without knowing the fundamentals...which I still don't.

...

To be fair, I think I could do IPC without a problem now, but the client and server stuff is still escaping me.

But before I study the editor itself - how about I check out ReasonML?

The thing has a native server. A few years ago when I tried Ocaml, editor support was awful, but that might have improved by this point.

https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/installation

Let me go on another adventure.

To me the most ideal situation would be if I could do the VS Code client in F# or Ocaml. That would be truly divine. I kind of don't trust F# when it comes to language interop, but it is not like I really gave this a try either.

4:35pm. It is not that I strictly cannot do what I want, but I still do not have strong feelings on the right way server and clients should be done. Purescript gave me some insights (especially around package management) but I haven't really gotten the release I wanted for the things I need.

4:40pm. First of all, should I use `npm` or `yarn`. What is the point of having two package managers?

https://www.positronx.io/yarn-vs-npm-best-package-manager/

This article has so many grammar errors. It feels like filler.

https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/etdrfj/introducing_yarn_2/

https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/e8o8oz/should_you_choose_npm_or_yarn/

4:55pm. Nevermind `yarn`. The stuff I am reading there is not very conclussive and are impressions based on what `npm` was in the past. The most surprising thing was that `npm` is supposedly a headache on Windows. So far, it worked quite well for me. Certainly compared to `stack`!

`npm install -g bs-platform`

Let me just run this.

4:55pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/editor-plugins

```
VSCode: Recommended. Use reason-vscode from the extensions marketplace.
```

Confusingly, there is also a `vscode-reason` which has been discontinued.

```
Browser Extension: Reason-tools
Reason-tools lets you quickly toggle between OCaml syntax and Reason syntax when you're browsing tutorials and documentations written in either syntax.
```

5pm. It has installed. Let me give it a try.

Oh, I just noticed that VS Code has a NPM scripts tab. That is nice.

5:05pm.

```
Js.log("Hello, BuckleScript and Reason!");
```

Both this and the plugin work. The compilation is quite fast. It is amazing how you can tell the difference just at startup. With the Purs compiler it required half a second just to start up.

Er, what do I do here?

I can't just dive straight into the plugin. Since I am using Ocaml for the first time in my life, how about I take the opportunity to do the same thing I did with Purescript?

Yeah, that is more time spent on nothing, but Ocaml and F# support exactly the kind of programming style I am a master of. I expect to really be at home here.

5:20pm. Had to take a little break. It gave me time to think.

And I think I should study Bucklescript. I can't assume that it is a part of the Ocaml compiler.

Considering that it produces readable JS code that implies that I do not have to worry about optimization or runtime code in the codebase. Considering how fast it is, I can expect that it is lean under the hood.

And it has this plugin. As a language it meets all of my requirements.

Since it is close to home, why don't I give it the same respect I alloted Purescript?

For all I know, it might not be reusing any of the Ocaml legacy code. It could be a fresh rewrite.

5:25pm. My moves are really haphazard, I know. But there isn't really any concrete way of learning something. I am not the kind of genius that can tell myself learn this or that.

If I made a mistake, then that mistake would be that I did not go for Bucklescript from the start.

5:30pm. This should be fun. Instead of TS, maybe I will give it a try at doing that HR problem in Reason.

Let me start learning this thing. First I will go through various tutorials, get familiar with compilation of this language, and then I will dive under the hood.

https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/let-binding

Ah, block scope. I missed this to an incredible degree in TS. I would (and will) move to Bucklescript just for this.

5:40pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/mutation

Yeah, this is the way mutation should be done. Period. I missed this. This is the language that I know and love in different clothing.

https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/type

The documentation is nice. As far as learning Reason goes, I think this will be all that I need.

5:45pm.

```
let add = a => b => a + b
```

Hmm, is there no difference between the above and...

```
let add = (a, b) => a + b
```

It seems there isn't. The compiler uncurries it automatically. Now I recall, when I first saw this this made me think that Reason is for amateurs. But I suppose in a language that does not do partial evaluation, this way might be better. Especially considering JS interop needs. Still, there should be some way to write out a function in curried form right?

https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/string-and-char#string-interpolation-unicode

This is interesting.

6pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/string-and-char#char
"Don't use it. Char doesn't support proper internationalization (unicode or UFT-8), and most of the time you've better served by either a string or a variant."

Yeah, maybe I should get rid these out of Spiral as well.

```
let greeting = "Hello"
let score = 10
let newScore = score + 10

let add = (a, b) => {
    let q = 4
    a + b + q
    }

let y = add(1, 2)

Js.log({j|$greeting - the score is $newScore|j});
```

It is great that it has indentation sensitivity, so I won't have to put in semicolons everywhere.

```
let add = (a, b) => {
    let q = 4 a + b + q
    }
```

Er, this works too. So it is not indentation sensitive, but merely comes out of parsing like that. Well it is fine.

I'll just program in the way I am accustomed to.

6:05pm. Oh, it has structural equality with `==`. This is great.

This is something that I tried earlier in TS and did not get.

6:15pm.

```
type student = {
    age : int,
    name : string
}

let age = 12
let name = "Sarah"
let {age, name} = {age, name}
```

Unlike F#, and like Spiral, Reason allows record punting. Wonderful.

6:15pm.

```
let age = 12
let name = "Sarah"
let School.{age, name} = School.{age, name}
```

FIlenames serve as modules. Wonderful. Exactly what I had in mind for Spiral.

6:25pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/record#design-decisions

```
After reading the constraints in the previous sections, and if you're coming from a dynamic language background, you might be wondering why one would bother with record in the first place instead of imitating JS and use a catch-all object concept for everything.

The reason is that JavaScript objects can be really slow. Some code might add fieds, remove fields, iterate over them, pass the keys themselves somewhere else, etc. The JS engines nowadays try to "guess" your object's usage patterns and sometime optimize that into a solid C++ struct, but some other time fail to do so and convert your overly dynamic object into a hash map, with a sudden >100x performance degradation (imagine an object field access needing to hash the key and traverse the hashmap to find it).
```

This is interesting.

https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/variant

> Behold, the crown jewel of Reason data structures!

Yes, yes! I am totally into this! Fuck monads!

6:45pm.

```
let add = (x, y) => x + y
let addFive = add(5)
let eleven = addFive(6)
let twelve = addFive(7)
```

Yeah, this works.

So this is how currying is done. It does do some optimization after all. I don't mind this at all.

6:55pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/pipe-first

Let me stop here as I am tired. I've gone through half the basics section at this point, and maybe a third of the documentation.

I am getting deja vu as I say this, but I have a good feeling about this. Both good languages and good tooling should be simple, and I sense a focus on simplicity that Purescript does not even come close to with Reason.

7pm. If Reason can simplify my web stuff, and serve as a good template to boot, I will have everything I need. I am going to crush this.

My spirit is up again. I have no idea where things were going to go given that I've stopped studying Purescript far ahead of schedule, but when one door closes another opens.

I am still in the process of discovering web development.

This is as good as it gets. Reason is exactly what I need."

Logitech Media Server 8.0.0!

I certainly hope this release will deserve the new version number. Because in Logitech Media Server's history v8 was supposed to be something big. After SqueezeCenter 7 was released, there was an increasing number of users asking for more flexibility navigating their music. In particular Classical Music lovers seemed to have quite different approaches to organizing music. We promised more flexibility for them in SqueezeCenter 8 (or whatever the name of the day back then was supposed to be).

One guy in the team was tasked to create a new database schema and whatever should come with it. He did work hard. But before he was done priorities got shifted. A media server was strapped on to our beloved music server. But despite the major changes LMS 7 has seen over the years, we never dared to bump the version to 8. Because 8 was supposed to provide that new flexibility we still hadn't fully figured out how to do...

Time flew by. Squeezebox was killed (but remains undead). Online streaming services grew more and more important. I started to pick up an idea we had early on already: "universal" or "global" search across all of a user's music. No matter whether it's online or on his disk. Every now and then I'd give it a try, failing quickly and giving up over and over again. At some point it reminded me of our failed attempts at giving more browsing flexibility. And I decided to make the step to version 8 if ever I managed to do the improved online music integration.

Around Christmas 2019 I gave it another try. An approach I thought I had explored before. But suddenly it seemed to be working. Within a few days I had my Spotify album collection integrated with my local music collection. Quick search across all albums, library views etc. A few more sleepless nights later I now feel confident that I have something working. At least working for me, that is :-D. That's what I decided to branch off Logitech Media Server 8.0 today. I doubt it'll be ground breaking. But anyway. Here we go.
