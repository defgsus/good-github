Solved a shitshow in the making

- Playercols now have custom ruler compatibility, operated via a toggle switch that changes the operation of the system from on-actions to MTTF.  For faster, cleaner operation, use the default option, but since paradox is stupid, you cant have on_startup events hit custom rulers, so this is a necessary evil.

- also added more imamite history

"9:10am. I am up.

Let me chill a bit and then I will start. I got up really early today just like yesterday.

9:50am. Let me finally start. It is time to get serious. Let me take some time to reply to Anti and then I'll begin work on figuring out how to trace through Javascript examples.

10:15am. Uf, I had to take a break. My mouth likes that cake, but my stomach sure doesn't.

10:25am. https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/02/13/how-good-is-the-bayes-posterior-for-prediction-really/

11am. Did a non-so quick reply to Anti in a commit thread from 5 days ago. Now let me read the article. After that I will look into JS debugging.

http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/bayes_holes_2.pdf
Holes in Bayesian Statistics

"the usual rules of conditional probability fail in the quantum realm"

Hmmm, interesting.

But I'll leave this thing for later. What I want to do now is definitely do some debugging of JS. I want to figure out why that sample from yesterday is not working.

11:10am. Focus me, focus.

So I am running the status bar sample, and it is not working for some reason. How do I figure this out?

11:15am. Well, the best place to start out is SO. Probably somebody else ran into this same issue and asked. If not, I'll ask myself.

11:20am. A cursory search is turning up nothing for me, either on SO or on the sample issues page. I am going to have to ask.

In the extension, I've tried putting a few breakpoints and running it, but regardless of where I put them, nothing gets hit.

11:25am. Hmmm...

I have no idea. Let me look for some vids on JS debugging. After that I'll just bother the people on the issues page for advice.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript+debugging+vs+code

I guess I'll give these vids a chance.

11:45am. Ok, I watched one, but that is about debugging regular JS.

I have no choice at this point. I am going to have to ask.

12:05pm. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples

I've opened the issue 254 here.

12:20pm. Let me take a break. I'll watch some more tutorial vids after breakfast.

I really need some advice here. While I wait for a reply, I think I'll try the other samples as well.

There is just no helping it here. I need a hook. I need to some way of getting a handle on the whole system.

Pharo style debugging is really good for acquiring this kind of experience.

...What might be worth doing is like before starting out with a template that works and then comparing the files step by step. That would teach me something."

Create Puchi_And_Luggage.cpp

Puchi hates to carry luggage, but unfortunately he got a job to carry the luggage of his N friends in office. Each day, one of his N friends, gives him the luggage of a particular weight to carry. You will be given the weight of luggage of each friend in the array Weight, where Weighti is the weight of luggage of ith friend carried by Puchi on ith day. It is given that all the luggages carried by Puchi are distinct in their weights.
As Prateek assigned this job to Puchi, so for each day, he wants to know the number of days in future when Puchi will have to carry the luggage , having weight less than the weight of luggage of current day.
Please help Prateek for the same.

"1:30pm. Ugh, let me do the chores. I am really working at the speed of a snail here. I am pretty much larping to work at this point given how little I accomplish per day.

So it is just as well that today's chores will be longer as I have to work around the house. When I come back, I will look at those other vids and then get a start on figuring out how to debug VS Code.

2:50pm. I am back. Let me chill just a bit and then I will start.

3pm. Let me start.

Let me watch those other two plugin tutorials.

I won't lie - as I've been complaining, I feel incredibly dry over this whole affair. Reading documentation and watching videos sucks. This kind of programming is really the worst kind.

3:10pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kXUCm-ySfE

Let me go for this one, I skimmed the previous one as it just parroted the documentation.

But I really am leaning towards just going through the sample and the template side by side until I figure out what is wrong.

3:15pm. Ah, fuck the videos. Let me just get some programming done!

3:20pm. Let me do that.

First of all, let me create a template from scratch.

3:25pm. Ok, that went smoothly.

```
// A launch configuration that compiles the extension and then opens it inside a new window
{
 "version": "0.2.0",
 "configurations": [
  {
   "name": "Launch Extension",
   "type": "extensionHost",
   "request": "launch",
   "runtimeExecutable": "${execPath}",
   "args": [
    "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}"
   ],
   "stopOnEntry": false,
   "sourceMaps": true,
   "outFiles": [
    "${workspaceRoot}/out/src/**/*.js"
   ],
   "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
  }
 ]
}
```

Right now I am looking at the `launch.json` file for the status bar sample.

If this comment is to be believed, this really is supposed to launch a new code instance.

```
// A launch configuration that compiles the extension and then opens it inside a new window
// Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
// Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
// For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
{
 "version": "0.2.0",
 "configurations": [
  {
   "name": "Run Extension",
   "type": "extensionHost",
   "request": "launch",
   "runtimeExecutable": "${execPath}",
   "args": [
    "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
   ],
   "outFiles": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/out/**/*.js"
   ],
   "preLaunchTask": "${defaultBuildTask}"
  },
  {
   "name": "Extension Tests",
   "type": "extensionHost",
   "request": "launch",
   "runtimeExecutable": "${execPath}",
   "args": [
    "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}",
    "--extensionTestsPath=${workspaceFolder}/out/test/suite/index"
   ],
   "outFiles": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/out/test/**/*.js"
   ],
   "preLaunchTask": "${defaultBuildTask}"
  }
 ]
}
```

This is the launch file for the template.

```
   "args": [
    "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}"
   ],
```
```
   "args": [
    "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
   ],
```

These two arguments are different between the two.

3:30pm. Hmmm, maybe I opened VS Code in the wrong folder...

```
   "outFiles": [
    "${workspaceRoot}/out/src/**/*.js"
   ],
```

Also this thing bothers me in the sample. I am not sure what `${workspaceRoot}` is, but...

```
   "outFiles": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/out/**/*.js"
   ],
```

The sample and the template definitely differ. In particular, I am not sure the `"${workspaceRoot}/out/src/**/*.js"` is pointing to anything.

3:40pm. Right now I am running `npm install` in the parent folder which I presume is the root. Maybe that will do something.

3:50pm. Ok, focus me. That install did not last this long. I did not need to start surfing /sci/. Let me see if I can make some progress.

3:55pm. Ok...

I give up. Seriously, I do not give a shit why this does not work.

I am 95% sure though that just copying the extension into the template should work though. That is what I should focus on then.

Also maybe I should ask on SO as well, as I am running out of patience.

I just want to know how trace through the thing. Knowing that will help me in my future endeavors.

First of all, let me do the paste idea. Then I will ask on SO about tracing.

4pm. No, just pasting the extension fails.

...I have no idea. Let me try another extension.

https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/tree-view-sample

This thing runs, but I have no idea what it is supposed to be doing. Let me try another.

https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/completions-sample

This thing works.

4:10pm. Ok, since all the samples apart from the status bar one actually open a VS Code instance when run, I can safely conclude that the particular sample I decided to start off with is broken.

Seriously though, unless I figure out how to trace the system, I will never get anywhere. If this was actual webdev, I'd have no problem with this. But since I am dealing with an editor I am not sure what to do.

4:20pm.

```
// A launch configuration that compiles the extension and then opens it inside a new window
// Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
// Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
// For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
{
 "version": "0.2.0",
 "configurations": [
  {
   "name": "Run Extension",
   "type": "extensionHost",
   "request": "launch",
   "runtimeExecutable": "${execPath}",
   "args": [
    "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
   ],
   "outFiles": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/out/**/*.js"
   ],
   "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
  }
 ]
}
```

Ok, let me go through the status bar and the sample config files one by one.

4:25pm. I am actually going file by file carefully. I pastad the .vscode files from the completion folder, but that hasn't made it work.

Right now I am looking at `package.json`, but the problem does not seem to be there.

Let me try one thing. In the completion thing, do the breakpoints at least work?

4:35pm. Yeah, the breakpoints work.

```
 const myCommandId = 'sample.showSelectionCount';
 subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand(myCommandId, () => {
  let n = getNumberOfSelectedLines(vscode.window.activeTextEditor);
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Yeah, ${n} line(s) selected... Keep going!`);
 }));
```

I've hacked things a little, and now this particular aspect works.

```
 // create a new status bar item that we can now manage
 myStatusBarItem = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Right, 100);
 myStatusBarItem.command = myCommandId;
 subscriptions.push(myStatusBarItem);
```

The status bar items does not though.

4:40pm. Ahhh, I get it. I see that the status bar appears after I trigger the command using the command palette. After I do that, the tracking works as in the screenshot.

With this I've finally gotten the plugin to work. Great success.

4:45pm. Still, why isn't the code instance being launched?

I find this highly confusing.

I really want to resolve this mystery before I do anything else.

```

let myStatusBarItem: vscode.StatusBarItem;

export function activate({ subscriptions }: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
```

This is such poor coding style.

I remember doing this one in my life, and that was during the codegen phase of the Cool compiler project. There I could not really help it, but here the author had a few options to avoid this.

The easiest way to do this would instead of making those functions global, put them into the activation function instead and have them capture the variable from scope.

Ok, focus me.

Now that I've managed to get a single thing to work, that gave me a spark of motivation. I should be able to do this if I focus.

4:55pm. I have no idea. Apart from package lock I've done all I can. I honestly, can't see what else I can do.

What the hell?

Well, let me play a little with the status bar example. Let me at least arrange the functions so they follow proper coding standards.

5pm. Done.

```
 // create a new status bar item that we can now manage
 const myStatusBarItem = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Right, 100);
 myStatusBarItem.command = myCommandId;
 subscriptions.push(myStatusBarItem);

 function updateStatusBarItem(): void {
  let n = getNumberOfSelectedLines(vscode.window.activeTextEditor);
  if (n > 0) {
   myStatusBarItem.text = `$(megaphone) ${n} line(s) selected`;
   myStatusBarItem.show();
  } else {
   myStatusBarItem.hide();
  }
 };
```

This is much nicer than what was there before.

Let me update the issue.

5:10pm. I see that the dev got assigned to this thing, so it will be fixed eventually.

Now that I've at least got the example to work, I feel like I am on a more solid footing.

This kind of error I've run into is the worst. You can't really reason it out, at most you can do a little dance and prayer and hope it goes away.

5:15pm. I've studied the example a little just now and I understand pretty much everything about it.

```
subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand(myCommandId, () => {
```

Come to think of it, are these subscriptions actually necessary for the program to work?

5:20pm. No they aren't. I am guess they are just there for resource management.

Ok...I am considering just calling it a day here.

I've finally gotten the thing to run, so I've broken through this block at least.

Now that I've gotten some basic familiarity, the rest will be easier.

5:25pm. What I need to do starting from here is go through all the samples in turn. Once I do that, I will be ready to deal with the LSP.

5:40pm. I think my mood is better than it was before. Going forward, I will definitely have more motivation. Today I mostly exercised my mental muscles a little. Now that they've adapted, I'll be able to go further. I am going to crush this thing.

Let me end the day here."
