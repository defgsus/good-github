A story of getting the tests working on Travis CI in the form of
squashed commit messages...

Apparently travis doesn't include python3-apt
... and I've forgotten how to install apt stuff on Travis
... really really forgotten everything about Travis
... yet another attempt at Travis

Pretty please with sugar on top ...

As Dave's eye twitches from the umpteenth attempt at injecting pain in
the ass packages into a venv on a CI service ...

... TRAVIS!! ...

Start Wreck: The Wrath of Travis continues after this short intermission

... TRAAAAAAVIS!! ...

Once more unto the breach, dear VMs ...

... travis ...

If this takes much more, the commit messages are going to get distinctly
sweary ...

... travis ...

Hallelujah! It's finally working ... well, sort of. I mean the tests
don't pass, but screw it, at least they're running. Now to ditch Jessie
and get Bullseye tests prepped ...

... yet another travis commit ...

Can we use dist in the matrix? Where's Morpheus when you need him ...

... travis ...

Apparently python-apt never had a 1.6.5 branch?!

... travis ...

Yes! YES! It fucking works! I mean, the tests don't work yet, but fuck
it, the Travis job actually runs. So ... that's good ... right?
