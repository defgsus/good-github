Classifier: remove invariant columns

It is common for the mlbackend to receive training data with columns
that do not vary across the rows. Usually they are all zero, in which
case they have no effect on training, but they could be (say) all one,
in which case the column becomes a duplicate bias vector.

In training this is a waste of resources, but the real trouble comes
with prediction. If a row has a different value in that column, its
effect is entirely random because the column is entirely untrained.

How can this happen? Well suppose the column is called 'course_X' and
the training data is from last year. Course X was not offered last
year for reasons, but this year it is.

The solution is to ignore all columns with no variation, and remember
which columns they were. This makes training faster and prediction
better.

To save the variable columns we need to transfer the indexes to and
from the TF object, because that is what we save. Other than the minor
hackiness involved there, it is all quite simple.

Programming Exercise: Telling a Random Story
Assignment 1: Most Frequent Word
You will write a program to determine the word that occurs the most often in a file. If more than
one word occurs as the most often, then return the first such word found. You should make all
words lowercase before counting them. Thus, “This” and “this” will both be counted as the
lowercase version of “this.” You should not consider punctuation, so “end” and “end,” will be
considered different words. Use the WordFrequenciesprogram in the lesson as a starting
point.
Specifically, you should do the following:
● Create a new project in BlueJ and then create a new class called WordFrequencies.
Put all the following items in this class.
● Create two private variables. One is called myWordsand should be an ArrayList of type
String to store unique words from a file, and one is called myFreqsand should be an
ArrayList of type Integer. The kth position in myFreqsshould represent the number of
times the kth word in myWordsoccurs in the file.
● Write a constructor WordFrequencies,and initialize the private variables.
● Write a void method findUniquethat has no parameters. This method should first clear
both myWordsand myFreqs, using the .clear() method. Then it selects a file and then
iterates over every word in the file, putting the unique words found into myWords. For
each word in the kth position of myWords, it puts the count of how many times that word
occurs from the selected file into the kth position of myFreqs, as was demonstrated in
the lesson.
● Write a void testermethod that has no parameters. This method should call findUnique.
Then print out the number of unique words, and for each unique word, print the
frequency of each word and the word, as was demonstrated in the lesson.
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
● Write the method findIndexOfMaxthat has no parameters. This method returns an int
that is the index location of the largest value in myFreqs. If there is a tie, then return the
first such value.
● Add code to the testermethod to determine and print the word that occurs the most
often in a selected file and how many times it occurs. You should find it helpful to call
findIndexOfMax.
For example, if the file were testwordfreqs.txt:
This is a test. Yes a test of a test. Test.
Then the output would be:
Number of unique words: 7
1 this
1 is
3 a
3 test.
1 yes
1 test
1 of
The word that occurs most often and its count are: a 3
We are ignoring punctuation, so note that “test.” and “test” are different, as the first one has a
period with it. Also note that there is a tie—two words are counted three times; you should
return the first such word found which is “a”.
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
Assignment 2: Character Names
Write a program to determine the characters in one of Shakespeare’s plays that have the most
speaking parts. Consider the play “The Tragedy of Macbeth” in the file macbeth.txt.Here are a
few lines from the file put into a much smaller file called macbethSmall.txt:
MACBETH. My dearest love,
Duncan comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH. And when goes hence?
MACBETH. Tomorrow, as he purposes.
LADY MACBETH. O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under it. He that's coming
Must be provided for; and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch,
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
MACBETH. We will speak further.
Note that each speaking part is at the beginning of the line (there may be some blanks before it)
and has a period immediately following it. Shakespeare used this format in many of his plays.
Sometimes the name of the person to speak was all capitalized and sometimes it was not.
Write a program to print out the main characters in one of Shakespeare’s plays, those with the
most speaking parts. You should identify a speaking part by reading the file line­by­line and
finding the location of the first period on the line. Then you will assume that everything up to the
first period is the name of a character and count how many times that occurs in the file. You will
only print those characters that appear more often than others. Notice our method is somewhat
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
error prone. For example, a period is also used to indicate the end of a sentence. By printing out
only those characters that appear a lot, we will get rid of most of the errors. Periods that indicate
the end of a sentence will likely be a unique phrase so you won’t print that as it would just occur
once or maybe twice.
For the file macbethSmall.txt, if we process it and print ALL the possible speaker characters
and counts found, we would get the following output:
MACBETH 3
Duncan comes here tonight 1
LADY MACBETH 2
May read strange matters 1
But be the serpent under it 1
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom 1
If we only print those with a count greater than 1, then our output is:
MACBETH 3
LADY MACBETH 2
In processing the complete play in macbeth.txtyou should not print out every count—you
would have too much output, so instead print every count that is greater than or equal to some
number (you decide what that number is).
Specifically, you should do the following:
● Create a class named CharactersInPlay.Put all the following items below in this class.
● You will need to create two private ArrayLists. One to store the the names of the
characters you find and one to store the corresponding counts for each character.
● Write a void method named updatethat has one String parameter named person. This
method should update the two ArrayLists, adding the character’s name if it is not already
there, and counting this line as one speaking part for this person.
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
● Write a void method called findAllCharactersthat opens a file, and reads the file
line­by­line. For each line, if there is a period on the line, extract the possible name of the
speaking part, and call updateto count it as an occurrence for this person. Make sure
you clear the appropriate instance variables before each new file.
● Write a void method called testerthat has no parameters. This method should call
findAllCharacters, and then for each main character, print out the main character,
followed by the number of speaking parts that character has. A main character is one
who has more speaking parts than most people. You’ll have to estimate what that
number should be. Test your method on the file macbethSmall.txt. and then
macbeth.txt.
● Write a void method called charactersWithNumPartsthat has two int parameters
named num1and num2, where you can assume num1should be less than or equal to
num2. This method should print out the names of all those characters that have exactly
number speaking parts, where number is greater than or equal to num1and less than or
equal to num2. Add code in tester to test this method out

Create coursera2 week2 freqinword

Assignment 2: Words in Files
Write a program to determine which words occur in the greatest number of files, and for each
word, which files they occur in.
For example, consider you are given the four files: brief1.txt, brief2.txt, brief3.txt, and
brief4.txt.
brief1.txtis:
cats are funny and cute
brief2.txtis:
dogs are silly
brief3.txtis:
love animals cats and dogs
brief4.txtis:
love birds and cats
The greatest number of files a word appears in is three, and there are two such words: “cats”
and “and”.
“cats” appears in the files: brief1.txt, brief3,txt, brief4.txt
“and” appears in the files: brief1.txt, brief3.txt, brief4.txt
To solve this problem, you will create a map of words to the names of files they are in. That is,
you will map a String to an ArrayList of Strings. Then you can determine which ArrayList value is
the largest (has the most filenames) and its key is thus, a word that is in the most number of
files.
Specifically, you should do the following:
● Create a new class called WordsInFiles. Put all the remaining listed items in this class.
● Create a private variable to store a HashMap that maps a word to an ArrayList of
filenames.
● Write a constructor to initialize the HashMap variable.
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
● Write a private void method named addWordsFromFilethat has one parameter fof
type File. This method should add all the words from finto the map. If a word is not in
the map, then you must create a new ArrayList of type String with this word, and have
the word map to this ArrayList. If a word is already in the map, then add the current
filename to its ArrayList, unless the filename is already in the ArrayList.
● Write a void method named buildWordFileMapthat has no parameters. This method
first clears the map, and then uses a DirectoryResource to select a group of files. For
each file, it puts all of its words into the map by calling the method addWordsFromFile.
The remaining methods to write all assume that the HashMap has been built.
● Write the method maxNumberthat has no parameters. This method returns the
maximum number of files any word appears in, considering all words from a group of
files. In the example above, there are four files considered. No word appears in all four
files. Two words appear in three of the files, so maxNumberon those four files would
return 3. This method assumes that the HashMap has already been constructed.
● Write the method wordsInNumFilesthat has one integer parameter called number.
This method returns an ArrayList of words that appear in exactly numberfiles. In the
example above, the call wordsInNumFiles(3)would return an ArrayList with the
words “cats” and “and”, and the call wordsInNumFiles(2)would return an ArrayList
with the words “love”, “are”, and “dogs”, all the words that appear in exactly two files.
● Write the void method printFilesInthat has one String parameter named word. This
method prints the names of the files this word appears in, one filename per line. For
example, in the example above, the call printFilesIn(“cats”)would print the
three filenames: brief1.txt, brief3.txt, and brief4.txt, each on a separate line.
● Write the void method testerthat has no parameters. This method should
○ call buildWordFileMap()to select a group of files and build a HashMap of words,
with each word mapped to an ArrayList of the filenames this word appears in.
○ determine the maximum number of files any word is in, considering all words.
○ determine all the words that are in the maximum number of files and for each
such word, print the filenames of the files it is in.
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
○ (optional) If the map is not too big, then you might want to print out the complete
map, all the keys, and for each key its ArrayList. This might be helpful to make
sure the map was built correctly

"8:35am. Got up 20m ago. Yesterday fatigue really hit me like a truck, so I did not even manage to read more than 2 chapters of the Toji novel. I'll take the opportunity provided by this early awakening to indulge myself. I'll study the ASP.NET book after that.

Also, I did some planning. I've decided. I think it really is unrealistic to aim for low 6-figure remote job at Intel, but I should be able to use that in order to pivot and get the guy to send me a sample. Having that neurochip would be the catalyst to actually doing the RL agent properly. If I could have it, I am not sure how things would go from there, but I am certain that I could at least create the poker agent. That would matter a lot.

If I get an offer for a 5 figure remote job, it could also serve as a backup if any disasters strike even if I have no intention of taking it. I'll be killing many birds in with one stone this way. The salary money does not really matter, all the big stuff in the lead up to the Singularity will be through RL anyway.

9:25am. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22381129
"Location: Remote
Vathys is hiring a machine learning compiler engineer to build the core compiler to a system that will be a step function improvement in ML capability.

The ideal candidate:

1. Has a good understanding of the fundamentals of deep learning algorithms. Less "I can use Keras" and more "I can write a CNN from scratch in numpy".

2. Has used a NN compiler framework or IR framework in the past such as TVM, MMdnn, MLIR, Glow, Tensor Comprehensions, etc.

3. Has experience with compilers, especially optimizing compilers and compilers for high performance code.

4. Has experience writing kernels for deep learning applications.

5. Has at least passing familiarity with the concept of polyhedral optimizations

Generous compensation will be provided to the right candidates.

Please contact tapabrata_ghosh[at]vathys[dot]ai if you're interested"

They forgot to put a link to their site, http://vathys.ai/.

It seems this is one of the startups, but damn it, it is just too early for me. I really do need to finish Spiral before I apply to anywhere, but on the other hand if I wait too long the opportunities will go away.

Nonetheless, times like these are a test of character. I always need to be in the frame of mind of abundance.

There will be more of these in the future. Plus, I am not making Spiral for any specific piece of hardware. There is no point in committing myself anything until I know that I can use it for my own purposes. I need to keep in mind that most of these startups are here to drain investor money and capitalize on the hype. There isn't room for 100 different neurochips on the market.

10:20am. Done with chapter 4 of the Toji novel. That was really good. I enjoyed this morning.

Now let me study the ASP.NET book."

Put it back, because it's pretty easy to implement, though I am a little
suspicious of its usecase. I think in the case of a "something's gone wrong",
I'd try to send debug link messages and stop messages, which would more readily
identify if other cores experience the same problem.

Yes, this is correct.

Correct; I've just explicitly added a mention in the "notes" for the Tinsel
Command and Control section.

My intention was for them to just not (for now), and to refactor this once
SBase is in. Added my intentions to the implementation plan section.

Somewhat shamefully we did have a list written down, but on rifling through
ADB's office I couldn't find them. I've added some extra notes on the
Supervisor API, but since I'm not exactly sure what people would want to do
with them, I've left them deliberately vague (for now)

IIRC, the softswitch does not support this at present. I imagine the mechanism
would be simple, from the Mothership perspective, because it just waits for a
`P_CNC_HEARTBEAT` packet or so, and collects the results. The supervisor API
could define `bool Super::stop_if_all_heartbeats_received_or_something()`,
making it easy for the application writer to use the thing.

Alternatively, we can leave the sleeping dragon alone, lest it breathe fire and
melt our computers.

"10:40pm. "Changes such as these have inevitably effected other changes in a ripple effect, for example,
in the forced removal of **runtime compilation**"

I wonder what is meant by **runtime compilation**. Egh, I really do not know much about how JITed languages work under the hood. Does that mean that ASP apps are AOT compiled? Probably not.

11:35am. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/memory-and-spans/memory-t-usage-guidelines
".NET Core includes a number of types that represent an arbitrary contiguous region of memory. .NET Core 2.0 introduced Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T>, which are lightweight memory buffers that can be backed by managed or unmanaged memory. Because these types can only be stored on the stack"

I am looking at some HN threads on ASP.NET and these got mentioned. Interesting they've got types stored on the stack now.

"Well it has always been performant. The whole Stackexchange is built with ASP.net, and it render things 10x faster than Ruby Rails while requiring 10x less hardware resources."

I am just checking out what people say about this since the book made performance claims. I do not see them being contested.

2:05pm. Done with breakfast, chores, bath. Let rest for a bit and then I will resume. Rather than reading the book, I started looking at threads midway, but I'll get back to it.

3pm. By 'get back to it,' I obviously meant 'rant on /sci/'. No seriously me, read the damn ASP.NET book!

3:10pm. 62/558. This overly long chapter on just setting up the environment that I apparently don't have the brain to skip is putting me to sleep. I really need to start skimming this. Yesterday I really started having fun with the TS book, but now this is really bringing me down.

3:15pm. Focus me, start skimming this. Hopefully chapter 3 will be something where I actually learn new things and that will pick me up.

3:30pm. Finally at chapter 3. It is asking me to get a free Azure DevOps subscription. I have no idea what that is, but I'll do it.

Maybe I made a mistake going with this book. Yesterday I was quite into it, but so far this book has been a snoozefest.

Let me commit here."

PARTIAL CHERRY-PICK: System tests: various fixes

 - start_registry() - use bash builtins, not curl, to test
   if registry port is open.

   curl on Fedora now barfs with "Received HTTP/0.9 when not
   allowed" when the registry is run with SSL, because the
   response is not valid HTTP. One workaround would be 'curl
   --http0.9' but (surprise) that option doesn't exist on rhel8;
   and even with that option we would need --output /dev/null
   to silence a different curl warning. Curl is overkill
   for this purpose anyway, all we really need is netcat
   or some simple binary is-port-listening-or-not test.
   Fortunately, bash provides a /dev/tcp/<host>/<port>
   emulator that does the right thing and works on Fedora
   as well as RHEL8.

 - new log_and_run() helper

   This is the noisiest yet least critical part of this PR.
   I'm sorry. It's motivated by my frustration in trying
   to reproduce the curl problem above: getting just the
   right incantation of openssl + podman-run cost me time.
   With this enhancement, important commands are logged
   as part of the output of failing tests, making it
   easy[*] for maintenance programmers to figure out a
   recipe for reproducing the failure.

     [*] "easy" as long as the test-writing developer
         uses log_and_run() wisely.

"3:40pm. It was super easy to open that Azure DevOps account.

Oh, I see that the poker thing I did back in 2016 is still there in the private repo. I actually forgot that the F# ML library that I did was called Spiral.

I've been thinking during the off-time whether I want to continue with my plan. Since I am firmly on the path of learning webdev, rather than going with the banditry plan, what I should do instead after training up that poker agent is distill it and turn the whole thing into a game.

It is just the case, that making the language, training the agent and everything else is difficult enough on its own. If I have to fight the online poker sites in addition to all of that, I will have a hard time. Even if I have the agent, I do not have a good way of automating the stealth Turing tests the sites would set out for me.

They can be beaten with hand engineering, but that would be a useless waste of time I could use making longer term gains and learning new skills.

I'll crush them when I am good and ready, but for now why don't I go this way and aim to diversify my portfolio. I might as well try capitalism for real at least once before humanity gets driven to extinction by the AI whose creation I am contributing to and whose power I am trying to internalize.

4:45pm. 93/558. It is teaching me how to use Github here. Some of this is new to me, so I've been going through this slowly.

I admit, this book is more thorough in starting me out than I thought it would be.

5pm. 97/558. I hadn't realized that it is possible to connect to a project.

5:10pm. I am looking for the build option, and it seems it is under repos rather than under pipelines unlike in the book.

5:15pm. Er, no, I actually just needed the classic editor. I see it now.

5:30pm. "In the next two chapters, we will explain the basic concepts of ASP.NET Core 3, including the start up class, using middleware, routing, error handling, and much more."

I saw a lot of this in the plugins so I am definitely interested in the meat of the book.

At any rate, I am finally done with chapter two. A lot of the stuff here is new to me, but it was not very interesting. As the project is empty, the build obviously failed.

5:35pm. 103/558. Do I really feel like continuing here?

5:40pm. Though my focus was low, I did go through 70 pages today. It was tedious tutorial stuff, but effort is still effort. I am feeling the fatigue.

Let me just start the chapter and I'll leave it for tomorrow. Hopefully the book should start getting interesting here. I want to save the good for when I am fresh.

6pm. 106/558. I'll leave this for tomorrow.

All in all, it does not feel like I did too badly today. Yes, I wasted a lot of time and my focus was low, but the material itself was tedious. Still I did learn a bit about modern programming practices. Tomorrow will be more hands on, much like yesterday.

6:10pm. Now come leisure. A best practice is to have learning and rest in balance. Stress maintenance is a core skill unless one wants frequent trips to the doctor."

finally got this MOTHERFUCKING BITCH ASS SEGFAULT to go away. now I can insert the same values one after another (still get double-free when inserting different values). made both arrays public and added links directly through each array.

fs/sync: Make sync() satisfy many requests with one invocation

Dave Jones reported RCU stalls, overly long hrtimer interrupts, and
amazingly long NMI handlers from a trinity-induced workload involving
lots of concurrent sync() calls (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/23/369).
There are any number of things that one might do to make sync() behave
better under high levels of contention, but it is also the case that
multiple concurrent sync() system calls can be satisfied by a single
sys_sync() invocation.

Given that this situation is reminiscent of rcu_barrier(), this commit
applies the rcu_barrier() approach to sys_sync().  This approach uses
a global mutex and a sequence counter.  The mutex is held across the
sync() operation, which eliminates contention between concurrent sync()
operations.  The counter is incremented at the beginning and end of
each sync() operation, so that it is odd while a sync() operation is in
progress and even otherwise, just like sequence locks.

The code that used to be in sys_sync() is now in do_sync(), and
sys_sync()
now handles the concurrency.  The sys_sync() function first takes a
snapshot of the counter, then acquires the mutex, and then takes another
snapshot of the counter.  If the values of the two snapshots indicate
that
a full do_sync() executed during the mutex acquisition, the sys_sync()
function releases the mutex and returns ("Our work is done!").
Otherwise,
sys_sync() increments the counter, invokes do_sync(), and increments
the counter again.

This approach allows a single call to do_sync() to satisfy an
arbitrarily
large number of sync() system calls, which should eliminate issues due
to large numbers of concurrent invocations of the sync() system call.

Changes since v1 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/24/683):

o	Add a pair of memory barriers to keep the increments from
	bleeding into the do_sync() code.  (The failure probability
	is insanely low, but when you have several hundred million
	devices running Linux, you can expect several hundred instances
	of one-in-a-million failures.)

o	Actually CC some people who have experience in this area.

Show overflow input values when typing or pulling cursor handle

SUMMARY
Issue: https://khanacademy.atlassian.net/browse/LP-7812

It turns out that if we remove the code that overrides Mathquil's native scrolling logic, the extra scrolly behavior we want (scrolling on cursor handle pull and when the user is typing past the edge of the box) just magically work. For some reason, we still needed to add the `overflow: "scroll"` styles in `override.less` to get manually scrolling to work, but Mathquil can handle the other stuff for us.

So this diff mostly just removes the code that overrides Mathquil's code. That also means removing the `scrollable` prop, which I really should have removed before anyway, since we're now making the input field always scrollable. (Should we be concerned about removing this prop since this is an open source project? I actually don't have any experience with open source, so I really don't know.)

I also updated my code for hiding the cursor handle on scroll since that currently messes up the feature of scrolling by pulling on the cursor handle (for obvious reasons). This isn't actually part of the ticket I set out to do, but since Mathquil is giving it to us for free, why not? It's not perfect though. It works pretty well when scrolling the input field left by pulling on the cursor, but scrolling it right is really janky. So I was thinking of taking the ticket I had for implementing the scroll-on-handle-pull feature and, instead of closing it, updating it to instead say to make this feature better. But since it's already a P3, I don't know if we'll ever get to it, so maybe it's better to just close it? https://khanacademy.atlassian.net/browse/LP-7695

TEST PLAN
Open the expression widget,
type in a whole buncha values,
when you pass the max width of the input field, verify the input field scrolls to show the new values you insert,
verify you can manually scroll left and right by using a track pad, scroll wheel, or by pulling the scroll bar,
tap into the input field,
verify the cursor handle appears,
scroll the field again,
verify the handle disappears,
tap into the field again,
grab the cursor handle,
verify you can pull it around the input field,
pull it off the side of the input field in a direction that has hidden values,
and verify the input field scrolls to show the hidden values.
