refactor(compiler-cli): accept a host for reading project configuration

Currently the `readConfiguration` function in the compiler relies on the
file system to perform disk utilities needed to read determine a project
configuration file and read it. This poses a challenge for the language
service, which would like to use `readConfiguration` to watch and read
configurations dependent on extended tsconfigs (#39134). Challenges are
at least twofold:

1. To test this, the langauge service would need to provide to the
   compiler a mock file system.
2. The language service uses file system utilities primarily through
   TypeScript's `Project` abstraction. In general this should correspond
   to the underlying file system, but it may differ and it is better to
   go through one channel when possible.

As discussed in the LS sync, we decided to provide to
`readConfiguration` a host that would take of reading configuration as
needed for the use case of the caller. A first attempt was to put this
on `NgCompilerAdapter`, but this is not elegant because it introduces a
`CompilerAdatpter` dependency where there is no need for one (e.g. when
creating a watch mode host).

To be honest, I am not in love with the `ReadConfigurationHost`
delivered in this patch. I think it may be less hassle in the long term
and more ergonomic to create a `FileSystem` abstraction on a per-project
basis, delivered to the compiler whenever a new langauge service is
created. Let me know what you think.

Unblocks #39134

Chem rework mk5, the unga strikes back (#4813)

* Chemical additions

Initial add of 2 chemicals, QC+ and Larvaway.

QC+ is highly toxic and stuns, but heals IB very, very rapidly. 

Metabolism rate 0.5u/tick, intended dose 5u, OD 6u, crit OD 10u. Healrate will be 2.5/tick, for a total of 25 pts of IB healed/dose, additional if OD'd (next commit). That's the good stuff.

The bad stuff is that it gives you 5u of toxins/tick, AND takes 15 stamina/tick, AND maxes out your pain. Give with antitox and it's 100% safe, but you'll still go down for about 20 seconds.

OD deals 3 toxin/tick and some minor bloodloss.
Crit OD deals hilariously high bloodloss. Maybe don't clot all your blood at once?

Larvaway is moderately toxic, and can cause stamina issues, but delays larva growth by 50% or so (next commit). Over time, it will become lethal.

Metabolism of 0.1u/tick, design dose 10u (200 seconds). OD's at 15u, crit OD at 25u.
The first 10u cause 0.5 toxin damage/tick with a 25% chance of 0.5 staminaloss/tick.
The second 10u cause 1 toxin damage/tick with a 25% chance of 20 staminaloss/tick.
Anything after 20u is processed causes 3 toxin/tick (but no staminaloss, yay?)
