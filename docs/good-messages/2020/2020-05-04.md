Fix for the extremely slow model generation with some MySQL databases.

If one tries to generate the models on a MySQL database with a lot of
databases and tables the generation is getting very slow (#329).

This seems to result from MySQL not optimizing queries on views very well.

The solution I have chosen and validated is to replace the table and schema
in the subquery with the actual names instead of references to the parent
queries.

The result for my system is insane and went down from over 9 hours to 4
seconds.

This fix is kinda ugly but straight forward and I think the speed advantage
is worth it. Especially as the code is never being seen by anyone.

Update 00128.txt

aaron's updates: "i reshuffled the music again so here

changes (that i remember):

my kingdom pfhor a horse: now uses leela acoustic, because otherwise leela showed up twice in one chapter
let sleeping gods die: uses aliens again, because guardians was too cheery
eat s’pht and die: uses guardians, because i’d removed it from every other level in the game that used it
pfhor får lamm: uses rapture, because i changed dread not to leela, and rapture fits this level perfectly
dread not: uses leela, because you are reunited with leela on this level after hathor was impersonating her for two levels
i’ve got a bad feeling about this: uses landing, because we wanted something grand and dark, and this brings it back full circle with the first mission where you’re serving hathor

i think that’s all of them? oh, also, i made a few of my latin translations a bit more reliable, i hope"

Create a first implementation using Rc<RefCell<State>>. It sucks... fml.

The following is my current issue and the proposed solution which will
be implemented in the following commit.

Creating a graph is especially hard is rust because of the borrow
checker and the desire of immutability. The two possible ways I could
devise was to use a shit ton of Rc<RefCell<State>> so many states could
point to a single state and a state can be mutated (so we can connect
NFAs). The other problem with this solution is that RefCell cannot
really go into a HashSet/HashMap since Hash in rust seems to want to
hash based on data rather than memory location (or ptr value). The other
solution was to use unsafe rust, I didn't try implementing this since I
have a better solution now.

My current solution which is unimplemented is to simplify things.
Instead of passing around State structs and connecting them to each
other, which would lead to a single piece of data having many owners and
gets tedious with rusts borrow checker, I will just represent states by
integers. By doing this, instead of passing around ptrs which is quite
annoying in rust, we pass integers which point to a location in a
vector.

Lesson learned. Having just completed CS350 (intro to operating systems)
at UWaterloo, I have gotten into a rhythm of passing around pointers and
handling them on a very low level, even distinguishing between virtual
and physical pointers. Coding like this in rust is a path to despair I
think, handling ptrs like that is tough with the borrow checker. I think
at a fundamental level, I have to learn more idiomatic rust.

I don't usually write commit messages like diary entries, but
Rc<RefCell<>> everywhere had me very frustrated for this commit and I
wanted to write down my thoughts so I don't repeat this in the future.
I do like rust so far, but it can be frustrating.
