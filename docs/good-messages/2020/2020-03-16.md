(POC) Add `hook_civicrm_postCommit`, a variant of `hook_civicrm_post`

Overview
--------

So here's a pattern that's occurred a few times: one wants to provide an
extra notification or log or correlated-record after something is chanaged
or created.  So you implement `hook_civicrm_post`.  It sounds simple, but it
doesn't work quite as expected - because running within the transaction can
have some special implications:

1. Performing subsequent SQL queries within the same transaction be wonky
2. Errors in your notification bubble-up and break the transaction.

You can resolve this by deferring your work until the transaction completes. The
technique has been discussed in various media over the years; e.g. here's a mention in the dev docs:

https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/hooks/hook_civicrm_post/#example-with-transaction-callback

However, I think the problem may be that the default is basically backwards: there are more use-cases
for 'post' hook in which you prefer to run *after the transaction commits*, but doing that case requires
the special incantation.

This patch is a proof-of-concept in which the system provides two hooks:

* `hook_civicrm_post`: Runs immediately after the change is *sent* to the DB.
  If there's a SQL transaction, then it runs *within* the transaction.
* `hook_civicrm_postCommit`: Runs after the change is *committed* to the DB.
  Runs outside of any SQL transactions.

My theory is that more developers would run their logic at the correct time
if they had `postCommit` available as a hook (and, of course, the downstream
code would look tidier).  This isn't really a pain-point for me, so I'm not
super-motivated to push it, and I haven't looked very hard for systemic
side-effects of buffering more posts.  However, I think it could provide
better DX (making it easier for more folks to get the right timing), so I
wanted to share the POC.

Before
------

```php
/**
 * Hook fired after the INSERT/UPDATE is sent to the DB
 */
function hook_civicrm_post($op, $objectName, $objectId, &$objectRef)
```

After
------

```php
/**
 * Hook fired after the INSERT/UPDATE is sent to the DB
 */
function hook_civicrm_post($op, $objectName, $objectId, &$objectRef);

/**
 * Hook fired after the record is committed to the DB.
 * This may be immediate (for non-transactional work) or it may be
 * delayed a few milliseconds (for transactional work).
 */
function hook_civicrm_postCommit($op, $objectName, $objectId, $objectRef);
```

ahead-behind: do not die when we see no INTERESTING pending object

We currently die if we are fed an ahead/behind with zero
objects (`foo..foo` in the most basic case, but in practice
something like `foo@{upstream}..foo`, when `foo` has just
been merged).  The problem is that we let
`handle_revision_arg` parse it, and then pick the pieces out
of the pending object list. So "^foo" looks no different to
us there than "foo".

This patch hacks around it by picking up the UNINTERESTING
object in that case. However, this isn't great because:

  1. Now we won't notice some types of bogus input.

  2. We end up reporting the name of the UNINTERESTING object.

We probably should pick apart the ".." ourselves, or even
just change it to ":" or whitespace.

commit: give a hint when a commit message has been abandoned

If we launch an editor for the user to create a commit
message, they may put significant work into doing so.
Typically we try to check common mistakes that could cause
the commit to fail early, so that we die before the user
goes to the trouble.

We may still experience some errors afterwards, though; in
this case, the user is given no hint that their commit
message has been saved. Let's tell them where it is.
