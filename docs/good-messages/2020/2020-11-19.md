damn man i just want grill and they took it away, damn them all!!! (#55024)

Whoever the damn bastard is who tried to take our grills. know this: we will not bend over while you take the only thing that still makes us happy. We just want to drink energy drinks and grill some hamburgers in peace. This is your final warning, try doing this again and we will assemble a lawn mower squad outside of your house at the early hours of 6AM to make sure you cannot enjoy your sunday morning in peace.

Newfood compatibility is now included by checking IS_EDIBLE() and removing the shitty foodtype that was there before

Logs pockets, updates some shitty stripping verbage (#55027)

Two things at hand here.
A: Pockets were not logged at all. I hate god.
B: I'm using log_message here because it gives me the freedom to be more grammatically correct. Please attack my spelling and offer suggestions of other mob strip panel things to log in the comments
B.5: I updated stripping to use log_message for the same reasons.
