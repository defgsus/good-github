damn man i just want grill and they took it away, damn them all!!! (#55024)

Whoever the damn bastard is who tried to take our grills. know this: we will not bend over while you take the only thing that still makes us happy. We just want to drink energy drinks and grill some hamburgers in peace. This is your final warning, try doing this again and we will assemble a lawn mower squad outside of your house at the early hours of 6AM to make sure you cannot enjoy your sunday morning in peace.

Newfood compatibility is now included by checking IS_EDIBLE() and removing the shitty foodtype that was there before

changed where stats array indices are located and defined, refactored ripple effects of that into EnergySamples array based underlying storage implementation is. But it's also used elsewhere and likely to be used a lot more now that it's a lot more accessible. Also added subtract() and dumptostring() utilities for double[]s of energy values. They currently live in SyncEnergyMonitor but you should consider relocating them to a more centrally accessible class functionality, if one finds itself to be more useful than what you have right now. Keep those comments on them with thoughts about relocating there in the back of your mind, so you know that you can process it and take the opportunity if need be. Thanks for the chat, friendo. Now go back to not pretending like git is your Diary. Good night, dear diary. Salam aleikum. Hallelujah ay-men.

[FIX/IMP] Legalize Odoo cookies

Recent EU laws require websites to:

1. Ask consent to the user to be able to use cookies for purposes not explicitly related to what the user is asking you to do (e.g. tracking, analytics, marketing, etc.).
2. Give the user a way to change his mind.

Due to these changes, Odoo approach is illegal because it doesn't respect any of those requirements.

This PR is deliberately violating Odoo stability guidelines based on the fact that laws are more important than guidelines. However, still with that, it's trying to adhere as much as possible to them.

The approach is:

- Use a new cookie, called `cookies_accepted`, to remember what kind of cookies the user accepts. This cookie is categorized as essential, and thus its acceptance isn't required.
- Categorize all other cookies being used in Odoo.
- Install those other cookies only when the user accepted them.
- Provide an editable website page where you can state your cookie policies. It comes pre-filled with all cookies Odoo uses.

A big problem we have is that the way cookie consent is asked requires the `website` addon to be installed, but some addons that use tracking cookies do not depend on it (e.g. `im_livechat` or `utm`). Due to this, those modules will never be able to install evil cookies unless `website` is installed. This should be improved later on master, where there's no stability requirement and module dependencies can be altered, possibly providing a specific addon that implements all common blocks and where any cookie-installing module can depend on.

Logs pockets, updates some shitty stripping verbage (#55027)

Two things at hand here.
A: Pockets were not logged at all. I hate god.
B: I'm using log_message here because it gives me the freedom to be more grammatically correct. Please attack my spelling and offer suggestions of other mob strip panel things to log in the comments
B.5: I updated stripping to use log_message for the same reasons.

Speed up raw writer by buffering

Remember, boys and girls, Rust IO frequently doesn't buffer by default, and then
it's veeeeeery sloooooooow.

Here we get 2-3 orders of magnitude speedup!

"12:30pm. Done with breakfast. Let just finish this fruit and then I'll do the chores.

2:50pm. That was longer than I thought. Before I resume, let me cool down for a bit.

3pm. Enough wasting time. Let me start.

3:05pm. I've put in a bit thought of what I should do next.

3:15pm. Had to take a short break. Let me say what I meant to say.

Before I can continue, I want to do something - I want to take those two servers that I have now and turn them into a single server.

Then I can begin operating on them and plugging in the things that I have now.

Right now I have the module loading finished, but I am in an awkward position where I cannot do anything about it.

Let me work a little on the top level again.

3:40pm. Hrmmm...

```fs
type FileState = {
    tokenizer : TokenizerStream
    parser : ParserStream
    typechecker : TypecheckerStream
    cancellation_start : unit IVar
    cancellation_done : unit Promise
    }

let token_range (r_par : ParserRes) ((a,b) : VSCRange) =
    let from, near_to = min (r_par.lines.Length-1) a.line, min r_par.lines.Length (b.line+1)
    vscode_tokens from near_to r_par.lines

let handle_token_range r_par canc req =
    r_par >>= fun (r_par : ParserRes) ->
    let rec loop () = canc <|> (req ^=> fun (r,res) -> IVar.fill res (token_range r_par r) >>= loop)
    loop()

let hover (l : Infer.InferResult PersistentVector) (pos : VSCPos) =
    l |> PersistentVector.tryFindBack (fun x -> x.offset <= pos.line)
    |> Option.bind (fun x ->
         x.hovers |> Array.tryPick (fun ((a,b),r) ->
            if pos.line = a.line && (a.character <= pos.character && pos.character < b.character) then Some r else None
            ))

let handle_hover_at r_typ canc req =
    r_typ >>= fun r_typ ->
    // TODO: It might be better if the hover handler tugged on the stream rather than just sampling it like now.
    let rec loop () = canc <|> (req ^=> fun (pos,res) -> IVar.fill res (hover (cons_fulfilled r_typ) pos) >>= loop)
    loop ()

let handle_typ uri type_errors r_typ canc =
    let rec loop ers = function
        | Nil -> Alt.unit()
        | Cons(a : Infer.InferResult,next) ->
            canc <|> (Alt.unit() ^=> fun () ->
                let errors = List.append a.errors ers
                Src.value type_errors {|uri=uri; errors=errors|} >>=.
                next >>= loop errors
                )
    r_typ >>= loop []

let file_server tokenizer_errors parser_errors type_errors (uri : string) req req_token_range req_hover_at =
    let cancel (s : FileState) = IVar.fill s.cancellation_start () >>=. s.cancellation_done
    let loop s =
        req >>= fun x ->
        let rec try_more x = Ch.Try.take req >>= function
            | Some x -> try_more (s.tokenizer.Run(x))
            | None -> Job.result x
        try_more (s.tokenizer.Run(x)) >>= fun (r_tok,tok) ->
        cancel s >>= fun () ->
        let r_par,par = s.parser.Run(r_tok)
        let r_typ,typ = s.typechecker.Run(r_par)
        let canc = IVar()
        Promise.start (Job.conIgnore [
            Src.value tokenizer_errors {|uri=uri; errors=r_tok.errors|}
            r_par >>= fun r_par -> Src.value parser_errors {|uri=uri; errors=r_par.parser_errors|}
            handle_token_range r_par canc req_token_range
            handle_typ uri type_errors r_typ canc
            handle_hover_at r_typ canc req_hover_at
            ]) >>- fun canc_done ->
        { tokenizer=tok; parser=par; typechecker=typ; cancellation_start=canc; cancellation_done=canc_done }
    Job.iterateServer {
        tokenizer=tokenizer
        parser=parser (System.IO.Path.GetExtension(uri) = ".spi")
        typechecker=typechecker 0 0 (Promise(Infer.top_env_default))
        cancellation_start=IVar()
        cancellation_done=Promise(())
        } loop
```

I remember complaining a lot about this recently, but the more I think about how to get the same functionality, the more I blank.

I can't think of any other method than cancellation tokens. I can't think of anything better than the general technique that is, but I can definitely improve on the above. I can abstract it more. Let me try that.

```fs
type FileState = {
    tokenizer : TokenizerStream
    parser : ParserStream
    typechecker : TypecheckerStream
    cancellable : unit Job
    }
```

Let me replace it with this. Now...

```fs
let cancel (s : FileState) = IVar.fill s.cancellation_start () >>=. s.cancellation_done
```

This I will abstract.

```fs
        let cancellable =
            let canc = IVar()
            Promise.start (Job.conIgnore [
                Src.value tokenizer_errors {|uri=uri; errors=r_tok.errors|}
                r_par >>= fun r_par -> Src.value parser_errors {|uri=uri; errors=r_par.parser_errors|}
                handle_token_range r_par canc req_token_range
                handle_typ uri type_errors r_typ canc
                handle_hover_at r_typ canc req_hover_at
                ]) >>- fun fin -> IVar.fill canc () >>=* fun () -> fin
        cancellable >>- fun cancellable ->
        { tokenizer=tok; parser=par; typechecker=typ; cancellable=cancellable }
```

Something like this, but let me turn it it into a proper function.

```fs
/// Reading from the promise cancels the job.
let cancellable_job f =
    let canc = IVar()
    Promise.start (f canc) >>- fun fin -> IVar.fill canc () >>=* fun () -> fin
```

Let me do this.

But I am really better just making it a regular job.

```fs
/// Binding from the outer layer starts a job, and binding from the inner layer cancels it and waits for completion.
let cancellable_job f =
    let canc = IVar()
    Promise.start (f canc) >>- fun fin -> IVar.fill canc () >>=. fin
```

Let me go with this.

4pm.

```fs
let file_server tokenizer_errors parser_errors type_errors (uri : string) req req_token_range req_hover_at =
    let loop s =
        req >>= fun x ->
        let rec try_more x = Ch.Try.take req >>= function
            | Some x -> try_more (s.tokenizer.Run(x))
            | None -> Job.result x
        try_more (s.tokenizer.Run(x)) >>= fun (r_tok,tok) ->
        s.cancellable >>= fun () ->
        let r_par,par = s.parser.Run(r_tok)
        let r_typ,typ = s.typechecker.Run(r_par)
        cancellable_job (fun canc -> Job.conIgnore [
            Src.value tokenizer_errors {|uri=uri; errors=r_tok.errors|}
            r_par >>= fun r_par -> Src.value parser_errors {|uri=uri; errors=r_par.parser_errors|}
            handle_token_range r_par canc req_token_range
            handle_typ uri type_errors r_typ canc
            handle_hover_at r_typ canc req_hover_at
            ]) >>- fun cancellable ->
        { tokenizer=tok; parser=par; typechecker=typ; cancellable=cancellable }
    Job.iterateServer {
        tokenizer=tokenizer
        parser=parser (System.IO.Path.GetExtension(uri) = ".spi")
        typechecker=typechecker 0 0 (Promise(Infer.top_env_default))
        cancellable=Job.unit()
        } loop
```

This is definitely a bit nicer. Now I no longer have to manage two different tokens, instead I have just a single job I wait on.

This is good. This simplifies my thinking a decent amount. Maybe this technique is viable after all.

5:15pm. Done with lunch. Apart from that I've been thinking all this while. Let me get back to that.

6pm. I meant to write code, but just spent all this time in intense thought.

I thought a lot about the servers, and realized I've hit a brick wall in terms of the usage of that general technique. And even though I've put some makeup on the cancellation tokens, it still basically does not change the fact that I cannot go anywhere with that.

Right now, my thoughts are going in an entirely different direction.

Remember the dirty flag technique during memoization?

```fs
let mutable dirty = false
Utils.memoize dict (fun x ->
    dirty <- true
    // ...
    ) x
```

One thing that had me particularly lost is how to deal with attention. Sure in the previous server, I had it tug on a file. That was simple enough.

But now that I am beyond toy example, I have to think - how exactly am I going to deal with all those lazy streams that span across packages and modules without making things inefficient.

And I know how.

First when it comes to parsing, I am going to use the dirty flag technique, except instead of setting some flag, I am going to map over the promises and set their errors when they are evaluated.

The same goes for streams.

And I know how to deal with the attention server as well. It was a real problem trying to think of a way to make this work - the packages are not at all arranged in sequential order like the modules. If that server is done with one package, which one should be next?

Also how do I deal with focus? What should it even be? And what should the server do when it changes?

6:10pm. I know. The ideas I have in mind right now will serve to simplify things.

The side effecting promises and streams are a great way of simplifying error reporting. They will do.

6:15pm. Let me stop here. Tomorrow I am going to put these ideas into into code. It won't be too long now until I am done.

What I have in mind right now is rather simple actually, so things should move quickly. If it were for that package thing I still have on the TODO list, I would put the ETA at ~3 days.

6:20pm. One thing that really stands out is how non-composable the regular servers are turning out to be. And how useful lazy promises and streams together with immutable data stractures really are in the concurrent domain. It is a real eye opener.

I am going to master all of this. As long as the progress is being made, I have nothing to complain about."

Sucessfully fucked the shit up

Tried to integrade the GUi. Realised, half my Programm wasnt designed for that and the other half was a game loop, not needen because of the GUI mainloop...
Didnt thaught, I would fix this much until I go to sleep. Gono try to fix the Rest tomorrow.
