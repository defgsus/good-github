Install as coreos-installer.legacy

For https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/210 I think
we will need at least some transitional period where RHCOS
ships both.  Even ignoring customers, the way our CI works
strongly encourages "ratcheting" changes in a compatible way,
i.e.:

- Introduce new thing, ship it
- Port consumers to new thing
- Remove old thing

And honestly I think this is a good model, because it forces
us to experience some of the pain that customers might feel here.

The basic idea here is:

- Install as `/usr/libexec/coreos-installer.legacy` so there's
  no chance of conflict with the real one
- Test for the presence of the "stamp file' we drop in our legacy initramfs
  so we know to defer to the real root's coreos-installer; see
  https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/pull/1389

switch from travis-ci to github actions

i was getting this error from bsdtar in travis-provided ubuntu version::

  sudo bsdtar -xpmf base.tar.xz -C rootfs
  bsdtar: Ignoring malformed pax extended attribute
  bsdtar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.
  Makefile:39: recipe for target 'rootfs' failed
  make: *** [rootfs] Error 1

i assumed it was something that's fixed in newer bsdtar as i didn't get
that on my laptop.  since i can't be arsed to invest in travis-ci.com,
and since i need to learn about github actions anyway, i went with the
latter, which yielded the same.  switched to using a voidlinux container
inside github actions runner, where i got a different error message::

  sudo bsdtar -xpmf base.tar.xz -C rootfs
  bsdtar: Pathname can't be converted from UTF-8 to current locale.
  bsdtar: Pathname can't be converted from UTF-8 to current locale.
  bsdtar: Pathname can't be converted from UTF-8 to current locale.
  bsdtar: Pathname can't be converted from UTF-8 to current locale.
  bsdtar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.
  make: *** [Makefile:44: rootfs] Error 1

turns out the container was running with LANG=POSIX whereas it needed
LANG=en_US.UTF-8 (i'm guessing C.UTF-8 would've been fine but the
voidlinux/voidlinux image from hub.docker.com doesn't have that
(which, btw, wtf?  the patch is there:
https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/glibc/patches/glibc-c-utf8-locale.patch))

which also means the whole container saga was perhaps unnecessary...

the following is from
https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/355#issuecomment-16549330

meanwhile, i started getting this error from xbps-install inside the rootfs::

  sudo chroot rootfs /sbin/xbps-install --debug --sync --update --yes xbps

the answer to which is:

(https://old.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/fpfhrq/help_void_wont_update/)

luckily, the libressl fuckup ("libcrypto45-3.0.2_2 (update) breaks installed
pkg `libressl-2.9.2_1'") is gone, so the Makefile uses the 20191109 snapshot
again.

Why...Am...I...Up.......................... But I started the add friends page. Currently it actually displays only your friends, but there's no way to add friends yet. This hopefully will become a way to add friends with a minor change. Only problem is that I might need to create a new branch of the database that only stores the UIDs since if I get them where they currently are, all of the user things come with them, but I guess I actually need all that so... yeah. Ok now it doesn't do that but it calls the gang of the methods in the wrong place so we're back to the OG problem where asynchronous things screw up my life.

Support and default to generating Atom feeds

This includes several breaking changes, but they’re easy to adjust for.

Atom 1.0 is superior to RSS 2.0 in a number of ways, both technical and
legal, though information from the last decade is hard to find.
http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Rss20AndAtom10Compared
has some info which is probably still mostly correct.

How do RSS and Atom compare in terms of implementation support? The
impression I get is that proper Atom support in normal content websites
has been universal for over twelve years, but that support in podcasts
was not quite so good, but getting there, over twelve years ago. I have
no more recent facts or figures; no one talks about this stuff these
days. I remember investigating this stuff back in 2011–2013 and coming
to the same conclusion. At that time, I went with Atom on websites and
RSS in podcasts. Now I’d just go full Atom and hang any podcast tools
that don’t support Atom, because Atom’s semantics truly are much better.

In light of all this, I make the bold recommendation to default to Atom.

Nonetheless, for compatibility for existing users, and for those that
have Opinions, I’ve retained the RSS template, so that you can escape
the breaking change easily.

I personally prefer to give feeds a basename that doesn’t mention “Atom”
or “RSS”, e.g. “feed.xml”. I’ll be doing that myself, as I’ll be using
my own template with more Atom features anyway, like author information,
taxonomies and making the title field HTML.

Some notes about the Atom feed template:

- I went with atom.xml rather than something like feed.atom (the .atom
  file format being registered for this purpose by RFC4287) due to lack
  of confidence that it’ll be served with the right MIME type. .xml is a
  safer default.

- It might be nice to get Zola’s version number into the <generator>
  tag. Not for any particularly good reason, y’know. Just picture it:

    <generator uri="https://www.getzola.org/" version="0.10.0">
	Zola
    </generator>

- I’d like to get taxonomies into the feed, but this requires exposing a
  little more info than is currently exposed. I think it’d require
  `TaxonomyConfig` to preferably have a new member `permalink` added
  (which should be equivalent to something like `config.base_url ~ "/" ~
  taxonomy.slug ~ "/"`), and for the feed to get all the taxonomies
  passed into it (`taxonomies: HashMap<String, TaxonomyTerm>`).
  Then, the template could be like this, inside the entry:

    {% for taxonomy, terms in page.taxonomies %}
        {% for term in terms %}
            <category scheme="{{ taxonomies[taxonomy].permalink }}"
		term="{{ term.slug }}" label="{{ term.name }}" />
	{% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}

Other remarks:

- I have added a date field `extra.updated` to my posts and include that
  in the feed; I’ve observed others with a similar field. I believe this
  should be included as an official field. I’m inclined to add author to
  at least config.toml, too, for feeds.
- We need to have a link from the docs to the source of the built-in
  templates, to help people that wish to alter it.

loopfs: implement loopfs

This implements loopfs, a loop device filesystem. It takes inspiration
from the binderfs filesystem I implemented about two years ago and with
which we had overall good experiences so far. Parts of it are also
based on [3] but it's mostly a new, imho cleaner approach.

Loopfs allows to create private loop devices instances to applications
for various use-cases. It covers the use-case that was expressed on-list
and in-person to get programmatic access to private loop devices for
image building in sandboxes. An illustration for this is provided in
[4].

Also loopfs is intended to provide loop devices to privileged and
unprivileged containers which has been a frequent request from various
major tools (Chromium, Kubernetes, LXD, Moby/Docker, systemd). I'm
providing a non-exhaustive list of issues and requests (cf. [5]) around
this feature mainly to illustrate that I'm not making the use-cases up.
Currently none of this can be done safely since handing a loop device
from the host into a container means that the container can see anything
that the host is doing with that loop device and what other containers
are doing with that device too. And (bind-)mounting devtmpfs inside of
containers is not secure at all so also not an option (though sometimes
done out of despair apparently).

The workloads people run in containers are supposed to be indiscernible
from workloads run on the host and the tools inside of the container are
supposed to not be required to be aware that they are running inside a
container apart from containerization tools themselves. This is
especially true when running older distros in containers that did exist
before containers were as ubiquitous as they are today. With loopfs user
can call mount -o loop and in a correctly setup container things work
the same way they would on the host. The filesystem representation
allows us to do this in a very simple way. At container setup, a
container manager can mount a private instance of loopfs somehwere, e.g.
at /dev/loopfs and then bind-mount or symlink /dev/loopfs/loop-control
to /dev/loop-control, pre allocate and symlink the number of standard
devices into their standard location and have a service file or rules in
place that symlink additionally allocated loop devices through losetup
into place as well.
With the new syscall interception logic this is also possible for
unprivileged containers. In these cases when a user calls mount -o loop
<image> <mountpoint> it will be possible to completely setup the loop
device in the container. The final mount syscall is handled through
syscall interception which we already implemented and released in
earlier kernels (see [1] and [2]) and is actively used in production
workloads. The mount is often rewritten to a fuse binary to provide safe
access for unprivileged containers.

Loopfs also allows the creation of hidden/detached dynamic loop devices
and associated mounts which also was a often issued request. With the
old mount api this can be achieved by creating a temporary loopfs and
stashing a file descriptor to the mount point and the loop-control
device and immediately unmounting the loopfs instance.  With the new
mount api a detached mount can be created directly (i.e. a mount not
visible anywhere in the filesystem). New loop devices can then be
allocated and configured. They can be mounted through
/proc/self/<fd>/<nr> with the old mount api or by using the fd directly
with the new mount api. Combined with a mount namespace this allows for
fully auto-cleaned up loop devices on program crash. This ties back to
various use-cases and is illustrated in [4].

The filesystem representation requires the standard boilerplate
filesystem code we know from other tiny filesystems. And all of
the loopfs code is hidden under a config option that defaults to false.
This specifically means, that none of the code even exists when users do
not have any use-case for loopfs.
In addition, the loopfs code does not alter how loop devices behave at
all, i.e. there are no changes to any existing workloads and I've taken
care to ifdef all loopfs specific things out.

Each loopfs mount is a separate instance. As such loop devices created
in one instance are independent of loop devices created in another
instance. This specifically entails that loop devices are only visible
in the loopfs instance they belong to.

The number of loop devices available in loopfs instances are
hierarchically limited through /proc/sys/user/max_loop_devices via the
ucount infrastructure (Thanks to David Rheinsberg for pointing out that
missing piece.). An administrator could e.g. set
echo 3 > /proc/sys/user/max_loop_devices at which point any loopfs
instance mounted by uid x can only create 3 loop devices no matter how
many loopfs instances they mount. This limit applies hierarchically to
all user namespaces.

In addition, loopfs has a "max" mount option which allows to set a limit
on the number of loop devices for a given loopfs instance. This is
mainly to cover use-cases where a single loopfs mount is shared as a
bind-mount between multiple parties that are prevented from creating
other loopfs mounts and is equivalent to the semantics of the binderfs
and devpts "max" mount option.

Note that in __loop_clr_fd() we now need not just check whether bdev is
valid but also whether bdev->bd_disk is valid. This wasn't necessary
before because in order to call LOOP_CLR_FD the loop device would need
to be open and thus bdev->bd_disk was guaranteed to be allocated. For
loopfs loop devices we allow callers to simply unlink them just as we do
for binderfs binder devices and we do also need to account for the case
where a loopfs superblock is shutdown while backing files might still be
associated with some loop devices. In such cases no bd_disk device will
be attached to bdev. This is not in itself noteworthy it's more about
documenting the "why" of the added bdev->bd_disk check for posterity.

NES: Update ED N8 & PowerPak SMDB

Huge Update!
All base folders are based on following No-Intro specs:
Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System (20200329-092100).zip

Note: seems [Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System (20200405-041607) [headered] is in the making but not ready yet!

**General cleanup**
Renamed all instances of T-Eng -> T+Eng

**Folder updates**
1 US A-Z -> Contain exactly all released retail releases [677 ROMs] in the latest revision released at the time, later re-releases (e.g. Gamecube, WiiWare -> Revisions)

2 Europe A-Z -> Contain exactly all released retail releases in both PAL regions [348 ROMs] in their latest revision released at the time in English language (where applicable, Deja Vu for example was only released in Swedish in PAL!)

2 Japan A-Z -> Should contain all released retail releases from this region but I'm not 100% sure, also only in their latest available revisions released at the time

2 Other regions -> Only 2 ROMs (1 Asia, 1 Canada)

2 Unlicensed A-Z -> Also based on what's available in the No-Intro set. Added those files which were in the previous pack to make sure nothing's missed.
I merged the PAL releases and NTSC releases because otherwise people would need to know exactly what to look for and I believe that's not feasible for the "mainstream". Slightly renamed the Multicarts folder.

3 Famicom Disk System -> Didn't touch (maybe updated a few file names, unsure)

3 Famicom Disk System for PowerPak -> Didn't touch (maybe updated a few file names, unsure)

3 Nintendo Switch -> New folder which I didn't know where else to place. There is one NES ROM which presumably works on real hardware that was recently released on Nintendo Switch (Steins;Gate (USA) (Nintendo Switch).nes).

3 Nintendo VS. System Arcade -> Didn't touch (maybe minor file name updates)

3 NSF Music for PowerPak -> Didn't touch (maybe minor file name updates)

3 PlayChoice-10 Arcade -> Didn't touch (maybe minor file name updates)

4 Betas, Prototypes, Revisions -> Also based on what's available in the No-Intro set. Added those files which were in the previous pack to make sure nothing's missed.
I also added a "Competitions" sub-folder to put the Nintendo World Championship ROM in.

4 Game Series Collections ->  -> Also based on what's available in the No-Intro set. Added those files which were in the previous pack to make sure nothing's missed. A lot of spelling errors were corrected as well plus other things, like:
1. Top 100 List - satoshimatrix.wordpress.com was missing rank #37
2. 4 Game Series Collections\Chronological\Famicom 1986 contained Dig Dug 2 but Dig Dug (1) is correct.
I removed following folders:
'4 Game Series Collections\Miscellaneous\2 Player Co-Op' (felt redundant, same content as '4 Game Series Collections\Multiplayer\Sort By - 2 Player Co-Op')
'4 Game Series Collections\Genre\Light Gun Zapper' (felt redundant, same content as '4 Game Series Collections\Accesories & Add-Ons\Light Gun Zapper')
I also removed clones in different folders, for example:
'4 Game Series Collections\Genre\Puzzle\*' Mario & Yoshi (EU clone of US Yoshi) + Dynablaster (EU clone of US Bomberman 2)
'D:\SMDB\01. ROMs\N8 SMDB Rework\Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System\4 Game Series Collections\x Genre\x Sports\Skiing & Snowboarding' Snowboard Challenge (EU clone of US Heavy Shreddin')

4 Hacks, 4 Homebrew and 4 Translations -> Left mostly untouched, I corrected a few spelling mistakes and removed dupes.

5 Tools & Service Test Carts -> Based on No-Intro ROM sets and added ROMs which were availble in the previous pack and are not in No-Intro

Unsupported -> Didn't touch

**Observations**

Hashes in '3 Famicom Disk System for PowerPak' are different from hashes in '3 Famicom Disk System' but file names are the same (for many files).
I don't know enough about the PowerPak to understand why it's like that but assume this has a reason (the Disk games probably have to be patched to work on the PowerPak?).
But shouldn't these files then have distinct file names?

Also: It might be a good idea to base the Disk System folders on the latest No-Intro ROM specs in similar fashion as I did it for the cartridge based ROMs.
(There are a few .fds games in the subfolders such as 'Game Series Collections\*' which should then also be looked at.

There are some files with the same file names and different hashes.
Only some examples which I found and noted down:
1. Esper Dream (J) (Rev 1) [b] [T+Eng].fds
2. Ganbare Goemon 2 (J) [T+Eng_S.Crusaders].nes
3. Nazo no Kabe - Block Kuzushi (Japan) [b].fds

As well as multiple instances of translation hacks with various amounts of different hashes, some even by same group and same version of translation:
- Labyrinth [3x]
- Bio Senshi Dan - Increaser Tono Tatakai [3x]
- Nekketsu Kakutou Densetsu [3x]
- Dragon Ball Z II - Gekishin Freeza!! [Saiya] [2x]

Author and/or versions of many translations/hacks are missing in file names.

One special curious translation case:
Double Moon Densetsu: In previous pack the Beta4 by Kiwibonga was used in the Game Series Collection.
This patch is listed as "Unfinished" on ROMhacking.net.
Then there are 2 files with the same hash in '4 Hacks' and '4 Translations' but without any info on version or auther of the patch (Legend of Double Moon, The.nes).
This game has recently received an updated translation patch according to ROMhacking.net: 1.02 by Stardust Crusaders & aishsha.
For now, I have used the Beta4 in the new pack as well but...

... what I propose for the Double Moon Densetsu translation:
- the reference to the two files 'Legend of Double Moon, The.nes' should be removed
- the Beta4 by Kiwibonga should be kept in '4 Translations' for documentation purpose
- the 1.02 by Stardust & aishsha should be added to '4 Translations'
- all references to Beta4 should be replaced by references to 1.02

Other presumably updated translation hacks I came across:
Final Fantasy II (J)
- has received an updated translation patch from Chaos Rush beginning of April (2.0)
- add to '4 Translations/English A-K/'
- replace current translation patches instances in '4 Game Series Collections/*' and '4 Translations/Selections' (where applicable) with it
https://www.romhacking.net/translations/2656/

Final Fantasy III (J)
- has another, more recent translation patch (v1.3_Chaos Rush)
- add latest patch to '4 Translations/English A-K/'
- replace current translation patches instances in '4 Game Series Collections/*' and '4 Translations/Selections' (where applicable) with it
https://www.romhacking.net/translations/4760/

Tenchi o Kurau II - Shokatsu Koumei Den (J)
- has another, more recent translation patch (v1.12_Dark Force, Dynamic-Designs, Jair, Taskforce)
- add latest patch to '4 Translations/English L-Z/'
- replace current translation patches instances in '4 Game Series Collections/*' and '4 Translations/Selections' (where applicable) with it
https://www.romhacking.net/translations/116/

Wagyan Land 2 also received a more recent patch than what's in the pack now.

SD Gundam Gaiden - Knight Gundam Monogatari (J) (V1.0) [T+Eng0.10_Assassin_Productions]
- only in 4 Game Series Collections\Genre\Role Playing Games\All Role Playing Games
- should be checked if this ROM is good and/or if newer/better translation patches exist and the be added to the '4 Translations' folder

**Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 - Karakuri Land (J)**
There is one file in the pack: Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 - Karakuri Land (J) [T+Eng v1.01_Shadow] -> but this version isn't listed on ROMhacking.net
There is another file in the pack: Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 - Karakuri Land[T+Eng_D] -> what's the version?
And another file: Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 - Karakuri Land (J) [hFFE][T+Eng] -> author and version?

**Final note**
My observations don't give a complete picture, I think it's safe to assume there are many more issues which are the same or similar to the ones I noted above.

markdown: Add helper configuration for mobile.

This refactoring is the first step toward sharing
our markdown code with mobile.  This focuses on
the Zulip layer, not the underlying third party `marked`
library.

In this commit we do a one-time initialization to
wire up the markdown functions, but after further
discussions with Greg, it might make more sense
to just pass in helpers on every use of markdown
(which is generally only once per sent message).
I'll address that in follow-up commits.

Even though it looks like a pretty invasive change,
you will note that we barely needed to modify the
node tests to make this pass.  And we have pretty
decent test coverage here.

All of the places where we used to depend on
other Zulip modules now use helper functions that
any client (e.g. mobile) can configure themselves.
Or course, in the webapp, we configure these from
modules like people/stream_data/hash_util/etc.

Even in places where markdown used to deal directly with
data structures from other modules, we now use functions.
We may revisit this in a future commit, and we might
just pass data directly for certain things.

I decided to keep the helpers data structure completely flat,
so we don't have ugly nested names like
`helpers.emoji.get_emoji_codepoint`.  Because of this,
some of the names aren't 1:1, which I think is fine.

For example, we map `user_groups.is_member_of` to
`is_member_of_user_group`.

It's likely that mobile already has different names
for their versions of these functions, so trying for
fake consistency would only help the webapp.  In some
cases, I think the webapp functions have names that
could be improved, but we can clean that up in future
commits, and since the names aren't coupled to markdown
itself (i.e. only the config), we will be less
constrained.

It's worth noting that `marked` has an `options`
data structure that it uses for configuration, but
I didn't piggyback onto it, since the `marked`
options are more at the lexing/parsing layer vs.
the app-data layer stuff that our helpers mostly
help with.

Hopefully it's obvious why I just put helpers in
the top-level namespace for the module rather than
passing it around through multiple layers of the
parser.

There were a couple places in markdown where we
were doing awkward `hasOwnProperty` checks for
emoji-related stuff.  Now we use the Python
principle of ask-forgiveness-not-permission and
just handle the getters returning falsy data.  (It
should be `undefined`, but any falsy value is
unworkable in the places I changed, so I use
the simpler, less brittle form.)

We also break our direct dependency on
`emoji_codes.json` (with some help from the
prior commit).

In one place I rename streamName to stream_name,
fixing up an ancient naming violation that goes
way back to before this code was even extracted
away from echo.js.  I didn't bother to split this
out into a separate commit, since 2 of the 4
lines would be immediately re-modified in the
subsequent commit.

Note that we still depend on `fenced_code`
via the global namespace, instead of simply
requiring it directly or injecting it.  The
reason I'm postponing any action there is that
we'll have to change things once we move
markdown into a shared library.  (The most
likely outcome is that we'll rename/move both files
at the same time and fix the namespace/require
details as part of that commit.)

Also the markdown code still relies on `_` being
available in the global namespace.  We aren't
quite ready to share code with mobile yet, but the
underscore dependency should not be problematic,
since mobile already uses underscore to use the
webapp's shared typing_status module.

Oh, *facepalm*.

That's why ^D was wonky as hell.
I'd forgotten to handle EoF, which is effectively what ^D triggers.
