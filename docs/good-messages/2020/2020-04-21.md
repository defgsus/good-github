width of curses menus

Menus with wide header or separator lines were rendered wide enough
to avoid wrapping those lines, but ones with narrow header/separators
and wide selectable entries were limited to half the display even
though lots of lines that would fit with full width were being wrapped.
Change the latter behavior.

Menus are right justified with the edge of the map when narrower than
it, left justified otherwise, and if the display is wider than the map,
they'll extend beyond its right edge.  (That hasn't actually changed;
it's just that left-justification is more likely now that menus will
be wide enough to show wide inventory lines without wrapping.)

Get rid of my ridiculous hack to force wider menu for the 'symset'
and 'roguesymset' sub-menus of 'O' since it's no longer useful.

There's still room for improvement.  If any lines need to be wrapped
despite using the full width, or perhaps are just a lot wider than
most of the entries, menu width could be narrowed to just enough for
'normal' lines to fit so that one or two really long entries don't
distort the menu.  That's a bit more complicated than I want to deal
with right now.  [If implemented, it would be relevant for tty too.]

genirq: Allow the irqchip state of an IRQ to be save/restored

There is a number of cases where a kernel subsystem may want to
introspect the state of an interrupt at the irqchip level:

- When a peripheral is shared between virtual machines,
  its interrupt state becomes part of the guest's state,
  and must be switched accordingly. KVM on arm/arm64 requires
  this for its guest-visible timer
- Some GPIO controllers seem to require peeking into the
  interrupt controller they are connected to to report
  their internal state

This seem to be a pattern that is common enough for the core code
to try and support this without too many horrible hacks. Introduce
a pair of accessors (irq_get_irqchip_state/irq_set_irqchip_state)
to retrieve the bits that can be of interest to another subsystem:
pending, active, and masked.

- irq_get_irqchip_state returns the state of the interrupt according
  to a parameter set to IRQCHIP_STATE_PENDING, IRQCHIP_STATE_ACTIVE,
  IRQCHIP_STATE_MASKED or IRQCHIP_STATE_LINE_LEVEL.
- irq_set_irqchip_state similarly sets the state of the interrupt.

Fix Immediately Immobilized Caravans

I noticed that caravan capacity calculations were acting funny, so I explored this behavior with only Harmony, Core, HugsLib, GU-Core and GU-Caravans.  I wrote and play-tested two alternate versions of the code responsible for the weird behavior.  I've included both versions in this pull request - you will likely want to edit this after testing and deciding if you like it.

---
Problem: Some caravans become immediately immobilized upon embarking when animals are mounted, especially caravans near full mass capacity.

---
Observation: Let's form a caravan consisting of two naked colonists (2 x 35 kg capacity), a Muffalo (73.5 kg capacity), and three granite chunks (3 x 25 kg mass).  We assign one rider, which reduces the Muffalo's capacity by 60 kg.

The caravan's capacity will appear correctly in the caravan screen:
35 + 35 + ( 73.5 - 60 ) = 35 + 35 + 13.5 = 83.5 kg

The caravan cargo will also appear correctly:
3 x 25 = 75 kg

Therefore, the caravan formation screen shows that we are in good shape:
75 kg / 83.5 kg
(8.5 kg available capacity)

---
However:

Upon embarking, those three chunks are distributed to our two colonists and the Muffalo.  This is done either manually by colonists loading a caravan leaving the home settlement, or automatically by Dialog_FormCaravan.AddItemsFromTransferablesToRandomInventories when leaving from an encounter map.

Either way, each of the colonists now carries 25 of their 35 kg capacity.
35 - 25 = 10 kg available capacity

Vanilla MassUtility.Capacity then calculates the Muffalo's capacity:
73.5 - 25 = 48.5 kg available capacity

And then GiddyUp's MassUtility_Capacity patch subtracts the rider and his inventory:
__result -= pawnData.caravanRider.GetStatValue(StatDefOf.Mass);
48.5 - 85 = -36.5 kg

Then corrects the negative remaining capacity to 0:
__result = Math.Max(__result, 0f);
0 kg

Now our caravan capacity has been reduced to 
35 + 35 + 0 = 70 kg

And just like that, our caravan is immobilized, despite moments earlier boasting 8.5 kg excess capacity.
75 kg / 70 kg
(5 kg overextended capacity)

---
Notes:
The main problem right now is that due to the random cargo distribution, there is no way a player can predict how much mass a rider might be carrying (and therefore how much total mass capacity the caravan will have) until the caravan embarks, but by then it's too late to pack a reasonable load.  Further, there is no guarantee that the mass distribution will be equal.  In my tests, sometimes one colonist got two chunks and the other got none; other times, each colonist got one.

As in the example above, this often results in caravans that become immobilized immediately upon embarking - and the more colonists and animals in the group, the less reliable the caravan forming screen can be.

I believe the first step is to remove individual pawn inventories from the equation and simply focus on the overall mass carried and mass capacity.  This makes sense, because inventory mass will still be counted as mass carried, so it doesn't need to also reduce mass capacity.  Plus, we don't really care who is carrying which pieces of slag or chunks or blocks - we just care that the caravan can haul the prize home.

I'd like to propose two solutions that I've coded and tested in various situations.

Solution A - Easy Mode
Each mounted animal's mass capacity is reduced ONLY by rider body mass.
This solution would allow for some slightly inflated caravan capacities, because the rider's "backpack" would get a free ride on mounted animals.  Would encourage more riding.

Solution B - Hard Mode
Each mounted animal's mass capacity is reduced by (rider body mass + rider mass capacity).
This solution is more realistic and would make riding more costly - the animal will feel the weight of the rider AND his backpack.  If the rider has additional mass capacity, then the animal must account for that by reducing its own capacity.
This solution would widen the gap further between the rider speed bonus versus higher mass capacity.  Anecdotally, I played for a while with this option and strongly prefer it due to the greater importance placed on strategy.  With Solution A, it was almost always better for everyone to ride all the time.  With Solution B, there was great incentive to load up the animal with cargo and walk it home, and a higher cost when I had to abandon a significant amount of loot in order to mount up and hurry home because of the Flu.

Perhaps a mod option could offer a choice between Easy Mode and Hard Mode.

In either case, the mass capacity shown on the caravan formation screen becomes reliable and players can pack loot until their caravans are full to the brim, without risk of the caravan immediately becoming immobile upon embarking.

Thanks for the fantastic mods.  Hopefully players will enjoy this fix without causing too much extra work for you and the other contributors.

Basic fetch on load, with tests

The pain! The pain!! Mocking
`fetch()` and `useState()` changes after `fetch()` returns is
PAAAAIIIINFUL. I went 'round and 'round the houses trying to mock fetch,
give it a fake return value, render the component and have react/jest
shut up about my code making updates outside of `act()`. The layers of
magic behind `useX` and `react-testing-library` are deep and rich. I
suppose they might be helpful once you've learned them, but they break
so many assumptions from my previous life, hide so much and introduce so
many new points of failure that I"m not currently convinced.

47583: col*: use logical types throughout the vectorized engine r=yuzefovich a=yuzefovich

**col...: create new package and move some code**

This commit introduces `colbase` package which currently contains the
following (that are extracted from `colexec` package):
- `allocator.go`
- `random_testutils.go`
- `Operator` interface
- `CopyBatch` method.

The reason for extracting these things is that they are used by multiple
col* packages, so I think it's a good hygiene to separate them out.

This commit also renames `execerror` package to `vecerror` and then
moves it inside of `colbase` directory. It also changes the panic
matching so that now we catch all panics coming from a package that has
`pkg/sql/col` in its path (this will make sure that we don't forget to
register newly added packages that use panic-catching mechanism of the
vectorized engine with the panic-catcher). Additionally, this commit
renames the methods of `execerror` package.

Next, it moves `colexec/typeconv` package into `colbase` as well as
`colexec/testutils.go` file.

Finally, it removes `vecerror.NonVectorizedPanic` in favor of
`vecerror.ExpectedError`. The guidance on whether `InternalError` or
`ExpectedError` method should be used has been updated: the distinction
is whether the vectorized engine ends up in an unexpected - invalid -
state (for example, we expect that the vectorized engine might be
performing division by zero when evaluating a binary expression).

Release note: None

**col...: use logical types throughout the vectorized engine**

This commit transitions the vectorized engine to use SQL logical types
wherever possible, only converting to its physical type equivalent when
necessary (for example, when choosing which instance of projection
operator to use). This will allow us to have access to the actual type
whever we need and will allow us implement `coltypes.Datum` for all
unoptimized types.

This commit also moves some a few things around to clean up the
dependency graph (namely, `BytesEncodeFormat` is moved from
`sql/sessiondata` to `sql/lex`). Additionally, it replaces a single call
to `util/log.Infof` with a print statement in `util/protoutil` package
to remove the dependency on `util/log` (which depends on a bunch of
other things) so that `pkg/workload` would need to import less things.

Another thing worth calling out is the creation of copies of types in
`execplan` file to make sure that we don't override the input sync
specs.

Addresses: #43559.

Release note: None

**col...: introduce new package and more code movement**

Move `coldata/random_testutils.go` into newly created package
`coldatatestutils`.

Move contents of `colbase/random_testutils.go` into `coldatatestutils`
package.

Rename `colbase` to `colexecbase`. Also remove templated comments from
import sections of `_tmpl` files in favor of adding vars that remove
unused warnings (those templated comments work poorly when
moving/renaming the dependencies).

Rename `vecerror` to `colexecerror`.

Move `CopyBatch` from `colexecbase` into `coldatatestutils`. Also remove
memory accounting from `CopyBatch`.

Move `typeconv` from `colexecbase` into `coltypes` folder.

Move `coldata/vec_test.go` into `coldata_test` package to prevent an
import cycle. Also move one unit test from `coldata/vec_test.go` into
`coldata/bytes_test.go`.

Move `colexecbase/allocator.go` into newly created `colmem` package.

Release note: None

47629: sql: use Clock.PhysicalTime in beginTransactionTimestampsAndReadMode r=nvanbenschoten a=nvanbenschoten

Synchronizing with the HLC clock doesn't look to be necessary. I'm confused
about this though. The comment on beginTransactionTimestampsAndReadMode says
that "txnSQLTimestamp propagates to become the TxnTimestamp". Is this trying to
say that the timestamp makes it way into the kv.Txn? Because that's not true.

Regardless, the one reason not to make this change is that PhysicalTime is not
guaranteed to be monotonic on some systems and can generally diverge from the
HLC's clock. If we're worried about that though, we should use the HLC here and
feed that directly into the kv.Txn. We shouldn't need to grab two timestamps
from the HLC per txn.

47756: cli,base: surface stored critical errors at the right moment r=tbg a=knz

Fixes #44041

If/when storage detects an important error, the text for this error is
stored in a file named `_CRITICAL_ERROR.txt` in the auxiliary
directory. The intention is to block subsequent server restarts until
the error is investigated and the file (manually) removed.

Prior to this patch, this check was done in the startup sequence 1)
before logging was fully initialized 2) using a `log.Fatal` to
announce the critical error.

The first aspect is problematic because it logs before logging flags
are applied. The second is problematic because it makes the failure
super-verbose and buries the lede.

This patch simplifies the code and makes the error reported at the
right place.

#### Tuesday 2020-04-21 18:02:36 by jhb

Retire two unused background fsck sysctls.

These two sysctls were added to support UFS softupdates journalling
with snapshots.  However, the changes to fsck to use them were never
committed and there have never been any in-tree uses of these sysctls.

More details from Kirk:

When journalling got added to soft updates, its journal rollback freed
blocks that it thought were no longer in use. But it does not take
snapshots into account (i.e., if a snapshot is still using it, then it
cannot be freed). So I added the needed logic to fsck by having the
free go through the kernel's blkfree code so it could grab blocks that
were still needed by snapshots. That is done using the setbufoutput
hack. I never got that code working reliably, so it is still sitting
in my work directory. Which also explains why you still cannot take
snapshots on filesystems running with journalling...

In looking over my use of this feature, and in particular the troubles
I was having with it, I conclude that it may be better to extract the
code from the kernel that handles freeing blocks claimed by snapshots
and putting it into fsck directly. My original intent was that it is
complex and at the time changing, so only having to maintain it in one
place was appealing. But at this point it has not changed in years and
the hacks like setinode and setbufoutput to be able to use the kernel
code is sufficiently ugly, that I am leaning towards just extracting
it.
