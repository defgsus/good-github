i mean personally I thought that having the butt made of slag instead of pharosium would've been in the same vein as having the butt be made from buttflesh and not normal flesh, cus it sounds more fitting for a butt to be made from gross, useless-ass slag and not refined, functional pharosium, cus its a butt for frricks sake, its not some sophisticated piece of prosthetic science, its a set of metal ass cheeks that makes a fart noise. butt, having all the cyberorgans set to the same material is legit a good idea, cus it'd make it a lot more consistent if we want an organ's materials to affect the organ itself. or if we make slag radioactive or something and have all the borgs make everyone's hair fall out. shit, thats a good idea actually, thanks Sov!

Add wheat (dear god)

Okay, so I wanted to add some dynamic wheat that grew or shrank with
the farm fields.

At first I thought - "that's easy! I'll just slap something together
with quads and and a plane!" The issue there was it didn't expand
easily - modifying meshes directly in the code was a headache and
inconsistent. Plus, with how Godot handles materials, we would have
needed to rescale the material's UV each time. This would have
affected all the wheat textures, globally, which would have been a
giant mess.

I also had the idea for the field to "part" as creatures / NPCs walked
through it. The mesh wasn't working, so I was about to shelve that
whole plan, when I had an idea - what if we used Godot's 3D GridMap to
place individual "units" of wheat that could be added and removed
dynamically.

This turned out to be a terrible idea. Not because it didn't work, but
purely because of the art pipeline.

You see, the GridMap requires a resource called a "MeshLibrary". This
is a scene of nothing but meshes that gets converted into a special
format for use with the GridMap. The only issue was that I was making
my "Wheat Cubes" out of three separate meshes instead of one cohesive
mesh. This was translating in the MeshLibrary as a single
upward-facing plane.

So I needed to make a Cube capable of using multiple materials. And
that involved me learning how to use Blender. I was not happy, but I
did it.

I also had to make a texture for the top of the wheat (which I was
happy with) and the side of the wheat (which I am NOT HAPPY WITH). So
I had to put in way more effort than I wanted to and I hate the wheat
vomit texture I made but WE HAVE WHEAT!

Add TREES!

After adding Surt-esque grid textures in the last commit, this commit
adds our first set of obstacles to navigate around: TREES!

I used yet ANOTHER piece of Surt assets, this time from his "Forest
Tiles" asset pack, which I modified using the pallete from his
Blowharder 2 asset pack.

Each tree has two light levels - light and dark. They're just pallete
swaps, but I think eventually we'll have a day/night mode and I want
to swap out the colors to better reflect the light level.

I chose to place all of the trees in the same animation frames. This
allows us to only use one scene to represent all trees. This will make
it easier to randomize trees on-the-fly; and will (probably?) make it
easier to re-use common code and behaviors, like the trees getting
knocked over or bursting into flames.

I eventually want to implement some sort of behavior where powerful
attacks can fell trees - so I tried making the trees physics objects
but they proved to be far too flimsy, falling over and rolling around
at the slightest whim. I'll kick that can until I start implenting
bear vs. clown attacks.

Currently, the trees sprites are set by a combination of light level
and tree type. The sprite is then set automatically - however, the
editor doesn't reflect this change - maybe we should do something
about that...
