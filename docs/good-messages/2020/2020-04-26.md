video: make OSD/subtitle bitmaps refcounted (sort of)

Making OSD/subtitle bitmaps refcounted was planend a longer time ago,
e.g. the sub_bitmaps.packed field (which refcounts the subtitle bitmap
data) was added in 2016. But nothing benefited much from it, because
struct sub_bitmaps was usually stack allocated, and there was this weird
callback stuff through osd_draw().

Make it possible to get actually refcounted subtitle bitmaps on the OSD
API level. For this, we just copy all subtitle data other than the
bitmaps with sub_bitmaps_copy(). At first, I had planned some fancy
refcount shit, but when that was a big mess and hard to debug and just
boiled to emulating malloc(), I made it a full allocation+copy. This
affects mostly the parts array. With crazy ASS subtitles, this parts
array can get pretty big (thousands of elements or more), in which case
the extra alloc/copy could become performance relevant. But then again
this is just pure bullshit, and I see no need to care. In practice, this
extra work most likely gets drowned out by libass murdering a single
core (while mpv is waiting for it) anyway. So fuck it.

I just wanted this so draw_bmp.c requires only a single call to render
everything. VOs also can benefit from this, because the weird callback
shit isn't necessary anymore (simpler code), but I haven't done anything
about it yet. In general I'd hope this will work towards simplifying the
OSD layer, which is prerequisite for making actual further improvements.

I haven't tested some cases such as the "overlay-add" command. Maybe it
crashes now? Who knows, who cares.

In addition, it might be worthwhile to reduce the code duplication
between all the things that output subtitle bitmaps (with repacking,
image allocation, etc.), but that's orthogonal.

Combine Soldier Types Implemented

Combine soldier types (other than default Grunt type) has been added to the mod. No structure change is made, just simple system with percentages is implemented so other combine type can be spawned in game. Percentages are;

Grunt (Default): %40 (https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Combine_Grunt)
Ordinal (Captain): %20 (https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Combine_Ordinal)
Suppressor: %20 (https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Combine_Suppressor)
Charger (Heavy): %20 (https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Combine_Charger)

For example if a wave has 6 combine soldiers to spawn, we'll get 3 Grunts and 1 soldier for each type. This brings new random game-play mechanics to mod because for example Ordinals can deploy Manhacks by themselves, Chargers can generate a shield when they get hurt, you can get pistol and SMG ammo from new combines etc.

Personnel note: I really loved the mod and finished it several times. But I always thought why there is no other types of combines, so I decided to get my hand dirty without any structure change. If you were planning to implement them with another way, just ignore this. If you didn't plan anything about it, you can check my code, it's so basic but it works. I also tried to add them as separate enemy types to enemy matrix (to places which were '???') so we can set enemy type counts separately but I had some trouble with spawn points. I can also generate some new waves after wave 18, I only do it for myself for now.

feat(fig): port rest of defaults role to Fig

Note pain an suffering related to dealing with horrible `defaults`
output format... Even Ansible shies away from dealing with "dict-add"
for this reason.

It is not 100% complete or even necessarily bug free, but it seems
enough to handle my current use cases.

v6.666: A standard revision of the "Official" DOOM FAQ. DOOM II information
added. A large amount of new add-on software, updated information on ports
and more.

--

Happy DOOM Birthday!

It's not often that someone can ask me, "What were you doing at this very
moment, one year ago?" and I would be able to answer. Today, December 10th,
1994, is one of those rare occasions in which I know exactly.

Actually, I'm sure if I asked about half the readers of this FAQ, they would
be able to give me details about their activities too. Most of us were
sitting on Internet (or using every free moment to log on) waiting for DOOM to
be released. I remember staying up most of the night, disappointed when it
wasn't release by 8am EST. I waited, waited, and waited, until finally
everyone located it on "ftp.uwp.edu" all at the same time. Wow! All the
die-hard-DOOM-fans-to-be let out a sigh of release as the suspense was lifted.

In retrospect, it has been an incredible experience. After 11 revisions and
thousands of pieces of E-mail, I'm still alive and sane! DOOM has taken up a
large portion of my life (it's so addictive) and now, here I am, one year,
later.

I hope everyone enjoys this "Anniversary Edition" of the "Official" DOOM FAQ
v6.666. It contains DOOM I and DOOM II information, the latest on DOOM ports,
and all the coolest add-on utilities.

Now, I have a feeling it's going to all start over again with Quake! Watch
for the game in late 1995 from id. Although this may or may not be last
"Official" DOOM FAQ, it will definitely be awhile until the next
revision--this covers just about everything.

Above all, "Keep on DOOMing!"

v5.0: A major revision of the "Official" DOOM FAQ. DOOM is released. FAQ is
completely rewritten. FAQ tells about troubleshooting, cheating, and add-on
software. New additions to DOOM iNsAnItY.

--

FINALLY! After 344 days of waiting after the press release, DOOM was released
on time. The game we all have been waiting for is BETTER than anyone even
expected it to be! I would like to thank all the "Usenetters" out there for not
making me eat my (or other people's) socks, and for not nuking my house. I know
there was a temptation, but id Software saved me!  Anyway, I hope you enjoy
this version of the FAQ. I hope this one answers all the questions you can
possibly dream up about DOOM! After all, it almost doubles the size of v2.6 of
the FAQ, and is about one-twentieth of the size of the actual game!

Currently, I have only seen the shareware version of the game. A small amount
of the information may not pertain to the mail-order or commercial version, but
most is accurate for all versions.

v5.6: A minor revision of the "Official" DOOM FAQ. New add-on software is
added. Many grammatic problems fixed.  The secrets section is rewritten.

--

Well, it has been another two months, but it's back!  After a lot of hard work
from DOOM add-on developers, some decent utilities have been created.  Map
editors, sound editors, graphics editors, cheating utilities, DOOM shells,
serial drivers, and new DOOM levels have all been released!  There are
hundreds of them, but don't despair.  This FAQ has a very complete catalog of
DOOM add-ons, including places to get them.  Here are just a few I recommend
checking out.

I have been playing DOOM for a long time now, and still am not bored of it.
However, for people who have gotten tired of it (or people just looking for
something new), I recommend checking out "hockey10.zip" by Seth Cohn.  This
amazing DOOM patch and PWAD creates a unique multi-player death hockey (yes, I
said "death hockey") game for DOOM.  This is hours of excitement.

The DOOM Hall of Fame: Collectors Edition is just that -- a classic.  If you
are looking for a great collection of LMPs, this is for you.  It contains a
LMP for every level that reveals all the secrets, plus some very strange LMPs.
"When you finish watching these, you will not only be a veteran at the
techniques and secrets of DOOM, but you will also have seen some of the most
spectacular near-death battles this side of Phobos."

Are you looking for a person to play multi-player DOOM with?  If so, look no
longer.  Jeff Forsyth's DOOM Modem Contact List can help you find a partner.
Check out Chapter [15] for more information.

These are just a few of the best add-on software available for DOOM.  There is
lots more, check out the add-on section of this FAQ.  Anyway, until next time,
have fun, and above all, "keep on DOOMing!"

v5.5: A standard revision of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.  DOOM v1.2 is released,
and information on modem play is added.  DOOM iNsAnItY is released seperately.
A complete list of add-on software, modem init strings, and troubleshooting
guidelines are added.

--

It has been more than two months since the last release of the FAQ, and there
is a lot of good reasons.  I promised to have a FAQ out at around the same
time that DOOM v1.2 was released, but DOOM v1.2 was delayed for about a month
and a half.  I had a hard drive crash, and all of the work I had previously
done on v5.5 of the FAQ was gone.  My E-mail box keeps overflowing, and at the
rate the information is coming in, there would not be ANY way for me to
release the FAQ if I had not drawn the line somewhere.  Anyway, here it is,
the "Official" DOOM FAQ v5.5.

DOOM iNsAnItY was removed (sorry) due to size complaints, but the last edition
of DOOM iNsAnItY has been released with this FAQ.  Look for it in the file
"dinsan55.txt" on the Internet or "dinsan55.zip" on BBSs.  DOOM v1.2 has been
released, which has caused one huge problem: modem support.  After weeding
through hundreds of messages, and with the help of a few others, a list of
modem strings that work with DOOM is included in this FAQ.  I hope one of them
works for you!  "Keep on DOOMing!"
