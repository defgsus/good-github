Allow covariants of __enter__, __aenter__, and @classmethod

The problem we currently have is the return type of classes such as
Client does not allow covariants when subclassing or context manager.
In other words:

```python
class Base:
    def __enter__(self) -> Base:  # XXX
        return self

class Derived(Base):
    ...

with Derived() as derived:
   # The type of derived is Base but not Derived. It is WRONG
    ...
```

There are three approaches to improve type annotations.
1. Just do not type-annotate and let the type checker infer
   `return self`.
2. Use a generic type with a covariant bound
   `_AsyncClient = TypeVar('_AsyncClient', bound=AsyncClient)`
3. Use a generic type `T = TypeVar('T')` or `Self = TypeVar('Self')`

They have pros and cons.
1. It just works and is not friendly to developers as there is no type
   annotation at the first sight. A developer has to reveal its type via
   a type checker. Aslo, documentation tools that rely on type
   annotations lack the type. I haven't found any python docuementation
   tools that rely on type inference to infer `return self`. There are
   some tools simply check annotations.

2. This approach is correct and has a nice covariant bound that adds
   type safety. It is also nice to documentation tools and _somewhat_
   friendly to developers. Type checkers, pyright that I use, always
   shows the the bounded type '_AsyncClient' rather than the subtype.
   Aslo, it requires more key strokes. Not good, not good.

   It is used by `BaseException.with_traceback`
   See https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/4298/files

3. This approach always type checks, and I believe it _will_ be the
   official solution in the future. Fun fact, Rust has a Self type
   keyword. It is slightly unfriendly to documentation, but is simple to
   implement and easy to understand for developers. Most importantly,
   type checkers love it.

   See https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1212

combine-diff: handle --find-object in multitree code path

When doing combined diffs, we have two possible code paths:

  - a slower one which independently diffs against each parent, applies
    any filters, and then intersects the resulting paths

  - a faster one which walks all trees simultaneously

When the diff options specify that we must do certain filters, like
pickaxe, then we always use the slow path, since the pickaxe code only
knows how to handle filepairs, not the n-parent entries generated for
combined diffs.

But there are two problems with the slow path:

 1. It's slow. Running:

      git rev-list HEAD | git diff-tree --stdin -r -c

    in git.git takes ~3s on my machine. But adding "--find-object" to
    that increases it to ~6s, even though find-object itself should
    incur only a few extra oid comparisons. On linux.git, it's even
    worse: 35s versus 215s.

 2. It doesn't catch all cases where a particular path is interesting.
    Consider a merge with parent blobs X and Y for a particular path,
    and end result Z. That should be interesting according to "-c",
    because the result doesn't match either parent. And it should be
    interesting even with "--find-object=X", because "X" went away in
    the merge.

    But because we perform each pairwise diff independently, this
    confuses the intersection code. The change from X to Z is still
    interesting according to --find-object. But in the other parent we
    went from Y to Z, so the diff appears empty! That causes the
    intersection code to think that parent didn't change the path, and
    thus it's not interesting for "-c".

This patch fixes both by implementing --find-object for the multitree
code. It's a bit unfortunate that we have to duplicate some logic from
diffcore-pickaxe, but this is the best we can do for now. In an ideal
world, all of the diffcore code would stop thinking about filepairs and
start thinking about n-parent sets, and we could use the multitree walk
with all of it.

Until then, there are some leftover warts:

  - other pickaxe operations, like -S or -G, still suffer from both
    problems. These would be hard to adapt because they rely on having
    a diff_filespec() for each path to look at content. And we'd need to
    define what an n-way "change" means in each case (probably easy for
    "-S", which can compare counts, but not so clear for -G, which is
    about grepping diffs).

  - other options besides --find-object may cause us to use the slow
    pairwise path, in which case we'll go back to producing a different
    (wrong) answer for the X/Y/Z case above.

We may be able to hack around these, but I think the ultimate solution
will be a larger rewrite of the diffcore code. For now, this patch
improves one specific case but leaves the rest.
