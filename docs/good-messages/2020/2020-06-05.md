tweaks the print plugin

The print plugin is probably the oldest plugin in BAP, and it was
really crying out for a little bit of attention and love. Not that I
was able to give it what it wants, but here are some tweaks that
hopefully will make our life easier (and nicer). Here is the list of
new features

1) `-dcfg` - will now print graphs of all subroutines as subgraphs
   enclosed in partitions, as well as print the interprocedural
   edges. This will also let `xdot` and other tools that didnt'
   understand several digraphs in row to work with bap directly, e.g.,
   `bap ./exe -dcfg | xdot -`

2) `-dgraph` is the new outputting format which is basically the same
   as `-dcfg` but without the IR terms (i.e., only basic blocks, no
   def terms). Also partitioned and with interprocedural edges.

3) tid numbers are properly escaped now (it looks like that dot or
   xdot interprets somehow them even if they are delimited with quotes)

4) new mechanism for filtering the output, instead of old
   `--print-symbol` and `--print-section` (which are still supported) we
   now have a new `--print-matching` filter that accepts
   `<property>:<regex>` format. The `<property>` field could be for
   now one of `section`, `segment`, `symbol`, or `name`. Where
   `symbol` now denotes the name of the symbol take from the file
   symbol table or accompanying debugging information, e.g.,
   dwarf. Not that symbol that we reconstructed during the
   disassembling. And `name` has the same meaning that `symbol` was
   bearing before, i.e., the name of a subroutine. Concerning the
   regular expression, the accepted syntax is PCRE with partial
   matches, e.g., `--print-matching=section:text` will match with
   `.text` and `texting`. Use `\b` to specify word boundaries, e.g.,
   `--print-matching='symbol:\bmain\b' will print only `main` (and not
   `__libc_start_main`). Do not forget to delimit the regex with
   single quotes, to prevent your shell from ringing the bell.

A Bug in Graphviz
=================

A side note on graphviz dot (and xdot). Due to a 20 years old
[bug][1] (supposedly finally fixed in version 2.40) dot is usually unable
to render more or less complex graphs. This bug is triggered randomly
and depends on many variables (like fonts, subroutine names, etc). It
manifests itself as a message (not visible when xdot is used) and
afterwards `dot` (and correspondigly xdot) will just hang up and stale
for infinity
```
Error: trouble in init_rank
	%0 1
	%0 1
	%0 1
        <lots of tid-looking identifiers>
```

I was using version 2.40 (via docker alpine) and was able to render
some complex graphs, but I believe I'm still hitting this issue on
some graphs even in version 2.40.

Arms APL Update

Update to the Arms APL. Very large DPS increases with Rend and Massacre, and a smaller DPS increase to Fervor of Battle. Changes to better account for a few different Major Essence choices, leading to a DPS increase for Condensed Life Force and Blood of the Enemy. Updated a few racial lines for the better. Most of these changes are larger increases the more Expedient you have.

Mostly comprehensive change list: 
1) Rewrote precombat lines for Memory of Lucid Dreams and Guardian of Azeroth to account for shorter fight timings, leading to large dps increases for 2 minute and 3 minute fights. 
2) Added conditionals to force certain potions for precombat based on essence choice.
3) Updated the second potion line.
4) Updated the usage of Ashvane's Razor Coral.
5) Updated Blood of the Enemy, Guardian of Azeroth, and Memory of Lucid Dreams lines.
6) Added Rend to the Execute section of the APL as well as changed its priority in the Single Target section.
7) Changed some conditionals for casting Execute.
8) Changed some conditionals for casting Whirlwind.

           If I had to restart the whole journey of educating myself on

           the following books would be what Iâ€™d buy for myself today.
           I recommend reading these books sequentially or based on the

           <p>Web developers are found working in various types of organizations,

Some web developers work for one organization as a permanent full-time employee, while others may work as independent consultants, or as contractors for an agency or at home personal use. Web developers typically 
               handle both server-side and front-end logic. This usually involves 
               implementing all the visual elements that users see and 
               use in the web applications or use, as well as all the 
               web services that are necessary to power the usage of their developing work.

Reduce result discount in conSize

Ticket #18282 showed that the result discount given by conSize
was massively too large.  This patch reduces that discount to
a constant 10, which just balances the cost of the constructor
application itself.

Note [Constructor size and result discount] elaborates, as
does the ticket #18282.

Reducing result discount reduces inlining, which affects perf.  I
found that I could increase the unfoldingUseThrehold from 80 to 90 in
compensation; in combination with the result discount change I get
these overall nofib numbers:

 Geometric Mean          -0.3%     -0.0%     -3.0%     -2.9%     -0.3%

I'm ok with these numbers, remembering that this change removes
an *exponential* increase in code size in some in-the-wild cases.

I investigated compress2.  The difference is entirely caused by this
function no longer inlining

WriteRoutines.$woutputCodes
  = \ (w :: [CodeEvent]) ->
      let result_s1Sr
            = case WriteRoutines.outputCodes_$s$woutput w 0# 0# 8# 9# of
                (# ww1, ww2 #) -> (ww1, ww2)
      in (# case result_s1Sr of (x, _) ->
              map @Int @Char WriteRoutines.outputCodes1 x
         , case result_s1Sr of { (_, y) -> y } #)

It was right on the cusp before, driven by the excessive result
discount.  Too bad!

HOLY SHIT, LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS LAD

this adds windows support to the engine, unfortunately for some god forsaken reason i cant do it statically so you gotta run the exe file inside of the windows folder

adds:
includes for SDL2
libraries for SDL2
makefile support for SDL2 (make a.exe)
this was painful so im gonna go sleebp now
