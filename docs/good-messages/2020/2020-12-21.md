Merge #13439: rpc: Avoid "duplicate" return value for invalid submitblock

f74894480 Only set fNewBlock to true in AcceptBlock when we write to disk (Matt Corallo)
fa6e49731 rpc: Avoid "duplicate" return value for invalid submitblock (MarcoFalke)

Pull request description:

  This is #13395 with one more commit tacked on. MarcoFalke got tired of dealing with the stupidity of fixing a return code with too many rounds of review (not that I blame him). Honestly we should probably have no return whatsoever, but for now, this fixes it (as well as nLastBlockTime for eviction purposes).

  Original description:

  When `submitblock` of an invalid block, the return value should not be `"duplicate"`.

  This is only seen when the header was previously found (denoted by the incorrectly named boolean `fBlockPresent`). Fix this bug by removing `fBlockPresent`.

[MIRROR] Removes roundstart miasma, from everything. (#2202)

* Removes roundstart miasma. Yes, even the gibs that are marked as miasma producers. Fuck you. Carbons now start listening for death at init, then get the component when they die. Gibs behave just as they used to. (#55343)

Proposal of collaboration

Hi Rowan, I'm a computer scientist with training as an actor for 10 years from Barcelona.
I would like to give a Christmas present to my aunts. They love botanic, history of science, British culture and long lived disciplined searches.
I was thinking on arranging a video call with you so they could ask you about Darwin's garden. In exchange I could help in any programming task that is blocking you or you haven't had the chance to start. Please take this proposal with affection and seriousness as it comes from the deepest of respects to your vocation.
I hope to hear from you! lau.llobet+payas@gmail.com
