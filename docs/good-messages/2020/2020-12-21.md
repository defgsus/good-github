not-really-christmas update

happy jesus day you guys. i'm going to feebly attempt to list the new stuff here:
- wildcard now actually shows you what card you get rather than just naming it
- new, boring jester finale card: "face the music"
- the ncr thief card "pirate a better version off the web" has been renamed "software update"
- i submitted more bugs to my issues page lol
- nerfed bonecrusher; what i was going for with the double damage thing has been separately added as Magic Axe
- more work toward weaken<>reduce swap (which hopefully will never ever exist)
- more work toward curse<>lock swap which i just decided should be a thing. already had some stuff in this vein from more swaps so i added that in.
- added scanner, the worst equipment ever, and fun fact!, the worst gadget ever
- made a little more progress on ncr thief's generator
- added more stuff to more generators
- added a cool little warrior gimmick card. "fast forward", makes your skillcard shift again mid-turn
- more currently unused items, yay. highlights: four movable steel plates, sunglasses at night, flamebringer
- other shit? idk

DAY 14 - 16

Hmm, some oncall duties and some other personal matter stop me from doing this. ALSO evil day 13, shite about Chinese remainder theorem. SMH

Anyway, here are my solutions for day 14 - 16

2020 day nineteen, part one

Oh boy, getting into the weeds on this one. I did lexer/parser earlier tonight, and now
I'm off implementing NFA/DFA from the same textbook.

I noticed that other ppl on the private leaderboard had only finished p1 of d19, so I
am a little worried about the p2 twist (again). OTOH, this was kinda fun...

New vector library and small stylistic changes

The old vector library was an overengineered piece of trash that
deserves to burn in hell. I'm not sure if I should be ashamed that I
wrote that shit, or proud that I was able to make such a complex thing.

Anyway, I have finally started working in this engine again and I hope I
will continue to do so. Next up on my list is loading obj files and
lighting.

"9:55am. As a reward for myself, let me take a small vacation today. Maybe I'll skip the morning session. I went to bed really late, but I still got up at this time. Let me chill a bit, and then I will talk about what is on my mind.

10:45am. I am almost done having my fun.

10:55am. I'll save the Toji No Miko game subs for later. Let me gather my thoughts.

Ever since I closed for the day yesterday, my energy level was very high to the point of interfering with my sleep, so I am letting some of it loose by slacking.

11:05am. I am thinking. Let me just write a thought down. This wasn't what I wanted to rant about, but since it is at the forefront of my mind, let me do it.

```fs
    use client = new RequestSocket()
    client.Connect(uri_client)
```

I am should make this a pub socket. Looking at the supervisor now, I think I am mostly set, but a request socket can only interface with a single server. I can't really use it to send errors to more than one destination.

11:25am. Had to step away for a bit, let me resume my train of thought.

I remember thinking in the past that VS Code's providers should really have just taken in observables, but I was wrong. Having providers send requests themselves means that a single language server can serve multiple editor instances.

If VS Code had the design I'd have suggested, I would be in real trouble now.

As things stack, I am in a really good position at the moment. All I need to do is change the request socket to a pub one, and the response on to a sub one on the VS Code side and I am good.

This is remarkable. I though about this months ago, and making Spiral support multiple editor instances within a single server seemed a lot more difficult back then. I forgot what the reason for that was. It does not matter.

11:30am. After changing the sockets, the only real change I need to make in order to make the plugin publication ready is to have it start the server on its own. I'll try it with a hardcoded path at first.

Hmmm...since the user won't have the command line open on the side, it would not be bad if Hopac's uncaught exceptions could be rerouted as fatal errors in the editor.

11:35am. Well, after that, there is also the matter of publishing the language. I am not familiar with how this should be done on the VS Code marketplace.

I think since I am going to be doing this, it is finally time that I clean up the repo of all the previous stuff and merge it with master. Actually, I'll merge and then clean up. Yesterday when I tried doing CFR I was surprised to find my memory scrambled. But even though I've forgotten where I put some things, the stuff in `Games`, `Learning` and `Cuda` folder is still valuable. I want to leave it around in some repo.

In fact, the poker game that is in Games might be a worthy project of porting to v0.2.

It is just, the whole solution has too much stuff in it right now, and I want to start with a clear slate in master. I'll get rid of all the pre-v0.2 stuff and clean up some of the v0.2 stuff as well.

11:50am. I am thinking. All the goals I have in mind are easy to describe, but some like publishing the plugin and packaging it with the language will require research time. I won't rush this. It probably won't take this long, but I'll give myself a few days to get this out of the way.

11:55am. I never thought I'd be doing it this soon, so it is no wonder I am excited. I was expecting that I would be doing this months from now.

But it is not like the language is unusable in its current form. I'll say it is prerelease alpha, and test it while it is out along with filling out the new documentation.

12pm. Right...it is good to spend some time just planning things out. Desires without steps to achieve them are just empty dreams. But dreams with steps to attain them will eventually become reality. You first desire the dream, then you forget the dream and desire the steps themselves.

12:05pm. The other point I want to dwell on is something I've mentioned yesterday.

One strong desire I have compared to before is not to do things from the command line.

This is actually my main anxiety right now. I do not want to drop Avalonia, Hopac and Rx just because I will be moving to Spiral.

I want to cement this desire. I will absolutely not give up these advantages that were so hard to get. I will not go back to being a command line loser again. I am not sure what I will do, but I will make it my priority to be able to do concurrency and GUIs from Spiral, whether that means having bindings to these libraries or figuring out how to do a hybrid approach.

12:15pm. Forget the CFR. Forget ML. Those things I've already done 100s of times before.

What I should be doing are GUIs. Those should be my next project in Spiral. ML is easy.

It used to be the hard part - but I have Spiral. It is not going to be an obstacle. For the next few months, what I should be my main aim is getting comfortable with making ML interactive.

That poker game in `Games` - why don't I make it interactive? Why not do a poker game in the way that it should be done?

Interactivity will be important every step of the way - for the sake of training agents, I will need my control center. I will need interactive games in order to play against the agents myself. And once I have good agents, I am not going to be directing their attacks against the gamling dens from the command line.

12:20pm. In fact...let me elaborate those ideas.

Back in late 2016, I really meant Spiral to be a code generator for an F# ML library.

Now that Spiral is no longer a run-and-done compiler, but a memoizing server, it might be worth considering that vision again.

I haven't really figured out yet how to make use of the F# compiler from F# itself. But there are possibilities.

12:25pm. Months ago, I've seen in preview that Fabulous can do UIs with hot-reloading. I need to explore possibilities in this direction.

There is nothing wrong with scripting languages - Spiral is fast, but performance is a means to an end. A whole program optimizing compiler like it is ideal for doing the backend. It would be great for compiling the core logic of my agents.

But I should not be obligated to do everything in it. What I am obligated is to use it to maximum possible effect.

12:30pm. Interafaces - I am not done with them. My work in the Lithe repo was just the first taste. And the concurrency work I did this year was just the first taste as well. I finally know how to do this properly. I need to go further. I need to keep exercising those skills. I've just made them a part of the new foundation.

12:35pm. Oh yeah. I forgot something - if there are multiple VS Code instances, which one own the server? When should the server close?

I actually don't know how to deal with that at all. I thought about this before, but drew a blank. I know how to check if an instance exists, but not more than that.

Let me stop here for the morning."

"2:15pm. Let stop reading Fang Yuan's demonic adventure or I will never end the break. Let me watch the Toji ep and I will focus my mind on work.

3pm. Done with the break.

I had my bit of fun. Now my tension is up and I want to do some work.

It is time to get things done. This will be the real deal. First of all, let me get the socket thing out of the way. No need to dawdle on this. Let me do the change and then I will test it out.

```fs
    use client = new PublisherSocket()
    client.Connect(uri_client)

    use __ = queue_client.ReceiveReady.Subscribe(fun x ->
        x.Queue.Dequeue() |> Json.serialize |> client.SendFrame
        client.ReceiveMultipartMessage() |> ignore
        )
```

This should not be receiving things anymore let me remove that last line.

Let me change things on the VS Code side next. Focus me, focus. Let me get a move on.

```fs
    use client = new PublisherSocket()
    client.Bind(uri_client)

    use __ = queue_client.ReceiveReady.Subscribe(fun x ->
        x.Queue.Dequeue() |> Json.serialize |> client.SendFrame
        )
```

Forgot that I also need to swap the binds and connects.

3:10pm. Hmmm...

```ts
    let isProcessing = true;
    (async () => {
        const sock = new zmq.Subscriber()
        sock.receiveTimeout = 2000
        await sock.connect(uriClient)
        while (isProcessing) {
            try {
                const [x] = await sock.receive()
                const msg: ClientRes = JSON.parse(x.toString())
                if ("PackageErrors" in msg) { errorsSet(errorsProject, Uri.parse(msg.PackageErrors.uri), msg.PackageErrors.errors) }
                else if ("TokenizerErrors" in msg) { errorsSet(errorsTokenization, Uri.parse(msg.TokenizerErrors.uri), msg.TokenizerErrors.errors) }
                else if ("ParserErrors" in msg) { errorsSet(errorsParse, Uri.parse(msg.ParserErrors.uri), msg.ParserErrors.errors) }
                else if ("TypeErrors" in msg) { errorsSet(errorsType, Uri.parse(msg.TypeErrors.uri), msg.TypeErrors.errors) }
                else if ("FatalError" in msg) { window.showErrorMessage(msg.FatalError) }
                else { const _ : never = msg }
            } catch (e) {
                if (e.errno === 11) { } // If the error is a timeout just repeat.
                else { throw e }
            }
        }
        await sock.disconnect(uriServer)
    })();
```

Let me go with this for the time being, but I am not sure if this will be enough. I know that pub/sub sockets might need to have the first entry as their filter. I forgot how that worked. Let me try this and then I will remind myself if it fails.

3:15pm. It is as I feared. Errors do not show up. I need to refresh my memory of how pub/sub sockets work.

https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Pub-Sub-Message-Envelopes

Ah, it says it is optional.

3:20pm. Ok, I do not think not having keys is why my sends are failing. Let me see what is going on the VS Code side. I'll put some print statements in there.

```fs
        window.showInformationMessage("Connecting...")
        await sock.connect(uriClient)
        window.showInformationMessage("Connected.")
```

Things are not happening the way I thought they would. For some reason, this does not finish connecting. Then the error is on the server side.

```fs
    use client = new PublisherSocket()
    client.Bind(uri_client)
```

But I did make sure to bind the client.

3:25pm. Things like this happen. I wanted to do this in the morning session, but when I looked at the clock it was 11:45 and I did not feel like starting anything new. I made the right choice. Right now I have no idea what is going on. It is definitely not good to rush situations like this.

I have no idea. I will have to look at the Lithe examples again.

```
    module Weather =
        let uri = "ipc://weather"
        let server (log : string -> unit) (poller : NetMQPoller) =
            try let rand = Random()
                init PublisherSocket poller (bind uri) <| fun pub ->
                log <| sprintf "Publisher has bound to %s." uri
                use __ = pub.SendReady.Subscribe(fun _ ->
                    // get values that will fool the boss
                    let zipcode, temperature, relhumidity = rand.Next 100000, (rand.Next 215) - 80, (rand.Next 50) + 10
                    sprintf "%05d %d %d" zipcode temperature relhumidity |> pub.SendFrame
                    )
                poller.Run()
            with e -> log e.Message

        let client' uri (filter : string) (log : string -> unit) (poller : NetMQPoller) =
            try init SubscriberSocket poller (connect uri) <| fun sub ->
                SubscriberSocket.subscribe sub filter <| fun _ ->
                log <| sprintf "Client has connected to %s and subscribed to the topic %s." uri filter
                let i = ref 0
                let total_temp = ref 0
                use __ = sub.ReceiveReady.Subscribe(fun _ ->
                    if !i < 100 then
                        let update = sub.ReceiveFrameString()
                        let zipcode, temperature, relhumidity =
                            let update' = update.Split()
                            (int update'.[0]),(int update'.[1]),(int update'.[2])
                        total_temp := !total_temp + temperature
                        incr i
                        log (sprintf "Average temperature for zipcode '%s' since the start of the sequence is %dF" filter (!total_temp / !i))
                    else
                        poller.Stop()
                    )
                poller.Run()
            with e -> log e.Message

        let client = client' uri
```

Hmmmm. I don't know.

Let me make a sub socket on the F# side just to check that things are working fine there. I need a sanity check.

```fs
    use sub = new SubscriberSocket()
    sub.Connect(uri_client)
    use __ = sub.ReceiveReady.Subscribe(fun x ->
        let q = x.Socket.ReceiveMultipartMessage()
        printfn "%A" q
        )
```

This is not receiving anything.

3:40pm.

```fs
    use sub = new SubscriberSocket()
    sub.Connect(uri_client)
    use __ = sub.ReceiveReady.Subscribe(fun x ->
        printfn "Ready to receive."
        let q = x.Socket.ReceiveMultipartMessage()
        printfn "Got: %A" q
        )
```

I can't figure this out. I guess I'll have to keep grinding away at it until I do. ZeroMQ is so nasty in that it essentially forces you to do assembly programming in disguise.

No type safety anywhere.

...No, nothing. The sub socket is just not getting anything.

```fs
    use sub = new SubscriberSocket()
    sub.Connect(uri_client)
    sub.SubscribeToAnyTopic()
    use __ = sub.ReceiveReady.Subscribe(fun x ->
        printfn "Ready to receive."
        let q = x.Socket.ReceiveMultipartMessage()
        printfn "Got: %A" q
        )
```

Ah you son of a bitch.

Let me try this.

```fs
    use sub = new SubscriberSocket()
    poller.Add(sub)
    sub.Connect(uri_client)
    sub.SubscribeToAnyTopic()
    use __ = sub.ReceiveReady.Subscribe(fun x ->
        printfn "Ready to receive."
        let q = x.Socket.ReceiveMultipartMessage()
        printfn "Got: %A" q
        )
```

Agh, I forgot to add it to the poller as well.

Yeah, this works now. I need both the poller add and the subscribe.

```ts
        const sock = new zmq.Subscriber()
        sock.subscribe()
```

So I should do this on the TS side as well.

But the problem on the TS side is that I can't get it to even connect.

```ts
const uriClient = `tcp://*:${port+1}`
```

Ah, I forgot - wasn't there some trouble with the shape of these addresses last time?

```fs
let uri_server = sprintf "tcp://*:%i" port
let uri_client = sprintf "tcp://localhost:%i" (port+1)
```

On the F# side, since I am binding, let me use `*` for both of these.

```ts
const uriServer = `tcp://localhost:${port}`
const uriClient = `tcp://localhost:${port+1}`
```

On the client side, let me `localhost`.

This was a thing before, but it took me a while to jog my memory of things.

I think now the sub should work on the VS Code side. Let me give it a try.

3:55pm. Yeah, it is fine now. The errors are back online.

I like the changes from an aesthetic perspective. I no longer have the server both binding and connecting to the client. The client is only making connections, and the server is only doing the the binds. That is how you know it is a server.

Right now the distinction between the two is very clear.

This was also a conceptually trivial change, it took me almost an hour to do because of ZeroMQ has little type safety. I was right to be suspicious of how long this could take me.

4pm. Well, it is behind me now. Let me commit this.

With this the server will be fully capable of interacting with multiple clients. No problem there anymore."

"4:10pm. Some ideas are coming to me.

The biggest challenge for this next part is not necessarily in the starting the process, but in closing it instead. I keep wondering whether there is a way of keeping track which processes referencing the server, something like ref counting at the process level, but who am I kidding? There is no way that is possible.

Instead what I should do is implement heart-beating.

Just have the editor instances send a `Ping` message every 1s. If the server gets nothing in the last 2s, then it can assume the editor has closed and shut itself down in response.

Hmmmm...

---

Timer
=====

A `NetMQTimer` allows actions to be performed periodically. Timer instances may be added to a `NetMQPoller`, and their
`Elapsed` event will fire according to the specified `Interval` and `Enabled` property values.

The event is raised on the poller's thread.

``` csharp
var timer = new NetMQTimer(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(100));
timer.Elapsed += (sender, args) => { /* handle timer event */ };
using (var poller = new NetMQPoller { timer })
{
    poller.Run();
}
```

---

I can just use this in order to check whether the time has elapsed every 2s.

4:20pm. https://netmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/timer/

I do not know why, but the timer code is squished in the docs for some reason. I'll inform the author.

4:30pm. Opened an issue.

Forget this.

What is next? Ah, yes. I think I know enough to do heart beating, but something is bothering me.

```ts
        sock.heartbeatInterval
        sock.heartbeatTimeToLive
        sock.heartbeatTimeout
```

What are these things? I see them in autocomplete. Does NetMQ have this too?

```fs
    server.Options.HeartbeatInterval
    server.Options.HeartbeatTimeout
    server.Options.HeartbeatTtl
```

Yes, it does.

4:35pm.

Hmmmm...I should familiarize myself with what this does before I do my own heart beating.

https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter4/#Heartbeating

I have no idea. Let me just read this. I can't find the documentation for those options.

5:05pm. Had to take a break.

I seem to be doing that a bit too much today.

I've thought about it. Let me just check out how an empty union would be serialized.

```fs
type T =
    | A of int
    | B of int
    | C of bool

let x : T = FSharp.Json.Json.serialize(C true) |> FSharp.Json.Json.deserialize
printfn "%A" x
```

I seem to be relearning that empty union cases do not work with this. Instead I'll have to include a field with every message. Ok.

```fs
            | HoverAt x -> job_val (fun res -> supervisor *<+ SupervisorReq.HoverAt(x,res))
            | BuildFile x -> job_null (supervisor *<+ SupervisorReq.BuildFile x)
            | Ping _ -> failwith "TODO"
```

Let me add this stump case for now.

5:25pm.

```
Unhandled exception. NetMQ.AddressAlreadyInUseException: Exception of type 'NetMQ.AddressAlreadyInUseException' was thrown.

```

I am thinking. This exception being thrown when the address is in use is not a problem. If the plugin tries to start a process while one already exists then this will just cause it to abort. This saves me the trouble of having to do special checking. If a process already exists, then the one trying to muscle in aborting is what I want.

Since the user won't be able to see the terminal, he won't notice the difference.

Good.

That is one issue down without even having to lift a finger.

5:30pm. I've planned out how to do simple heartbeating so that ceased to be a worry.

There is one last thing I need to think through before I can move forward.

I need to come to an understanding of how the compiler itself should be bundled with the VS Code plugin.

5:35pm. `C:\Users\Marko\Source\Repos\The Spiral Language\The Spiral Language v0.2 (typechecking)\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1`

There is a lot of stuff in here. 17mb.

5:40pm. Let me make an experiment. What I will do is redirect the compilation to the plugin directory.

...Er, I have no idea how to do this.

```
<PackageReference Include="FSharp.Control.Reactive" Version="4.4.0" />
<PackageReference Include="FSharpx.Async" Version="1.14.1" />
```

Do I need these two packages?

5:45pm. Let me try removing them. I should also try upgrading to Core 5.

...No, I have no option to to change the target framework. Nevermind that.

5:50pm. ...Let me upgrade NetMQ to the latest version. I should also upgrade the F# Core...

Ok, let me just try running to see if updating my dependencies broke anything.

5:55pm. No, it is fine.

Ok, now I have the urge to do is to clean up everything in the Spiral repo and merge with master. But I will leave that for later.

It is close, but it is not the time for that yet.

I know how to implement whatever I need so the plugin runs the compiler. I know how to make the server close automatically as well.

All those details I will manage.

Right now, I have some easy seeming tasks that I need to clear.

1) Figure out how to redirect the compilation result into the plugin directory.

I need to do some research on how F#'s compilation pipeline works.

2) How exactly do I publish the plugin + compiler. I'll assume a folder contains all that I need. Do I zip that and then send it to the VS Code marketplace somehow?

No doubt, there is a way to automate all these steps.

I need to be on guard that I do not send the debug version online by accident.

6pm. More broadly, I can frame the task ahead of me in 3 steps.

1) Bundlings. Making sure the complation output goes into the right place where the plugin is. Making the pipeline to easily publish the plugin. Making a check so I do not send a debug version by accident.
2) Cleanup. It is time to move from the v0.2 to master. I'll do that along with cleaning up all those v0.09 projects.
3) Implementation. I need the plugin to start the server automatically. I also need to implement heartbeating on both sides.

I think tomorrow I will start with the second one. I can get that out of the way without disturbing anything else.

6:35pm. Done with lunch. Let me close here.

I'll do the second one first tomorrow, and then figure out the compilation, bundling and publishing. Then I will do the implementation which won't be too difficult.

I know I haven't really done much today, but I really needed some time to slow down a bit and think about what the next move should be.

I think I should be able to manage all of the above tomorrow. After that I'll get started on the docs. I'll tone down the crazy, and crank up the business."

# Commands used in StackSkills' Git Introductory Course

.gitignore {this is a file, denoted by the "." at the beginning}

- Create the .gitignore file by using the touch command
   $ touch .gititnore

- Edit the new file using the nano command
  $ nano .gititnore

- Enter these commands into the .gitignore file.
  \*.log {\# no log files}

  \!error.log {\# but do track error.log, even though you're ignoring .log files above}

  /TODO {\# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO}

    build/ {\# ignore all file in the build/ directory}

  doc/*.txt {# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt}

    doc/**/*.pdf {# ignore all .pdf files int he doc/ directory}

  *Example:* ![txt in a .gitignore file](./gitignore.png)

cat {something}

- cat opens a file

  >cat {text file}
  >
  >- opens the text file and displays the text

  >cat HEAD
  >
  >- opens the head file in the .git folder

  >cat master
  >
  >- opens the master file in the .git folder
  >- see NOTE for git commit below.

  >cat index
  >
  >- opens the index file in the .git folder

cd ~users/

- ~~Must go out to the repository location on local machine...I think, one dir at a time.~~
- for directories that begin with a dot (.), e.g. .ssh or .git, you don't need the tilda (~)
- `cd {dir}` is all you need to open up the next directory.

cd ..

- This takes you back to the previous directory

dir

- lists content of current directory

git add

- add file to index (staging area)
- **NOTE:** You must add the file to the staging area (index) *before* you can commit the changes.
- adding a dot (.) after a space at the end of the `git add` command, e.g. `git add .` adds all the files in the directory.

git checkout -- file.txt

- checks out specified file from the repository. Replaces local files.

git checkout .

- checks out all files and all directories in/below the current dir

git clean -xdf

- delete all untracked files and directories
- -x = ignore rules for getting the file
- d = directory, meaning folders and what's inside
- f = force or forms...can't tell with the accent

git clone [URL or SSH]

- Retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL or SSH.
- **NOTE:** Remember to initialize or reinitialize the target directory.

git commit

- commit file

  > git commit -m "commit messag"
  >
  > - commit file and include a commit message.

  > git commit --amend -m "commit message"
  >
  > - Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit, but can be used to amend a merge commit

- **NOTE:** When you go to the .git folder (cd .git) and look at the master files, the number there is the number of the last commit.

git diff

- shows unstaged changes

git fetch

- will not download new content

git gui&

- opens Git Gui

git init

- creates an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one.
- use this when you add a new repository clone to an existing Git directory.

  - navigate to the folder and run `git init` in that folder.
  - when you create the new clone and save it to your local machine, this is the defaulted location.

gitk

- brings up a big-ass window
- shows history of all changes

git log

git log --pretty=oneline

- removes Author and Data lines and puts the hash and -m on a single line.

git ls-tree {commit token for tree}

- don't need entire commit token, just first 5 or so characters

git merge

git pull

- combines git fetch and git merge into one command

git push [alias] [branch]

- transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch

git reset -- file.txt

- returns files that have been staged to regular modified status.

git reset HEAD^^ (HEAD~2)

- the carrots (^) indicate the number of commits we need to go back

- (HEAD~2) if the number of commits needed to go back is large, use this instead of the carrots

git reset --soft HEAD~{number of commits back to go}

- can move files back to the index or file system
- the carrots (^) indicate the number of commits we need to go back
- (HEAD~2) if the number of commits needed to go back is large, use this instead of the carrots

git reset --mixed HEAD^{each ^ is 1 commit back to go}

- this is the default mode. can move a file directly back to the file system
- the carrots (^) indicate the number of commits we need to go back
- (HEAD~2) if the number of commits needed to go back is large, use this instead of the carrots

git reset --hard

- deletes changes completely. cannot restore.

git revert \<sha1>

- \<sha1> is the hash line for the commit you want to revert obtained from the git log command.- can type the entire hash OR just the first 5 letters.- opens a VERY OLD Unix text editor:
  - Press i on your keyboard to enter Insert mode then add the commit message (see screenshot in Markdown file).
      ![Insert Mode](./git_revert.png)
  - When finished, press [esc], then : then wq (w = writer, q = quit). Press Enter (see second screenshot).
            ![Insert Mode](./git_revert2.png)
  - ![Insert Mode](./git_revert3.png)
  - To escape the editor without adding a commit message, press [esc], then : then q!. Press Enter.

git show -s --pretty=raw {commit token}

- don't need entire commit token, just first 5 or so characters

nano {text file}

- opens file in an editor. Remeber ^S to save and ^X to exit.

touch {file}

- add file to repository
- can include local path to the file if it isn't already in the local repository.
- doesn't seem to work. It's a Linux command so maybe that's why.
  - ==looks like it just creates empty files==, so you have to put content into them.

To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To dieâ€”to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dreamâ€”ay, there's the rub:
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pauseâ€”there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.

Proposal of collaboration

Hi Rowan, I'm a computer scientist with training as an actor for 10 years from Barcelona.
I would like to give a Christmas present to my aunts. They love botanic, history of science, British culture and long lived disciplined searches.
I was thinking on arranging a video call with you so they could ask you about Darwin's garden. In exchange I could help in any programming task that is blocking you or you haven't had the chance to start. Please take this proposal with affection and seriousness as it comes from the deepest of respects to your vocation.
I hope to hear from you! lau.llobet+payas@gmail.com
