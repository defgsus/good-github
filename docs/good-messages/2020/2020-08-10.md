Fix: object materials: many bugs and omissions for material hatred

This started out with me trying to add a special case to searmsg(),
which then turned into making the searmsg() code xhity-compatible, i.e.
working regardless of who the defender and aggressor are (or even having
no aggressor), and ballooned into fixing a ton of things that did not
work correctly with regards to the material hatred system.

Changes to functions:
- searmsg now takes a fourth argument, a boolean representing that the
  message should be minimal; e.g. "The silver sears foo's flesh!" or
  "foo is seared!" instead of "Your silver longsword sears foo's flesh!"
- searmsg now uses "recoil" rather than "flinch" because it makes for
  slightly better and less verbose sentence structure.
- New function, attack_contact_slots, which determines based on a monster
  attack what gear slots if any should be counted as the defender hating
  it.  For instance, attack_contact_slots of an AT_CLAW attack will
  return the glove and ring slots.
- mon_hates_material now correctly determines that a player infected
  with lycanthropy but not transformed should hate silver.
- All the functions above are now xhity-compatible.

Bugs fixed:
- Hate_material didn't detect a vampshifted player (one who has
  #monster'd into fog or wolf or bat form but can #monster again to
  resume vampire form). Now, Hate_material is just a shorthand for
  mon_hates_material, which didn't previously include a case for a
  non-transformed player with lycanthropy.
- Monster hitting player with a weapon in melee combat applied material
  damage twice.
- Player hitting monster with a weapon in melee combat applied material
  damage twice.
- hates_material() didn't test is_elf() for iron hatred, meaning that
  it didn't apply to elvish monsters that are not S_ELF.

Omitted cases that should have caused material damage but didn't:
- Player hitting self in the foot with a pick
- Monster versus monster direct contact in melee combat
- Player kicking an object barefoot
- Player kicking an iron door barefoot
- Monster wearing a helm and headbutting player

Omitted cases that did cause damage but lacked a message:
- Player throwing something up and hitting themself in the head with it
- Monster hitting a monster with a weapon in melee combat
- Monster hit by an object from a trap
- Player hitting a monster with an iron ball or iron chain
- Player crashing into iron bars
- Player with boots kicking a monster, while polyselfed into a form with
  kick attacks

Other:
- I tried to add a comment everywhere a material hatred if statement
  does NOT add additional damage due to dmgval() having already added
  it. Anywhere one of these if statements doesn't have either a damage
  increase or a comment stating it happened elsewhere is considered a
  bug.
- Unified codepaths for monster touching player with a body made of a
  material player hates and monster hitting player while wearing gear
  made of a material player hates.
- Many of the hmonas() calls for special_dmgval have been merged.  The
  code here for multiple claw/touch attacks hitting with strictly
  alternating arms has been removed; the player will hit with whatever
  gives the highest damage.
- Iron haters opening and closing an iron door barehanded is a case I
  considered for applying material damage, but decided not to because it
  would really just be annoying. It can be assumed they all have glass
  doorknobs or something.

One case that this does NOT supply at this time is the one in which the
aggressor hits a defender made of a material they hate with their bare
skin, and should take damage. I can't think of a way to do this right
now that doesn't involve adding more global variables (that could handle
the case in the passive() functions). For the time being it shouldn't
matter much; it would matter more if monks could be elves or similar.

(cherry picked from commit 047f1ca8cd782ef030f7f3949c3696cee3b8833b)
