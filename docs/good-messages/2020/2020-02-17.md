Remove remains of Libav compatibility

Libav seems rather dead: no release for 2 years, no new git commits in
master for almost a year (with one exception ~6 months ago). From what I
can tell, some developers resigned themselves to the horrifying idea to
post patches to ffmpeg-devel instead, while the rest of the developers
went on to greener pastures.

Libav was a better project than FFmpeg. Unfortunately, FFmpeg won,
because it managed to keep the name and website. Libav was pushed more
and more into obscurity: while there was initially a big push for Libav,
FFmpeg just remained "in place" and visible for most people. FFmpeg was
slowly draining all manpower and energy from Libav. A big part of this
was that FFmpeg stole code from Libav (regular merges of the entire
Libav git tree), making it some sort of Frankenstein mirror of Libav,
think decaying zombie with additional legs ("features") nailed to it.
"Stealing" surely is the wrong word; I'm just aping the language that
some of the FFmpeg members used to use. All that is in the past now, I'm
probably the only person left who is annoyed by this, and with this
commit I'm putting this decade long problem finally to an end. I just
thought I'd express my annoyance about this fucking shitshow one last
time.

The most intrusive change in this commit is the resample filter, which
originally used libavresample. Since the FFmpeg developer refused to
enable libavresample by default for drama reasons, and the API was
slightly different, so the filter used some big preprocessor mess to
make it compatible to libswresample. All that falls away now. The
simplification to the build system is also significant.

i have listened to all of these twice before i hit upload.

i play guitar, write music, love to sing songs, everything.
I have a friend who is him self in a similar situation as me personally, maybe not the code, or outreach or sharing side.. but he has his way, and he shares his bands music with me from time to time.
SO, among this, is a song by his band.
If you are actually still reading this... are actually reading this...
Unlikeley anyone will.

But hey, if your there, have a listen, comment what you think i guess, just want to be able to open a place to share things like this. aside from....
#BrainStops...
# Thinks of 10 ... DOZEN different ways this is allready out there haha, gaurentee there others out there like me, who have thier own.

Just yeah, always happy to share, i just like to engage and encourage others too as well.

Enjoy.

"Once, in China during the Ming Dynasty, there was a highly respected blacksmith who was going around in the garden of the palace in search of a good time, when he spotted a poor maiden.[pause 1] \"Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find a good time?\" he asked the maiden[pause 1].\nThe maiden thought long and hard, then she said: \"A good time is to be found in the last house you visited.\" The blacksmith thought long and hard about the maiden's answer. Then he offered her his only son as a reward. The following autumn after hours talking to a friend, the blacksmith finally understood what the maiden had meant: Much treasured is he who challenges his love, for he shall find the truth. And that's how he realized that a good time had been inside him all along."

PLUMBING: Lavaland geysers, pumps and regrettable balance decisions! (#49067)

Implements the geysers and pumps I originally added along with the first draft of plumbing.

Geysers
A geyser can be plungered with a reinforced plunger to activate. At wich point, it'll either produce clf3, hollow water, protozine or rarely wittel.

Pumps
Adds the liquid pump to the plumbing RCD. Place on an active geyser and wrench it to start pumping the geyser of its delicious juicess. I also changed it to not use power, because it would be awful drawing kilometer long wires along with the ducts.

Chems
Hollow water works basically like blood and mutage, where you can mix it with 1 unit of holy water for more holy water.

Protozine has a .2 healing, down from omnizine's .5. The healing is just kind of a side thing and not really what this chem was implemented for.

If it wasn't obvious, this allows chemists to industrialize strange reagent creation, with hollow water being able to create limitless holy water alongside protozine being a valid replacement for omnizine. Getting 2 geysers with those chems and on lavaland is quite the hassle, and you still need to get some holy water from the chaplain as kickstarter. I honestly think this is fine, and otherwise I could add a unique botany catalyst, so they don't become useless in the process.

Wittel
Adds wittel, wich is rare. Does nothing, but can be processed into two fun/regrettable chems.

Adds gravitum. Metabolizes very slowly. Drinking it makes you weightless, and spraying it makes that object temporarily weightless. Make 10u by mixing 1 wittel with 10 sorium

Adds metalgen. Created by mixing it with mutagen and bluespace powder. Must then be mixed with 40u of a powedered material and 1u of liquid dark matter.
The material used becomes imprinted on the chem. It can then be applied to anything, except mobs, to turn it into that material. Radiation is bad, and no you can't turn the nuke into plasma to blow it up.
The chem is difficult to get and use, but it can turn the escape shuttle into solid gold wich looks really cool. You could also turn it into plasma and vaporize everything. It can be used to, with some effort, duplicate materials.

ðŸ†‘
add: Adds geysers to lavaland! They can be activated by using a reinforced plunger found in the medical vendor. They can be harvested by using a new plumbing device, magically powered liquid pumps!
add: Adds Hollow Water to geysers, wich can be combined with Holy Water as catalyst for more Holy Water
add: Adds Protozine to geyers, a very weak version of Omnizine. Can be used in Strange Reagent mixing
add: Adds Wittel, a very rare geyser chem. Can be processed into gravitum, wich removes gravity. Can also be processed into metalgen, wich has a strange tendency to transform objects into the imprinted material.
/ðŸ†‘

Why:
This is what I originally wanted to do. The idea was to have a lot more chems, but I can't focus on one thing for that long. Hopefully this'll empower the bored chemist and make the rounds just that more interesting. Hopefully this'll spark the creation of some other geyser chems aswell.

That and makes shaft miners not the only ones hunting on lavaland.

Merge branch 'work.openat2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs

Pull openat2 support from Al Viro:
 "This is the openat2() series from Aleksa Sarai.

  I'm afraid that the rest of namei stuff will have to wait - it got
  zero review the last time I'd posted #work.namei, and there had been a
  leak in the posted series I'd caught only last weekend. I was going to
  repost it on Monday, but the window opened and the odds of getting any
  review during that... Oh, well.

  Anyway, openat2 part should be ready; that _did_ get sane amount of
  review and public testing, so here it comes"

From Aleksa's description of the series:
 "For a very long time, extending openat(2) with new features has been
  incredibly frustrating. This stems from the fact that openat(2) is
  possibly the most famous counter-example to the mantra "don't silently
  accept garbage from userspace" -- it doesn't check whether unknown
  flags are present[1].

  This means that (generally) the addition of new flags to openat(2) has
  been fraught with backwards-compatibility issues (O_TMPFILE has to be
  defined as __O_TMPFILE|O_DIRECTORY|[O_RDWR or O_WRONLY] to ensure old
  kernels gave errors, since it's insecure to silently ignore the
  flag[2]). All new security-related flags therefore have a tough road
  to being added to openat(2).

  Furthermore, the need for some sort of control over VFS's path
  resolution (to avoid malicious paths resulting in inadvertent
  breakouts) has been a very long-standing desire of many userspace
  applications.

  This patchset is a revival of Al Viro's old AT_NO_JUMPS[3] patchset
  (which was a variant of David Drysdale's O_BENEATH patchset[4] which
  was a spin-off of the Capsicum project[5]) with a few additions and
  changes made based on the previous discussion within [6] as well as
  others I felt were useful.

  In line with the conclusions of the original discussion of
  AT_NO_JUMPS, the flag has been split up into separate flags. However,
  instead of being an openat(2) flag it is provided through a new
  syscall openat2(2) which provides several other improvements to the
  openat(2) interface (see the patch description for more details). The
  following new LOOKUP_* flags are added:

  LOOKUP_NO_XDEV:

     Blocks all mountpoint crossings (upwards, downwards, or through
     absolute links). Absolute pathnames alone in openat(2) do not
     trigger this. Magic-link traversal which implies a vfsmount jump is
     also blocked (though magic-link jumps on the same vfsmount are
     permitted).

  LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS:

     Blocks resolution through /proc/$pid/fd-style links. This is done
     by blocking the usage of nd_jump_link() during resolution in a
     filesystem. The term "magic-links" is used to match with the only
     reference to these links in Documentation/, but I'm happy to change
     the name.

     It should be noted that this is different to the scope of
     ~LOOKUP_FOLLOW in that it applies to all path components. However,
     you can do openat2(NO_FOLLOW|NO_MAGICLINKS) on a magic-link and it
     will *not* fail (assuming that no parent component was a
     magic-link), and you will have an fd for the magic-link.

     In order to correctly detect magic-links, the introduction of a new
     LOOKUP_MAGICLINK_JUMPED state flag was required.

  LOOKUP_BENEATH:

     Disallows escapes to outside the starting dirfd's
     tree, using techniques such as ".." or absolute links. Absolute
     paths in openat(2) are also disallowed.

     Conceptually this flag is to ensure you "stay below" a certain
     point in the filesystem tree -- but this requires some additional
     to protect against various races that would allow escape using
     "..".

     Currently LOOKUP_BENEATH implies LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS, because it
     can trivially beam you around the filesystem (breaking the
     protection). In future, there might be similar safety checks done
     as in LOOKUP_IN_ROOT, but that requires more discussion.

  In addition, two new flags are added that expand on the above ideas:

  LOOKUP_NO_SYMLINKS:

     Does what it says on the tin. No symlink resolution is allowed at
     all, including magic-links. Just as with LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS this
     can still be used with NOFOLLOW to open an fd for the symlink as
     long as no parent path had a symlink component.

  LOOKUP_IN_ROOT:

     This is an extension of LOOKUP_BENEATH that, rather than blocking
     attempts to move past the root, forces all such movements to be
     scoped to the starting point. This provides chroot(2)-like
     protection but without the cost of a chroot(2) for each filesystem
     operation, as well as being safe against race attacks that
     chroot(2) is not.

     If a race is detected (as with LOOKUP_BENEATH) then an error is
     generated, and similar to LOOKUP_BENEATH it is not permitted to
     cross magic-links with LOOKUP_IN_ROOT.

     The primary need for this is from container runtimes, which
     currently need to do symlink scoping in userspace[7] when opening
     paths in a potentially malicious container.

     There is a long list of CVEs that could have bene mitigated by
     having RESOLVE_THIS_ROOT (such as CVE-2017-1002101,
     CVE-2017-1002102, CVE-2018-15664, and CVE-2019-5736, just to name a
     few).

  In order to make all of the above more usable, I'm working on
  libpathrs[8] which is a C-friendly library for safe path resolution.
  It features a userspace-emulated backend if the kernel doesn't support
  openat2(2). Hopefully we can get userspace to switch to using it, and
  thus get openat2(2) support for free once it's ready.

  Future work would include implementing things like
  RESOLVE_NO_AUTOMOUNT and possibly a RESOLVE_NO_REMOTE (to allow
  programs to be sure they don't hit DoSes though stale NFS handles)"

* 'work.openat2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs:
  Documentation: path-lookup: include new LOOKUP flags
  selftests: add openat2(2) selftests
  open: introduce openat2(2) syscall
  namei: LOOKUP_{IN_ROOT,BENEATH}: permit limited ".." resolution
  namei: LOOKUP_IN_ROOT: chroot-like scoped resolution
  namei: LOOKUP_BENEATH: O_BENEATH-like scoped resolution
  namei: LOOKUP_NO_XDEV: block mountpoint crossing
  namei: LOOKUP_NO_MAGICLINKS: block magic-link resolution
  namei: LOOKUP_NO_SYMLINKS: block symlink resolution
  namei: allow set_root() to produce errors
  namei: allow nd_jump_link() to produce errors

"12:10pm. Yeah, there is a bunch there.

Also, Google has gone to full shit. It would not even give me the link to Genesis, I had to try Bing instead.

Ok...as I expected there is really a shitload to choose from, as would be expected from a popular language.

I just noticed that there is a book for .NET devs. That is what I need.

I've gotten 3 so far, I'll check them out later. Let me do the chores here.

12:45pm. Let me finally start. Let me try compiling that thing again.

12:50pm.

Uhhh, what the hell? Let me try it again.

12:55pm. The same error. This is the first time I've run into an error like this. I'll assume the server is overburdened on the other side and try at some other time.

1:05pm. I've tried `yarn install` again and it is processing while I read the vscode source.

1:10pm. For whatever reason, this time `yarn install` ran to completion. Interesting.

1:15pm. I tried the build, but VS Code just crashed. Let me close this file and I will try it again.

1:25pm. Ok, the build succeeded, but I have no idea how to run this. Let me try the other option and if that fails I'll give up on this for the time being.

Yeah, this roughly par the course for compiling huge projects. I'd be more surprised if it actually worked without a hitch.

1:35pm. The book seems to be for ASP.NET devs and I do not even know what that is.

...

Ok...

I'll leave those threads alone for the time being. What I should be doing is studying pro plugins. F# ones or whatever else.

1:40pm. VS Code is way too big of a meal on my plate right now. That tutorial gave me a spark to try, but as expected, large projects are not ideal for this sort of thing.

1:45pm. Let me make up my mind to do this. Let me go after the F# LSP plugin. I need to see if I can at least get it to run. After that I'll look at the source for it.

...The extensions is installing at moment.

1:50pm. It sure is taking a while.

https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharp-language-server

Let me clone this thing while I wait.

```
e:\Typescript>git clone https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharp-language-server

```

This thing is no huge by any means. I can grook it with some study.

1:55pm. I have no idea what is going on. The plugin is not running, and the project I've downloaded is building forever.

You know what, let me take a bath here. I can't deal with this.

I want to get starting and the thing is just downloading stuff in the background.

2:50pm. I am back, and the stupid thing is still installing packages.

Ok, for the F# plugin some of the dependencies are broken and it is failing at downloading them.

For the VS Code plugin, I am not sure.

Let me remove the packages...

HtmlAgilityPack (1.8.4)
Fsharp.Core (4.7.0)
Fsharp.Compiler.Service (27.0.1)

...by hand, and I'll get the from Nuget manually.

Also, there is the Microsoft.NETCore.App (2.0.0) SDK that is missing.

I am not sure how I am supposed to get that one.

2:55pm. That seems to have worked. Now the packages are there. Let me try the build again.

Now the build passes. I've tried running it though and it seems to be looking for the wrong dlls.

```
Listening on stdin
Couldn't find FSharp.Core.dll in C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\2.1.15
Couldn't find System.ComponentModel.Composition.dll in C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\2.1.15
```

Why is it looking for a later version than the one referenced by the project?

3:05pm. I tried changing the .NET target to 2.1, decided to do a clean and it is taking forever again.

Holy shit!

Why is everything so buggy here! How much time is this going to make me waste!

```
Listening on stdin
Couldn't find FSharp.Core.dll in C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\2.1.15
Couldn't find System.ComponentModel.Composition.dll in C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\2.1.15
```

It seems on release it downloaded everything again, and I spotted it trying to get 2.1 in the status bar.

This is hell. I am in hell.

3:10pm. I am dying here.

3:15pm. I need an alternate plan. Since the wrapper is not that big, what I should do is write it again from scratch. Update it for the latest core version.

Actually, no. Let me start a fresh project, and I will go through the files and dependencies by hand one by one.

The whole thing is a wrapper over the F# compiler services, so this thing is exactly what I need to understand.

Let me also update VS. These issues might be fixed by going to a newer version.

It is 500mb. Agh...I should have switched to the fast connection.

```
let x = 2
let y = 3
let z : float = x + y
```

Oh, this works now that I point it at a .fsx file. It gives me a type error as one would expect.

3:20pm. Great, this is one thing down.

If I can understand all the aspects of the F# plugin I will have enough to make a Spiral one.

While VS is updating let me check out the TS books that I've gotten.

https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-TypeScript-for-CSharp-and-.NET-Core-Developers

Here is the code for one of the books.

3:30pm. Ok, VS has finished updating, but the project is still giving me that strange error. Whatever. I will go through the entire project in depth over the next few days.

...I've just started chapter one of that book, and now that I've found the code bundle am considering going through chapter one at least.

...No, forget that.

Focus on the goal in front of you.

What I need to do here is go through the entire project file by file, studying it in depth. After that I'll have time to play with TS to my heart's content.

Let me try at least do a little today."

"3:45pm.

```
let private isSeq(t: Type) =
    t.IsGenericType && t.GetGenericTypeDefinition() = typedefof<seq<_>>
let private implementsSeq(t: Type) =
    let is = t.GetInterfaces()
    Seq.exists isSeq is

let private isList(t: Type) =
    t.IsGenericType && t.GetGenericTypeDefinition() = typedefof<list<_>>

let private isMap(t: Type) =
    t.IsGenericType && t.GetGenericTypeDefinition() = typedefof<Map<_, _>>
```

It is really great that I have some experience with .NET metaprogramming, so I know what this is. That having said, I actually had not known about `typedefof`.

You learn something new every day it seems.

4:15pm. Done going through `Types.fs`. There is really a lot there. I am really confused as to what the serialization code is supposed to be for. Why is is serializing .NET types?

4:25pm. I am studying Tokenizer. I really have no clue why the wrapper is going through all these length.

But I'll know. Let me go through the rest of the files. Thankfully the library has plenty of tests. Studying those should be really instructive.

4:30pm. I really, really love how F# has clear cut ordering to modules. That really makes it much easier to go through projects.

4:40pm. Done with the Parser. At this point the tedium is starting to hit me.

5pm.

```
let private thenMap (f: 'A -> 'B) (result: Async<'A>): Async<'B> =
    async {
        let! a = result
        return f a
    }
```

...

```
let connect(serverFactory: ILanguageClient -> ILanguageServer, receive: BinaryReader, send: BinaryWriter) =
    let server = serverFactory(RealClient(send))
    let processRequest(request: Request): Async<string option> =
        match request with
        | Initialize(p) ->
            server.Initialize(p) |> thenMap serializeInitializeResult |> thenSome
        | WillSaveWaitUntilTextDocument(p) ->
            server.WillSaveWaitUntilTextDocument(p) |> thenMap serializeTextEditList |> thenSome
```

For a performance oriented implementation, this is the worst way of doing it.

Also I am wondering why the author is implementing his own message passing thing when F# already has a perfectly good `MailboxProcessor`.

5:20pm. Oh, this piece of crap. How do I run the tests via the IDE?

5:25pm. I so do not feel like messing with this right now.

I remember having difficulty with NUnit when I tried using it in the past too.

5:35pm. Ok, it works now. I have no idea why building everything failed to collect the tests last time. Maybe because I added the references last. So adding the parser tests which I'd missed triggered a rebuild of the entire project, which got me the tests.

Ok.

5:40pm. Gah, why is the thing so buggy. I erased the JSON tests file and it still does not register the change.

5:50pm. Ok, I figured it out. Including what all 3 of the packages do.

The adapter is needed to find the tests in the files, and the Test.Sdk is needed to actually run them. The whole thing goes by so fast, that I did not even notice the errors in the Output->Tests pane.

Isn't this great? Now I finally know how to use NUnit. Joy.

I had to comment out one of the tests as it was running forever, but the rest all pass.

Tomorrow, what I will do is go through them one by one by hand.

6pm. That will give me a feel for absolutely everything.

I still have no idea why JSON tuples have to be serialized to F# tuples and things of that sort, but hopefully that mystery will be revealed as I go along.

This is a great spot to call it a day.

Today I was focused for a bit at least. I am going to push through this eventually. On the other side, the completed Spiral is waiting for me."

##### 2020-02-17 22:30:27 by jonathan

less major modifications than the last few. added some enum types so that i can address registers more easily and to get rid of some magic numbers. tested the basic functionality of all the functions and it seems like it's working well. the potential exception is that while a command is in async wait and the data transfer socket on the recv system closes, the recv trigger doesnt seem to ever get reset. im not sure if thats the actual issue, it might be a deeper, but it doesnt seem to be a problem as long as the socket is closed outside of an async wait. cleaned up some other bugs in the code: the array coords are stored as double but were being loaded as floats - one of the if flags for closing the enet sockets was a duplicate of a previous one and so one of the other enet sockets was actually left out and so could never be closed which spun the epollwait cmd into a loop - somehow or other even after the socket was closed nrecv would still come back as 0 and so the would try to disconnect a closed socket and segfault (i put check statement before the disconnect to make sure the socket was still active before trying to close it, seemed to fix the issue) - updated the python code so that the case messages for the tx system were properly defined as uint8_t instead of uint32_t as they were previously - reorganized the registers in verilog so that the trigger durations and delays for a given channel are adjacent to one another instead of in two separated regions (should make it easier to add new ones by just appending to the register list instead of potentially having to move a lot of things around). that's probably it for todays updates. tomorrow i will test whether the recv memory can be split into 8 separate 16bit ram blocks instead of a single 128bit block without breaking everything, that'd make a lot of the compression stuff simpler as well as make it easier to split up the data into separate packets to send over ethernet, which otherwise would have/will required an annoying amount of manual memory management when trying to do realtime stuff. I think thats
