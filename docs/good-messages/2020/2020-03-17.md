memset() refactoring (#10656)

I noticed that in some builds we'd end up with memset in JS, instead
of in compiled code. That's because we have memset implemented in
our JS library code. That was useful in the old days before compiler_rt
but today it's risky - it can lead to surprising slowness and bloat. It's
also an old hack for fastcomp that we'll want to remove anyhow in
time.

This ifdefs out that memset in the JS library for upstream. I didn't try
to also fix fastcomp as linking is different there, and it's not worth the
effort.

This removes memset from DEFAULT_LIBRARY_FUNCS_TO_INCLUDE
which is an old hack. This removal is necessary as otherwise we look
for it in the JS library, where it isn't any more, and error. (In fastcomp,
we add it back in manually.)

There is a potentially noticeable difference here: in the past you could
do x__deps: ['memset'] in a JS library, that is, depend on the JS
version of memset. We have to disallow that if we want to always use
the compiled optimal version. The fix for JS library code that wants to
use memset is the usual: set it up in deps_info.json, that is, tell the
linker that if x will be used from the JS library, then memset is needed
from the system libraries. Or, without modifying deps_info.json - say,
in a user's JS library - adding _memset to EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS
will work. This PR adds a warning to help figure that out.

The one slightly annoying thing in this PR is that we need to add code
in system_libs.py to handle the sanitizers specifically: sadly the
usual deps_info mechanism does not work since we scan only user files
for things, and not libraries (to be able to scan libraries, we'd need to
somehow figure out which of their object files will actually be linked in -
but only lld knows that).

Do CafInfo/SRT analysis in Cmm

This patch removes all CafInfo predictions and various hacks to preserve
predicted CafInfos from the compiler and assigns final CafInfos to
interface Ids after code generation. SRT analysis is extended to support
static data, and Cmm generator is modified to allow generating
static_link fields after SRT analysis.

This also fixes `-fcatch-bottoms`, which introduces error calls in case
expressions in CorePrep, which runs *after* CoreTidy (which is where we
decide on CafInfos) and turns previously non-CAFFY things into CAFFY.

Fixes #17648
Fixes #9718

Manual inspection of programs in testsuite/tests/programs
---------------------------------------------------------

I built these programs with a bunch of dump flags and `-O` and compared
STG, Cmm, and Asm dumps and file sizes.

(Below the numbers in parenthesis show number of modules in the program)

These programs have identical compiler (same .hi and .o sizes, STG, and
Cmm and Asm dumps):

- Queens (1), andre_monad (1), cholewo-eval (2), cvh_unboxing (3),
  andy_cherry (7), fun_insts (1), hs-boot (4), fast2haskell (2),
  jl_defaults (1), jq_readsPrec (1), jules_xref (1), jtod_circint (4),
  jules_xref2 (1), lennart_range (1), lex (1), life_space_leak (1),
  bargon-mangler-bug (7), record_upd (1), rittri (1), sanders_array (1),
  strict_anns (1), thurston-module-arith (2), okeefe_neural (1),
  joao-circular (6), 10queens (1)

Programs with different compiler outputs:

- jl_defaults (1): For some reason GHC HEAD marks a lot of top-level
  `[Int]` closures as CAFFY for no reason. With this patch we no longer
  make them CAFFY and generate less SRT entries. For some reason Main.o
  is slightly larger with this patch (1.3%) and the executable sizes are
  the same. (I'd expect both to be smaller)

- launchbury (1): Same as jl_defaults: top-level `[Int]` closures marked
  as CAFFY for no reason. Similarly `Main.o` is 1.4% larger but the
  executable sizes are the same.

- galois_raytrace (13): Differences are in the Parse module. There are a
  lot, but some of the changes are caused by the fact that for some
  reason (I think a bug) GHC HEAD marks the dictionary for `Functor
  Identity` as CAFFY. Parse.o is 0.4% larger, the executable size is the
  same.

- north_array: We now generate less SRT entries because some of array
  primops used in this program like `NewArrayOp` get eliminated during
  Stg-to-Cmm and turn some CAFFY things into non-CAFFY. Main.o gets 24%
  larger (9224 bytes from 9000 bytes), executable sizes are the same.

- seward-space-leak: Difference in this program is better shown by this
  smaller example:

      module Lib where

      data CDS
        = Case [CDS] [(Int, CDS)]
        | Call CDS CDS

      instance Eq CDS where
        Case sels1 rets1 == Case sels2 rets2 =
            sels1 == sels2 && rets1 == rets2
        Call a1 b1 == Call a2 b2 =
            a1 == a2 && b1 == b2
        _ == _ =
            False

   In this program GHC HEAD builds a new SRT for the recursive group of
   `(==)`, `(/=)` and the dictionary closure. Then `/=` points to `==`
   in its SRT field, and `==` uses the SRT object as its SRT. With this
   patch we use the closure for `/=` as the SRT and add `==` there. Then
   `/=` gets an empty SRT field and `==` points to `/=` in its SRT
   field.

   This change looks fine to me.

   Main.o gets 0.07% larger, executable sizes are identical.

head.hackage
------------

head.hackage's CI script builds 428 packages from Hackage using this
patch with no failures.

Compiler performance
--------------------

The compiler perf tests report that the compiler allocates slightly more
(worst case observed so far is 4%). However most programs in the test
suite are small, single file programs. To benchmark compiler performance
on something more realistic I build Cabal (the library, 236 modules)
with different optimisation levels. For the "max residency" row I run
GHC with `+RTS -s -A100k -i0 -h` for more accurate numbers. Other rows
are generated with just `-s`. (This is because `-i0` causes running GC
much more frequently and as a result "bytes copied" gets inflated by
more than 25x in some cases)

Extra compiler allocations
--------------------------

Runtime allocations of programs are as reported above (NoFib section).

The compiler now allocates more than before. Main source of allocation
in this patch compared to base commit is the new SRT algorithm
(GHC.Cmm.Info.Build). Below is some of the extra work we do with this
patch, numbers generated by profiled stage 2 compiler when building a
pathological case (the test 'ManyConstructors') with '-O2':

- We now sort the final STG for a module, which means traversing the
  entire program, generating free variable set for each top-level
  binding, doing SCC analysis, and re-ordering the program. In
  ManyConstructors this step allocates 97,889,952 bytes.

- We now do SRT analysis on static data, which in a program like
  ManyConstructors causes analysing 10,000 bindings that we would
  previously just skip. This step allocates 70,898,352 bytes.

- We now maintain an SRT map for the entire module as we compile Cmm
  groups:

      data ModuleSRTInfo = ModuleSRTInfo
        { ...
        , moduleSRTMap :: SRTMap
        }

   (SRTMap is just a strict Map from the 'containers' library)

   This map gets an entry for most bindings in a module (exceptions are
   THUNKs and CAFFY static functions). For ManyConstructors this map
   gets 50015 entries.

- Once we're done with code generation we generate a NameSet from SRTMap
  for the non-CAFFY names in the current module. This set gets the same
  number of entries as the SRTMap.

- Finally we update CafInfos in ModDetails for the non-CAFFY Ids, using
  the NameSet generated in the previous step. This usually does the
  least amount of allocation among the work listed here.

Only place with this patch where we do less work in the CAF analysis in
the tidying pass (CoreTidy). However that doesn't save us much, as the
pass still needs to traverse the whole program and update IdInfos for
other reasons. Only thing we don't here do is the `hasCafRefs` pass over
the RHS of bindings, which is a stateless pass that returns a boolean
value, so it doesn't allocate much.

(Metric changes blow are all increased allocations)

rts: Implement concurrent collection in the nonmoving collector

This extends the non-moving collector to allow concurrent collection.

The full design of the collector implemented here is described in detail
in a technical note

    B. Gamari. "A Concurrent Garbage Collector For the Glasgow Haskell
    Compiler" (2018)

This extension involves the introduction of a capability-local
remembered set, known as the /update remembered set/, which tracks
objects which may no longer be visible to the collector due to mutation.
To maintain this remembered set we introduce a write barrier on
mutations which is enabled while a concurrent mark is underway.

The update remembered set representation is similar to that of the
nonmoving mark queue, being a chunked array of `MarkEntry`s. Each
`Capability` maintains a single accumulator chunk, which it flushed
when it (a) is filled, or (b) when the nonmoving collector enters its
post-mark synchronization phase.

While the write barrier touches a significant amount of code it is
conceptually straightforward: the mutator must ensure that the referee
of any pointer it overwrites is added to the update remembered set.
However, there are a few details:

 * In the case of objects with a dirty flag (e.g. `MVar`s) we can
   exploit the fact that only the *first* mutation requires a write
   barrier.

 * Weak references, as usual, complicate things. In particular, we must
   ensure that the referee of a weak object is marked if dereferenced by
   the mutator. For this we (unfortunately) must introduce a read
   barrier, as described in Note [Concurrent read barrier on deRefWeak#]
   (in `NonMovingMark.c`).

 * Stable names are also a bit tricky as described in Note [Sweeping
   stable names in the concurrent collector] (`NonMovingSweep.c`).

We take quite some pains to ensure that the high thread count often seen
in parallel Haskell applications doesn't affect pause times. To this end
we allow thread stacks to be marked either by the thread itself (when it
is executed or stack-underflows) or the concurrent mark thread (if the
thread owning the stack is never scheduled). There is a non-trivial
handshake to ensure that this happens without racing which is described
in Note [StgStack dirtiness flags and concurrent marking].

more stupid ench stuff

removed JER bc enchant tab showed wrong enchs
removed enchant books from JEI
attempt at removing enchant books from loottables
enabled and disabled some enchants from randomenchants

ISSUES
you can still get a enchant books youre not supposed to get from bewitched tome
probably a shit ton of other stuff because fucking enchantments in this game its absolutely garbage
