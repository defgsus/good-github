First Aid Box

There is a extensive variation in the contents of first aid kits primarily based on the knowledge and experience of these putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area the place it may be used and variations in regulation or legislation in a given area.
 
First Aid Kit



Almost all of us will need to use a first aid kit at some time. Make time to prepare home and journey kits for your family’s safety. First aid kits may also be fundamental or comprehensive. What you want depends on your clinical training and your distance from expert clinical help. Ready-made first aid kits are commercially available from chain stores or outside retailers, however it’s effortless to make smart, less expensive first aid kits yourself. or if you buy from online Here FIRST AID BOX

Home and Travel First Aid Kit Basics
Home first aid kits are commonly used for treating these sorts of minor irritating injuries:
•	Cuts
•	Burns
•	Sprains
•	Strains
•	Stings
•	Splinters
•	Abrasions

First aid kits for travel need to be greater comprehensive because a drug store may or might not be accessible. In addition to personal medical items, the kit have to contain items to assist alleviate the common symptoms of viral respiratory infections such as these:
•	Cough
•	Fever
•	Sore Throat

Pack and use barrier objects such as latex gloves to guard your self from the bodily fluids of others. Check the kit twice a yr and change expired drugs.
Where to keep your First aid kit
•	The best area to maintain your first aid kit is in the kitchen. Most family activities take place here. The bathroom has too a lot humidity, which shortens the shelf lifestyles of items.
•	The travel kit is for actual trips away from home. Keep it in a suitcase, backpack, depending on the activity.
•	A first aid kit for day-to-day use in the car be just like the domestic first aid kit. For that matter, you should keep similar kits in your boat (inside a water resistant bag), travel trailer, mobile home, camper, cabin, holiday home, and at any place you spend time.

vo_gpu: opengl: make it work with EGL 1.4

This tries to deal with the crazy EGL situation. The summary is:

- using eglGetDisplay() with multiple windowing platforms doesn't really
  work, but Mesa had an awful hack for it
- this hack can be disabled at build time, and some distros sometimes
  accidentally or intentionally do so
- Mesa will probably eventually disable it by default
- we switched to eglGetPlatformDisplay(), but this requires EGL 1.5
- the very regrettable graphics company (also known as Nvidia) ships
  drivers (for old hardware I think) that are EGL 1.4 only
- that means even though we "require" EGL 1.5 and link against it, the
  runtime EGL may be 1.4
- trying to run mpv there crashes in the dynamic linker
- so we have to go through some more awful compatibility hacks

This commit tries to do it "properly", but using EGL 1.4 as base. The
plaform selection mechanism is a messy extension there, which got
elevated to core API in 1.5 (but OF COURSE in incompatible ways).

I'm not sure whether the EGL 1.5 code path (by parsing the EGL_VERSION)
is really needed, but if you ask me, it feels slightly saner not to rely
on an EGL 1.4 kludge forever. But maybe this is just an instance of
self-harm, since they will most likely never drop or not provide this
API.

Also, unlike before, we actually check the extension string for the
individual platform extensions, because who knows, some EGL
implementations might curse us if we pass unknown platform parameters.
(But actually, the more I think about this, the more bullshit it is.)

X11 and Wayland were the only ones trying to call eglGetPlatformDisplay,
so they're the only ones which are adjusted in this commit.

Unfortunately, correct function of this commit is unconfirmed. It's
possible that it crashes with the old drivers mentioned above.

Why didn't they solve it like this:

struct native_display {
    int platform_type;
    void *native_display;
};

Could have kept eglGetDisplay() without all the obnoxious extension BS.
