:anger: docs: Add IRC channel + quotes issue to FAQ (closes #255)

This commit addresses the pain point that @Tjzabel hit this past week
when the IRC channel is not escaped by quotes in the `env` file. Since
he is probably not the first or last person this will happen to, this
documents it in our FAQ.

:anger: emoji because this was really frustrating. :joy:

Closes #255.

recorder: don't use a magic index for mp_recorder_get_sink()

Although this was sort of elegant, it just seems to complicate things
slightly. Originally, the API meant that you cache mp_recorder_sink
yourself (which would avoid the mess of passing an index around), but
that too seems slightly roundabout.

In a later change, I want to change the set of streams passed to
mp_recorder_create(), and then I'd have to keep track of the index for
each stream, which would suck. With this commit, I can just pass the
unambiguous sh_stream to it, and it will be guaranteed to match the
correct stream.

The disadvantages are barely worth discussing. It's a new linear search
per packet, but usually only 2 to 4 streams are active at a time. Also,
in theory a user could want to write 2 streams using the same sh_stream
(same metadata, just writing different packets or so), but in practice
this is never done.
