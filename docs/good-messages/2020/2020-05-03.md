Modify the hotpatch mechanism, in order to make it much less ROP-friendly.

Currently x86_patch_window_open is a big problem, because it is a perfect
function to inject/modify executable code with ROP.

 - Remove x86_patch_window_open(), along with its x86_patch_window_close()
   counterpart.
 - Introduce a read-only link-set of hotpatch descriptor structures,
   which reference a maximum of two read-only hotpatch sources.
 - Modify x86_hotpatch() to open a window and call the new
   x86_hotpatch_apply() function in a hard-coded manner.
 - Modify x86_hotpatch() to take a name and a selector, and have
   x86_hotpatch_apply() resolve the descriptor from the name and the
   source from the selector, before hotpatching.
 - Move the error handling in a separate x86_hotpatch_cleanup() function,
   that gets called after we closed the window.

The resulting implementation is a bit complex and non-obvious. But it
gains the following properties: the code executed in the hotpatch window
is strictly hard-coded (no callback and no possibility to execute your own
code in the window) and the pointers this code accesses are strictly
read-only (no possibility to forge pointers to hotpatch an area that was
not designated as hotpatchable at compile-time, and no possibility to
choose what bytes to write other than the maximum of two read-only
templates that were designated as valid for the given destination at
compile-time).

With current CPUs this slightly improves a situation that is already
pretty bad by definition on x86. Assuming CET however, this change closes
a big hole and is kinda great.

The only ~problem there is, is that dtrace-fbt tries to hotpatch random
places with random bytes, and there is just no way to make it safe.
However dtrace is only in a module, that is rarely used and never compiled
into the kernel, so it's not a big problem; add a shitty & vulnerable
independent hotpatch window in it, and leave big XXXs. It looks like fbt
is going to collapse soon anyway.

BAIN conflict refactoring, some fixups

Mopy/bash/bosh/bain.py:
bain: Refactor getConflictReport, split into methods

Useful for #450, we now no longer have to crawl our way through the
string but can directly use the in-memory conflict objects. An exemplary
lesson in why one should never only expose a string, otherwise its
format becomes API.

Threw in docstrings everywhere as well, otherwise this might actually be
a negative line diff.

Mopy/bash/basher/installer_links.py:
Drop unneeded remaps assignments

resetAllEspmNames() already does what we want. No need for this weird,
encapsulation-breaking logic.

Mopy/bash/bosh/converter.py:
Hacky fix for BCFs crashing with subarchives

When you have e.g. a 7z file inside a 7z file, even if the file gets
removed in the BAINification, the BCF creation process would crash. This
is a very hacky temp fix, the real fix is probably to pass a valid
crc_installer to that method.

Mopy/bash/bosh/cosaves.py:
cosaves: Fix crash when reading ARVR

God I'm stupid, forgot to move the self.elements initialization before
the self.key_type initialization which uses self.elements.

Under #437, #450.

:warning: fixing runtime registration

That shit is f*cked up.
So basically we need to register runtime growth, but that ain't possible
without doing allocations, which themselves are impossible since the
runtime is growing. I came up with something hopefully this shit will
work but Damn it was annoying...

Simplification of Project Structure / Dealing with Parentheses 

We can now run our scrapy script and web spider from within the same Python script!  Although, we'll eventually have the web spider definition and the running of our application in different files, since the parse function is already getting pretty long.

Also, now we search for something of the form "/wiki/something_like_this_(Something)/" in our <p> tags, and check to see if what precedes this link is balanced with respect to parentheses.  If it isn't, continue to the next link in the paragraph, and if there isn't one, then proceed to the next paragraph.  This works for Hank Green (we get to philosophy) and Tom Hanks (we get trapped in Semiotics <=> Meaning (Semiotics))!

However, there are a couple issues at hand.  We click on the wrong link on Germany because there's some Coordinates at the top of the article in a span, containing a hyperlink in a <p> tag (although we should be able to ignore <p> tags if they contain this span id?).  Also, I'm not sure how we're handing italicized links, but I should definitely give more thought to that.

Maybe this should just be a Python Game instead of a Javascript-y game?  The problem is that my parents and friends will have a higher barrier to entry.  User experience is always best on integrated websites.  Also I'm afraid of the unknown and I have no idea how to execute server-side scripts or set any of that stuff up or what I even need to do in order to deliver that functionality.  But I should definitely play around with it, because it's cool.

Auto merge of #71631 - RalfJung:miri-unleash-the-gates, r=oli-obk

Miri: unleash all feature gates

IMO it is silly to unleash features that do not even have a feature gate yet, but not unleash features that do. The only thing this achieves is making unleashed mode annoying to use as we have to figure out the feature flags to enable (and not always do the error messages say what that flag is).

Given that the point of `-Z unleash-the-miri-inside-of-you` is to debug the Miri internals, I see no good reason for this extra hurdle. I cannot imagine a situation where we'd use that flag, realize the program also requires some feature gate, and then be like "oh I guess if this feature is unstable I will do something else". Instead, we'll always just add that flag to the code as well, so requiring the flag achieves nothing.
