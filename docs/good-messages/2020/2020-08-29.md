"8:45am. I got up 10m ago. Yesterday I had to go to bed early as could be expected since I was too tired for my usual routine. Right now it is time for the laze. Work can come later.

10:50am. Done with breakfast. Even though I could laze longer I actually want to meet some of my goals for the day. There will be plenty of time to rest when Spiral is finished. When Spiral is done, all the programming I will do will be play.

Well, that might be putting it too strongly. But I do want to move on from the language at least.

So what should be done today?

11am. Focus me, focus.

Instead of thinking how I am going to spend the next 7h working, just focus on the next task at hand. After that I'll take a break for however long I want. That is the way to do this.

Seriously, fuck the mentality of needing to work all day. Just complete the goal and indulge in the satisfaction of that.

Right now what do I have to do?

Well, I have the hovers and I have the errors. Let me convert them.

11:15am.

```fs
    |> fun x ->
        type_application |> Seq.iter (fun x -> if has_metavars x.Value then errors.Add(range_of_expr x.Key, ValueRestriction x.Value))
        if 0 < errors.Count then raise (TypeErrorException (Seq.toList errors))
        let hovers = hover_types |> Seq.toArray |> Array.map (fun x -> x.Key, show_t top_env' x.Value)
        let errors = errors.ToArray() |> Array.map (fun (a,b) -> show_type_error top_env' b, a)
        (hovers, errors), x
```

Hmmmm...

```fs
if 0 < errors.Count then raise (TypeErrorException (Seq.toList errors))
```

I think I will just remove this.

11:15am. And with that I am done with `infer`. I have everything that I need in it, apart from some lose ends I will tie up later.

Let me get rid of mock typechecker. `server_typechecking` and `server_hover` I'll move to `Blockize`.

```fs
let infer (top_env' : TopEnv) (env : Env) expr =
```

Ah right. Actually I made a mistake. I definitely do not need `env` here.

```fs
let env_term = List.fold (fun s (BundleRecInl(_,(_,a),_,_)) -> Map.add a (TySymbol "<real>") s) env.term l
```

And removing it reveals an error in one of the recursive cases.

```fs
let env_term = List.fold (fun s (BundleRecInl(_,(_,a),_,_)) -> Map.add a (TySymbol "<real>") s) Map.empty l
```

This should be like so.

Ok...

```fs
let default_env : TopEnv = {hoc = PersistentVector.empty; ty=Map.empty; term=Map.empty}
```

Let me have this.

11:25am.

```fs
let server_typechecking (uri : string) = Job.delay <| fun () ->
    let req = Ch ()

    let rec waiting data = req ^=> extracting data
    and extracting data subreq =
        waiting data <|> (IVar.read subreq ^=> fun (bundle,res) ->
            let rec loop = function // Does memoization by fetching previous computed values.
                | [], bundle -> List.map (fun _ -> IVar()) bundle
                | (a, ivar) :: a', (b :: b' as bundle) -> if a = b then ivar :: loop (a',b') else loop ([], bundle)
                | _, [] -> []
            let x = loop (data, bundle)
            Hopac.start (IVar.fill res x)
            let x = List.zip bundle x
            processing Infer.default_env x x
            )
    and processing state data = function
        | [] -> waiting data
        | (x,res) :: x' ->
            waiting data <|> Alt.prepareFun (fun () ->
                if res.Full then IVar.read res ^=> fun (_,state) -> processing state data x'
                else
                    let (_,state as x) = TypecheckingUtils.bundle x |> Infer.infer state
                    Hopac.start (IVar.fill res x)
                    processing state data x'
                )

    Job.server (waiting []) >>-. req
```

Now it is all clear.

Let me try compiling this.

...There were some errors. Also, the errors need to be a list. Forgot about that.

11:30am. Now it compiles. First of all let me comment out the instance in that one example. Then I will run the server for the first time.

```
instance bind option a : forall b. x f =
    match x with
    | Some: x => Some: 2
    | None => None
```

This is going out.

Actually, before I start the debugging session, let me take a short break here."

#### Saturday 2020-08-29 16:42:26 by Marko Grdinić

"3:10pm. Let me resume. I will slack more later.

Let me just get this thing done.

```fs
| RawForall(_,(_,(a,_,_)),b) -> cterm term (Set.add a ty) b
```

Ah, wait, can't foget to validate the constraints now as well.

```fs
| RawForall(_,(_,(a,_,l)),b) -> List.iter (ctype term ty) l; cterm term (Set.add a ty) b
```

Let me do this like so.

3:15pm.

```fs
let var_of (name,kind) = {scope=0; constraints=Set.empty; kind=kind; name=name}
let typevars (l : TypeVar list) = List.map (fun (_,(a,b)) -> var_of (a, typevar b)) l
```

This I am not sure how to fix.

```fs
let typevar_to_var ((r,(name,kind)) : TypeVar) : Var = {scope= !scope; constraints=Set.empty; kind=typevar kind; name=name}
```

And this now needs to be evaluated.

```fs
    //let typevar_to_var ((r,(name,kind)) : TypeVar) : Var = {scope= !scope; constraints=Set.empty; kind=typevar kind; name=name}
```

Let me comment it out.

3:25pm.

```fs
    let rec typevar_to_var ((r,(name,kind,constraints)) : TypeVar) : Var =

        {scope= !scope; constraints=Set.empty; kind=typevar kind; name=name}
    and term (env : Env) s x =
```

No actually, I need to move it down and then eval it.

3:35pm. I am still thinking about it. Actually, I might have made the parsing of the foralls too complicated.

If I think about it, if I am only going to have single argument constraints, there is no need to make them `RawTExpr`.

Let me backtrack.

3:40pm.

```fs
type TypeVar = (Range * VarString * RawKindExpr) * (Range * VarString) list
```

Let me make the `TypeVar` this.

No need for anything more complicated than this.

```fs
| TyForall(a,b), TyForall(a',b') | TyInl(a,b), TyInl(a',b') when a.kind = a'.kind && a.constraints = a'.constraints -> loop (b, subst [a',TyVar a] b')
```

I forgot to unify the constraints here previously.

```fs
type TypeVar = (Range * VarString) * RawKindExpr * (Range * VarString) list
```

I am doing it wrong. The range should be this. Period.

```fs
let forall_var d : Result<TypeVar,_> =
    let tvar = (read_type_var' |>> fun x -> x, RawKindWildcard) <|> rounds ((read_type_var' .>> skip_op ":") .>>. kind)
    let cons = curlies (sepBy1 read_type_var' (skip_op ";")) <|>% []
    pipe2 tvar cons (fun (name,kind) cons -> name,kind,cons) d
```

Let me do it like this. Dealing with all those parenths is impossible.

3:50pm. Ok, now I have everything set once more.

3:50pm.

```fs
| RawForall(_,(((_,a),_,l)),b) -> List.iter check l; cterm term (Set.add a ty) b
```

Now here I can just do this.

Actually, this is wrong, because it checks from the wrong env.

4pm.

```fs
let validate_bound_vars (top_env : Env) term ty x =
    let errors = ResizeArray()
    let check_term term (a,b) = if Set.contains b term = false && Map.containsKey b top_env.term = false then errors.Add(a,UnboundVariable)
    let check_ty ty (a,b) = if Set.contains b ty = false && Map.containsKey b top_env.ty = false then errors.Add(a,UnboundVariable)
```

I finally abstracted this shit here. That was my miss. I should not have pastad it.

4:05pm.

```fs
    let rec typevar_to_var (((_,name),kind,constraints) : TypeVar) : Var =
        // TODO
        {scope= !scope; constraints=Set.empty; kind=typevar kind; name=name}
```

Once more I am here.

I need to deal with constraints.

4:10pm.

```fs
    let rec typevar_to_var (((_,name),kind,constraints) : TypeVar) : Var =
        let rec typevar = function
            | RawKindWildcard -> fresh_kind()
            | RawKindStar -> KindType
            | RawKindFun(a,b) -> KindFun(typevar a, typevar b)
        let kind = typevar kind
        // TODO
        {scope= !scope; constraints=Set.empty; kind=kind_force kind; name=name}
```

I need to bring this back.

Now I need to eval the constraints.

I am going to bring back the TyConstraint, but rather than something stupid like that constraint id, I am going to put in the needed constraint directly.

```fs
type Constraint =
    | CNumber

let constraint_kind x =
    let (^) a b = KindFun(a,b)
    match x with
    | CNumber -> KindType ^ KindConstraint
```

Let me once more implement this.

```fs
let default_env : TopEnv =
    let ty = ["number", TyConstraint CNumber] |> Map.ofList
    {hoc = PersistentVector.empty; ty=Map.empty; term=Map.empty}
```

This is how I am going to plow the basic constraints in.

```fs
| TyConstraint a -> unify_kind i.kind (constraint_kind a)
```

Should this be the right way of doing this in unify? Probably.

4:25pm. Ok, as far as constraints are concerned, I filled in all the gaps.

```fs
    let typevar_to_var (((_,name),kind,constraints) : TypeVar) : Var =
        let rec typevar = function
            | RawKindWildcard -> fresh_kind()
            | RawKindStar -> KindType
            | RawKindFun(a,b) -> KindFun(typevar a, typevar b)
        let kind = typevar kind
        // TODO
        {scope= !scope; constraints=Set.empty; kind=kind_force kind; name=name}
```

4:30pm. I am thinking what to do here. Damn constraints are so annoying.

Let me just go through them collecting them.

4:40pm.

```fs
    let typevar_to_var env (((_,name),kind,constraints) : TypeVar) : Var =
        let rec typevar = function
            | RawKindWildcard -> fresh_kind()
            | RawKindStar -> KindType
            | RawKindFun(a,b) -> KindFun(typevar a, typevar b)
        let kind = typevar kind
        let cons =
            constraints |> List.choose (fun (r,x) ->
                match Map.tryFind x env.ty |> Option.orElseWith (fun () -> Map.tryFind x top_env.ty) with
                | Some (TyConstraint x) -> unify_kind r (KindFun(kind,KindConstraint)) (constraint_kind x); Some x
                | Some x -> errors.Add(r,ExpectedConstraint x); None
                | None -> errors.Add(r,UnboundVariable); None
                ) |> Set.ofList
        {scope= !scope; constraints=cons; kind=kind_force kind; name=name}
```

This is good. I think that prototype constraints should also be constraints rather than higher order types. It will be too difficult to deal with them otherwise.

4:45pm.

```fs
let typevars x = List.map (typevar_to_var Map.empty) x
```

Typevars can just be this...although...

...Ah, shit. Now I have to deal with shadowing.

```fs
let typevars x = List.fold (fun s x -> typevar_to_var s x |> fun x -> Map.add x.name (TyVar x) s) Map.empty x
```

This function needs to change its nature. It will have to be a fold.

```fs
    | BundleType(_,(_,name),vars,expr) ->
        let vars = typevars vars
        let v = fresh_var()
        ty {term=Map.empty; ty=add_vars Map.empty vars} v expr
        let inl = List.foldBack (fun x s -> TyInl(x,s)) vars (visit_t v)
        {top_env' with ty = Map.add name inl top_env.ty}
```

Actually going by this, it will have to be a `mapFold`.

```fs
let typevars x = List.mapFold (fun s x -> typevar_to_var s x |> fun x -> x, Map.add x.name (TyVar x) s) Map.empty x
```

```fs
    match expr with
    | BundleType(_,(_,name),vars,expr) ->
        let vars,env_ty = typevars vars
        let v = fresh_var()
        ty {term=Map.empty; ty=env_ty} v expr
        let inl = List.foldBack (fun x s -> TyInl(x,s)) vars (visit_t v)
        {top_env' with ty = Map.add name inl top_env.ty}
```

Let me go with this.

5pm.

```fs
                | Choice1Of2(_,name,(vars,env_ty'),expr) ->
                    let v = fresh_var()
                    ty {term=Map.empty; ty=Map.foldBack Map.add env_ty' env_ty} v expr
                    PersistentVector.conj (HOCNominal(name,vars,visit_t v)) hoc
```

Things get a bit more complicated here, but not too much.

```fs
let typevars x = List.mapFold (fun s x -> typevar_to_var s x |> fun x -> x, Map.add x.name (TyVar x) s) Map.empty x
```

No, I fucked this up. Shit.

5:10pm. I am going to stop here for the day.

I've realized that I am in a mindset where I am trying to rush things through so I can fill in the gaps, but as a result I am just making a mess everywhere. At this point I've completely lost control of the typechecker.

5:15pm. I did get a spark of desire. What I am going to do is deal with constraints completely right now. I meant to leave prototypes for later, but I am going to do it all as my next goal. Today I just got a taste of the finished typechecker. But I am going to push it to 100% and then I am going to get my fill of it.

5:50pm. Ok, I admit. I was not thinking clearly when I decided to let nominals, union and regular types have constraints. That was a huge mistake. Instead of rushing forward, I am trying to think through what that means and I realize that it would make a huge mess. The only way to make that work somehow is to have the kinds carry constraints and I definitely don't want that.

I am going to streamline the language to highlight the difference between regular vars and metavars, and higher order function vars.

6:25pm. Done with lunch. Let me call it a day here. The morning session was great today, as apart from some light debugging, I got things to work very quickly. But the last few hours were hell.

6:30pm. I am still thinking about the prototypes. I am thinking of making their syntax more like Haskell's, but I've decided against it.

6:35pm. This bit of hardship has definitely gotten me into the mood to deal with. Tomorrow, I am going to cement Spiral's design and get to work on doing what I expected to leave for later.

By the looks of things, testing itself won't be a problem. In that case, I will just do this and the typechecker will be 98% done at that point. The last 2% is orphan checking across modules, but that will not be a big hurdle.

I just have to do this and Spiral v0.2's type system is done. I will never have to go through the hassle of doing this again. I'll be able to look back and consider work well done.

Tomorrow I will go at it from the parser. I will definitely do this."

Recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this is becoming a growing concerns among the top management. There has been increased escalations on service delivery and client satisfaction levels came down by 8 percentage points. CEO, Mr. Brain, knows the issues but concerned to take any actions in penalizing non-performing employees as this would affect the employee morale of all the employees in general and may further reduce the performance. Also, the market perception best employer and thereby attracting best talents to join the company.
Mr. Brain decided to initiate a data science project , which analyses the current employee data and find the core underlying causes of this performance issues. Mr. Brain, being a data scientist himself, expects the findings of this project will help him to take right course of actions. He also expects a clear indicators of non performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employee, if required, may not significantly affect other employee morals.

[MIRROR] Waterworks: Plumbing enabled sinks, tanks, plant trays, and showers. (#562)

* Waterworks: Plumbing enabled sinks, tanks, plant trays, and showers. (#52865)

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/326831214667235328/740812723956482118/2020-08-06_02-04-14.mp4
For everything in this PR working at the same time, watch this video!

Alright, from the top:
Sinks now need plumbing to pump out liquids.

All sinks now has a demand-only plumbing pipe face the opposite direction of the sink itself. A standard iron sink will hold 100 units of water, and must be constructed from a sink frame. To complete the frame, a new stock part, the water recycler must be applied to the frame. Once the sink is constructed, it will only hold those 100 units of water until new water is piped in.
This however doesn't extend just to water, as a result. Any reagent can be piped into the sink, and will be used 5 units at a time per use. This means water isn't just an infinite resource, and will need to be resupplied to the station if, somehow, you're using a metric ton of water somehow.

A basic sink setup with water being plumbed in.
Showers now need plumbing to wash you off.

Want to dispense reagents faster on your Patients Victims Friends Coworkers? Well, you may also construct a shower frame, in a similar fashion to a sink frame, and pipe in your own reagents into the loop. The shower drains reagents much faster than the shower, and also preforms vapor and touch reagent reactions, resulting in a constant stream of chemicals being processed. This can lead to horrible situations, like a chemical heater hooked up to a vat of cooking oil being pumped into a shower.
Additionally, showers will display the reagents they're pumping out visually based on the color of their chemical contents. As a result, dangerous or unique showers are going to look noticeably different if their contents are dangerous looking.

A safe shower.
image
A very unsafe shower.
Wait what was that bit about cooking oil?

So, reagent dispensers, like water/fuel tanks, Virus Food, Cooking Oil Vats, Pepperspray, and the like, can now be converted into a stationary tank of reagents by using a sheet of metal on it, allowing it to behave as a simple supply of their respective contents, and can be pumped into a plumbing network. This means rolling water tanks can be used to resupply sinks and showers, as well as allow for inventive uses of otherwise unused chemicals located all around the station. Pump welding fuel into a resupply line to fight a blob! Pump pepper spray into the dorms showers! Create a deep fryer shower! The possibilities are LIMITED (Because we have very few reagent dispensers)! Still, this will prevent sinks and showers from being completely unfix-able should all the water run out, as cargo can purchase many of these chemical tanks at will.
Hydroponics is now also plumbing enabled.

So there I was, thinking, have I gone mad? Is the barking I hear in my noggin my own dogs rattling and raging against the eternal ocean tide, or are these the hounds of tindalos come to finally rip me to shreds within the sea of causality?
The answer to this is quite simple: I added plumbing simple-demand components to hydroponics.
Now, the trays will accept a pumping input, which can provide the plants themselves a reagent input for their nutrients, and SHOULD (current not fixed yet) also contribute to refilling the trays water. As a check to this horrible decision, there are very few plumbing chems that don't suffer from some kind of downside if exclusively pumped into the trays, so this should be done delicately and with forethought applied, or you'll have a row of plants with dead stats because they OD'd on ammonia.
image
Holy damn why are you doing this

I'm thinking this pr is probably in need of some serious trimming and will probably be closed as a result of the need to atomize this down, but this way I can start to get some feedback and ideas on which aspects would be better suited towards the current design direction of plumbing/bio-chem/reagent heavy jobs. As far as I'm aware, this is all in accordance with the relevant design docs, but this way I'll know for sure 🤷‍♂️
To-do before being 100% sparkly and clean

Fix hydroponics trays adding water to the nutrient reagents slot (NOT A TRUE FIX, SEE COMMENTS BELOW PLEASE)
Make disconnected sinks/showers slowly regenerate water so that a stationwide plumbing net isn't required so Anturk doesn't snap my kneecaps off
Make water/fuel tanks use their snowflaked stationary tank sprites instead of the custom overlay version

    Yeet out the existing psudo-plumbing from hydroponics

Why It's Good For The Game

We've discussed adding plumbing into the game for forever now, and with all the new and tangentally related plumbing content we have, almost everything we have now perfectly enables servers to properly create a station-wide plumbing network.

Sinks and showers provide an infinite supply of water all shift long, and since they can be produced with any material, anywhere, practically for free, that was the first and foremost reason why I made this PR, to make water slightly more precious on station, to justify the 20+ water tanks mapped across every station. Plus, no more meatsink spam in the middle of the hallways.

Hydroponics has a built in feature that was intended to work similar to plumbing, before we had plumbing, for sharing resources/water, but it was pretty rough and is still exceptionally difficult to make look very pretty on live servers. By integrating them with actual plumbing pipes, this enables one step closer to integrating chemistry and botany to merge going forward, and give them an incentive to include each other in their supply chains each shift.

On the reagent tank conversion, That's just an interesting feature I felt the need for while testing everything else, and found pretty great success in. Being able to pipe in large supplies of a single reagent that ordinarily would just sit on a wall or in mait somewhere proved extra useful, and would be beneficial for refilling plumbing heavy areas like bathrooms/medbay, etc.

Update Silent in the Morning.txt

I've tried to figure this one out before long ago and gave up.  The previous tab from Paul Marin has almost all the right notes, but without playing it in the right position, it doesn't sound right, its missing the proper flow.  After watching the 8/15/11 Dinner and a Movie show from UIC (elements set), the amazing encore includes Silent with great close ups of Trey's playing.  Watching that, I unlocked the trick - playing the repeated notes on different strings.  Once you play it in these positions, it will click like it never has before, and it finally sounds right!  Also similar patterns Trey uses on other songs like YEM, Tweezer, etc... I hope you like my tab and find it worthy!  My main contribution to this site before this was the Inlaw Josie Wales tab I shared, back when that song was new.  I'm happy to find a tab that I could improve, and I'm really happy its this one because the patterns in this one puzzled me for a long time!

start xow.service on dongle plugin

I encountered the `Mt76Exception: Failed to load firmware` error quite a few times. xow.service is stopped and needs a restart as stated in the Troubleshooting section of the README.md. To make my life easier i added a udev rule to do just that for me when i plugged the dongle back in after uplugging it.
Should start/restart the xow.service if the service is not running or is in a `failed` state due to previous ABRT signal.
I think it would be a simple change to the udev.rules to make that the default behaviour but maybe a manual restart is desired?

Anyways, thanks a lot for your work! I'm quite happy with xow!

Lots of minor improvements and fixes

My configuration had accumulated lots of small issues, some were quite old. This
commit turned out bigger than I anticipated, but it does improve a lot of stuff.

1. Remove custom solution to save and reload the Emacs frame position. It never
worked as expected, but I kept the code because I had hopes I could improve it.
The current solution is to always start Emacs in fullscreen. Simple and fast.

2. Load "custom-file" without showing a message in the echo area.

3. Check whether the flycheck-mode function is bound before calling it in
.dir-locals.

4. Add new function to take SVG screenshots (Emacs should be compiled with Cairo
support).

5. Move winner-mode configuration to the appropriate use-package definition.

6. Disable displaying the estimated time to load Emacs during start-up. I prefer
to enable it manually in case I need it, e.g. when installing new packages.

7. Defer loading general.el and replace all of the use-package ":bind" keywords
and manual calls to general-define-key with the use-package keyword ":general".
This change reduces start-up time and it's more consistent.

8. Fix inconsistent/confusing loading of many packages, mainly because of
deferred loading complex behavior.

9. Join the ivy/counsel configurations and remove the swiper package. I'm now
using CTRLF instead.

10. Remove annoying "^" char on the initial input of many counsel functions.

11. Fix issue where counsel would try to use certain helpful functions even when
helpful was not available.

12. Move hydra, flycheck, smartparens and evil-cleverparens out of the core
namespace.

13. Remove editorconfig package. I've never used to be honest and most real
projects use other tools to enforce code style.

14. Start Emacs without showing the modeline. It makes the start-up feel even
faster because there's nothing to see changing on the screen, just the gray
background.

15. Update the guix channel to point to my fork
"https://github.com/ilmotta/guix.git".
