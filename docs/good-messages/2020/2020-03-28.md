Gettin back into it

-Arkadina joins the battle! Kinda! She has moves but there's no way to fight her
-Rose Rain now heals less
-Blood Drain has been swapped for Agitate, a move I think is much more fun
-Captain's Resolve, a move which increases one target's Rain, is unused in Finn's skill list
-Latent Spark, a move which does what you think it does, is in Arkadina's skill list

To-do: Start thinking about that Arkadina fight

"8:20am. I am up. And the first order of business will be to figure out how to disable those focus assist notifications.

https://www.howtogeek.com/435349/how-to-disable-windows-10s-annoying-focus-assist-notifications/

This is the first thing that comes up in Google. The way to disable it is literally at the top of the search so I know I am not alone in being annoyed by it.

8:25am. That was easy.

Reactive UI and Reactive Extensions for Xamarin.Forms | Xamarin Developer Summit

What surprises me about these ReactiveUI talks is how informative and different from each other they are. Yesterday at 11pm I wacted 2/3rds of this I'll finish the rest now. Given how uninformative Kent Boogaart's talk was, I thought it would be the case for the rest, but it is not. This talk in particular is a good tutorial on ReactiveUI. I am learning quite a bit from it.

8:30am. What my plan is to learn all the lower level reactive stuff, and then figure how all this is built from that.

Sometimes you can look back and realize that all the bad luck in the present stems from some failure in the past. Like a curse, the failure to attain something when it should have been mires one in mediocrity that is had to escape from.

When a power that should have been here is missing everything goes wrong.

8:40am. I can't look at this from the point of finishing Spiral. Editor support is just a side story to this; reactive programming is much more than that.

The way I've designed the language now, the typechecker will not be much trouble at all. I've gotten rid of all the troublesome spots by replacing typeclasses and row polymorphism with nominal prototypes and row subtyping coercions. Whatever is left are fairly conservative extensions to Hindley-Milner.

8:45am. Well, enough dwelling on this. Let me do my morning reading and then I'll finish that talk and resume the Rx book.

9:15am. Let me finally start the book. I'll leave slacking for later.

Time to finish the last chapter of part 3.

http://introtorx.com/Content/v1.0.10621.0/14_HotAndColdObservables.html

9:25am. This stuff with cold and hot observables is relevant to me. For example, I do not want to do typechecking on files that are unfocused unless strictly necessary.

Using laziness for this might be an elegant way of achieving this.

The challenge of handling information propagation in UIs is quite similar to editor support.

I do not feel like I am wrong at all for going down this route for once. I think that for once, I am doing the right thing in fact.

9:40am. "Some observable sequences can appear to be hot when they are in fact cold. A couple of examples that surprise many is Observable.Interval and Observable.Timer (though it should not come as a shock to attentive readers of the Creating observable sequences chapter). In the example below, we subscribe twice to the same instance, created via the Interval factory method. The delay between the two subscriptions should demonstrate that while they are subscribed to the same observable instance, the values each subscription receives are independent, i.e. Interval is cold."

Ah, so this is the main difference between hot and cold.

9:55am.

```
let period = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1.0)
let obs =
    Observable.interval period
    |> Observable.publish
Observable.connect obs
Observable.subscribe (printfn "First obs %i") obs
Threading.Thread.Sleep period
Observable.subscribe (printfn "Second obs %i") obs

Console.ReadKey()
```

I am confused as to why that connect is necessary. But I guess I'll find the reason for it at some point.

Let me just one again state how astonishing the range of functionality that Rx has is. This is definitely my kind of thing. I definitely just want to keep studying.

"In the example above, the observable variable is an IConnectableObservable<T>, and by calling Connect() it will subscribe to the underlying (the Observable.Interval)."

Ah, I see.

"As you can imagine, this is quite useful whenever an application needs to share sequences of data. In a financial trading application, if you wanted to consume a price stream for a certain asset in more than one place, you would want to try to reuse a single, common stream and avoid making another subscription to the server providing that data. In a social media application, many widgets may need to be notified whenever someone connects. Publish and Connect are perfect solutions for this."

Yeah, but having to manage that connect disposable is iffy. Isn't there a better way of turning a cold observable into a hot one?

10:10am. "Let us modify that last example by replacing uses of Connnect() by the extension method RefCount. This will "magically" implement our requirements for automatic disposal and lazy connection. RefCount will take an IConnectableObservable<T> and turn it back into an IObservable<T> while automatically implementing the "connect" and "disconnect" behavior we are looking for."

They really think of everything. This is great.

10:15am. Interval gets reset once the ref count goes to zero.

10:25am. http://introtorx.com/Content/v1.0.10621.0/15_SchedulingAndThreading.html

The previous chapter (as well as the rest of the book) was quite informative. Now it is finally time for part 4. This should be a bit fun. This chapter is long, let me see if I can go through at least half of it before it is time for breakfast.

10:35am. This stuff with threads is new to me and is something I need to master if I am going to move to the next level. And by next level, I mean UI work.

Let me translate the first example in F#.

10:40am.

```
Console.WriteLine("Starting on threadId:{0}", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)
let subject = Subject.broadcast
subject.Subscribe(fun o -> Console.WriteLine("Received {1} on threadId:{0}", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId, o))
let notify = new ParameterizedThreadStart(fun o ->
    Console.WriteLine("OnNext({1}) on threadId:{0}", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId, o)
    subject.OnNext(o)
    )

notify.Invoke(1)
Thread(notify).Start(2)
Thread(notify).Start(3)
```

Here is the C# thing rewritten in F#. I remember using that parameterized thread start delegate in the past.

10:50am. Let me also translate the next example. This chapter is going slowly so far. It is fairly brain intensive compared to the previous ones. It will take me a while to go through it after all.

Anything having to do with time or scheduling I have to really focus on.

11:05am.

```
Console.WriteLine("Starting on threadId:{0}", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)
let source =
    Observable.Create(fun (o : IObserver<_>) ->
        Console.WriteLine("Invoked on threadId:{0}", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)
        o.OnNext(1)
        o.OnNext(2)
        o.OnNext(3)
        o.OnCompleted()
        Console.WriteLine("Finished on threadId:{0}", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        Disposable.Empty;
        )

source
    .SubscribeOn(ThreadPoolScheduler.Instance)
    .Subscribe(
        (fun o -> Console.WriteLine("Received {1} on threadId:{0}", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId, o)),
        (fun () -> Console.WriteLine("OnCompleted on threadId:{0}", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId))
        )
Console.WriteLine("Subscribed on threadId:{0}", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)

Console.ReadKey()
```

I had to change `.SubscribeOn(Scheduler.ThreadPool)` to `.SubscribeOn(System.Reactive.Concurrency.ThreadPoolScheduler.Instance)` here.

This is quite good. Now I know how to make my observables async.

```
The ObserveOn method is used to declare where you want your notifications to be scheduled to. I would suggest the ObserveOn method is most useful when working with STA systems, most commonly UI applications. When writing UI applications, the SubscribeOn/ObserveOn pair is very useful for two reasons:

    * you do not want to block the UI thread
    * but you do need to update UI objects on the UI thread.
```

Holy shit, did I need this back then. I did some dirty hack to make the thing work for the game, but I missed the thing that I needed.

11:15am.

---

Consider a WPF application that used Rx to populate an ObservableCollection<T>. You would almost certainly want to use SubscribeOn to leave the Dispatcher, followed by ObserveOn to ensure you were notified back on the Dispatcher. If you failed to use the ObserveOn method, then your OnNext handlers would be invoked on the same thread that raised the notification. In Silverlight/WPF, this would cause some sort of not-supported/cross-threading exception. In this example, we subscribe to a sequence of Customers. We perform the subscription on a new thread and ensure that as we receive Customer notifications, we add them to the Customers collection on the Dispatcher.

```
_customerService.GetCustomers()
    .SubscribeOn(Scheduler.NewThread)
    .ObserveOn(DispatcherScheduler.Instance)
    //or .ObserveOnDispatcher()
    .Subscribe(Customers.Add);
```

---

Hmmm...I don't really get how this works. Should I go back and actually write out that `GetCustomers` example? Let me do it.

...No that was `GetProducts` and it was a weird SQL thing. Forget it for now.

11:35am. This UI pseudo-code made to illustrate deadlocking is really confusing.

"Avoid using blocking calls: e.g. First, Last and Single"

It seems that these are missing from the library and have been replaced by their async equivalents. Good. There is a lesson there.

"Only the final subscriber should be setting the scheduling"

I'll keep this in mind. Though I still do not get the `SubscribeOn`, `ObserveOn` split.

"Before we had a clear idea of where we should be doing the scheduling in my first Rx project, we had all sorts of layers adding 'helpful' scheduling code. What it ended up creating was a threading nightmare. When we removed all the scheduling code and then confined it it in a single layer (at least in the Silverlight client), most of our concurrency problems went away. I recommend you do the same. At least in WPF/Silverlight applications, the pattern should be simple: "Subscribe on a Background thread; Observe on the Dispatcher"."

11:45am. http://introtorx.com/Content/v1.0.10621.0/15_SchedulingAndThreading.html#AdvancedFeaturesOfSchedulers

Let me stop here. I am around 40% into the chapter. So far so good.

I do not know where the Schedule function is exactly, or rather what it should be in the current version of .NET. After this is done, I'll have the Rx.NET book that I got assist me here."

fs/sync: Make sync() satisfy many requests with one invocation

Dave Jones reported RCU stalls, overly long hrtimer interrupts, and
amazingly long NMI handlers from a trinity-induced workload involving
lots of concurrent sync() calls (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/23/369).
There are any number of things that one might do to make sync() behave
better under high levels of contention, but it is also the case that
multiple concurrent sync() system calls can be satisfied by a single
sys_sync() invocation.

Given that this situation is reminiscent of rcu_barrier(), this commit
applies the rcu_barrier() approach to sys_sync().  This approach uses
a global mutex and a sequence counter.  The mutex is held across the
sync() operation, which eliminates contention between concurrent sync()
operations.  The counter is incremented at the beginning and end of
each sync() operation, so that it is odd while a sync() operation is in
progress and even otherwise, just like sequence locks.

The code that used to be in sys_sync() is now in do_sync(), and sys_sync()
now handles the concurrency.  The sys_sync() function first takes a
snapshot of the counter, then acquires the mutex, and then takes another
snapshot of the counter.  If the values of the two snapshots indicate that
a full do_sync() executed during the mutex acquisition, the sys_sync()
function releases the mutex and returns ("Our work is done!").  Otherwise,
sys_sync() increments the counter, invokes do_sync(), and increments
the counter again.

This approach allows a single call to do_sync() to satisfy an arbitrarily
large number of sync() system calls, which should eliminate issues due
to large numbers of concurrent invocations of the sync() system call.

Changes since v1 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/24/683):

o	Add a pair of memory barriers to keep the increments from
	bleeding into the do_sync() code.  (The failure probability
	is insanely low, but when you have several hundred million
	devices running Linux, you can expect several hundred instances
	of one-in-a-million failures.)

o	Actually CC some people who have experience in this area.

Prototype of Herder AI

- Done a lot. Just gonna paste inn my "personal" report on the whole commit.
- Basically created AI behaviour for Herder enemy.

EVERYTHING I DID:

POINTS
- satt opp tags for platforms "enocunter"
- add new temp class for player. TempPlayer.
- Added left and right point and position them correctly.
	(REMEMBER: left point is now place to the right and vice versa.
	Just change fortegn på rotasjonene i constructor.
	Husk og å plasser dei skikkelig, jeg har nå bare plassert
	dei skikkelig i BP, og ikkje hardcoda da.
	I BP increasa eg vinklene litt, sånn at dei blir lengre
	vekke horisontalt, huska å gjør det i constructor når du lage den ekta)
- Variable Distance is working
- Changed points to ignore collison (ignore raycast collision)
  VERY IMPORTANT actually, wasted 1 hour 30 minutes on that shiet.

AI BEHAVIOUR
- Created Herder_BP by copying from Enemy_BP (anklebiter)
- Made little folder structure for different enemeis.
- Created the rest of Herder AI requirements; its own blackboard, AI controller and behaviour tree.
- Linked of these together by:
	- Set correct AI controller in the super top root component of Herder_BP
	- In your AI_Controller, from beginPlay in EventGraph, RunBehaviourTree and set to correct asset
	- Choose correct BlackBoard within your BehaviourTree
- Added Left/Behind/Right box colliders in MyTempPlayer_BP thorugh C++. This didn't work, so did it in BP.
- Increased size and color of Herder to differantiate from anklebiters.
- Setup Herder_BT with planned grunnmur. Added variables in BB:
	- VECTORS: LeftLocation, RightLocation, PlayerLocation
	- BOOLEANS: StageOneComplete, PrioritizeLeft
	- OBJECTS: Player, LeftPoint, RightPoint
- Added tag for TempPlayer: "TempPlayer" (this is not need in real game, as we just call get
	playerController 0, instead of finding a reference by tag).
- Got reference to chair/TempPlayer through its AI controller at beginPlay.
- Then made GetPlayerLocation Task in BT and MoveToLocation Task. These obtain the reference made,
	and calculates where TempPlayer is. Made sure that through referencing variables in BB,
	you have to set in a variable's details panel, the variable to be Instance Editable.
	This will make it possible to select which variable it actually is in the BT, so it is
	connected to the BB.
- Duplicated MoveToLocation task, and named it MoveToPoint. This is to have a simple difference.
	When point is reached, StageOne bool will be true. Added this logic inside it.
- Decided to instead of having a reference to the points in BT/BB, I'll only have the reference to
	the points's location there. The location is passed in by the AI controller, which gets the location
	from Player every frame. So made two new variables just for this, inside player c++. LeftPointLocation
	and RightPointLocation. Made sure every tick that the variables were updated inside player.
	Then, used the reference we already have in the AI Controller to transfre these values to
	the AI Controller, and from there into the blackboard.
- Next is LeftPrioritize bool. Made tag for Herder_BP "Herder". Adda BeginOvarlap for LeftBox of RightBox
	i Player. Connection skjer fra Player til Herder_BP til AI Controller til BlackBoard.
	Husk at du må sifta om på bool valuene sån at han går left når da e left og sån. Eg har jo
	feil plass på dei (rigtpoint er LeftPoint etc).
- Next is CompleteStageOneBool. (bare bruk ein bool, bare bruk den reference boolen som heter RefToStageOne så slepper
	du å CheckCurrentStage tasken. blir og ryddigere)
	- Ser at OverlapEvents blir triggra 4 gonger per frame, så lagde heilt ny collision channel som
		heter Herder. Lagde ny box collider i Herder_BP som Herder type, og skifta behind collideren
		i Player til samme Herder type. Alt er på Ignore unntatt "Herder" som er overlap.
		(Ditta kan du gjør på left/right colliderene og, bedre performance, slepper å caste)
	- Her går da fra BehaviourTree (MoveToPoint task) direkte til Herder_BP og så Player.
		Ditta gjelde å get bool value fra BT til Player sån at Player kan sei om da skjer
		overlapEnd, og så manipulera denna bool value accordingly. Den blir sendt fra BT til
		Herder til Player, og manipulert går fra Player til Herder men ikkje tilbake til BT.
		(eller BB egentlig). Så for å senda bool over det siste steget, laget eg ny task i BT
		som heter "CheckCurrentStage". Denne checker om AI skal fortsette å utføre stage two, ved å
		sjekke ka StageOneComplete bool egentlig er, og så transfere den informasjonen til BB booleanen.
		Når den sjekker ka den egentlige boolen er, så får den informasjonen fra AI controlleren i tick
		function.
- Set rotation of enemies, først disable all rotation shit i movementComponenten. Så bare simpel i tick for Herder_BP.
	Bare ser ka eg gjorde i starten av tick function.
- Middle box prioritizer:
	- Lagde ny box colllider i TempPlayer_BP som kalles MiddleBox. Huska å setta collision til Herder og ignore al
		unntatt andre herders som er overlap.
	- Refrencing kommer til å gå: Player-Herder-AIController-BlackBoard. Så lagde PrioritizePlayer bool i Herder_BP.
		Merk deg dei publice variablene. Eg satte dei nye som eg har lagt alle om til public.
	- Så lagde eg variabel i BlackBoard som heter PrioritizePlayer og satte opp logic i BT.
	- Siste del er bare å connecte referencingen per tick i AIControlleren.

drm: add managed resources tied to drm_device

We have lots of these. And the cleanup code tends to be of dubious
quality. The biggest wrong pattern is that developers use devm_, which
ties the release action to the underlying struct device, whereas
all the userspace visible stuff attached to a drm_device can long
outlive that one (e.g. after a hotunplug while userspace has open
files and mmap'ed buffers). Give people what they want, but with more
correctness.

Mostly copied from devres.c, with types adjusted to fit drm_device and
a few simplifications - I didn't (yet) copy over everything. Since
the types don't match code sharing looked like a hopeless endeavour.

For now it's only super simplified, no groups, you can't remove
actions (but kfree exists, we'll need that soon). Plus all specific to
drm_device ofc, including the logging. Which I didn't bother to make
compile-time optional, since none of the other drm logging is compile
time optional either.

One tricky bit here is the chicken&egg between allocating your
drm_device structure and initiliazing it with drm_dev_init. For
perfect onion unwinding we'd need to have the action to kfree the
allocation registered before drm_dev_init registers any of its own
release handlers. But drm_dev_init doesn't know where exactly the
drm_device is emebedded into the overall structure, and by the time it
returns it'll all be too late. And forcing drivers to be able clean up
everything except the one kzalloc is silly.

Work around this by having a very special final_kfree pointer. This
also avoids troubles with the list head possibly disappearing from
underneath us when we release all resources attached to the
drm_device.

v2: Do all the kerneldoc at the end, to avoid lots of fairly pointless
shuffling while getting everything into shape.

v3: Add static to add/del_dr (Neil)
Move typo fix to the right patch (Neil)

v4: Enforce contract for drmm_add_final_kfree:

Use ksize() to check that the drm_device is indeed contained somewhere
in the final kfree(). Because we need that or the entire managed
release logic blows up in a pile of use-after-frees. Motivated by a
discussion with Laurent.

v5: Review from Laurent:
- %zu instead of casting size_t
- header guards
- sorting of includes
- guarding of data assignment if we didn't allocate it for a NULL
  pointer
- delete spurious newline
- cast void* data parameter correctly in ->release call, no idea how
  this even worked before

v6: Review from Sam
- Add the kerneldoc for the managed sub-struct back in, even if it
  doesn't show up in the generated html somehow.
- Explain why __always_inline.
- Fix bisectability around the final kfree() in drm_dev_relase(). This
  is just interim code which will disappear again.
- Some whitespace polish.
- Add debug output when drmm_add_action or drmm_kmalloc fail.

v7: My bisectability fix wasn't up to par as noticed by smatch.

v8: Remove unecessary {} around if else

v9: Use kstrdup_const, which requires kfree_const and introducing a free_dr()
helper (Thomas).

v10: kfree_const goes boom on the plain "kmalloc" assignment, somehow
we need to wrap that in kstrdup_const() too!! Also renumber revision
log, I somehow reset it midway thruh.

"1pm. Let me finish the recent batch of RTW chapters and then I will resume. I'll leave the chores for later.

1:40pm. Let me resume. Enough slacking.

Let me deal with the chapter.

1:45pm.

```
var myName = "Lee";
scheduler.Schedule(
    () => Console.WriteLine("myName = {0}", myName));
myName = "John";//What will get written to the console?
```

Actually, I had not realized that there is no easy way to pass in a variable as a constant in C#.

```
var myName = "Lee";
scheduler.Schedule(myName,
    (_, state) =>
        {
        Console.WriteLine(state);
        return Disposable.Empty;
        });
myName = "John";
```

"Here, we pass myName as the state. We also pass a delegate that will take the state and return a disposable. The disposable is used for cancellation; we will look into that later. The delegate also takes an IScheduler parameter, which we name "_" (underscore). This is the convention to indicate we are ignoring the argument. When we pass myName as the state, a reference to the state is kept internally. So when we update the myName variable to "John", the reference to "Lee" is still maintained by the scheduler's internal workings."

How convoluted. Thankfully I do not have to think about this in F#.

1:55pm. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20192645
https://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/

Right now I am wondering about Scala. Agh, let me take some time to do reading related to my interests. My focus is not that high at the moment. I'll dive into the book once I get through this.

2:20pm.

```
Like other groups it looks like a lot of the size difference is due to them using an LR parser generator and tree rewriting for parsing, as well as a regex->NFA->DFA conversion pipeline for lexing. Their front-end (lexing+parsing+AST construction) is 5548 lines where ours is 2164, with similar ratios for bytes. They also used expect tests for their parser where we used similar snapshot tests that put the expected output outside the code, so their parser tests were ~600 lines of that total where ours were ~200.
```

These are fairly insane sizes for a parser. They are definitely doing something wrong.

It seems they were parsing Java.

Hmmm...as far as language go, Spiral has a fairly complex syntax - certainly moreso than Java. Still, it tops at 2k I think. It would be possible to do it under 1k if I were doing everything using FParsec directly.

2:25pm. I had my fun. Let me get back to the book. Focus me, focus.

```
Concurrency.Scheduler
```

Ah, this thing actually exists in the current version. Great!

```
var list = new List<int>();
scheduler.Schedule(list,
    (innerScheduler, state) =>
        {
        Console.WriteLine(state.Count);
        return Disposable.Empty;
        });
list.Add(1);
```

I am trying to rewrite the above in F# and am realizing that every single overload takes an `IScheduler` as the first argument. Just what is `innerScheduler` supposed to be here anyway?

Clearly the APIs have change, and for the better in the latest version of .NET.

...Er, let me backtrack a little through the chapter. Let me go from the top. I forgot what it was about by this point.

3:10pm.

```
var source = new FileStream(@"C:\Somefile.txt", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
var factory = Observable.FromAsyncPattern<byte[], int, int, int>(
    source.BeginRead,
    source.EndRead);
var buffer = new byte[source.Length];
IObservable<int> reader = factory(buffer, 0, (int)source.Length);
reader.Subscribe(
    bytesRead =>
        Console.WriteLine("Read {0} bytes from file into buffer", bytesRead));
```

Mmmm...let me try rewriting this in F#. At this point I am really reconsidering just switching books, but I'll persevere.

3:15pm.

```
let f : AsyncCallback -> obj -> IAsyncResult = failwith ""
let g : IAsyncResult -> _ = failwith ""

let factory = Observable.FromAsyncPattern(f,g)
```

I actually can't figure out how to pass the arguments into this properly as the function has literally 30 overloads. At the end of this I get a warning that this is depreciated.

```
Warning FS0044 This construct is deprecated. This conversion is no longer supported. Replace use of the Begin/End asynchronous method pair with a new Task-based async method, and convert the result using ToObservable. If no Task-based async method is available, use Task.Factory.FromAsync to obtain a Task object.
```

Ah, I just realized, even though the compiler will accept the method, Intellisense won't show it. I had no idea this was a thing in VS.

3:25pm.

```
let source = new FileStream(@"C:\Somefile.txt", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)
let q = source.AsyncRead(3)
let x = Observable.FromAsync(Async.ta)
```

Agh, I am confused. `AsyncRead` produces a value of the `Async` type. `FromAsync` wants a `Task`. The examples in the book are simply too outdated for me to follow them properly.

Forget about this.

3:30pm. Things like these really do take me off my game. I can't really focus 50% of the time properly. Either I am paying attention or I am not.

3:35pm. Enough. Unlike the rest, this chapter is really weak and outdated. Let me move on to the `Rx.NET in Action with Examples in C#` 2017 book.

I'll start from the top and make my way through it quickly. Given that I've covered plenty of ground already, it should not take me too long till I reach the point I am already at.

5pm. 40/337. Let me do the chores here. I am actually quite distracted right now. I am thinking about Spiral's pattern matching and how I could do pattern matching on arrays and lists. I am also thinking of adding pattern matching on dictionaries. Also, I might add the variable equality match with `$k`. That would be best.

...Forget this. I need to focus on the book. Let me do the chores and I'll see whether I can put in another 30 pages away.

5:40pm. Done with chores. Let me see if I can skim some of these early chapters. I really do not need an explanation of what observables are at this point.

6:15pm.

---

Many times developers choose to change the event-handler registration to a lambda
expression such as

`anObject.SomeEvent += (sender, eventArgs)=>{...};`

---

I was guilty of this in the poker GUI. But it really made things a lot easier, and in addition to this, the UI would only need to be disposed after the app exits.

Lunch time.

6:20pm. 52/337. Let me stop here. There is a lot of new stuff in this book, and as it turns out I can't just skim over all of this. I am actually going to have to pay attention to what is written.

This is fine. I did say I would take my time."

Term changes

In my opinions, your translations are grammatically correct, but there are terms that are different in Chinese and English, I'll list them here and propose file change.
Touch -> Tap : We "tap" on a "touch"screen phones, yeah.
Get -> Purchase : To make it more obvious.
Kill -> Defeat : PvZ1 and 2 in English never use the world kill, so I suggest that you shouldn't too.
Drive -> Trigger : Drive doesn't make sense to me (and people who tried to translate the game to English using google translate)
Weapons...
I don't know about this name, are they called weapons in Chinese too? I'd suggest blocks but not all of them are blocks, I dunno .-.
Weapon Card is problematic too, because in English PvZ we call it "Seed Packets", I don't know what to call them here, my idea was crafting recipe but I don't think it works .-.
Also, in English PvZ1, Crazy Dave always call the player "neighbor", do you want to change this?
I'll leave dialogues and Almanac entries for now, I'm still working on almanac entries and I can't change the dialogues without knowing the contexts.

Arrow consistency with other editors

Let me preface this will a huge thank you for creating this wonderful editor! I love the work you've done.

Other popular editors, specifically VS Code, Atom, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio use right for closed and down for open. I personally find down for closed and up for open extremely unintuitive. Swapping the arrow directions in the settings (something I don't think needs to be a setting) still feels very off.

Kivy is Laggy ? Yes, it is.

Hello eevryone ,

Today i'm making a small update to integrate an old function that shows the emergencies numbers that you can call where-ever you're but it's not the main topic of this small update.

Today, I want to say that I will stop for a moment to continue to dev this program.
Why ?
Because Kivy is Laggy and its really annoying to see it as a final product.
For now, I don't know how to optimize it.
So i will take sometimes to work on it AND also find another UI.

To be honest, it's really frustrating to see that our works not always follow our plans as usual!

So I will work by my side but I will not give up for now !

Franck ROCHAT , :four_leaf_clover: :sunny:  .

llvm: libomptarget support (#14060)

This allows the llvm build to support:

* clang cuda
* libomptarget for:
  * current host
  * cuda
* bitcode compilation of libomptarget device runtime for inlining by 
  bootstrapping libomptarget
* split dwarf information support as an option for debug builds, if you need a
  debug build, for the love of all that's good in the universe use this flag
* adds necessary dependencies for shared library builds and libomp and
  libomp target to build correctly
* new version of z3 to make it sufficient to build recent llvm

The actual change is much smaller than the diff, this is because it's been formatted with black.  I realize this kinda sucks right now, but I'm hoping it will make future updates here less painful.

Please add a bit more info about boot process

Your guide is so good that it's a shame to skip over this critical step. (It feels to me like the "magic step".)

And sorry for the bogus pull request, but I didn't see any way to ask questions... Thank you.

"fix" myperl::Pxb's annoying habit of useless line numbers in error messages

unfortunately, I had to do this via cheating (`$Carp::CarpLevel`) :-(
but I honestly can't figure out a better way:
-	`@CARP_NOT` only seems to work from the package that actually makes the `croak` call
-	which doesn't help me a whit :-/
-	and `%Carp::CarpInternal` seemed like a bridge too far, even for me
-	so I'm stuck with this until someone suggests a better way
