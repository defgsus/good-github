"fix" myperl::Pxb's annoying habit of useless line numbers in error messages

unfortunately, I had to do this via cheating (`$Carp::CarpLevel`) :-(
but I honestly can't figure out a better way:
-	`@CARP_NOT` only seems to work from the package that actually makes the `croak` call
-	which doesn't help me a whit :-/
-	and `%Carp::CarpInternal` seemed like a bridge too far, even for me
-	so I'm stuck with this until someone suggests a better way
