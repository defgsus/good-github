Baubas here

Baubas, an evil spirit with long lean arms, wrinkly fingers and red eyes. He harasses people and tears their hair or stifles them. To children, he is the equivalent of the boogeyman of the English-speaking countries. A misbehaving child could be told by the parents: "Behave, or baubas will come and get you". Also it could be described as a black and dark creature living under the carpet or in some dark spot of the house.

Unethical Aspects of Image Classification

This project was a collaborative paper on Image Classification.

Image classification has played an important role in everyday uses and the growth of data
science. According to the case study featured on Science Direct, Image Classification refers to
the process of computer vision being able to classify an image to its visual content. The use of
algorithms to classify is used in everyday life from experimentation to visual tagging on social
media. The algorithms used for image classification are able to be seen as both positive and
negative within the data science community.
Our paper is presented to the reader as follows; the first section will showcase image
classification models used within multiple industry fields and how it can benefit society. The
second section will feature the unethical aspects of image classification. Our final section will
summarize what we discovered and discuss why our group believes this is the importance to the
data science community

Build Ledger as amalgamation library

I am getting really frustrated because Ledger uses C++ with Boost. This
makes IDE experience miserable because Boost likes templates a lot and
it takes ages for IDEs to figure out what the heck is going on there,
and they have to do it each time when I come back to the project: just
sit around for 10 minutes until Android Studio gathers up its shit
(moveover, it's just impossible to do without having 16 GB+ or RAM).

So fuck Boost. That's what I want to say. Don't bend to this cancer.
But we don't have much choice here, do we?

Since Google does not have such problems, there is no good workaround.
The suggested approach is to factor out the problematic projects. This
is exactly what I'm doing here. Ledger build will be completely
independent from the main Gradle build for Ledger AAR. The libraries
will be prebuilt, and they actually include everything that Ledger
needs: itself, Boost, GMP, MPFR, whatever -- all packed into one giant
250+ MB static library for the linker to have fun with. SQLite calls
this "amalgamation" so I will do as well. And yeah, we need to build
this abomination for all four architectures supported by Android!

Anyhow, the "make ledger-libs" target has been adjusted to do just that.
We don't adjust Android Studio project in this commit though, that will
come a bit later.

And yeah! Note that it's not enough to just build the library. We also
need to KILL WITH FUCKING FIRE all Boost includes from public headers
which are so abundant in Ledger. There is no easy way to do that other
than meticulously wrap each and every Ledger object into a PIMPL wrapper
so that it's completely totally absolutely insulated from Boost via ABI.
Well, let's hope that link-time optimizations elide all that.

Day 10 - second star

What I like:
- Combinatoric solution. It pleases me :)
- `in-groups` using a lazy stream!

What I don't like:
- Utils with no tests (WTF!)
- The time I've spent trying to figure out the right formula.

Instead of applying memoization ("dynamic programming"), I _insisted_
on finding the right formula. It took me hours to understand that
"3 holes in a sequence" was actually 2^(n-3). But it worth it, I'm a
tad smarter now (at least I hope so!).

I also got my time to get back to stream and lazy sequences in Racket.
It's really cool and easy, so much I had to write a small reminder to
myself https://ronie.medium.com/going-lazy-with-racket-dd39b71ca06.

For me, I get stuck on Day 10 of AoC for more than I'd like to admit,
but that pushed me on some areas I enjoy learning and exploring.

Yeah, I love when I hit a wall! <3

Strong Password Hacker rank Problem

Louise joined a social networking site to stay in touch with her friends. The signup page required her to input a name and a password. However, the password must be strong. The website considers a password to be strong if it satisfies the following criteria:

Its length is at least .
It contains at least one digit.
It contains at least one lowercase English character.
It contains at least one uppercase English character.
It contains at least one special character. The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()-+
She typed a random string of length  in the password field but wasn't sure if it was strong. Given the string she typed, can you find the minimum number of characters she must add to make her password strong?

Note: Here's the set of types of characters in a form you can paste in your solution:

numbers = "0123456789"
lower_case = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
upper_case = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
special_characters = "!@#$%^&*()-+"
Example

Undefined control sequence \eq

This password is 5 characters long and is missing an uppercase and a special character. The minimum number of characters to add is .

Undefined control sequence \eq

This password is 5 characters long and has at least one of each character type. The minimum number of characters to add is .

Function Description

Complete the minimumNumber function in the editor below.

minimumNumber has the following parameters:

int n: the length of the password
string password: the password to test
Returns

int: the minimum number of characters to add
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the length of the password.

The second line contains the password string. Each character is either a lowercase/uppercase English alphabet, a digit, or a special character.

Constraints

All characters in  are in [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], or [!@#$%^&*()-+ ].
Sample Input 0

3
Ab1
Sample Output 0

3
Explanation 0

She can make the password strong by adding  characters, for example, $hk, turning the password into Ab1$hk which is strong.

 characters aren't enough since the length must be at least .

Sample Input 1

11
#HackerRank
Sample Output 1

1
Explanation 1

The password isn't strong, but she can make it strong by adding a single digit.
