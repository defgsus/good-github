Fixed bug where you couldn't place turrets next to each other because OwnlyMe decided the HP bars were to be entities for god knows what reason. Replaced that entity code with calls to draw_animation. Also, for the first time, commiting my own cheat library of settings I use in my personal games to git, mostly so I can keep track of chagnes I make over time / have a safety net if I oopsie and delete something. I don't expect anyone to use these cheats, but, feel free, I guess.

feat(buildozer): add documentation for the buildozer rule

This patch introduces Stardoc to this workspace, and adds a series of
targets that ultimately generate an output containing the rule reference
for `//buildozer:def.bzl%_buildozer`, stripping the underscore for a
nicer user experience.

It's difficult to say whether or not this is the best way to go about
this, as what we're really doing is generating documentation for a
private symbol (`_buildozer`), and then defining a genrule to invoke
`sed` and remove the offending underscore. This rule is private because
we expose the rule through a public macro `buildozer`, however, stardoc
is incapable of generating complete documentation for the macro
(including attributes from the proxied rule, which is what we'd want for
friendly documentation -- see https://github.com/bazelbuild/stardoc/issues/82).
