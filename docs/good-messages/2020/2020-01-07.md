Merge pull request #64 from xephonhq/web/vuepress

Replace nuxt.js with vuepress #52 

- Add license field #34 

The website supports more filter, and the implementation is no longer hard coded, there is a schema defined in javascript and can be checked using `make check`

REAMD.md file is now partially generated `make generate`, a markdown table is injected and other content can be edited by human directly as long as you don't touch the magic comment used by regular expression (poor man's template)

Each database now has its own page e.g. https://awesome-time-series-database.netlify.com/database/akumuli.html Except the vue component, it's plain markdown and people can say whatever they want (marketing stuff like fastest tsdb ...) I am thinking about a common layout for people (at least myself) to recap what's special about a tsdb (e.g. storage format, compression)

Spell tweaks/improvements, new monsterdrops

* Set it so that air talisman's effect only works on summoned monsters,
using the new ability to filter by monster ID. This eliminates having it
apply the effect to NPCs.
* Set it so that Consecrate has added effects when you hit specific
monsters with it. The Arcane Blessing version hits just about every
nether, triffid, and fungal monster in vanilla, along with all four
arcana boss monsters, with a dazing attack, along with massive damage to
hostile summoned monsters.
* Also gave a lesser version of the effect to the Magic Sign version of
Consecrate. The selection of monsters affected is narrower (no bosses,
few advanced monsters), the total effect is weaker, and it doesn't
affect summoned monsters at all.
* Finally changed Flame Armor and Frost Armor to more
consistent-sounding names, Heat Ward and Cold Ward. Had to do it the
stupid way via obsoleting the old spells and making new ones with the
desired ID, because the spell list is by spell ID instead of something
sane like spell NAME.
* Added drop additions for the new triffid monster, and the shock leech
family.
