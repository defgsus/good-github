Update

# Companions
- Fixed companions having 100% absorption, meaning they can actually die now.
- Companions now have varying HP based on their size, e.g. bigger equals more HP.
- Companions now have varying FP costs to summon, based on their size.
- Changed the companion summon items into 'Tablets', to allow for a more generalized icon. Needed as icon space is low, and unique icons aren't required for these items, unlike weapons and armor.
 - Incense of Cooperation -> Sunlight Tablet
 - Crab Bait -> Crab Tablet
 - Rocky's Stick -> Craggy Tablet
 - Slug Whistle -> Slimy Tablet
 - Blessed Tipple -> Blessed Tablet
 - Old Bone -> Dusty Tablet
 - Rat Treat -> Rat Tablet
- Added Hallowed Tablet: summon Erekris, the Cathedral Knight - Found in Cathedral of the Deep
- Added Holy Tablet: summon Metora, the Cathedral Evangelist - Found in Cathedral of the Deep
- Added Royal Tablet: summon Farold, the Lothric Knight - Found in High Wall of Lothric
- Added Scorched Tablet: summon Zarloth, the Black Knight - Found in Kiln of the First Flame
- Added Etched Tablet: summon Praxos, the Silver Knight - Found in Anor Londo
- Added Bloodied Tablet: summon Woof, the Undead Dog - Found in Undead Settlement
- Added Wrathful Tablet: summon Alfreda, the Pontiff Knight - Transposed from Pontiff Sulyvahn soul
- Added Crystalline Tablet: summon Tazshi, the Ravenous Crystal Lizard - Transposed from Oceiros soul
- Added Demonic Tablet: summon Bazdulk, the Demon - Transposed from Demon Prince soul

Fundamental pagination flaw fixed with re-implementation, with other fixes.

After attempting to do some heavy local caching of a GitHub org (local
processing is -much- faster than trying to do remote requests, let alone having
to be concerned with quotas and whatnot), there would be times where the tool
would just -hang-.  No new output was produced, but no network or disk activity
was active.  And of course this appeared to be intermittant...

THE SYMPTOMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING:

The main way that this failure showed itself was by periodically stalling.  A
quick run through with 'set -x' set showed that it was failing at the final
step, where multiple json files are stiched together.  For some reason, the
list of files to stitch was coming up empty.  Feed no input to a tool that is
expecting input, and you get a hanging tool.

Figuring out -why- the files were dissapearing was much harder than expected.
At first I though that the files weren't being created, or that requests
weren't being made.  At one point, I confirmed that files were dissapearing
before they were attempting to be merged, which did help isolate the problem to
the substituted process, but for the longest time it seemed like it was humming
along just fine.

At one point, I attempted to simplify the everything by removing the final 'sed'
command within the curl request, and was reminded why this implementation ended
up like this in the first place.  Without the final 'sed', the rest of the
script continues as if nothing happened and eventually completes.  Meanwhile,
the process substitution almost always takes much longer, and when it finally
does finish, the files are immediately cleaned up due to the trap, and you're
left with only the first page of data.

While debugging this issue, it became trivially apparent when the terminal
prompt would reappear, in the middle of the substituted process still doing its
thing.

THE ROOT CAUSE:

As I -now- know, traps are -not- inherited by subshells, but -are- with process
substitution.  And whenever a --paginated request was made, when it turned out
that no additional pages would be needed, the 'seq' would fail since 'seq 2 1'
is understandably not valid.

This then triggers the 'cleanup' trap, resulting in that entire string of
commands capturing the first request, then blowing it away because the final
'sed' command has long since stopped getting input.

As for why this appeared intermittant, welp, -that's- because before I realized
that -this- was the problem, I was trying other things like varying the
'per_page' size, and the request URL, -both- of which changed the behavior of
the problem...

THE RE-IMPLEMENTATION:

The nice thing about all of this was that in my time away from managing this
block of code, I gathered some new tools.  I remembered that 'curl' supports
outputing only the header into a file, and used this with a temporal fifo to do
the header analysis (in fact, I think I originally tried to do this -without-
a fifo, for reasons only a younger me only knows).  Once this was done, I could
get rid of the weird implementation in its entirety since I can throw the first
'curl' request into the background, read the fifo to determine how many more
requests to make, make them in the background, and wait on all of the requests
to resolve within the main script.

Oh, and I made sure that 'seq' doesn't try to run if only the first page is
needed.

Now, for the minior fixes:
- Always request the max datum size, even for simple requests
- Disabled datum check for 'get' request, since it can apparently accept data...
- Added trap for user interruption.  Useful for those really large requests.

#### Saturday 2020-10-31 20:58:08 by Luke Humphreys

Alternate Universe Ivor: Level_1

The youngest son of a successful merchant, the path of Ivor's life was
altered for ever when his father was convicted of Fraud and embezzlement
after falling foul of a member of the local nobility, Lord Haslow.
Impoverished, and with their widower father gaoled for life, the 3
children suddenly found themselves thrown onto the streets of Baldur's
Gate.

Life was very hard for the first few years, but the young Ivor was sheltered
from the worse of it by his elder siblings who slowly started to crawl onto the
bottom rung of the local underworld. After several years, between Elisa's
prodigious thieving skills and Alexey's Del Boy-esque "talent" for a shady deal,
the family could start to think about surviving the next week rather than until
the next meal.

Both of his elder siblings worried about Ivor's chances of survival. He was more
than able to keep up with Elisa on any thieving mission for the guild, and his
sharp sense and saved them both more than once. None the less he lacked the
confidence and bravado required to flourish in this mirky underworld.

It was Elisa who came up with a solution, coming into some valuable information
she and Alexey were able to blackmail the Abbot of Oak-Tree Abbey to take Ivor
in as a novice. In order to save face, it was agreed that everyone (including)
Ivor would be told that he had entered the monastery on a scholarship.

The Abbot was good to his word, and Ivor was not mistreated. In truth the
timing was perfect - he was after a patsy. The Abbey had started to hear
whispers that the "Cult of the dragon" were stirring into action. Ivor was
given the unglamorous research specialism of the Cult. Given access to the
archives of the monastery and resources to hunt down historical sites Ivor
published prodigiously for nearly 20 years. In truth he discovered little the
leaders of the Order did not already know - but he had become the publish face
of the Order's research into the cult. When the time came, he would be
sacrificed allowing the cult to believe they had removed the one remaining
expert in the field.
