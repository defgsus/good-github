Create IT’S MAGIC!

Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

Input:

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

Output:

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

 

Constraints:

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109

SAMPLE INPUT 
5
14 7 8 2 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
1
Explanation
Both 14 and 7 are valid answers, but since 7 is the smallest, the required array index is 1.

"8:10am. Got up 10m ago. It is time to chill.

9:05am. Done. Let me do some work. Today come the JS DOM tutorials. Let me go through the first one.

Damn I sure feel like slacking here.

10am. https://youtu.be/0ik6X4DJKCc?t=1940

Ok, this part is new to me. How does this work? ...Ah, he wraps it in quotes a moment later. Nevermind.

10:15am. The stuff here is super simple. Maybe I should have skipped this, but since I did say I am going to do it I might as well do it. Let me go through the 3 left and then I'll take a proper break. Hopefully I can hold myself from falling asleep.

10:20am. https://youtu.be/mPd2aJXCZ2g?t=382

What is going on here?

11am. Done with 2. Had to take break. Let me move onto 3. This is so boring, but I have to persevere. After I am done with this DOM stuff, I am going to move on to the framework vids. After I cross that mountain, I can finally move onto the backend.

11:20am. Rather than watching the video, I am thinking about Spiral.

Because that `From: NearTo:` idea, I've been thinking of how to fit it all together.

I am going to do one thing - I am going to bring back objects. This time they will be simpler than before - I'll simply use them for modules. One difference from records is that it will be possible to apply keyword args to them directly `Range .From: a NearTo: b`. Also unlike records which use immutable maps, I will implement then using dictionaries. This will make indexing into them faster at compile time.

11:25am. This is really great. This is how things should be done.

11:30am. Ever since I had that idea about big keyword arg uses, I've been thinking on and off on how to implement this and it is finally coming together.

12pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i37KVt_IcXw

I know I said I would do 4, and I certainly had the time for it, but let me stop here. I'll leave the last for after the break. I am going to fall asleep here at this rate.

12:55pm. Let me finish the Toji ep and then I will do the chores. After that comes the last video, and one of the framework courses. Also, it seems I forgot to commit. Let me do it here."

28.1.Database Tricks on SymfonyCloud

We just deployed to SymfonyCloud! Well, I mean, we did... but it doesn't... ya know... work yet. Because this is the production 500 error, we can't see the real problem.
No worries! Head back to your terminal. The symfony command has an easy way to check the production logs. It is...

symfony logs

This prints a list of all the logs. The app/ directory is where our application is deployed to - so the first item is our project's var/log/prod.log file. You can also check out the raw access log... or everything. Hit 0 to "tail" the prod.log file. And... there it is:

An exception has occurred... Connection refused.

Adding a Database to SymfonyCloud
I recognize this: it's a database error.... which... hmm... makes sense: we haven't told SymfonyCloud that we need a database! Let's go do that!
Google for "SymfonyCloud MySQL" to find... oh! A page that talks about exactly that. Ok, we need to add a little bit of config to 2 files. The first is .symfony/services.yaml. This is where you tell SymfonyCloud about all the services you need - like a database service, ElasticSearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.
Copy the config for .symfony/services.yaml... then open that file and paste.
The database is actually MariaDB, which is why the version here is 10.2: MariaDB version 10.2.
Notice that we've used the key mydatabase. That can be anything you want: we'll reference this string from the other config file that we need to change: .symfony.cloud.yaml.
Inside that file, we need a relationships key: this is what binds the web container to that database service. Let's see... we don't have a relationships key yet, so let's add it: relationships and, below, add our first relationship with a special string: database set to mydatabase:mysql.
This syntax... is a little funny. The mydatabase part is referring to whatever key we used in services.yaml - and then we say :mysql... because that service is a mysql type.
The really important thing is that we called this relationship database. Thanks to that SymfonyCloud will expose an environment variable called DATABASE_URL which contains the full MySQL connection string: username, host, database name and all:

 29 lines  .env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:3306/blackfire
It's literally DATABASE_URL and not PIZZA_URL because we called the relationship database instead of pizza... which would have been less descriptive, but more delicious.
This is important because DATABASE_URL happens to be the environment variable that our app will use to connect to the database. In other words, our app will instantly have database config.

Back at the terminal, hit Ctrl+C to exit from logging. Let's add the two changes and commit them:

git add .
git commit -m "adding SfCloud database"
Now, deploy!

symfony deploy
Oh, duh - run with the --bypass-checks flag:

symfony deploy --bypass-checks
The deploy will still take some time - it has a lot of work to do - but it'll be faster than before. When it finishes... it dumps the same URL - that won't change. But to be even lazier than last time, let's tell the command to open this URL in my browser... for me:

symfony open:remote
Tunneling to the Database
And... we have a deployed site! Woo! The database is empty... but if this were a real app, it would start to be populated by real users entering their real Bigfoot sightings... cause Bigfoot is... totally real.
But... to make this a bit more interesting for us, let's load the fixture data one time on production.

This is a bit tricky because the fixture system - which comes from DoctrineFixturesBundle - is a Composer "dev" dependency... which means that it's not even installed on production. That's good for performance. If it were installed, we could run:

symfony ssh
To SSH into our container, and then execute the command to load the fixtures. But... that won't work.

No problem! We can do something cooler. Exit out of SSH, and run:

symfony tunnel:open
I love this feature. Normally, the remote database isn't accessible by anything other than our container: you can't connect to it from anywhere else on the Internet. It's totally firewalled. But suddenly, we can connect to the production database locally on port 30000. We can use that to run the fixtures command locally - but send the data up to that database. Do it by running:

DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:30000/main php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
Ok, let's break this down. First, there is actually a much easier way to do all of this... but I'll save that for some future SymfonyCloud tutorial. Basically, we're running the doctrine:fixtures:load command but sending it a different DATABASE_URL: one that points at our production database. When you open a tunnel, you can access the database with root user, no password - and the database is called main.
The only problem is that this command... takes forever to run. I'm not sure exactly why - but it is doing all of this over a network. Go grab some coffee and come back in a few minutes.
When it finishes... yes! Go refresh the page! Ha! We have a production site with at least enough data to make profiling interesting.
Next, let's do that! Let's configure Blackfire on production! That's easy right? Just repeat the Blackfire install process on a different server... right? Yep! Wait, no! Yes! Bah! To explain, we need to talk about a wonderful concept in Blackfire called "environments".

31.1.Automatic Performance Checks: Builds{Hello Builds; Build "URLs to Test"; Build Log: blackfire-player}

Head back to https://blackfire.io, click "Environments" and click into our "Sasquatch Sightings Production" environment.
Interesting. By default, it takes us not to the profiles tab... but to a tab called "Builds". And, look on the right: "Periodic Builds": "Builds are started every 6 hours"... which we could change to a different interval.
Further below, there are a bunch of "notification channels" where you can tell Blackfire that you want to be notified - like via Slack - of the results of this "build" thingy.

Hello Builds
Ok, what the heck is a build anyways? To find out, let's trigger one manually, then stand back and see what happens. Click "Start a Build". The form pre-fills the URL to our site... cool... and we can apparently give it a title if we want. Let's... just start the build.
This takes us to a new page where.... interesting: it's running an "Untitled Scenario"... then it looks like it went to the homepage... and created a profile?
Let's... back up: there are a lot of interesting things going on. And I love interesting things!
First, we've seen this word "scenario" before! Earlier, we used the blackfire-player: a command-line tool that's made by the Blackfire people... but can be used totally outside of the profiling tool. We created a scenario.bkf file where we defined a scenario and used the special blackfire-player language to tell it to go to the homepage, assert a few things, then click on the "Log In" link and check something else:

 20 lines  scenario.bkf
name "Various scenarios for the site"
# override with --endpoint option
endpoint "https://localhost:8000"
scenario
    name "Basic Visit"
    visit url("/")
        name "Homepage"
        expect status_code() == 200
        expect css("tbody.js-sightings-list tr").count() > 10
        # won't work until we're using Blackfire environment
        assert metrics.sql.queries.count < 30
    click link("Log In")
        name "Login page"
        expect status_code() == 200
At that time, this was a nice way to "crawl" a site and test some things on it. The "build" used the same "scenario" word. That's not an accident. More on that soon.

Build "URLs to Test"
The second important thing is that this profiled the homepage because, when we created our environment, we configured one "URL to test": the homepage. That's what the build is doing: "testing" - meaning profiling - that page.
Let's add a second URL. One other page we've been working on a lot is /api/github-organization: this JSON endpoint. Copy that URL and add it as a second "URL to test". Click save... then manually create a second build.
Like before, it creates this "Untitled Scenario" thing. Ah! But this time it profiled both pages! The build also shows up as green: the build "passed".
This is a critical thing about builds. It's not simply that a build is an automated way to create a profile for a few pages. That would be pretty worthless. The real value is that you can write performance tests that cause a build to pass or fail.
Check it out "1 successful constraint" - which is that "HTTP Requests should be limited to 1 per page". Hey! That's the test that we set up inside .blackfire.yaml!

6 lines  .blackfire.yaml
"tests":
    "HTTP Requests should be limited to 1 per page":
        path: "/.*"
        assertions:
            - "metrics.http.requests.count"
The real beauty of tests is not that the "Assertions" tab will look red when you're looking inside a profile. The real beauty is that you can configure performance constraints that should pass whenever these builds happen. If a build fails - maybe because you introduced some slow code - you can be notified.

Build Log: blackfire-player
But there's even more cool stuff going on. Near the bottom, click to see the "Player output". Woh! It shows us how builds work behind-the-scenes: the Blackfire server uses the blackfire-player!
Look closer: it's running a scenario: visit url(), method 'GET', then visit url() of /api/github-organization. It's a bit hard to read, but this converted our 2 "URLs to test" into a scenario - using the same format as the scenario.bkf file - then passed that to blackfire-player. You can even see it reloading both pages multiple times to get 10 samples. That's one of the options it added in the scenario.
So with just a tiny bit of configuration, Blackfire is now creating a build every 6 hours. Each time, it profiles these 2 pages and, thanks to our one test, if either page makes more than one HTTP request, the build will fail. By setting up a notification, we'll know about it.
The fact that the build system uses blackfire-player makes me wonder: instead of configuring these URLs, could we instead have the build system run our custom scenario file? I mean, it's a lot more powerful: we can visit pages, but also click links and fill out forms. We can also add specific assertions to each page... in addition to our one "global" test about HTTP requests.
The answer to this question is... of course! And it's where the build system really starts to shine. We'll talk about that next.

History & Graphs from Automated Builds
But before we do, I want you to see what the build page looks like once it's had enough time to execute a few automated builds. Let's check out the SymfonyCasts environment. Woh! It's graph time! Because this environment has a history of automated builds, Blackfire creates some super cool graphs: like our cache hit percentage and our cache levels. You can see that my OPcache Interned Strings Buffer cache is full. I really need to tweak some config to increase that.
I can also see how the different URLs are performing over time for wall time, I/O, CPU, Memory & network as well as other stuff. We can click to see more details about any build... and even look at any of its profiles.
Anyways, next: let's make the build system smarter by executing our custom scenario.

27.3.Deploying to SymfonyCloud{Initializing your SymfonyCloud Project; Deploying & Security Checks}

Next, to tell SymfonyCloud that we want a new "server" on their system, run:

symfony project:create
Every "site" in SymfonyCloud is known as a "project" and we only need to run this command once per app. You can ignore the big yellow warning - that's because I have a few other SymfonyCloud projects attached on my account. Let's call the project "Sasquatch Sightings" - that's just a name to help us identify it - and choose the "Development" plan.
The development plan includes a free 7 day trial... which is awesome. You do need to enter your credit card info - that's a way to prevent spammers from creating free trials - but it won't be charged unless you run symfony project:billing:accept later to keep this project permanently.
I already have a credit card on file, so I'll use that one. Once we confirm, this provisions our project in the background... I assume it's waking up thousands of friendly robots who are carefully creating our new space in... the "cloud". Hey! There's one now... dancing!
And... done!

Deploying & Security Checks
Ready for our first deploy? Just type:

symfony app:prepare:deploy --branch=master --confirm --this-is-not-a-real-command
Kidding! Just run:

symfony deploy
And... hello error! This is actually great. Really! The deploy command automatically checks your composer.lock file to see if you're using any dependencies with known security vulnerabilities. Some of my Symfony packages do have vulnerabilities... and if this were a real app, I would upgrade those to fix that problem. But... because this is a tutorial... I'm going to ignore this.

Our First Deploy
Run the command again with a --bypass-checks flag:

symfony deploy --bypass-checks
We still see the big message... but it's deploying! This takes care of many things automatically, like running composer install and executing database migrations. This first deploy will be slow - especially to download all the Composer dependencies. I'll fast-forward. It also handles setting up Webpack Encore... and even creates a shiny new SSL certificate. Those are busy robots!
And... done! It dumped out a funny-looking URL. Copy that. In a real project, you will attach your real domain to SymfonyCloud. But this "fake" domain will work beautifully for us.
Spin back over and pop that URL into your browser to see... a beautiful 500 error! Wah, wah. Actually, we're super close to this all working. Next, let's use a special command to debug this error, add a database to SymfonyCloud - yep, that's the piece we're missing - and load some dummy data over a "tunnel". Lots of good, nerdiness!

doom2-pwad-eviternity: Imported version 1.0

Eviternity is a megawad comprised of six 5-map
episodes (called Chapters) plus two secret maps.
This project exclusively uses OTEX, a brand new
high quality texture pack by ukiro.

Eviternity's six chapters explore a series of
unique and varied themes, each featuring classic
gameplay with an interest in making each map hold
its own unique identity and personality. The
themes are "Medieval", "Techbase", "Icy Castles",
"Industrial / Brutalism", "Hell / Gore / Alien" and
"Heaven".

This project was created as a birthday gift to
Doom, which is celebrating its 25th birthday the day
this was first released ("RC1", Released on December
10th, 2018. The texture pack used in this project,
OTEX, was also released on the same day - so please
do not use Eviternity as a base for your wads & mods.
While mostly being a "Dragonfly project", with 24
maps being made or heavily worked on by myself, I
present to you a mighty lineup of well-known guest
mappers who have crafted beautiful and fun levels.
