[0.10.4] Remove several HTTPClient options.

Hello there. I know that message might seem kinda cliche for everyone reading it,
but I honestly feel like I need to tell what this is all about.
When I was creating gd.py, I did not intend to do anything harmful to the game or its servers.
Just like that commit (85de5978e99f463a2f8a6ffcab8ebbfcc9265edc),
I did not think about possible consequences of my actions.
I have added several things just to basically trick the servers.
Eventually, it turned out to bypass the security and cause many problems.
gd.py was used to raid servers in a way that they just could not understand what is going on.
I want to apologize for creating such API that allowed many people to easily raid different levels/users.
I should have considered all the effects that my library can cause and what it can be actually used for.

sys: Horrible hack for compat_sysinfo userspace confusion

 * The size of various entries in the sysinfo struct are 32-bit
   or 64-bit, depending on architecture. On Android, the entire
   media stack is running in 32-bit mode. It's been discovered
   that various proprietary pieces of this stack are using
   these values without considering the mem_unit flag. And
   I'm not surprised, they never would have seen anything other
   than 1 until we started getting devices with >4gb of RAM.

   This original code is totally fine. The problem is how the
   values get scaled. By default, it's going straight for
   PAGE_SIZE as the mem_unit. For a device with 6GB of RAM,
   we go from totalmem=6014545920 down to totalmem=1468395.
   If a calculation compares this with raw bytes (say 512MB)
   in order to change some behavior for a low-ram system, we
   are screwed.

   This is actually happening in the OnePlus camera driver. It's
   a Qualcomm-inherited bug, and easily fixable. Unfortunately
   we're not quite ready to stop using the prebuilt HAL. The
   result is that ZSL performs badly, ZSL-HDR is disabled,
   continuous shot is hacky, and various other de-featuring
   happens thanks to this. I suspect similar bugs are lurking
   elsewhere.

   To bandaid the shit out this problem, we'll shift in a loop
   with mem_unit monotonically increasing until the upper 32-bits
   are clear. On our 6GB system, this gives us something
   more sane where memunit=2 and totalmem=3007272960 and thus
   passes the 1GB / 512MB bytes comparisons.

Create IT’S MAGIC!

Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

Input:

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

Output:

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

 

Constraints:

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109

SAMPLE INPUT 
5
14 7 8 2 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
1
Explanation
Both 14 and 7 are valid answers, but since 7 is the smallest, the required array index is 1.

"8:10am. Got up 10m ago. It is time to chill.

9:05am. Done. Let me do some work. Today come the JS DOM tutorials. Let me go through the first one.

Damn I sure feel like slacking here.

10am. https://youtu.be/0ik6X4DJKCc?t=1940

Ok, this part is new to me. How does this work? ...Ah, he wraps it in quotes a moment later. Nevermind.

10:15am. The stuff here is super simple. Maybe I should have skipped this, but since I did say I am going to do it I might as well do it. Let me go through the 3 left and then I'll take a proper break. Hopefully I can hold myself from falling asleep.

10:20am. https://youtu.be/mPd2aJXCZ2g?t=382

What is going on here?

11am. Done with 2. Had to take break. Let me move onto 3. This is so boring, but I have to persevere. After I am done with this DOM stuff, I am going to move on to the framework vids. After I cross that mountain, I can finally move onto the backend.

11:20am. Rather than watching the video, I am thinking about Spiral.

Because that `From: NearTo:` idea, I've been thinking of how to fit it all together.

I am going to do one thing - I am going to bring back objects. This time they will be simpler than before - I'll simply use them for modules. One difference from records is that it will be possible to apply keyword args to them directly `Range .From: a NearTo: b`. Also unlike records which use immutable maps, I will implement then using dictionaries. This will make indexing into them faster at compile time.

11:25am. This is really great. This is how things should be done.

11:30am. Ever since I had that idea about big keyword arg uses, I've been thinking on and off on how to implement this and it is finally coming together.

12pm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i37KVt_IcXw

I know I said I would do 4, and I certainly had the time for it, but let me stop here. I'll leave the last for after the break. I am going to fall asleep here at this rate.

12:55pm. Let me finish the Toji ep and then I will do the chores. After that comes the last video, and one of the framework courses. Also, it seems I forgot to commit. Let me do it here."

31.1.Automatic Performance Checks: Builds{Hello Builds; Build "URLs to Test"; Build Log: blackfire-player}

Head back to https://blackfire.io, click "Environments" and click into our "Sasquatch Sightings Production" environment.
Interesting. By default, it takes us not to the profiles tab... but to a tab called "Builds". And, look on the right: "Periodic Builds": "Builds are started every 6 hours"... which we could change to a different interval.
Further below, there are a bunch of "notification channels" where you can tell Blackfire that you want to be notified - like via Slack - of the results of this "build" thingy.

Hello Builds
Ok, what the heck is a build anyways? To find out, let's trigger one manually, then stand back and see what happens. Click "Start a Build". The form pre-fills the URL to our site... cool... and we can apparently give it a title if we want. Let's... just start the build.
This takes us to a new page where.... interesting: it's running an "Untitled Scenario"... then it looks like it went to the homepage... and created a profile?
Let's... back up: there are a lot of interesting things going on. And I love interesting things!
First, we've seen this word "scenario" before! Earlier, we used the blackfire-player: a command-line tool that's made by the Blackfire people... but can be used totally outside of the profiling tool. We created a scenario.bkf file where we defined a scenario and used the special blackfire-player language to tell it to go to the homepage, assert a few things, then click on the "Log In" link and check something else:

 20 lines  scenario.bkf
name "Various scenarios for the site"
# override with --endpoint option
endpoint "https://localhost:8000"
scenario
    name "Basic Visit"
    visit url("/")
        name "Homepage"
        expect status_code() == 200
        expect css("tbody.js-sightings-list tr").count() > 10
        # won't work until we're using Blackfire environment
        assert metrics.sql.queries.count < 30
    click link("Log In")
        name "Login page"
        expect status_code() == 200
At that time, this was a nice way to "crawl" a site and test some things on it. The "build" used the same "scenario" word. That's not an accident. More on that soon.

Build "URLs to Test"
The second important thing is that this profiled the homepage because, when we created our environment, we configured one "URL to test": the homepage. That's what the build is doing: "testing" - meaning profiling - that page.
Let's add a second URL. One other page we've been working on a lot is /api/github-organization: this JSON endpoint. Copy that URL and add it as a second "URL to test". Click save... then manually create a second build.
Like before, it creates this "Untitled Scenario" thing. Ah! But this time it profiled both pages! The build also shows up as green: the build "passed".
This is a critical thing about builds. It's not simply that a build is an automated way to create a profile for a few pages. That would be pretty worthless. The real value is that you can write performance tests that cause a build to pass or fail.
Check it out "1 successful constraint" - which is that "HTTP Requests should be limited to 1 per page". Hey! That's the test that we set up inside .blackfire.yaml!

6 lines  .blackfire.yaml
"tests":
    "HTTP Requests should be limited to 1 per page":
        path: "/.*"
        assertions:
            - "metrics.http.requests.count"
The real beauty of tests is not that the "Assertions" tab will look red when you're looking inside a profile. The real beauty is that you can configure performance constraints that should pass whenever these builds happen. If a build fails - maybe because you introduced some slow code - you can be notified.

Build Log: blackfire-player
But there's even more cool stuff going on. Near the bottom, click to see the "Player output". Woh! It shows us how builds work behind-the-scenes: the Blackfire server uses the blackfire-player!
Look closer: it's running a scenario: visit url(), method 'GET', then visit url() of /api/github-organization. It's a bit hard to read, but this converted our 2 "URLs to test" into a scenario - using the same format as the scenario.bkf file - then passed that to blackfire-player. You can even see it reloading both pages multiple times to get 10 samples. That's one of the options it added in the scenario.
So with just a tiny bit of configuration, Blackfire is now creating a build every 6 hours. Each time, it profiles these 2 pages and, thanks to our one test, if either page makes more than one HTTP request, the build will fail. By setting up a notification, we'll know about it.
The fact that the build system uses blackfire-player makes me wonder: instead of configuring these URLs, could we instead have the build system run our custom scenario file? I mean, it's a lot more powerful: we can visit pages, but also click links and fill out forms. We can also add specific assertions to each page... in addition to our one "global" test about HTTP requests.
The answer to this question is... of course! And it's where the build system really starts to shine. We'll talk about that next.

History & Graphs from Automated Builds
But before we do, I want you to see what the build page looks like once it's had enough time to execute a few automated builds. Let's check out the SymfonyCasts environment. Woh! It's graph time! Because this environment has a history of automated builds, Blackfire creates some super cool graphs: like our cache hit percentage and our cache levels. You can see that my OPcache Interned Strings Buffer cache is full. I really need to tweak some config to increase that.
I can also see how the different URLs are performing over time for wall time, I/O, CPU, Memory & network as well as other stuff. We can click to see more details about any build... and even look at any of its profiles.
Anyways, next: let's make the build system smarter by executing our custom scenario.

28.1.Database Tricks on SymfonyCloud

We just deployed to SymfonyCloud! Well, I mean, we did... but it doesn't... ya know... work yet. Because this is the production 500 error, we can't see the real problem.
No worries! Head back to your terminal. The symfony command has an easy way to check the production logs. It is...

symfony logs

This prints a list of all the logs. The app/ directory is where our application is deployed to - so the first item is our project's var/log/prod.log file. You can also check out the raw access log... or everything. Hit 0 to "tail" the prod.log file. And... there it is:

An exception has occurred... Connection refused.

Adding a Database to SymfonyCloud
I recognize this: it's a database error.... which... hmm... makes sense: we haven't told SymfonyCloud that we need a database! Let's go do that!
Google for "SymfonyCloud MySQL" to find... oh! A page that talks about exactly that. Ok, we need to add a little bit of config to 2 files. The first is .symfony/services.yaml. This is where you tell SymfonyCloud about all the services you need - like a database service, ElasticSearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.
Copy the config for .symfony/services.yaml... then open that file and paste.
The database is actually MariaDB, which is why the version here is 10.2: MariaDB version 10.2.
Notice that we've used the key mydatabase. That can be anything you want: we'll reference this string from the other config file that we need to change: .symfony.cloud.yaml.
Inside that file, we need a relationships key: this is what binds the web container to that database service. Let's see... we don't have a relationships key yet, so let's add it: relationships and, below, add our first relationship with a special string: database set to mydatabase:mysql.
This syntax... is a little funny. The mydatabase part is referring to whatever key we used in services.yaml - and then we say :mysql... because that service is a mysql type.
The really important thing is that we called this relationship database. Thanks to that SymfonyCloud will expose an environment variable called DATABASE_URL which contains the full MySQL connection string: username, host, database name and all:

 29 lines  .env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:3306/blackfire
It's literally DATABASE_URL and not PIZZA_URL because we called the relationship database instead of pizza... which would have been less descriptive, but more delicious.
This is important because DATABASE_URL happens to be the environment variable that our app will use to connect to the database. In other words, our app will instantly have database config.

Back at the terminal, hit Ctrl+C to exit from logging. Let's add the two changes and commit them:

git add .
git commit -m "adding SfCloud database"
Now, deploy!

symfony deploy
Oh, duh - run with the --bypass-checks flag:

symfony deploy --bypass-checks
The deploy will still take some time - it has a lot of work to do - but it'll be faster than before. When it finishes... it dumps the same URL - that won't change. But to be even lazier than last time, let's tell the command to open this URL in my browser... for me:

symfony open:remote
Tunneling to the Database
And... we have a deployed site! Woo! The database is empty... but if this were a real app, it would start to be populated by real users entering their real Bigfoot sightings... cause Bigfoot is... totally real.
But... to make this a bit more interesting for us, let's load the fixture data one time on production.

This is a bit tricky because the fixture system - which comes from DoctrineFixturesBundle - is a Composer "dev" dependency... which means that it's not even installed on production. That's good for performance. If it were installed, we could run:

symfony ssh
To SSH into our container, and then execute the command to load the fixtures. But... that won't work.

No problem! We can do something cooler. Exit out of SSH, and run:

symfony tunnel:open
I love this feature. Normally, the remote database isn't accessible by anything other than our container: you can't connect to it from anywhere else on the Internet. It's totally firewalled. But suddenly, we can connect to the production database locally on port 30000. We can use that to run the fixtures command locally - but send the data up to that database. Do it by running:

DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:30000/main php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
Ok, let's break this down. First, there is actually a much easier way to do all of this... but I'll save that for some future SymfonyCloud tutorial. Basically, we're running the doctrine:fixtures:load command but sending it a different DATABASE_URL: one that points at our production database. When you open a tunnel, you can access the database with root user, no password - and the database is called main.
The only problem is that this command... takes forever to run. I'm not sure exactly why - but it is doing all of this over a network. Go grab some coffee and come back in a few minutes.
When it finishes... yes! Go refresh the page! Ha! We have a production site with at least enough data to make profiling interesting.
Next, let's do that! Let's configure Blackfire on production! That's easy right? Just repeat the Blackfire install process on a different server... right? Yep! Wait, no! Yes! Bah! To explain, we need to talk about a wonderful concept in Blackfire called "environments".

30.1.Production Profile: Cache Stats & More Recommendations{Profiles Belong to the Environment; Caching Information; Quality & Security Recommendations}

We just profiled our first page on production, which is using the Blackfire Server Id and Token for the environment we created.

Profiles Belong to the Environment
Go to https://blackfire.io, click "Environments", open our new environment... and click the "Profiles" tab. Yep! Whenever anyone creates a profile using this environment's credentials, it will now show up here: the profile belongs to this environment. We haven't invited any other users to this environment yet, but if we did, they would immediately be able to access this area and trigger new profiles with their browser extension.
If you go to back to https://blackfire.io to see your dashboard, the new profile also shows up here. But that's purely for convenience. The profile truly belongs to the environment. You can even see that right here. But Blackfire places all profiles that I create on this page... to make life nicer.
Click the profile to jump into it. Of course... this looks exactly like any profile we created on our local machine. But it does have a few differences.

Caching Information
Hover over the profile name to find... "Cache Information". We talked about this earlier: it shows stats about various different caches on your server and how much space each has available. Now that we're profiling on production, this data is super valuable!
For example, if your OPcache filled up, your site would start to slow down considerably... but it might not be very obvious when that happens. It's not like there are alarms that go off once PHP runs out of OPcache space. But thanks to this, you can easily see how things really look, right now, on production. If any of these are full or nearly full, you can read documentation to see which setting you need to tweak to make that cache bigger.

Quality & Security Recommendations
The other thing I want to show you is under "Recommendations" on the left. There are 3 types of recommendations... and we have one of each: the first is a security recommendation, the second is a quality recommendation and the third a performance recommendation. Only the performance recommendations come standard: the other two require an "Add on"... which I didn't have until I started using my organization's plan.
As always, to get a lot more info about a problem and how to fix it, you can click the question mark icon.

Converting Recommendations into Assertions
One of my favorite things about recommendations is that you can easily convert any of these into an assertion. If you click on assertions, you'll remember that we created one "test" that said that every page should have - at maximum - one HTTP request.
We configured that inside of our .blackfire.yaml file: we added tests, configured this test to apply to every URL, and leveraged the metrics system to write an expression.
Back on the recommendations, click to see more info on one of these... then scroll down. Every recommendation contains code that you can copy into your .blackfire.yaml file to convert that recommendation into a test... or "assertion".
That might not seem important right now... because so far, it looks like doing that would simply "move" this from a "warning" under "Recommendations" to a "failure" under "Assertions"... which is cool... but just a visual difference.
But! In a few minutes, we'll discover that these assertions are much more important than they seem. To see why, we need to talk about the key feature and superpower of environments: builds.

29.1.Blackfire Environments{Hello: Environments; Understanding Organizations; Environment vs Personal Server Credentials; Configuring Blackfire on SymfonyCloud}

Now that our site is deployed - woo! - how can we get Blackfire working on it? Well... we already know the answer. If you find the Blackfire Install page... it makes it easy: I want to install on "a server"... and let's pretend it uses Ubuntu.
Getting Blackfire installed on your production machine is as easy as running the commands below to install the Blackfire PHP extension - the Probe, install the Agent and configure the agent with our server id and token. Easy peasy!

Hello: Environments
But.... some Blackfire account levels - offer a kick-butt feature called environments. If you have access to Blackfire environments - or if you're able to get a "plan" that offers environments, I highly recommend them.

 Tip

Blackfire environments require a Premium plan or higher.

An environment is basically an isolated Blackfire account. When you have an environment, you send your profiles to that environment. The first advantage is that you can invite multiple people to an environment, which means that anyone can profile your production site and see other profiles made by people on your team. It also has other superpowers - ahem, builds - that really make it shine.

Understanding Organizations
So let's create an environment! Go back to https://blackfire.io and click on the "Environments" tab. Actually, click on the "Organizations" tab... that's where this all starts. Blackfire organizations are a bit like GitHub organizations. With GitHub, you can subscribe to a "plan" directly on your personal account or you can create an organization, have it subscribe & pay for a plan, and then invite individual users to the organization. Blackfire organizations work exactly like that. And if you want to use environments, you need to create an organization and subscribe to a Blackfire plan through that organization.
This did confuse me a bit at first. Basically, unless you just want the lowest Blackfire paid plan, you should probably always create an organization and subscribe to Blackfire through it. It just has a few more features than subscribing with your personal account.

Creating an Environment
Anyways, I've already got an organization set up and subscribed to a plan. Once you have an organization, you can click into it to create a new environment. I already have one for SymfonyCasts.com production. Click to create a new one. Let's call it: "Sasquatch Sightings Production".
For the "Environment Endpoint", it wants the URL to the site. Again, if this were a real project, I would attach a real domain... but copy the weird domain name, and paste. Select your timezone, sip some coffee, and... "Create environment" !
On the second step, it asks us to provide URLs to test... and it starts with just one: the homepage. We're going to talk more about this soon, so just leave it. I'll also uncheck the build notifications - more on those later.

Environment vs Personal Server Credentials
Hit "Save settings" and... we're done! It rewards us with a shiny new "Server Id" and "Server Token".
This is super important. No matter how you install Blackfire on a server, you eventually need to configure the "Server id" and "Server Token". This is basically a username & password that tells Blackfire which account a profile should be sent to.
When you register with Blackfire, it immediately created a "Server Id" and "Server Token" connected with your personal account. We used that when we installed Blackfire on our local machine. But now that we have an environment, it has its own Server Id and token. The drop-down on the Install page is allowing us to choose which credentials we want to see on this page.
Locally, we should still use our personal credentials: it keeps things cleaner. But on production, we should use the new environment's Server Id and Token. The install page gives us all the commands we need using those credentials.
Oh, and by the way: if you have a "free" personal account... but are attached to an organization with a paid plan, any profiles you create with your personal Server Id and Token will inherit the features from that organization's plan. That lets us use our personal credentials locally and still get all the Blackfire features we're paying for. One exception to that rule, unfortunately, is "Add-Ons".

Configuring Blackfire on SymfonyCloud
Ok, let's get our production machine set up. I'll select "Symfony Cloud" as my host... which takes me to a dedicated page on this topic.
Let's see... step one is, instead of installing Blackfire with something like apt-get, we'll add a line to .symfony.cloud.yaml. I already have an extensions key... so just add blackfire.
Boom! Blackfire is installed. Add this file to Git... and commit it:

git add .
git commit -m "adding blackfire extension"
The other step is to configure Blackfire. Once again, it has a drop-down to select between my personal credentials and credentials for an enivornment. Select our "Sasquatch production" environment. Cool! This gives us a command to set two SymfonyCloud variables. Copy that, move over, and paste:

symfony var:set BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID=XXXXXX BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN=XXXXXX
Ok... we're good! To make both changes take effect, deploy!

symfony deploy --bypass-checks
I'll fast-forward. Once this finishes... move over and refresh. Ok... everything still works. Now, moment of truth: open the Blackfire browser extension and create a new profile. It's working! I'll call it: [Recording] First profile in production.
Next, let's... look at this profile! It will contain a few new things and some data that is much more relevant now that we're on production.

32.1.Builds with Custom Scenarios{Scenarios in .blackfire.yaml; Building the Custom Scenario; Per Page Assertions/Tests}

A few chapters ago, we created this scenario.bkf file.
It's written in a special blackfire-player language where we write one or more "scenarios" that, sort of, "crawl" a web page, asserting things, clicking on links and even submitting forms. This a simple scenario: the tool can do a lot more.
On the surface, apart from its name, this has nothing to do with the Blackfire profiler system: blackfire-player is just a tool that can read these scenarios and do what they say. At your terminal, run this file:

blackfire-player run scenario.bkf --ssl-no-verify
That last flag avoids an SSL problem with our local web server. When we hit enter... it goes to the homepage, clicks the "Log In" link and... it passes.

Scenarios in .blackfire.yaml
This is cool... but we can do something way more interesting. Copy the entire scenario from this file, close it, and open .blackfire.yaml. Add a new key called scenarios set to a |
That's a YAML way of saying that we will use multiple lines to set this.
Below, indent, then say #! blackfire-player.
That tells Blackfire that we're about to use the blackfire-player syntax... which is the only format supported here... but it's needed anyways. Below, paste the scenario. Make sure it's indented 4 spaces
The cool thing is that we can still execute the scenario locally: just replace scenario.bkf with .blackfire.yaml. The player is smart enough to know that it can look under the scenarios key for our scenarios.

blackfire-player run .blackfire.yaml --ssl-no-verify
But if you run this... error!

  Unable to crawl a non-absolute URI /. Did you forget to set an endpoint?

Duh! Our scenario.bkf file had an endpoint config:

 20 lines  scenario.bkf
# override with --endpoint option
endpoint "https://localhost:8000"
You can copy this into your .blackfire.yaml file. Or you can define the endpoint by adding --endpoint=https://localhost:8000:

blackfire-player run .blackfire.yaml --ssl-no-verify --endpoint=https://localhost:8000
Now... it works!

Building the Custom Scenario
So... why did we move the scenario into this file? To find out, add this change to git... and commit it.

git add .
git commit -m "moving scenarios into blackfire config file"
Then deploy:

symfony deploy --bypass-checks
Once that finishes... let's go see what changed. First, if we simply went to our site and manually created a profile - like for the homepage - the new scenarios config would have absolutely no effect. Scenarios don't do anything to an individual profile. Instead, scenarios affect builds.
Let's start a new one: I'll give this one a title: "With custom scenarios". Go!
Awesome! Now, instead of that "Untitled Scenario" that tested the two URLs we configured, it's using our "Basic visit" scenario! It goes to the homepage, then clicks "Log In" to go to that page.
Yep, as soon as we add this scenarios key to .blackfire.yaml, it no longer tests these URLs. In fact, these are now meaningless. Instead, we're now in the driver's seat: we control the scenario or scenarios that a build will execute.

Per Page Assertions/Tests
Even better, we have a lot more control now over the assertions - or "tests"... Blackfire uses both words - that make a build pass or fail.
For example, the "HTTP requests should be limited to one per page" will be run against all pages in the scenarios - that's 2 pages right now. But the homepage also has its own assert: that the SQL queries on this page should be less than 30. If you look back at the build... we can see that assertion! We can even click into the profile, click on "Assertions", and see both there.
So not only do we have a lot of control over which pages we want to test - even including filling out forms - but we can also do custom assertions on a page-by-page basis in addition to having global tests. I love that.

27.3.Deploying to SymfonyCloud{Initializing your SymfonyCloud Project; Deploying & Security Checks}

Next, to tell SymfonyCloud that we want a new "server" on their system, run:

symfony project:create
Every "site" in SymfonyCloud is known as a "project" and we only need to run this command once per app. You can ignore the big yellow warning - that's because I have a few other SymfonyCloud projects attached on my account. Let's call the project "Sasquatch Sightings" - that's just a name to help us identify it - and choose the "Development" plan.
The development plan includes a free 7 day trial... which is awesome. You do need to enter your credit card info - that's a way to prevent spammers from creating free trials - but it won't be charged unless you run symfony project:billing:accept later to keep this project permanently.
I already have a credit card on file, so I'll use that one. Once we confirm, this provisions our project in the background... I assume it's waking up thousands of friendly robots who are carefully creating our new space in... the "cloud". Hey! There's one now... dancing!
And... done!

Deploying & Security Checks
Ready for our first deploy? Just type:

symfony app:prepare:deploy --branch=master --confirm --this-is-not-a-real-command
Kidding! Just run:

symfony deploy
And... hello error! This is actually great. Really! The deploy command automatically checks your composer.lock file to see if you're using any dependencies with known security vulnerabilities. Some of my Symfony packages do have vulnerabilities... and if this were a real app, I would upgrade those to fix that problem. But... because this is a tutorial... I'm going to ignore this.

Our First Deploy
Run the command again with a --bypass-checks flag:

symfony deploy --bypass-checks
We still see the big message... but it's deploying! This takes care of many things automatically, like running composer install and executing database migrations. This first deploy will be slow - especially to download all the Composer dependencies. I'll fast-forward. It also handles setting up Webpack Encore... and even creates a shiny new SSL certificate. Those are busy robots!
And... done! It dumped out a funny-looking URL. Copy that. In a real project, you will attach your real domain to SymfonyCloud. But this "fake" domain will work beautifully for us.
Spin back over and pop that URL into your browser to see... a beautiful 500 error! Wah, wah. Actually, we're super close to this all working. Next, let's use a special command to debug this error, add a database to SymfonyCloud - yep, that's the piece we're missing - and load some dummy data over a "tunnel". Lots of good, nerdiness!

33.1.Per-Page Time Metrics & Custom Metrics{Cautiously Adding Time-Based Assertions; Custom Metrics; Checking the Time-Based Metric}

We know that the scenario will be executed against our production server only. If we profiled a local page, this stuff has no effect. That means that the results of these profiles should have less variability. Not no variability: if your production server is under heavy traffic, the profiles might be slower than normal. But, it will have less variability than trying to compare a profile that you created on your local machine with a profile created on production: those are totally different machines and setups.

 Tip

I also recommend adding samples 10 to each scenario. This will then use 10 samples (like normal Blackfire profiles) and further reduce variability:

    visit url("/")
        name "Homepage"
        samples 10
        ...

Cautiously Adding Time-Based Assertions
This means that you can... maybe add some time-based assertions... as long as you're conservative. For example, on the homepage, let's assert that main.wall_time < 100ms.
By the way, most metrics start with metrics. and you can look on the timeline to see what's available. A few metrics - like wall time and peak memory - start with main..
Anyways, as you can see inside Blackfire, our homepage on production normally has a wall time of about 50ms... so 100ms is fairly conservative. But time-based metrics are still fragile. Doing this will likely result in some random failures from time-to-time.

Let's commit this:

git status
git add .
git commit -m "adding homepage time assertions"
And deploy:

symfony deploy --bypass-checks

Custom Metrics
While that's deploying, I want to show you a super powerful feature that we won't have time to experiment with: custom metrics. Google for "Blackfire metrics". In addition to the timeline, this page also lists all of the metrics that are available.
But you can also create your own metrics inside .blackfire.yaml. In addition to tests and scenarios, we can have a metrics key. For example, this creates a custom metric called "Markdown to HTML". The real magic is the matching_calls config: any time the toHtml method of this made-up Markdown class is called, its data will be grouped into the markdown_to_html metric.
That's powerful because you can immediately use that metric in your tests. For example, you could assert that this metric is called exactly zero times - as a way to make sure that some caching system is avoiding the need for this to ever happen on production. Or, you could check the memory usage... or other dimension.
You can use some pretty serious logic to create these metrics: making it match only a specific caller for a function, OR logic, regex matching and ways to match methods, calls from classes that implement an interface and many other things. You can even create separate metrics for the same method based on which arguments are passed to them. They went a little nuts.

Checking the Time-Based Metric
Anyways, let's check on the deploy. Done! Go back - I'll close this tab - and let's create a new build. Call it "With homepage wall time assert". Start build!
And... it passes! This time we can see an extra constraint on the homepage: wall time needs to be less than 100ms. If it's greater than 100ms and you have notifications configured, you'll know immediately.
Next: now that we have this idea of builds being created every 6 hours, we can do some cool stuff, like comparing a build to the build that happened before it. Heck we can even write assertions about this! Want a build to fail if a page is 30% slower than the build before it? We can do that.

34.1.Testing a Build Compared to the Last Build{Adding a Comparison Test with percent(); Comparison Tests: Not for Manual Builds; Automatic Build on Deploy; Seeing the Compared Builds}

A long time ago in this tutorial, we talked about Blackfire's truly awesome "comparison" feature. If you profile a page, make a change, then profile it again, you can compare those two profiles to see exactly how that change impacted performance.
When you use the build system, you can do the exact same thing... and you can even write "tests" that compare a build to the previous build. For example, you could say:

 Yo! If the wall time on the homepage is suddenly 30% slower than the previous build, I want this build to fail.

Adding a Comparison Test with percent()
How can we do that? It's dead simple. Add a new global metric - how about "Pages are not suddenly much slower" - and set this to run on every page: path: /.*. For the assertion, we can use a special function called percent: percent(main.wall_time) < 30%.
That's it! There's also a function called diff(). If you said diff(metrics.sql.queries.count) < 2 it means that the difference between the number of SQL queries on the new profile minus the old profile should be less than 2.

Let's see what this looks like! Find your terminal and commit these changes:

git status
git add .
git commit -m "adding global wall time diff assert"
Now... deploy!

symfony deploy --bypass-checks

Comparison Tests: Not for Manual Builds
But... bad news. If we waited for that to finish deploying... and then triggered a new custom build... that test would not run. In fact, I want you to see that. Wait for the deploy to finish - okay, good - then move back over and start a build.
This does what we expect: it executes our scenario and creates 2 profiles. Look at the 3 successful constraints for the homepage: we see the other global test about "HTTP requests should be limited"... but we don't see the new one. What gives?
So... when you create a build, you can specify a "previous" build that it should be compared to by using an internal "build id". Our project is too new to see it, but this happens automatically with "periodic" builds: our comparison assertion will execute on periodic builds.

 Tip

Triggering builds via a webhook requires an Enterprise plan.

But when we create a manual build... there's no way to specify a "previous" build... which is why the comparison stuff doesn't work. Fortunately, since I don't want to wait 12 hours to see if this is working, there is another way to trigger a build: through a webhook. Basically, if you want to create a build from outside the Blackfire UI, you can do that by making a request to a specific URL. And when you do that, you can optionally specify the "previous build" that this new build should be compared to.

Automatic Build on Deploy
This webhook-triggered-build is especially useful in one specific situation: creating a build each time you deploy. If you did that correctly, your comparison assertion would compare the latest deploy to the previous deploy... which is pretty awesome.
Because we're using SymfonyCloud, this is dead-simple to set up.
Find the Blackfire SymfonyCloud documentation and, down here under "Builds", I'll select our environment. Basically, by running this command, we can tell SymfonyCloud to send a webhook to create a Blackfire build each time we deploy.

Copy it, move over to your terminal and... paste:

  symfony integration:add --type=webhook --url='https://USER:PASS@blackfire.io/api/v2/builds/env/aaaabbee-abcd-abcd-abcd-c49b32bb8f17/symfonycloud'
Hit enter to report all events and enter again to report all states. For the environments - this is asking which SymfonyCloud environments should trigger builds. Answer with just master - I'll explain why soon.
And... done! Let's redeploy our app. Oh, but before we do, refresh our builds page. Ok, we have 5 builds right now. Now run:

symfony redeploy --bypass-checks
This should be pretty quick. Then... go refresh the page. Yes! A new build - number 6 - triggered by SymfonyCloud. And it passes. Awesome! Let's redeploy again:

symfony redeploy --bypass-checks
When that finishes... there's build 7! But to see the comparison stuff in action, I need to do a real deploy so that the next build is tied to a new Git sha. I'll do a meaningless change, commit, then deploy:

git commit -m "triggering deploy" --allow-empty
symfony deploy --bypass-checks

Seeing the Compared Builds
Actually, I could have skipped changing any files and committed with --allow-empty to create an empty commit. When this finishes... no surprise! We have build 8!
On this build, it's super cool: each profile has a "Show Comparison" link to open the "comparison" view of that profile compared to the same profile on the build from the last deploy - which - if you click "latest successful build" - is build 7.
Back on build 8, click the "Show 4 successful constraints" link. There it is! We can see our "Pages are not suddenly much slower" assertion! It's comparing the wall time of this profile to the one from the last build.
Click to open up the profile... and make sure you're on the Assertions tab. I love this: 2 page-specific assertions from the scenario, and 2 global assertions: one using the percent() function.
The "Recommendations" also got a bit better: Blackfire automatically has some built-in recommendations using diff: this recommends that the new profile should have less than 2 additional queries compared to the last build. It looks like it failed... but that's just because the other part of this recommendation - not making more than 10 total queries - failed.
Next: what about running builds on your staging server so you can catch performance issues before going to production? Or what about executing Blackfire builds on each pull request? We can totally do that - with a second environment.

Action: ObjCThemis

iOS build automation is not much easier than Android, but at least iOS
Simulator on macOS supports x86. Thankfully, we are developing a library
and for tests we do not need code signing. Otherwise we'd dealing with
longstanding Apple policy of changing the way code signing works every
18 months.

However, most pain and suffering comes from the build systems popular
for iOS/macOS development. Note that CocoaPods cache. It shaves off
about 4 minutes and 850 MB of crap^W trunk reposistory that CocoaPods
pulls. It still takes about three minutes to download and unpack but
that's better than nothing. Though, we have to do it for every build.
Maybe some day we'll invent a shared cache, but until then let's just
ride upon Microsoft's generosity of providing free macOS runners.
(Otherwise we would be paying $2.08 per build.)

SSS Rework FOMOD GUI

Depends on 190-de-wx-pt1, rewrites most of the GUI to use the wrappers
instead. Drops a whole bunch of wx usages, which is nice. RadioButton
needs wrapping, see all the ugly hacks at the bottom of gui_fomod. Also,
the design that uses __dict__ of wx objects to store group objects has
to go, it's fundamentally hacky and very fragile - e.g. imagine if the
wx guys decided to add __slots__ to their objects.

Also contains a bunch of fixes and misc improvements, e.g. user-facing
strings have been made translatable, some bugs that were carried over
from belt have been fixed, and the 'Back' button no longer works on the
first page.

Note the glaring TODOs - this is a straight up port of the original GUI,
but we currently don't have a way to change fonts, which the original
GUI relied on to differentiate its components. I added some
HBoxedLayouts as an alternative, which works fine for the main FOMOD
dialog and may even be an improvement in terms of visual clarity, but
doesn't help at all with the results screen, which is now an unreadable
mess.

Infernio: Updated for wrapped WizardDialog, gave fomods their own stored
size.

Initial version of gui package

Infernio: Had to squash a whole bunch of these together in order to have
the resulting commit not break dev. Introduces a decent first design for
the GUI package featuring layouts, buttons and some text components.

Move layouts to new gui package with fully wrapped classes

The goal is to replace balt with this, fully encapsulating the wx
classes inside.

Add regular buttons to new gui package

The onButClickEventful argument is not yet implemented, but it's only
used in one class (the ColorPicker dialog) so it isn't a massive concern.
It's waiting for better event handling before it can be implemented.

Add ToggleButton and CheckBox to gui, plus more

The main widget API now uses properties instead of getters and setters.

Add text edit fields to gui

Still to do:
    * styles (no border, sunken border)
    * fonts (mostly monospace)
    * event binding (on_lose_focus)
    * a lot of documentation

WIP - Add labels to gui

again, this is not even close to done. barely more than a stash

Cleanup some leftovers from nycz's initial work

Rename abstract classes to fit WB style

We use 'A' instead of 'Abstract'. Also renamed Widget to _AWidget since
instantiating that class doesn't seem useful.

Import directly in balt

Leads to slightly cleaner looking code. Also deleted the remnants of the
StaticText class.

Create gui.DeselectAllButton

Make TextCtrl wrappers more consistent

There is no reason for anything but TextArea to ever have a 'wrap'
parameter. However, the 'modified' property is useful for both TextAreas
and TextFields, so let's move it to the abstract class.

Remnants of balt.StaticText -> gui.Label transition

Rename abstract classes in layouts.py to fit

Carry over wx3 SendSizeEventToParent edit

Was the only actually needed one from the wx3 TEMP commit

layouts: Use SetSizer by default

Fixes dialogs opening way too small and not remembering their size

Add docstrings and typing

Also removed some obsolete labels in patcher_dialog.py.

Rename 'text' and 'name', both forbidden names

Get rid of all 'text' usages in the new GUI code

Forbidden name, see wiki.

Get rid of all 'name' usages in the new GUI code

Forbidden name, see wiki. I almost definitely missed some here.

Rename some setter parameters

To avoid forbidden names etc.

Reintroduce support for some missing features

1. Hiding text input borders

Also turns the INI details name back into a read-only text area again
(works better for small screens).

2. StaticText.Rewrap (now Label.rewrap)

Cut out some parts of this that I don't think are needed, but we'll have
to see.

Drop noAutoResize

When in doubt, leave it out - can't find any breakage from not
supporting this, so dropping it.

Remove HideNativeCaret() usage

Doesn't even seem to work, and why are we even doing this in the first
place??

Split into modules earlier

gui/__init__.py should become a central import point, will significantly
reduce commit noise and simplify the API usage (in exchange for a *very*
painful conflict resolution that I'll now have to slug through...).

Notes for these squashed modules:

Move text-related classes into gui/text_components.py

gui/__init__.py is starting to become pretty large and there's no reason
to limit ourselves to one file anyways.

Also randomly noticed that the copyright dates were still from 2015
here.

Move button classes into gui/buttons.py

Since these are going to expand soon (BitmapButton), now felt like a
good time to do it.

Some minor improvements to layouts.py

Fix 'Modified' field not being editable

Got the incorrect assignment (False instead of True), but I dropped the
entire assignment instead. Don't know why it was there in the first
place.

Add string prefixes to gui

scripts/build/installer/macros.nsh:
Drop empty 'gui' folder in standalone

FFF this into the first wx-begone merge, whenever we're ready for
that ;)

I *FINALLY* figured out how to keep `ssh` from fucking up my terminal window names!!!

this is a bit of a hack, but it is *totally* worth it to stop this stupidly annoying problem

Fixed bug 4996 - Mac: XBoxOne Bluetooth rumble isn't working

rofferom

I have an annoying issue on MacOS about XBoxOne Bluetooth rumble (Vendor: 0x045e, Product: 0x02fd).

When 360controller is installed, rumble is working correctly. However, Bluetooth rumble isn't working at all, with or without 360controller installed (although it is working with Chrome + https://html5gamepad.com).

I looked at the code, and it seems that XBox controllers are managed in MacOS in this file: SDL_hidapi_xbox360.c. The XBoxOne file is disabled for MacOS in SDL_hidjoystick_c.h.

The function HIDAPI_DriverXbox360_Rumble() is called correctly, and hid_write() returns no error.

I have tried a stupid test. I took the rumble packet from 360controller: https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/blob/ec4e88eb2d2535e9b32561c702f42fb22b0a7f99/XBOBTFF/FFDriver.cpp#L620. With the patch I have attached, I manage to have rumble working on Bluetooth (with some stupid vibration level, but it proves it can if the packet is changed).

But it breaks the USB rumble with 360controller. A comment in the function makes an explicit reference to 360controller, I think that's why I have broken this specific usecase.

I don't know what is the correct way to fix this, but it seems that the current implementation has a missing case for Bluetooth support.


Note that I also tested master this morning, and I have another issue:
    if (!device->ffservice) {
        return SDL_Unsupported();
    }

test fails in DARWIN_JoystickRumble(). This test has been done quickly, I'm not totaly confident about its accuracy.
