Ripennnn

- decided not to give an effect with Leftovers/Berry Juice since this isn't true in the games (which tbh seems like a bug since it triggers a message but whatever) but might decide to change that later but like at the same time it doesn't really make sense based on the description so Idk
- tbh I don't feel amazing about this solution since it just feels like hardcoding shit in a bunch of different places which doesn't feel super elegant but like I can't figure out another way to write it right now
- anyways I feel like my test is pretty comprehensive so there's that

Fucking Schiool

Why do I have to do xyz, why do I have to go to bed at 11, why does life suck?

The answer to that, my friend, is 42.

Re-implement unsafe coercions in terms of unsafe equality proofs

(Commit message written by Omer, most of the code is written by Simon
and Richard)

See Note [Implementing unsafeCoerce] for how unsafe equality proofs and
the new unsafeCoerce# are implemented.

New notes added:

- [Checking for levity polymorphism] in CoreLint.hs
- [Implementing unsafeCoerce] in base/Unsafe/Coerce.hs
- [Patching magic definitions] in Desugar.hs
- [Wiring in unsafeCoerce#] in Desugar.hs

Only breaking change in this patch is unsafeCoerce# is not exported from
GHC.Exts, instead of GHC.Prim.

Fixes #17443
Fixes #16893

Test changes
------------

- break006 is marked as broken, see #17833
- The compiler allocates less when building T14683 (an unsafeCoerce#-
  heavy happy-generated code) on 64-platforms. Allocates more on 32-bit
  platforms.
- Rest of the increases are tiny amounts (still enough to pass the
  threshold) in micro-benchmarks. I briefly looked at each one in a
  profiling build: most of the increased allocations seem to be because
  of random changes in the generated code.

Metric Decrease:
    T14683

Metric Increase:
    T12150
    T12234
    T12425
    T13035
    T14683
    T5837
    T6048

"8:35am. I am up. Yesterday was a mess, but there is no doubt about it - the UI difficulties that have plagued me for years are going to be resolved this month. Without a doubt.

The Svelte guy deserves great praise for his accomplishment.

If I weren't obsessed about drawing out the power of the next gen hardware for the sake of AI, and was a webdev instead, I'd like to think that I would have made an UI language much like Svelte.

I mean, what he did might seem simple, but webdev has existed for decades and yet only now this comes out.

Being able to do things in less than 100 lines of code that would have previously taken 1000 is a game changer for me.

Blazor has a similar design, so if I want to stay with .NET, I can just go with it.

8:40am. It is really wonderful, I have two, not just one options that are both decent when it comes to UI creation.

I said that Pharo has good UI support, but not like this. This - this is what I wanted all along.

Before this, the only real choice in my mind was Elm, but having a virtual DOM and diffing on every pass while elegant and effective is only a 2/3rds of a solution at most. It is a solution, but it does not quite capture what UI programming really is. It more like works around the issues.

The Svelte design is without a doubt 100% there. It is perfect.

8:45am. I think I can allow myself to get excited about programming once more. Give me a year and I will have complete mastery of web development.

Without a doubt, I will try ML once again and this time I am not going to end up being glued to the command line.

Before I start chilling, let me say one thing - I am surprised how similar desktop UI development and web development are. I thought there would be more pronounced differences, but I was wrong. Desktop might lack HTML and CSS, but besides that the programming model is identical.

I guess in the end, me looking down on webdev was merely ignorance.

8:50am. Now, let me chill for a bit and I will start. I am actually motivated today, so I won't dawdle too much."

"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12499
On Catastrophic Interference in Atari 2600 Games

This paper is interesting. Let me read the Satanophany chapter and then I'll go for it. After that comes the Blazor talk from yesterday.

9:10am. "The Memento agent is far more sample efficient than training the baseline Rainbow agent longer. The Memento agent achieves the same median performance increase in only 5M frames compared to 200M frames for the longer-training Rainbow agent."

9:15am. Yeah, the fact that a single task in RL might have multiple subtasks which cause catastrophic forgetting is what I considered myself. This is not some big insight. It is just that I do not how to resolve the issue.

Reseting from random weights is interesting, but it is hardly the right way to go. Does the brain really do this? I doubt it.

Though I wonder what the Deepmind/OpenAI guys would think about this paper? If they had integrity they should feel shame over throwing so much hardware at the games without resolving the underlying issues. If they want to be seen as the best, then they should do this rather than waiting for somebody else to do it.

9:35am. Though I had been reading that paper, I still dawdled a bit too much. Let me go through the Blazor talk. Then I'll check out that Svelte post. Then comes the MySQL lecture.

9:40am. https://youtu.be/Khn7sDUSEJM?t=934

This is super cool. Yeah, dedicating myself to thoroughly mastering this for the next few years sounds like what I should be doing. Whatever I do, these kinds of UIs is how I should be expressing myself in programming. More than just using this, I should be diving under the hood to understand the secrets of this.

This is real programming.

9:50am. https://youtu.be/Khn7sDUSEJM?t=1605

Interesting that he is talking about gRPC here for efficient client-server communication.

https://youtu.be/Khn7sDUSEJM?t=3309

Blazor for native UIs? That's the future right there. Or part of it. I did not think they would have gone that far, but they are really going all out here.

10:30am. This was great.

10:35am. I am looking at the HN threads and it seems that there is a way to use F# with Blazor. That should be interesting.

https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/26/whats-behind-the-hype-about-blazor/

10:40am. I guess I'll save the MySQL lecture for later. Let me read some of this and then I'll watch a talk by Rich Harris.

11:15am. https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity

Let me watch the video accompanying this.

11:20am. https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao?t=532

I actually saw this coming yesterday. In the Vue tutorial, or was it maybe the Svelte tutorial itself, Brad did not need to spread into the array and assign to it. He could have added to an existing array and then just triggered the update by reassigning itself. That would have worked as well.

11:40am. https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao?t=1136

I wonder what talk he is talking about here?

11:55am. https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao?t=1825

Transitions are interesting too. I've been wondering how I would animate moving cards in my GUI. Svelte has a solution.

12:10pm. Uf, that was a lot to digest. Let me have that break. I want to see more Blazor, but I'll leave that for later.

What I need to do is get back to the grind. I am going to go through the MySQL video and then the ASP.NET lecture after that.

I am not sure whether I feel like messing with the legacy stuff now that I know about Blazor, but I should spend some time on it even if I won't use it. I want to at least understand some of it.

1:30pm. Did I forget to commit? Yes, I did. At any rate, the next thing on my TODO list are chores. Then a bit chilling. Then the MySQL lecture. I'll install that studio and start following along. If not, I'll just move to the ASP.NET lecture."

[android][home] 🤖 Add DevMenu on Android (#6829)

# Why

Fixes #6521 

# How

- Created unversioned `DevMenuManager` class which mostly just delegates calls to versioned `DevMenuModule` modules specific for SDK version. These modules are responsible for providing initial props, dev menu options and actions to run when these options are selected. The manager creates a new `ReactRootView` that bases on kernel's (home's) React instance manager and starts `HomeMenu` app which is registered as a second entry point in `home` and then, manager adds this root view to the currently used activity (it must implement `ExperienceActivity`). As I needed to know which experience activity is the current one, I've added `sCurrentActivity` static member to that class and just track it using activity's lifecycle methods.
- Backported `DevMenuModule` to all SDK versions included in the client. Including some changes between them - for example hot and fast reloading.
- Added support for back button and Android's menu press (which can be simulated by `adb shell input keyevent 82`).
- Removed some unused code related to `Nux` and replaced it with new onboarding screen (see #6793).
- Created new `ShakeDetector` which works more like on iOS. The one provided by React Native is annoying in most cases as it actually requires two shakes.
- Updated `ReactAndroidCodeTransformer` to turn off showing React Native dev menu in non-standalone apps.
- **To do after merging:** Rebuild versioned expoviews.

# Test Plan

- [x] Test on experience in debug mode
- [x] Test on experience in production mode
- [x] Test on snacks
- [x] Test on older SDKs
- [x] Test on simulators
- [x] Test that onboarding shows up once you open the experience for the first time or you didn't accept it yet (clicked `Got it` button).
- [x] Test that using dev menu still works once we kill home's activity.

Topic: Lyme: Visualizing Disease Spread

Questions:
1.	Can you visualize the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in Colorado Counties for the years 2002 to 2004?
2.	Can you visualize the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation and humidity?

Dataset:
The data has taken from drivenData.org, it was released as a part of their competition DengAI.
Dataset from the competition has only 2 cities Sanjuan and Iquitos, but we have added three more cities Cusco, Tijuana and Rosario with random precipitation, humidity and temperature.
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death. Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics can improve research initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics.

Our data contains Climatic variables such as precipitation, temperature, humidity for each City. And also, we have total cases of Dengue Affected Cases for the Corresponding Year and Week of the Year.

Column Names:
1.	City- Name of the city
2.	Year-Dengue Affected Year
3.	Weekofyear-Week of the Year 
4.	week_start_date-Week start data in the format mm-dd-yy
5.	avg_temp- Average air temperature according to Climate Forecast System Reanalysis                             measurements (0.5x0.5-degree scale).
6.	precip_amt-Total Precipitation amount according to Climate Forecast System Reanalysis                                measurements (0.5x0.5-degree scale).
7.	Humidity_amt-Mean Specific humidity according to Climate Forecast System Reanalysis                                        measurements (0.5x0.5-degree scale).
8.	total_cases- Total cases predicted.
