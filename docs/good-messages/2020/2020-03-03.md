Update MELEE.dec

Welp, I just realized that I made a fucky wucky on one of the combo sequences in the original commit when I added the Player Translated flags, so I have fixed my idiotic error by reverting and fixing it up.

few things: i added a function to profile page that supposedly is used to read data but im kinda stuck there. sign up view i added code so that database adds email and password in the addPerson() function and also I understand how to track a user better throughout all views so that we may not even have to read from the database (ill still try to get that working though dw). i started looking how to upload photos and it involves a diff thing (Firebase Storage) which i added to pod file, you just need to pod install i think (check to make sure). it looks plausible just am bored of reading shit i don't understand well. i will keep you updated and plz call if you don't understand some of these things. It will help me too to understand it better if i have to explain it. enjoy florida! looks like a lot of fun and you guys all look wonderful!

"8:35am. I am up. Yesterday was a mess, but there is no doubt about it - the UI difficulties that have plagued me for years are going to be resolved this month. Without a doubt.

The Svelte guy deserves great praise for his accomplishment.

If I weren't obsessed about drawing out the power of the next gen hardware for the sake of AI, and was a webdev instead, I'd like to think that I would have made an UI language much like Svelte.

I mean, what he did might seem simple, but webdev has existed for decades and yet only now this comes out.

Being able to do things in less than 100 lines of code that would have previously taken 1000 is a game changer for me.

Blazor has a similar design, so if I want to stay with .NET, I can just go with it.

8:40am. It is really wonderful, I have two, not just one options that are both decent when it comes to UI creation.

I said that Pharo has good UI support, but not like this. This - this is what I wanted all along.

Before this, the only real choice in my mind was Elm, but having a virtual DOM and diffing on every pass while elegant and effective is only a 2/3rds of a solution at most. It is a solution, but it does not quite capture what UI programming really is. It more like works around the issues.

The Svelte design is without a doubt 100% there. It is perfect.

8:45am. I think I can allow myself to get excited about programming once more. Give me a year and I will have complete mastery of web development.

Without a doubt, I will try ML once again and this time I am not going to end up being glued to the command line.

Before I start chilling, let me say one thing - I am surprised how similar desktop UI development and web development are. I thought there would be more pronounced differences, but I was wrong. Desktop might lack HTML and CSS, but besides that the programming model is identical.

I guess in the end, me looking down on webdev was merely ignorance.

8:50am. Now, let me chill for a bit and I will start. I am actually motivated today, so I won't dawdle too much."

Optimize ReasonReactRouter url comparison

cc @nikgraf @rickyvetter

As much as possible, we try not to drag in runtime in ReasonReact (and the current RR's `React.re` is runtime-free, apart from a few empty module outputs). This is not just to give a very comfortable and reliable guarantee of "zero-cost perf", but also to ensure there's no semantic mismatch between React.js and ReasonReact. As seen with... well, most codebases, any helper that inserts itself into two layers potentially breaks things, and old versions of RR certainly had bugs regarding discrepancies vs React.js. The relatively new hook-based version can guarantee "zero interop bug", which is something extremely nice to rely on whenever we can.

This is just a tangent though; but yeah, no runtime is great for many reasons. In this particular diff, the generic object comparison was added in 9147410fb0ee296950b8d79e9cd59eb392a7ee50. This isn't great:
- The generic comparison is theoretically wrong because it doesn't properly handle some of JS' corner-cases (imagine someone puts a `Symbol` on an object, etc.): https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/80297bbb138f5e0d69c7fed74c5b6043391b2505/lib/js/caml_obj.js#L305
- The above code, because of its genericity, is also extremely slow, since it introspects into some runtime types, allocates (in a comparison!...), is not tail-recursive (https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/80297bbb138f5e0d69c7fed74c5b6043391b2505/lib/js/caml_obj.js#L385).
- It's even worse because in the router, we just want "not equal". If you check the JS output of the diff, you'll see that it's calling `caml_notequal`, which is literally `!caml_notequal`. So we do a full check for deep _equality_ first, _then_ negate it, instead of bailing early in 95% of the cases.
- This is especially bad because ReasonReact is a base library.

So we hand-roll our own `urlNotEqual` comparison:
- It only needs to handle our `url` record. Super lean, and easily and verifiably 100% correct, unlike the generic version.
- The fastest checks possible, with even better readability because it's not generic. See the new JS output; no runtime introspection, no allocation, tail recursive.
- Even better, bails early by checking the other fields first.
- Removes the need for dragging in `caml_obj` (Instagram, and I'm sure some other high-profile highly constrained use-cases, has some informal "be a good citizen" rule regarding introducing new infra; i.e. "don't take over everything, don't be a burden, etc". The Reason community should definitely follow this mantra more, and more so than other FP communities. Don't forcefully shove Reason where you can cause resentments from unrelated teams).

This restores the Router to be mostly allocation-free (edit: except now I see that a rather bad and allocation-heavy implementation of `useUrl` went in... cc @rickyvetter). We can confidently say "this is the fastest and leanest Router for React, not to mention that it actually fulfills more feature requirements of a router than alternatives thanks to our non-opinionated pattern matching on the URL and letting you do the rest (also keep in mind also that OCaml pattern matching doesn't allocate).

Btw, don't get attached to this particular diff's elegant implementation. Generally speaking, we should prefer array over list. It's just that for our Router, list really is a better representation, for once.

Lastly, this diff is one of the reasons why I'm uneasy with all the `deriving` or other codegen for creating equality comparisons. Once you dumbly generate those, you naturally reach for the slowest possible equal comparison (see all the points above), and since most folks don't look at the generated JS, that comparison's cost is entirely hidden now. That's no way to teach performance and correctness.

===

It's hard to write up what "quality" means for Reason libraries, but I'd like this diff to be an example of it. People naively think "quality" means "elegance" and "less visible code", but that's just "cleanness", like how disorganizingly stuffing your clothes into a corner still makes a clean room but doesn't make it easier to find a clothe back. For Reason, I'd like us to mentally inline all the code, pretend they're all visible to you, _then_ evaluate the quality. This has the consequence that we get more careful about dragging in dependencies, that we don't pretend abstracting into a function means the cost is zero now (refer to my recent Reason conf talk), and that we go beyond the superficial polish into deeper polish.

"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12499
On Catastrophic Interference in Atari 2600 Games

This paper is interesting. Let me read the Satanophany chapter and then I'll go for it. After that comes the Blazor talk from yesterday.

9:10am. "The Memento agent is far more sample efficient than training the baseline Rainbow agent longer. The Memento agent achieves the same median performance increase in only 5M frames compared to 200M frames for the longer-training Rainbow agent."

9:15am. Yeah, the fact that a single task in RL might have multiple subtasks which cause catastrophic forgetting is what I considered myself. This is not some big insight. It is just that I do not how to resolve the issue.

Reseting from random weights is interesting, but it is hardly the right way to go. Does the brain really do this? I doubt it.

Though I wonder what the Deepmind/OpenAI guys would think about this paper? If they had integrity they should feel shame over throwing so much hardware at the games without resolving the underlying issues. If they want to be seen as the best, then they should do this rather than waiting for somebody else to do it.

9:35am. Though I had been reading that paper, I still dawdled a bit too much. Let me go through the Blazor talk. Then I'll check out that Svelte post. Then comes the MySQL lecture.

9:40am. https://youtu.be/Khn7sDUSEJM?t=934

This is super cool. Yeah, dedicating myself to thoroughly mastering this for the next few years sounds like what I should be doing. Whatever I do, these kinds of UIs is how I should be expressing myself in programming. More than just using this, I should be diving under the hood to understand the secrets of this.

This is real programming.

9:50am. https://youtu.be/Khn7sDUSEJM?t=1605

Interesting that he is talking about gRPC here for efficient client-server communication.

https://youtu.be/Khn7sDUSEJM?t=3309

Blazor for native UIs? That's the future right there. Or part of it. I did not think they would have gone that far, but they are really going all out here.

10:30am. This was great.

10:35am. I am looking at the HN threads and it seems that there is a way to use F# with Blazor. That should be interesting.

https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/26/whats-behind-the-hype-about-blazor/

10:40am. I guess I'll save the MySQL lecture for later. Let me read some of this and then I'll watch a talk by Rich Harris.

11:15am. https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity

Let me watch the video accompanying this.

11:20am. https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao?t=532

I actually saw this coming yesterday. In the Vue tutorial, or was it maybe the Svelte tutorial itself, Brad did not need to spread into the array and assign to it. He could have added to an existing array and then just triggered the update by reassigning itself. That would have worked as well.

11:40am. https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao?t=1136

I wonder what talk he is talking about here?

11:55am. https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao?t=1825

Transitions are interesting too. I've been wondering how I would animate moving cards in my GUI. Svelte has a solution.

12:10pm. Uf, that was a lot to digest. Let me have that break. I want to see more Blazor, but I'll leave that for later.

What I need to do is get back to the grind. I am going to go through the MySQL video and then the ASP.NET lecture after that.

I am not sure whether I feel like messing with the legacy stuff now that I know about Blazor, but I should spend some time on it even if I won't use it. I want to at least understand some of it.

1:30pm. Did I forget to commit? Yes, I did. At any rate, the next thing on my TODO list are chores. Then a bit chilling. Then the MySQL lecture. I'll install that studio and start following along. If not, I'll just move to the ASP.NET lecture."

Use zic's new "-b slim" option to generate smaller timezone files.

IANA tzcode release 2019b adds an option that tells zic not to emit
the old 32-bit section of the timezone files, and to skip some other
space-wasting hacks needed for compatibility with old timezone client
libraries.  Since we only expect our own code to use the timezone data
we install, and our code is up-to-date with 2019b, there's no apparent
reason not to generate the smallest possible files.

Unfortunately, while the individual zone files do get significantly
smaller in many cases, they were not that big to begin with; which
means that no real space savings ensues on filesystems that don't
optimize small files.  (For instance, on ext4 with 4K block size,
"du" says the installed timezone tree is the same size as before.)
Still, it seems worth making the change, if only because this is
presumably the wave of the future.  At the very least, we'll save
some cycles while reading a zone file.

But given the marginal value and the fact that this is a new code
path, it doesn't seem worth the risk of back-patching this change
into stable branches.  Hence, unlike most of our timezone-related
changes, apply to HEAD only.

c++: Fix non-constant TARGET_EXPR constexpr handing [PR93998]

We ICE on the following testcase since I've added the SAVE_EXPR-like
constexpr handling where the TARGET_EXPR initializer (and cleanup) is
evaluated only once (because it might have side-effects like new or delete
expressions in it).
The problem is if the TARGET_EXPR (but I guess in theory SAVE_EXPR too)
initializer is *non_constant_p.  We still remember the result, but already
not that it is *non_constant_p.  Normally that wouldn't be a big problem,
if something is *non_constant_p, we only or into it and so the whole
expression will be non-constant too.  Except in the builtins handling,
we try to evaluate the arguments with non_constant_p pointing into a dummy1
bool which we ignore.  This is because some builtins might fold into a
constant even if they don't have a constexpr argument.  Unfortunately if
we evaluate the TARGET_EXPR first in the argument of such a builtin and then
once again, we don't set *non_constant_p.

So, either we don't remember the TARGET_EXPR/SAVE_EXPR result if it wasn't
constant, like the following patch does, or we could remember it, but in
some way that would make it clear that it is non-constant (e.g. by
pushing into the global->values SAVE_EXPR, SAVE_EXPR entry and perhaps
for TARGET_EXPR don't remember it on TARGET_EXPR_SLOT, but the TARGET_EXPR
itself and similarly push TARGET_EXPR, TARGET_EXPR and if we see those
after the lookup, diagnose + set *non_constant_p.  Or we could perhaps
during the builtin argument evaluation push expressions into a different
save_expr vec and undo them afterwards.

2020-03-03  Jakub Jelinek  <jakub@redhat.com>

	PR c++/93998
	* constexpr.c (cxx_eval_constant_expression)
	<case TARGET_EXPR, case SAVE_EXPR>: Don't record anything if
	*non_constant_p is true.

	* g++.dg/ext/pr93998.C: New test.

Big ol' day of debugging.

Holy crap these 2 issues caused a lot of troubles:
- Moving the trails to a pool Object, they stopped rendering after the starting list of preinnitialized pool objects > they now are rendered by the pool Object instead of the Trail Object, in which case it no longer loses track of them
- Collisions again. Somewhere a world or local reference got mixed up so 0,0 of the grid is once again top left instead of centered. AI dont collide properly because I have no fucking idea what Tim did to that class but Im going to be rebuilding it from scratch now that i can focus on AI instead of debugging basic ass shit.

Topic: Lyme: Visualizing Disease Spread

Questions:
1.	Can you visualize the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in Colorado Counties for the years 2002 to 2004?
2.	Can you visualize the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation and humidity?

Dataset:
The data has taken from drivenData.org, it was released as a part of their competition DengAI.
Dataset from the competition has only 2 cities Sanjuan and Iquitos, but we have added three more cities Cusco, Tijuana and Rosario with random precipitation, humidity and temperature.
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death. Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics can improve research initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics.

Our data contains Climatic variables such as precipitation, temperature, humidity for each City. And also, we have total cases of Dengue Affected Cases for the Corresponding Year and Week of the Year.

Column Names:
1.	City- Name of the city
2.	Year-Dengue Affected Year
3.	Weekofyear-Week of the Year 
4.	week_start_date-Week start data in the format mm-dd-yy
5.	avg_temp- Average air temperature according to Climate Forecast System Reanalysis                             measurements (0.5x0.5-degree scale).
6.	precip_amt-Total Precipitation amount according to Climate Forecast System Reanalysis                                measurements (0.5x0.5-degree scale).
