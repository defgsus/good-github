Update issue templates

I graduated the university with a computer science degree and after graduation started working on this field. I tried to like programming, but it was all in vein. It was not really my thing. In addition, it was not easy to make a career in the company where I started working. There are times where you should give passion to my hobby y — blogging and writing on the internet. I was doing it approximately about three years by then.

I was invited to take a marketing position to a large IT company. My duties were blogging and social media. In essence, everything seemed fine for the first several months, but soon I became obsessing with the idea of opening my own media startup. That being sad, I've decided to leave this job.

WEL<COME TO MY TECHNOLOGICAL REALM

Hello World!

I have been here before.. many, many, times..

adding, deleting, editing..scripting away—

Yet, I am delighted

that you have found my not-so-secret nest..

This is the internet after all..

with sublime support and guidance from Code First Girls,

this is where my technological realm begins..

Most recently, having A LOT of time reflecting on past and

future current events -- I've decided to acknowledge a switch

to my sudden self-realisation that I was not happy in my

career in dentistry;

I felt compelled to make changes happen in my life or else I

will never know.

Thoughts stirred and  formed, planting 'motivational seeds'

Exploring the brave new world behind a touch screen

Add dead bodies

Last night (the night of December 4th, 2020), I was laying in bed with
Coral on a Discord voice call and she was thinking about how checkpoints
worked. (Like, an in-lore explanation, not how it works in the actual
game.) Then she suggested at one point, what if there was a mod for
VVVVVV where you left behind a dead body every time you died.

So behold, this is that mod. What happens every time you die is the game
keeps track of where exactly you died, along with your sprite at the
time of death, and shoves it into an array. Then the game simply draws
that array on the screen, using color 1 (which is the color of death).
In the main game, it's drawn above all other non-humanoids, but in
custom levels it's drawn before every other entity.

Supercrewmates (the Intermission 1 companion) also create dead bodies.

Dying as VVVVVV-Man doesn't show a VVVVVV-Man-sized body, but the
playtesting ghosts feature doesn't account for VVVVVV-Man either, so.
Possibly playtesting ghosts and dead bodies should just use the same
entity-drawing function as normal entities do, but that's a bit
complicated. Or at the very least, some code should be refactored and
de-duplicated there to easily enable that without having to copy-paste
code.

Dead bodies are cleared every time you quit to the menu, or exit
playtesting (so, every time scriptclass::hardreset() gets called).

Whenever a dead body is added, there's also a check so the game doesn't
add a duplicate dead body if there's already a dead body that exists
with the same exact position and drawframe.
