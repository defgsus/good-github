Out with the Desperado, in with the.. chunky desperado


Various things

Renames desperado preemptively. Allows for proper docking if codes are given. More work on the shuttle itself. Makes shuttle not consume horrible amounts of fuel.
Desperado no longer requires mercs to devote skillpoints to fly


Some tweaks, begins new merc shuttle 


Cyclopes, maybe. Naming is hard.


Hammerhead is a better name.


Adds breathable asteroid turf for my own sanity


Does it REALLY need two areas


Hydrogen is a bane on mercs everywhere.


Adds flavorful tutorial notes for the shuttle & suit cycler


Hardsuit tutorial note 


Fixes tutorial typos. Removes vestige tenacity - almost functional, but not pretty


Adds kelotane and dexalin bottles. Some mapping.

Makes my life easier.
Abandoned mine, more like abandoned gone


Merc base, new. 


Switches merc base to a funky reactor for testing


The shuttle doesn't work. Trying to make the shuttle work.


Fixes the shuttle.


Uses the correct appearance mirror.


Merc base is never known


Gives vox *some* love. No throwers though.
