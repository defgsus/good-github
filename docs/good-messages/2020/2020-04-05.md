Hey>>>> https://roselyn1.box.com/s/g7f68o1w733z60oyc00od4nc7olhgd4n

I just started my first job. I am so excited about it. The next
major move for me is to get my own apartment and a hot lover to
keep me occupied at nights. I would love to be able to come home
to a nice guy and a big fat cock every single night.

For coronavirus let does this on video calling!

Buffs the circle game, adds an achievement (#50145)

About The Pull Request

Examining someone holding a circled hand from using the *circle emote while next to them can now alert said person, and if you don't act fast, they'll bop you! You'll have a split second to move away before this happens. Losing the circle game to a hulk will result in a very forceful bop.

Bopping someone will award an achievement, "HA, GOTTEM"

Also adds COMSIG_PARENT_EXAMINE to carbon and human's examines, cause they never had that set, and adds TRAIT_HULK to being hulk since I forgot to actually give it its own trait when I added said trait in another PR
Why It's Good For The Game

Enhances pranking. It's honestly amazing to me that this functionality wasn't built in when this was first made.
Changelog

cl Ryll/Shaps
add: The *circle emote now has additional functionality! Go prank your friends!

Fix bugs in get-song.js

This fixes 2 bugs in get-song.js:

1) Adds long-missing try/catch blocks when testing each application.

   Some applications may not be installed, and now with Catalina some
   users may have Music.app and others iTunes.

   During testing, I did notice that Application('com.apple.iTunes')
   actually returns Music.app on Catalina (yay backwards compatibility)
   but I'd rather be safe than sorry, and this fixes the exception for
   Vox, and any other apps I may add later.

2) Supports Apple Music tracks

   This has been a pain in my ass for over a year now, since I started
   my free trial of Apple Music and then just decided to stick with it.

   Essentially, this boils down to the parenthesis after `currentTrack`,
   which change the type of object we're receiving. With the parenthesis
   we get the property, or the track object itself, and without the
   parenthesis we get an "object specifier", or a reference, which
   would always point to the currently playing track.

   There are more details about this here: https://github.com/JXA-Cookbook/JXA-Cookbook/wiki/iTunes#getting-the-current-track-an-example-of-specifier-vs-property-access
