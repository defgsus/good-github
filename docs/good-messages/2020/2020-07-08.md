MFC r361798, r361800: vfs: default disallow read(2) of a directory

This MFC is in accordance with the original MFC plan outlined in the commit
message for r361798, appearing in full (with exception to metadata) below.

To summarize: this MFC only merges back the sysctl with a default disallow
policy, as in head, to ensure we hit any issues quickly but in a fashion
that end users can easily revert. Interested parties can flip the
security.bsd.allow_read_dir sysctl back to 1 to fully honor the previous
behavior of allowing read(2) of any dir, filesystem permitting.

r361798:
vfs: add restrictions to read(2) of a directory [1/2]

Historically, we've allowed read() of a directory and some filesystems will
accommodate (e.g. ufs/ffs, msdosfs). From the history department staffed by
Warner: <<EOF

pdp-7 unix seemed to allow reading directories, but they were weird, special
things there so I'm unsure (my pdp-7 assembler sucks).

1st Edition's sources are lost, mostly. The kernel allows it. The
reconstructed sources from 2nd or 3rd edition read it though.

V6 to V7 changed the filesystem format, and should have been a warning, but
reading directories weren't materially changed.

4.1b BSD introduced readdir because of UFS. UFS broke all directory reading
programs in 1983. ls, du, find, etc all had to be rewritten. readdir() and
friends were introduced here.

SysVr3 picked up readdir() in 1987 for the AT&T fork of Unix. SysVr4 updated
all the directory reading programs in 1988 because different filesystem
types were introduced.

In the 90s, these interfaces became completely ubiquitous as PDP-11s running
V7 faded from view and all the folks that initially started on V7 upgraded
to SysV. Linux never supported this (though I've not done the software
archeology to check) because it has always had a pathological diversity of
filesystems.
EOF

Disallowing read(2) on a directory has the side-effect of masking
application bugs from relying on other implementation's behavior
(e.g. Linux) of rejecting these with EISDIR across the board, but allowing
it has been a vector for at least one stack disclosure bug in the past[0].

By POSIX, this is implementation-defined whether read() handles directories
or not. Popular implementations have chosen to reject them, and this seems
sensible: the data you're reading from a directory is not structured in some
unified way across filesystem implementations like with readdir(2), so it is
impossible for applications to portably rely on this.

With this patch, we will reject most read(2) of a dirfd with EISDIR. Users
that know what they're doing can conscientiously set
bsd.security.allow_read_dir=1 to allow read(2) of directories, as it has
proven useful for debugging or recovery. A future commit will further limit
the sysctl to allow only the system root to read(2) directories, to make it
at least relatively safe to leave on for longer periods of time.

While we're adding logic pertaining to directory vnodes to vn_io_fault, an
additional assertion has also been added to ensure that we're not reaching
vn_io_fault with any write request on a directory vnode. Such request would
be a logical error in the kernel, and must be debugged rather than allowing
it to potentially silently error out.

Commented out shell aliases have been placed in root's chsrc/shrc to promote
awareness that grep may become noisy after this change, depending on your
usage.

A tentative MFC plan has been put together to try and make it as trivial as
possible to identify issues and collect reports; note that this will be
strongly re-evaluated. Tentatively, I will MFC this knob with the default as
it is in HEAD to improve our odds of actually getting reports. The future
priv(9) to further restrict the sysctl WILL NOT BE MERGED BACK, so the knob
will be a faithful reversion on stable/12. We will go into the merge
acknowledging that the sysctl default may be flipped back to restore
historical behavior at *any* point if it's warranted.

Merge #5101

5101: Add expect -- a light-weight alternative to insta r=matklad a=matklad

This PR implements a small snapshot-testing library. Snapshot updating is done by setting an env var, or by using editor feature (which runs  a test with env-var set). 

Here's workflow for updating a failing test:

![expect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/85926956-28afa080-b8a3-11ea-9260-c6d0d8914d0b.gif)

Here's workflow for adding a new test:

![expect-fresh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/85926961-306f4500-b8a3-11ea-9369-f2373e327a3f.gif)

Note that colorized diffs are not implemented in this PR, but should be easy to add (we already use them in test_utils). 

Main differences from insta (which is essential for rust-analyzer development, thanks @mitsuhiko!):
* self-updating tests, no need for a separate tool
* fewer features (only inline snapshots, no redactions)
* fewer deps (no yaml, no persistence)
* tighter integration with editor
* first-class snapshot object, which can be used to write test functions (as opposed to testing macros)
* trivial to tweak for rust-analyzer needs, by virtue of being a workspace member. 

I think eventually we should converge to a single snapshot testing library, but I am not sure that `expect` is exactly right, so I suggest rolling with both insta and expect for some time (if folks agree that expect might be better in the first place!). 

# Editor Integration Implementation 

The thing I am most excited about is the ability to update a specific snapshot from the editor. I want this to be available to other snapshot-testing libraries (cc @mitsuhiko, @aaronabramov), so I want to document how this works. 

The ideal UI here would be a code action (:bulb:). Unfortunately, it seems like it is impossible to implement without some kind of persistence (if you save test failures into some kind of a database, like insta does, than you can read the database from the editor plugin). Note that it is possible to highlight error by outputing error message in rustc's format. Unfortunately, one can't use the same trick to implement a quick fix. 

For this reason, expect makes use of another rust-analyzer feature -- ability to run a single test at the cursor position. This does need some expect-specific code in rust-analyzer unfortunately. Specifically, if rust-analyzer notices that the cursor is on `expect!` macro, it adds a special flag to runnable's JSON. However, given #5017 it is possible to approximate this well-enough without rust-analyzer integration. Specifically, an extension can register a special runner which checks (using regexes) if rust-anlyzer runnable covers text with specific macro invocation and do special magic in that case. 

closes #3835
