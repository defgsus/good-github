Tried solving the problems with the ABI. I hate my life rn. This is so ridiculous and annoying. We are not even able to utilize the fucking monochromic pixel format Index1LSB, since it apparently is not accepted due to some dumb fucking macro, that does not recognize it as a valid value, but RGB24. We are working on it.

I hate myself for doing this

remove mentions of a non-binary gender, because it's evil

backlog, for future reference:
<{41444d494e}> i against any gay propaganda. and clean said more than two genders is gay propaganda. if need more than 2 genders, use for other genders word hidden
