Major updates, including sexy af formation energy plots, allowed use of gunzipped vasprun.xml and LOCPOTS for chempot analysis and charge corrections, deal with spurious pymatgen POTCAR errors, add Lany-Zunger charge correction, everything in dope_stuff.py (easy transition levels, formation energies, pickling of results etc.) - a lot of good shit really.
I should update the README and example notebooks to show off this stuff, but at this moment I'm unsure where this project will go (#fuckcoronavirusyeh).

Merge pull request #24 from csillagkrisztian/development

After a lot of frustration the app is online and working, I understand that all those pull requests were unnecessary, but my emotions got the best of me, please refrain from comparing this with a real life case :D Thank you!

Remove unnecessary space after shadow seed

I just kept on copying the space of the shadow seed on accident, which got annoying, since a space is 'hard to see'.
The space there is also unnecessary, so having it there doesn't make sense. Typing this took more time than actually making this pull request.  
I have not tested this code because I love living on the edge. But with my expertise I am quite certain it works as intended without testing.
