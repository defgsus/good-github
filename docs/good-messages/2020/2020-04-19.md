New rituals:
	Name of the Wind - causes fierce winds on the map for several days

Tweaks:
Eye of the Storm changes:
	Increased radius 6->9 cells
	Significantly improved performance

Druid Regrowth changes:
	Material costs increased
	Surgery work required increased by 50%
	Duration for a body part to regrow increased ~60%
	Able to regrow almost any bodypart on any type of human or animal (mods included) as a standard form of regrowht
	Standard regrowth will restore the bodypart but never result in an improved bodypart, this type of regrowth is only available for missing parts
	Improved regrowth bodyparts remain unchanged and will be available for bodyparts missing and still intact

Resurrection changes:
	Will always reduce the skill level of the resurrected (eg Shooting, Social, etc)
	Has chance to apply health defects (dementia, carcinoma, and more!!)

Reduced potential class XP gain through casual mentoring but the exchange now accounts for XP gain bonuses
Mentor Magic/Might now accounts for XP gain bonuses
Adjusted the amount of unnatural flair on the front of the cloak of supremacy
Reduced sound volume when using lighting storm
Druid Beguile Animal will attempt to nudge enraged animal to attack the enemies of the druid
Increased phasestrike cooldown to 25s and decreased its damage multiplier by ~25%

Bug fixes:
Giant skeletons no longer target allied/neutrals with abilities
Fixed an error when teleporting onto unwalkable cells
Fixed a bug allowing commander's and super soldier's to spawn even if the class was disabled
Added LOS check for Arrow Storm to prevent no line of sight message spam

Make Xyce/ADMS more agressive about skipping assignments

In my original bug 1284 work, I had "optimized" sensitivity code by
skipping computation of output pure variables (variables that are
designated for output, but do not get used in computation of
sources). It did this solely by looking at the LHS of assignments, and
skipping the assignment *AND DECLARATION* of such variables.

That was a problem, because *sometimes* (mostly in mextram and hicum
level 0), there were local variables that were also not used in
sources (the only thing that matters in sensitivity context at this
point), but were not output variables, but whose assignment involved
output variables on the RHS *AND* which were subsequently ONLY used to
calculate other output variables (and therefore these variables were
never actually used in sensitivity context).

My first approach to dealing with this was to carelessly replace all
now-undeclared output variables on the RHS of such assignments with
0.0.  That was dumb, because sometimes these variables were used in
denominators --- the Intel 2019 compiler then catches the division by zero
as a compile time error on Windows.

My second approach (earlier this evening) made the substitution 1.0
instead of 0.0.  That fixed the divide by zero, but still had several
stupid, unnecessary asignments.

This commit adds more aggressive pruning of assignment statements in
sensitivity functions.  We skip an assignment if:
  - the LHS is a pure output variable (never used in sources)
OR:
  - the LHS isn't output, but also isn't in sources
     AND
     - the RHS contains output variables that are not in sources and
       are not input variables (parameters).

This removes a handful of completely pointless assignments in MEXTRAM
and HICUM level 0.  It has no impact on other models.  It removes the
dumb divide by zero problem, but doesn't do so by introducing
pointless computations involving lots of 1.0 which are then assigned
to variables that are never, ever used, either.

Note that I don't, in fact, skip *declaration* of these useless
variables (unlike the skipping of declaration of pure output
variables.  I simply don't ever assign to them after they're
initialized to zero.

Note also that this change doesn't eliminate *ALL* pointless
assignments.  In MEXTRAM, there are in fact variables whose
assignments have, on the RHS, only variables whose assignments we just
skipped, but which don't themselves have RHS's that fit our "skip this
assignment" test.  These variables are also useless, but we cant
detect that.  They wind up with expressions on the RHS that involve
only variables that are always zero (because we never assign to them
after initialization by zero).  Solving this problem completely will
involve a really heavy duty recursive operation, and is not worth the
trouble.  I'm just trying to avoid generating useless expressions that
can be detected easily, and to not replace them with clearly illegal
constructs that will cause problems at compile time, or crash at run
time.  The current commit seems a reasonable compromise.

Again, this stuff only applies in sensitivity, where output variables
are all useless and only contributions to sources matter.  It has no
impact on normal, non-sensitivity code.

Update README.md

Catch me if you can (or CatchMe) - is a supporting service for connecting students of one or more Universities. General idea of this website is to amuse the students, however, it can be a useful tool for traveling purposes (because it can content the useful and important information about some locations). At this website the user enters a hashtag in the input field and at the map he/she can see all the locations with such a hashtag. 
The peculiarity of this process is in the fact that one hashtag can lead to different location. For example, if user insert #Arctic, their could see many different places on map with the same hashtag, like photos with real Arctic places as well as pubs with name “Arctic” in South Africa or hotel “Arctic” in Murmansk or night club “Arctic” in Saint-Petersburg. 
Or the student can enter #ITMO and find where other students of ITMO have been in Saint-Petersburg or around the world . The same for the students of all universities!
The optional part of the website is to add the tracking function: the traveler can create and show to the others his/her route using the hashtags.
Problem: Students always want to be in close connection with others and want to know about interesting places as well as they want to create their own traveling plans they implement after session! (or doing the session or after exam))) 
Solution: Create and develop an webservice which will help to all students stay in touch and enjoy the communications in students community. Moreover, each other community can use this website to join and follow the #hashtags. 
Framework: Django/Flask
Simplified cases:
•	A student wants to go to the pub after an exam near the University. She/he enter #pub and could see the different places with such a hashtag. It could be real pubs, but it also could a concert of the rock band with the name “pub” and finally the student can ask others is it interesting or not and find the location of the concert (and visit it). 
•	An ITMO student is traveling around the world and add the place on the map with #hashtag “Helsinki”, thus, he can see all the places with this hashtag around the world and in Helsinki and can enjoy the sense of brotherhood or even find some other ITMO students in Helsinki for pub crawling.
