Casino port

This is first phase of casino port where I have made my casino spaceship compatible with new chomp codebase. There isnt a connecting port at station yet due to changes being made to main map, but with second phase of casino port there should be one for casino shuttle to move back and forth to transfer visitors.

Non-casino changes
Port of:
purple assistant cap, wah!
wiggler hat, dont know if the sprite works fully yet.
The monocoole, every self respecting technomancer needs this! Also need this for casino rewards.
Snaps, can recommend for lunch, I prefer the licorice flavoured ones!
Space cleaner dispenser, yep any janitors dream, so far its only on casino spaceship.
Ported old modular sofa for station usage, is already on casino, future plans could involve making the modular sofa that can be built from steel be a little more pretty and made from wood as well and also get another overlay/color when added cloth for cushion.

also deleting a .txt file that I didnt get to delete before someone really wanted me to upload wip files so they could work off them, sorry about that but its fixed now!
deleted alienwhitelist and custom_items.txt since github doesnt seem to have those blacklisted

casino port:
Ported the map with the golden goose spacecasino
ported the deluxe edition bar and kitchen gear! Say hello to the good old deluxe dispenser, deluxe food vendor and deluxe drink vendor, perhaps one day they will be constructible by crew!
ported the casino stripper pole, casino roulette, slotmachine, poker/blackjack table, ported the casino wheel of fortune
casino wallet~
casino jukebox! And re implemented the system so the casino songs no longer are on the normal jukebox, sorry folks, hope you didnt like them too much :c
casino visitor and staff manual, might need a bit of revision depending on what event managers wants
Casino chips, gotta gamble with something!
fixed runtime errors from deluxe dispenser trying to add cartridges with reagents that have been renamed on new chomp

Be aware, there will be more casino changes in near future along with some other non-casino changes, including porting of pint metamorphic glass.

PLUMBING: Lavaland geysers, pumps and regrettable balance decisions! (#49067)

Implements the geysers and pumps I originally added along with the first draft of plumbing.

Geysers
A geyser can be plungered with a reinforced plunger to activate. At wich point, it'll either produce clf3, hollow water, protozine or rarely wittel.

Pumps
Adds the liquid pump to the plumbing RCD. Place on an active geyser and wrench it to start pumping the geyser of its delicious juicess. I also changed it to not use power, because it would be awful drawing kilometer long wires along with the ducts.

Chems
Hollow water works basically like blood and mutage, where you can mix it with 1 unit of holy water for more holy water.

Protozine has a .2 healing, down from omnizine's .5. The healing is just kind of a side thing and not really what this chem was implemented for.

If it wasn't obvious, this allows chemists to industrialize strange reagent creation, with hollow water being able to create limitless holy water alongside protozine being a valid replacement for omnizine. Getting 2 geysers with those chems and on lavaland is quite the hassle, and you still need to get some holy water from the chaplain as kickstarter. I honestly think this is fine, and otherwise I could add a unique botany catalyst, so they don't become useless in the process.

Wittel
Adds wittel, wich is rare. Does nothing, but can be processed into two fun/regrettable chems.

Adds gravitum. Metabolizes very slowly. Drinking it makes you weightless, and spraying it makes that object temporarily weightless. Make 10u by mixing 1 wittel with 10 sorium

Adds metalgen. Created by mixing it with mutagen and bluespace powder. Must then be mixed with 40u of a powedered material and 1u of liquid dark matter.
The material used becomes imprinted on the chem. It can then be applied to anything, except mobs, to turn it into that material. Radiation is bad, and no you can't turn the nuke into plasma to blow it up.
The chem is difficult to get and use, but it can turn the escape shuttle into solid gold wich looks really cool. You could also turn it into plasma and vaporize everything. It can be used to, with some effort, duplicate materials.

ðŸ†‘
add: Adds geysers to lavaland! They can be activated by using a reinforced plunger found in the medical vendor. They can be harvested by using a new plumbing device, magically powered liquid pumps!
add: Adds Hollow Water to geysers, wich can be combined with Holy Water as catalyst for more Holy Water
add: Adds Protozine to geyers, a very weak version of Omnizine. Can be used in Strange Reagent mixing
add: Adds Wittel, a very rare geyser chem. Can be processed into gravitum, wich removes gravity. Can also be processed into metalgen, wich has a strange tendency to transform objects into the imprinted material.
/ðŸ†‘

Why:
This is what I originally wanted to do. The idea was to have a lot more chems, but I can't focus on one thing for that long. Hopefully this'll empower the bored chemist and make the rounds just that more interesting. Hopefully this'll spark the creation of some other geyser chems aswell.

That and makes shaft miners not the only ones hunting on lavaland.

Wilk 12/19 (#66)

* lolok

Lot of shit.

* Large Amount of Changes

Rime Core:

Added 'gag' option to custom send function.

Rime Alias:

For the 0495023947124719237th time I have added queueing to the Hammer Throw alias.

Turned Mjoll's unblock alias into just ub/unblock and jacked the directional alias for another work in progress project. Should work the same, mostly.

Added pause/unpause alias.

Rime Attack Library:

Added slightly annoying echo about things not added to the library yet.

Fixed Tarot Moon function. (Was missing check on applying aff.)

Added a lot here. More needs to be done still. Most of the original tracking in Rime has been added. Please report any bugs.

Added even more.

Added a fuckton more.

Rime Curing:

Fixed pipe queueing with Aeon specifics.

Fixed salve queueing with Aeon specifics.

Fixed Sentinel parrying shifting when it should be static head.

Adjusted Ascendril parrying to hard swap to torso when you have Hypothermia.

Added hard switch to Sensitivity when you're impaled.

Fixed focusing vs. Wayfarer when you have the Muddled affliction.

Adjusted Sciomancer curing priorities /a lot/. Should survive a lot longer now.

Swapped static priority of pre-restore and limb curing in general on most classes. No reason to be curing torso damage when both legs are broken. o.O

Removed 'guessing' for hidden afflictions. Fixed tree and renew not being spammed when you have hidden afflictions. Careful, they spam a lot more now.

Started adding support for hidden recklessness detection.

Fixed up howl detection. Let me know if this wigs out when you're fighting shifters.

Rime PvP Core:

Added "locked" special condition to rime.pvp.has_aff() function.

Added a "You" or "you" escape in rime.pvp.add_aff() function. Why didn't I do this to start with??? Removes the need for script escapes in specific triggers/functions.

Rime PvE:

Started work on auto corpse turn in while bashing mobs that have a turn in quest.

Completely most of the above addition. Corpse turn in added for Three Rock, Ayhesa, and Caldera.

If this breaks somewhere let me know. I'm going to throw Maz's map into the discord, too, so hopefully it quits breaking for everyone.

Misc:

There are a bunch of half started/half finished projects going on including some shrinesight stuff and some faux farming triggers. They may or may not become more than what they currently are, they may exist in limbo for forever. If you have any issues involving them then feel free to delete the triggers entirely. There's also a credit buying trigger you need to check and make sure is turned off unless you want to start buying credits every time someone says there are cheaper credits on market channel.

Remove exe / com wrapper around openrct2.dll for Windows (#10727)

We get repeated reports of people saying the game is incorrectly reported as a virus. It is becoming more inconvenient for players and even myself, because when we attempt to download a build, it is immediately deleted by scanners (including the default for Windows: Windows Defender).

One scanner is not too much of an issue, but the game is flagged by almost half of available scanners as reported by VirusTotal.

So why is it being flagged?

Windows has a very annoying concept, the subsystem for a binary. The console subsystem allows stdin / stdout as you would expect, just like posix. Unfortunately if a user runs a console subsystem binary from the desktop or explorer, the game will be opened under conhost and thus you get a console showing alongside the game window. This is not a good user experience for most players. To resolve this, you can use the windows subsystem, but this will detach stdin and stdout immediately on launch. There are hacks that can be done in code to allocate a new console but I found this to not work very well with stdin or other terminal emulators.

My solution to the problem was to have two binaries: openrct2.exe and openrct2.com. Both are executable but openrct2.exe is windows subsystem, openrct2.com is console subsystem. The desktop shortcut opens openrct2.exe with no console window showing. Typing openrct2 on the command line will execute openrct2.com (as .com has higher PATH precedence than .exe by default) with working stdin and stdout. In order to reduce the size, I have the entire game inside openrct2.dll and then supply two tiny wrapper EXEs that simply route main(...) into the DLL.

These wrapper EXEs are the problem, they are very small and do nothing but call into a DLL, this must match virus signatures too closely and their size probably reduces the data available for the scanner to analyse.

So as I can not find any other way of achieving my goal of a cli and gui version of OpenRCT2, this changes the build to publish openrct2 as a single executable (rather than a DLL + wrapper EXE), and then duplicate the entire ~10MB exe again and flip the subsystem flag. The installer and zip size won't be affected as this extra size will be completely compressed out, but when unpacked will lead to an extra ~10MB on disc. But I think it is a fair compromise.

VirusTotal now reports all artefacts as safe, for now anyway.

[Balance Patch - Tend Wounds Edition]

Seriously why the fuck is this doing such little healing and taking so much time to do?

Like, it's literally useless with our synthflesh+silver sulf... meta

Fuckin hell, even bicardine/kelotane heals faster than this shit.

Not anymore.

Today, I'm dramatically improving the healing and giving a decent time reduction to doing this surgery.

I still see the code where it's less efficient on dead bodies, but ehh... price for being dead and this might be stupid good as is.

--------

PATCH NOTES

- Doubled healing on all Tend Wounds

- Roughly around 40% reduction to time needed to do the step that actually heals.

$_DEV: Added Flag patrol log button

Added a Flag Patrol log button and associated text-area, however, I cannot for the life of my get it to validate and encode correctly. I will take another look tomorrow, but it's being dumb and hurting my feelings ;(

I did add some front-end checking for required fields, also changed out the words "required" for a cool red start, and finally disabled auto fill because fuck that shit.

"1:50pm. Enough chilling. Let me do the chores and then I will resume.

2:10pm. Done with chores. Time to do those other two project folders.

2:15pm. Focus me, focus. It really sucks. This part really sucks. I do not feel like doing this, but at the same time I do not feel like doing the usual leisure activities either.

2:25pm. What the hell, am I doing? Focus.

Go through the damn files.

2:45pm.

```
let private convertNameToCode(n: HtmlNode): HtmlNode =
    let name = n.GetAttributeValue("name", n.InnerText)
    HtmlNode.CreateNode("`" + name + "`")

let private convertInnerTextToCode(n: HtmlNode): HtmlNode =
    let text = n.InnerText
    HtmlNode.CreateNode("`" + text + "`")

let private convertPara(n: HtmlNode): HtmlNode =
    HtmlNode.CreateNode("\n\n")

Why is it juggling Html around?

2:50pm.

```
let private ensure(xmlFile: FileInfo) =

        let needsUpdate =
            match cache.TryGetValue(xmlFile.FullName) with

```

I am definitely having more trouble understanding this file than the LSP stuff.

2:55pm. My focus is low, but I need to push through this.

3:05pm. Ok, I do not understand most of the stuff in TipFormatter.

...Ah, wait, now I remember. C# uses XML in comments.

Still why is so much processing needed here?

Well, nevermind that.

Let me move on. I want to get through this today. I want to study all the files and then move on to the tests.

3:15pm.

```

```

This is way beyond the level of what could be understood just by looking at it.

3:25pm. `Navigation.fs` is a beast. Forget it.

Towards the end, there will be something where all this stuff gets turned into JSON and that will be the points that I really need to study.

Actually, one of the things that so turns me off from OO, is just how complex OO languages are internally. The similar case seems to apply to SML modules it seems.

3:45pm. I am really not absorbing much from this. Let me move to the next file.

4:05pm. I've been taking a short breather. Let me resume.

It is tough. There is this huge wall of text. There is an endless pile of code that I need to, yet don't understand. And doing this way is extremely inefficient as a method of learning.

4:15pm. Focus me, focus. To be honest, though I had enough. I am looking at `ProjectManage.fs` and am thinking - fuck this shit.

Let me just put in the rest and I will move to the tests.

4:20pm. The thing builds. Let me try running it.

```

Couldn't find System.ComponentModel.Composition.dll in C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\2.1.15
```

What the dick?

I can't believe I am getting this error again.

So that means that some package or the other is looking for a later version of .NET core.

...How about I fire up the debugger and find what it is?

```
    // Process messages on main thread
    let mutable quit = false
    while not quit do
        match processQueue.Take() with

It seems that `processQueue.Take` is the culprit.

```
    let processQueue = new System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection<PendingTask>(10)
    let _ = processQueue.Take()
    let _ = 2
```

Yep. Oh boy.

Indeed the files it is looking for are not in those folders.

How can this be happening?

4:40pm.

```
let connect(serverFactory: ILanguageClient -> ILanguageServer, receive: BinaryReader, send: BinaryWriter) =
    let processQueue' = new System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection<PendingTask>(10)
    let _ = processQueue'.Take()
```

This is inexplicable. When I do this it just freezes.

```
let connect(serverFactory: ILanguageClient -> ILanguageServer, receive: BinaryReader, send: BinaryWriter) =
    let server = serverFactory(RealClient(send))
    let processQueue' = new System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection<PendingTask>(10)
    let _ = processQueue'.Take()
    let _ = 2
```

This triggers the error. For some reason that `server` does the trick.

I don't get it. Maybe I am not supposed to run the main?

4:45pm. Ok, it is clear to me that the only way I am going to be able to do this is to ask the author. But before that let me move on to the tests.

4:55pm.

```
[<Test>]
let ``report a type error when a file is saved``() =
    let client, server = createServerAndReadFile("MainProject", "CreateTypeError.fs")
    client.Diagnostics.Clear()
    server.DidChangeTextDocument(edit("MainProject", "CreateTypeError.fs", 4, 18, "1", "\"1\"")) |> Async.RunSynchronously
    server.DidSaveTextDocument(save("MainProject", "CreateTypeError.fs")) |> Async.RunSynchronously
    let messages = diagnosticMessages(client)
    let isTypeError(m: string) = m.Contains("This expression was expected to have type")
    if not (List.exists isTypeError messages) then Assert.Fail(sprintf "No type error in %A" messages)
```

Some of the tests run, but the others freeze. At any rate, I choose wrong.

This F# project is not a good target for me. It is too complex as a study target. The stuff in LSP is passable, but I have no idea what is going on in the server.

Well, let me ask the author for advice. Hopefully he won't take offense to what I will say.

...Ah, actually, it does seems like I can run the tests that haven't been run manually. Great.

Except for one, they all pass.

5:10pm. Forget this. I am never going to get anywhere studying the wrapper itself. Let me study the typescript side of it.

That should hopefully be more instructive.

5:15pm. Holy shit, the fsharp.json file is literally 1.6k LOC. What the hell?

5:25pm. Well, nevermind that. The client is giving type errors due to some missing modules. I am not sure how to compile it.

Well, let me go with `npm install`.

Oh, great. The type errors went away.

5:30pm.

```
 // The server is packaged as a standalone command
 let serverMain = context.asAbsolutePath(binName());
```

I think I get it. On windows, the server is an executable.

...I am confused. It says it is compiling to a console application. Yet in the folder I only see a .dll. What the hell?

5:40pm. It is compiling it to an exe in the rebuild that I did by hand, but not in the cloned one. What the fuck?

I am furious here. Fuck these shitty builds. Fuck them. Why can't those retards master the fine art of doing compilation properly.

Oahhhhh...

Let me just go through the client file top to bottom and then I will think of what comes next.

5:50pm. Done. I am exhausted. This is yet another day that I make middling progress. I am not sure if I am actually learning something or just spinning my wheels here.

Nevertheless, I must go on. Let me ask the author about the .dll issue.

...There is a similar issue to mine there, though the .dll versions are different.

https://github.com/adamnew123456/fsharp-language-server/tree/dotnet-3

It seems somebody got it running here. Let me try cloning this and building it.

6pm. I am running into the same compilation bullshit as last time. It is having trouble downloading the required packages on its own.

No, it is the same fuckery as last time. I have no idea what the hell is wrong with this project.

I do not want to waste hours figuring out what is eating this thing again.

6:05pm. I am thinking about taking the thing that works and reverting to the earlier commits, but most authors aren't like me that they make novel length commits detailing most of the development steps.

Sure I could ask the author what is wrong, but there is an outstanding issue that has not been answered, so I do not see a point in doing that.

I'll admit it, I am absolutely astonished at what the author has built here. I certainly would not be able to deal with this complexity. So he deserves some respect for being able to do all of this. In 2017 when I tried dealing with .NET stuff, it was so complex that I decided to go with macros instead. The F# guys who are doing the support for VS cannot have it easy either. They've really guaranteed themselves stable employment.

6:10pm. Right now, more than anything I feel like I've made a strategic error in choosing F# as my template. I should have picked something like C instead. I need a relatively simple statically typed language rather than an OO monstrosity that is F#.

6:15pm. C would be close to ideal if not for its macros.

Agh...I have no choice at this point. Tomorrow, I will make post on the PL sub asking suggestions as I am really making grinding progress here. I've been at this for over a week now with little to show for it.

6:20pm. I should have done this ten days ago. Ugh.

I pretty much did everything wrong here. I put in a lot of effort and reality is just spitting in my face here.

But games have taught me that once you make the right moves, you can win.

6:25pm. Right now, it is time I start unwinding. No need to raise my stress beyond its limit. Working past 6pm is really only for times when you are super inspired and right now the situation is the complete opposite of that.

There are just too many things that I lack. Webdev knowledge especially it seems. Someday, somewhere, somebody will laugh at me today.

Tomorrow, I am going to change my policy and hopefully finally find the hook I am looking for. Learning only really starts once you grab that initial foothold and start building. I am yet to do this."

Implemented Particle BC approach + got load/save working!

Body.h, Body.cc: I wrote a new method, Apply_BCs, which simply applies BCs to each patticle in a body. This is done using a parallel for loop to optimize performance.

Body_IO.cc: Removed an intentional bug that I introduced yesterday (to test the whole exception thing) but forgot to remove... oops.

Update.cc: While getting the code to work, I ran into a bunch of problems with nan accelerations. I was able to quickly debug the problem by having the particle print its info if it gets nan.

Save_Simulation.cc: There was a bug in here. I wrote a line to print the "plus_x_BC" (an approach that I am NOT using any more), but forgot to remove it.. that line caused a bunch of problems. Also, I added some extra spaces to the "Has_BC" part of "Save_Particle" to improve readability.

Load_Simulation.cc: Oh boy, there were some bugs in here. The part that read in "Time_Steps_Between_Updates" only worked if a body was not a box... This line should be read in for ALL bodies, not just non-box ones. I have no idea why that if statement was there. I fixed it. There was also a strange typo in the sscanf lines (318 and 326)... I double typed something. For some reason, the compiler didn't comaplin about this one, idek.

Particle.cc: I updated the particle printing method to improve debugging.

Partice.h: Updated friend function prototypes.

Boundary_Conditions.cc: Made the BC functions work with the "Paritcles have BCs" approach. This involved renaming some functions and changing a few lines. Surprpsingly painless.

Simulation_Setup.cc: Renamed Free_Box_BC as FREE. Renamed Startup_Simulation as Setup_Simulation. Added BC setting to Setup_Box method.

Simulation.cc: Updated function names. Updated the way that BCs are applied (108-109) and fixed a REALLY ANNOYING bug. Before, time_update was an unsigned. this was a TYPO, it's suposed to be a double. This bug caused a ton of problems. Finding it took forever :-1:. Anyway, after fixing that (and encountering another bug with time_update when loading in files... Time_Steps_Between_Updat was not being set for box bodies, see my discussion on Load_Simulation.cc for more), I realized that this line should have some printouts for debugging. I added some (141-144), and defined a new variable, "SIMULATION_DEBUG" to toggle printing.

Simulation.h: Added SIMULATION_DEBUG definition (and commeted it out), updated some names, and played around with some settings.

With these changes, the code ran, saved, loaded, and ran again! Save/Load is finally working again, and BCs are fully implemented!

In the future, I want to implement the setup file.

Nanopaste Fixes #2892 (#3568)

* Nanopaste fixed

Signed-off-by: fernandos33 <ois333@yahoo.com>

* well this adds 4 cigars as contraband for the cigarette machine (costing 25) , and  more important adjusted the price from 300 to 12 so people are able to fuck their lungs at will (we are in cyberpunk yeah smoking is expensive in real life but... even them not that much)

* small changes as asked (did not messed with relative path, will do tomorrow)

* s

* fixed the paste again cleaned the code a little and now if you try using the trauma kit, it wont start a "loading bar" as if it was going to fix, it now only works on organic, and nanopaste only works on robotic organs)

* NO MORE RELATIVE PATHS IN SURGERY NO ONE BIT

Signed-off-by: fernandos33 <ois333@yahoo.com>

* good indentions heh

* more indent

* thanks for pushing me, i learned a lot in the PR, thanks to everyone involved you guys are the reason i wanted to code (to help such community)
