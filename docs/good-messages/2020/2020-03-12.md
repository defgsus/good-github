I love having to add tests for basic things like printing don't you?

Dear python developers. I'm leaving and never coming back as soon as I
possibly can. This is beyond insane. If by "unneeded" __str__
definitions you mean "I have no idea what I am doing but I don't like
seeing repetitive things and have no understanding of the consequences
of this change on other developers nor the fact that it will increase
the amount of work that thousands of them have to do all in the name
reducing the tiny amount of work that I do on something that DIDNT
EVEN NEED TO BE CHANGED (??!?!)" then you are correct. If you care
about people continuing to use the software you produce I suggest you
don't make changes that will, I don't know, cause RecursionErrors out
of nowhere in previously working code. WTF.

Bubble Sort Visualization (#114)

A visualization of the Bubble Sorting Algorithm, arguably the least efficient method of sorting (going through the set by pairs over and over again, moving smaller numbers before larger ones). Once the initial lines show up, you'll experience a decent wait time, as the BubbleSorter() function has, in my experience, needed anywhere from ~37 to 50 iterations to properly sort them. Seriously. Bubble sorting sucks. I initially hoped I could simply use the builtin sort() function, however it uses a sorting method called "Timsort," so no luck there...

It should be noted that I made the dimensions slightly smaller than the ones he used, but that's just my personal preference, its aspect ratio is the same.

Difficulty - 3 / 10

commit: give a hint when a commit message has been abandoned

If we launch an editor for the user to create a commit
message, they may put significant work into doing so.
Typically we try to check common mistakes that could cause
the commit to fail early, so that we die before the user
goes to the trouble.

We may still experience some errors afterwards, though; in
this case, the user is given no hint that their commit
message has been saved. Let's tell them where it is.

Allow notebook format version 4.1 mimebundle keys ending in `+json` to have arbitrary JSON

There are a number of people posting issues with nbformat 5 being stricter about validating notebook format 4.1, including:

https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/issues/160
https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/issues/161
https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/issues/2553
https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/issues/2788


Essentially, nbformat package version 4.x allowed noncompliant format 4.1 notebooks to be verified as valid, leading to many notebooks in the wild having major/minor format version 4.1, but with widgets and other json outputs that were technically invalid.

Upgrading to nbformat package 5.x correctly flagged these notebook as noncompliant. This is correct technically. However, practically it means that all these notebooks files tagged as format 4.1 that were working fine suddenly won't even open after upgrading to nbformat version 5. This is a pain.

This retroactively upgrades the format 4.1 schema to allow json in these cases, since in practice there are lots of notebooks labeled as format 4.1, I think by official Jupyter software, that have json in the mimebundle output. Essentially, this acknowledges that in the official implementations from Jupyter, notebook format 4.1 has indeed had arbitrary JSON values in mimebundles, and we cannot in good conscience decree it invalid.

# tgbot 

എന്നെ ഈ നിലയിൽ ആക്കിയതും ഇപ്പൊ നോക്കി നടത്തുന്നതും ഈ [കുരുപ്പാണ്](https://t.me/tHe_GaMeR_B0Y) എന്നെ ഉണ്ടാക്കിയത് ഈ [ഗ്രൂപ്പ്](t.me/movielinks_only) മാനേജ് ചെയ്യാൻ വേണ്ടി ആണ്. 

ഞാനും മേരി ചേച്ചിയുടെ പോലെ തന്നെ ഒരു പവർഫുൾ ബോട്ട് ആണ് 

Alternatively, [find me on telegram](https://t.me/tHe_GaMeR_B0Y)! (Keep all support questions in the support chat, where more people can help you.)

## You can also tap the Deploy To Heroku button below to deploy straight to Heroku!

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/TGExplore/Marie_Chechi2.0)

## Starting the bot.

Once you've setup your database and your configuration (see below) is complete, simply run:

`python3 -m tg_bot`


## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Please make sure to use python3.6, as I cannot guarantee everything will work as expected on older python versions!
This is because markdown parsing is done by iterating through a dict, which are ordered by default in 3.6.

### Configuration

There are two possible ways of configuring your bot: a config.py file, or ENV variables.

The prefered version is to use a `config.py` file, as it makes it easier to see all your settings grouped together.
This file should be placed in your `tg_bot` folder, alongside the `__main__.py` file . 
This is where your bot token will be loaded from, as well as your database URI (if you're using a database), and most of 
your other settings.

It is recommended to import sample_config and extend the Config class, as this will ensure your config contains all 
defaults set in the sample_config, hence making it easier to upgrade.

An example `config.py` file could be:
```
from tg_bot.sample_config import Config


class Development(Config):
    OWNER_ID = 861055237  # my telegram ID
    OWNER_USERNAME = "tHe_GaMeR_B0Y"  # my telegram username
    API_KEY = "your bot api key"  # my api key, as provided by the botfather
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database'  # sample db credentials
    MESSAGE_DUMP = '-1234567890' # some group chat that your bot is a member of
    USE_MESSAGE_DUMP = True
    SUDO_USERS = [18673980, 83489514]  # List of id's for users which have sudo access to the bot.
    LOAD = []
    NO_LOAD = ['translation']
```

If you can't have a config.py file (EG on heroku), it is also possible to use environment variables.
The following env variables are supported:
 - `ENV`: Setting this to ANYTHING will enable env variables

 - `TOKEN`: Your bot token, as a string.
 - `OWNER_ID`: An integer of consisting of your owner ID
 - `OWNER_USERNAME`: Your username

 - `DATABASE_URL`: Your database URL
 - `MESSAGE_DUMP`: optional: a chat where your replied saved messages are stored, to stop people deleting their old 
 - `LOAD`: Space separated list of modules you would like to load
 - `NO_LOAD`: Space separated list of modules you would like NOT to load
 - `WEBHOOK`: Setting this to ANYTHING will enable webhooks when in env mode
 messages
 - `URL`: The URL your webhook should connect to (only needed for webhook mode)

 - `SUDO_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered sudo users
 - `SUPPORT_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered support users (can gban/ungban,
 nothing else)
 - `WHITELIST_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered whitelisted - they can't be banned.
 - `DONATION_LINK`: Optional: link where you would like to receive donations.
 - `CERT_PATH`: Path to your webhook certificate
 - `PORT`: Port to use for your webhooks
 - `DEL_CMDS`: Whether to delete commands from users which don't have rights to use that command
 - `STRICT_GBAN`: Enforce gbans across new groups as well as old groups. When a gbanned user talks, he will be banned.
 - `WORKERS`: Number of threads to use. 8 is the recommended (and default) amount, but your experience may vary.
 __Note__ that going crazy with more threads wont necessarily speed up your bot, given the large amount of sql data 
 accesses, and the way python asynchronous calls work.
 - `BAN_STICKER`: Which sticker to use when banning people.
 - `ALLOW_EXCL`: Whether to allow using exclamation marks ! for commands as well as /.

### Python dependencies

Install the necessary python dependencies by moving to the project directory and running:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

This will install all necessary python packages.

### Database

If you wish to use a database-dependent module (eg: locks, notes, userinfo, users, filters, welcomes),
you'll need to have a database installed on your system. I use postgres, so I recommend using it for optimal compatibility.

In the case of postgres, this is how you would set up a the database on a debian/ubuntu system. Other distributions may vary.

- install postgresql:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install postgresql`

- change to the postgres user:

`sudo su - postgres`

- create a new database user (change YOUR_USER appropriately):

`createuser -P -s -e YOUR_USER`

This will be followed by you needing to input your password.

- create a new database table:

`createdb -O YOUR_USER YOUR_DB_NAME`

Change YOUR_USER and YOUR_DB_NAME appropriately.

- finally:

`psql YOUR_DB_NAME -h YOUR_HOST YOUR_USER`

This will allow you to connect to your database via your terminal.
By default, YOUR_HOST should be 0.0.0.0:5432.

You should now be able to build your database URI. This will be:

`sqldbtype://username:pw@hostname:port/db_name`

Replace sqldbtype with whichever db youre using (eg postgres, mysql, sqllite, etc)
repeat for your username, password, hostname (localhost?), port (5432?), and db name.

## Modules
### Setting load order.

The module load order can be changed via the `LOAD` and `NO_LOAD` configuration settings.
These should both represent lists.

If `LOAD` is an empty list, all modules in `modules/` will be selected for loading by default.

If `NO_LOAD` is not present, or is an empty list, all modules selected for loading will be loaded.

If a module is in both `LOAD` and `NO_LOAD`, the module will not be loaded - `NO_LOAD` takes priority.

### Creating your own modules.

Creating a module has been simplified as much as possible - but do not hesitate to suggest further simplification.

All that is needed is that your .py file be in the modules folder.

To add commands, make sure to import the dispatcher via

`from tg_bot import dispatcher`.

You can then add commands using the usual

`dispatcher.add_handler()`.

Assigning the `__help__` variable to a string describing this modules' available
commands will allow the bot to load it and add the documentation for
your module to the `/help` command. Setting the `__mod_name__` variable will also allow you to use a nicer, user
friendly name for a module.

The `__migrate__()` function is used for migrating chats - when a chat is upgraded to a supergroup, the ID changes, so 
it is necessary to migrate it in the db.

The `__stats__()` function is for retrieving module statistics, eg number of users, number of chats. This is accessed 
through the `/stats` command, which is only available to the bot owner.

Add functionality from tf_slim to replace tf.contrib functionality

TLDR: Google sucks, this was harder than it needed to be, but the TF2
issues should be solved now.

The issue here was that usage of tf.contrib cannot be replaced
automatically by the upgrade script. It seems that several libraries in
tf.contrib have not been automatically ported. Google really bungled the
upgrade process from TF1 to TF2. They have not managed backwards
compatability well with little to no thought to existing users. This
was not an easy task to solve, and the only entity to blame here is
Google. You can track the upgrade process of TF1 contrib functionality
here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0
(Notice how empty the sheet is)

Fortunately, the functionality required by astronet was ported to a
separate library Google created called tf-slim. There is no
documentation that they did that, and it is instead left to the user to
discover that. Why not include that information in the TF2 upgrade page?
Who knows why Google seems to hate their users?

However, it's not just as easy pip installing tf-slim, because while
the GitHub repository has updated code, the actual pip package is not
updated and still contains references to tf.contrib. Why not update the
pip package if its such a major release? No good reason other than pure
mismanagement of this upgrade process. I don't know if anyone at Google
really even thought through this well.

Anyways, I managed to cherry pick the exact functionality astronet
needed from tf-slim and put it into astronet itself and modified the
imports. Everything should work correctly now.

                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

"5:20pm. The way is the market is going is definitely feeling like 2008. At that time though, by the time the crash happened finance stocks were making new lows for 4 quarters straight and bonds were getting crushed, so one had plenty of warning to get out from a technical perspective.

This selloff here happened right in the middle of a bull run in tech stocks.

Even in 1999 it took half a year after the market crashed for the bear market to really start.

At most I can see is the the other sectors were particularly hot, but still there place to be in the stock market is hardly a secret. The stupid thing would have been to own small caps before all of this.

A dumb man sells because stocks are going down, the smart man sells because stocks are not going up.

5:25pm. I have no idea whether I could have anticipated the scale of the selloff from just watching the news. I really thought that 2 days ago was the bottom.

As expected, it is difficult to account for selloffs like these unless you really have a strategy of staying out of the market completely because you are waiting for the big crash to get active. Right now I am definitely in bull mode though. Since the market is in complete demoralization stage, I would not be surprised to see it start rallying today towards the end of the day. If not that then tomorrow.

But it is easy to see this when you are not invested in anything.

5:30pm. Let me resume. Stop lurking the /biz/ sticky.

What is next?

The `server` and the `client`.

5:55pm.

```
arg1 !== void 0
```

Yesterday I said that this tests for `undefined` rather than `null`. Let me try it out in the repl. It might turn out to be the case that it tests for both.

Ah, `void 0` is literally `undefined`. Then I was right.

6:05pm.

```
class TestStream extends Duplex {
 _write(chunk: string, _encoding: string, done: () => void) {
  this.emit('data', chunk);
  done();
 }
 _read(_size: number) { }
}
```

Yeah, he obviously did not know what classes were 3 years ago. Definitely came from a JS background.

6:15pm. Forget it, I do not feel like it anymore.

I did a little skim to see if thing make more sense to me. And they do to an extent. But it is obvious that server just on its own has a massive amount of complexity.

I really am wondering whether I am better just doing it on my own.

Well, I'll have enough to decide it pretty soon. I am nearly done with this now. Having a standard language protocol sounds good at first glance, but if they overload it with features just to cover all the cases then I really am better just rolling my own.

One thing I'll want to do is check out how Purescript does it. Surely it won't let me down. It actually goes as far as advertizing its tooling so that should be something.

6:25pm. It is amazing. Literally everywhere I've looked, I can only find trash.

Let me close here."

Create troubleshooting documentation

I decided to add this documentation this morning when the Manifest ETL
was broken I couldn't remember what we had done in the past to fix it.

I added some other tips for troubleshooting common errors that could be
useful for current or future developers on the SFS.

Add files via upload

******************************* Class Exercise Start ***********************
Create an interactive program.
Ask a user for his/her name. All the following questions and answers should contain his/her name. Also ask for gender (M, F).
Ask for age. Based on age, the program should respond the following:
0-5 : You are too young for this app.
6-18: Oh you are a student
19-40:Well, you must be employed.

The program should provide more details about the age. For example:
If user answers 3, the program should respond: Come back in 3 years when you will be a student.
If user answers 10, the program should respond: Keep up... 8 more years left and afterwards you will make money.
If user answers 25, the program should respond: You finished school 7 years ago.

Also, the program should tell you how old you were in 1980 (if you were born) and how old you will be in 2040.

Then ask the user about his/her favorite season. You have to provide the following options and the user must choose one of them by inserting a number 1-4:
1. Winter
2. Spring
3. Summer
4. Autumn

Based on the answer, respond with a message:
Winter = It must be cold outside
Spring = Ohh, flowers are very beautiful these days
Summer = Let's go for swimming
Autumn = The trees are full of brown leaves

Ask user to enter his/her height and weight. Then find the BMI and print a message:
Underweight   = < 18.5
Normal weight = 18.5â€“24.9
Overweight    = 25â€“29.9
Obesity       = BMI of 30 or greater 
**BMI = kg/meters^2

Now let's find your lucky day. Transform your age to days. Add the digits of the days. If number is more than 6, use the modulo operation with number 7. Based on result find the lucky day.
0 = Monday
1 = Tuesday
...
6 = Sunday
For example 
30 years is 10950 days(1 year = 365 days)
Add digits : 1+0+9+5+0 = 15
15 is larger than 6
15%7 = 1
Lucky day is Tuesday.

The user now wants to go to a club. There is a man in the entrance of the club. Only people that their lucky day is Wednesday can enter. You must also be between 20 and 40. Can you enter? Print the message that the guy tells you at the door. If he doesn't let you pass, he will tell you the reason.
If you can enter and you are 20-25 the guy welcomes you with your name.
If you can enter, you are over 25 and male, the guy welcomes you with title Mr. 
If you are female he will ask you if you are married. If yes he welcomes you Mrs. otherwise Ms.

Include expiration time calculation for the shopping cart

We'll start working with 15 minutes of expiration time for the shopping cart. Remembering: a shopping cart is a master order with the 'reserved' status.

It's a little tricky the calculation logic, because we'll have many different products with different rules than can be put together in the shopping cart but, as general rule, everything with a floating exchange rate expires.

We have something that is not ideal implemented here, but I think will be easier for the user understand: if you put something that expires in your shopping cart, once that expires the wole shopping cart is expired. It is possible to make item by item expire, but I think this would look quite weird and is possible to enter in an annoying loop.

Oh FFS, try latest macOS image to see if it can install gcc.

I would like to say that I don't own a mac, or have physical access to a mac
of any kind.  My only interaction with the mac ecosystem is through the
travis-ci build interface.  Having said that... based solely on the experience
I've had with this build system... I HATE MACS.  With a passion.  They are
overhyped pieces of shit made by idiots who favour shiny things over any sane
design principles.  These machines should not exist.

MUSICAL: Very basic prototype working and it sounds awful

? I mean that sounds really, really shitty. Kind of menacing and weird, 
but not at all an interesting sound unfortunately... very grinding and 
repetitive.

? Not impossible it can be resurrected by rethinking how the music is 
represented... maybe playing one square at a time from top to bottom 
with the different pieces just having different tones associated with 
them? Maybe black and white as different instruments? But then no chords 
or anything...

? Basically you're often going to be playing four or more notes in a 
single moment and that sounds bad.
