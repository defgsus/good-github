suggested wording changes

Various changes, based on what I have read.  I am NOT an immunologist or epidemiologist, and don't always remember where I saw stuff, so DO NOT treat me as more of an expert than you.  I'm just trying to help.

The "80% mild" particularly worries me, as it seems pretty clear that that 80% includes an awful lot of stuff that is way way past what I as a layperson would consider "mild".  I think "mild" for most people is "Not bad enough to take off of work", not "hospitalized but not intubated", and there are a lot of people (Republicans in particular) who are saying, "enh, it's the flu, no big deal".  YES IT IS A BIG DEAL!

It would be nice if we had a number for the % who eventually need hospitalization.

Thank you very much for doing this!

SSS Rework FOMOD GUI

Depends on 190-de-wx-pt1, rewrites most of the GUI to use the wrappers
instead. Drops a whole bunch of wx usages, which is nice. RadioButton
needs wrapping, see all the ugly hacks at the bottom of gui_fomod. Also,
the design that uses __dict__ of wx objects to store group objects has
to go, it's fundamentally hacky and very fragile - e.g. imagine if the
wx guys decided to add __slots__ to their objects.

Also contains a bunch of fixes and misc improvements, e.g. user-facing
strings have been made translatable, some bugs that were carried over
from belt have been fixed, and the 'Back' button no longer works on the
first page.

Note the glaring TODOs - this is a straight up port of the original GUI,
but we currently don't have a way to change fonts, which the original
GUI relied on to differentiate its components. I added some
HBoxedLayouts as an alternative, which works fine for the main FOMOD
dialog and may even be an improvement in terms of visual clarity, but
doesn't help at all with the results screen, which is now an unreadable
mess.

Infernio: Updated for wrapped WizardDialog, gave fomods their own stored
size.

Code cleanup and minor improvements

Ugh, well I just wrote this description but lost it ( °^°)

Ten will now spend energy when shooting blood projectiles, but recovers some when hitting opponents with his veins.

New entity.spendEnergy(energy) method : subtracts energy to the user if it has enough, returns true if successful, false otherwise.

Extracted ugly code from damage interaction, made functions with it, can be used as listeners to the "hit" event (shaking the camera or entities, etc, some of them don't really work).

New vectorTransition.isDone() method (also other transitions I guess), returns true if the transition is over.

Extracted sizeTransition controller, now ends when the transition is over.

Revived some camera dead code, still kinda dead because they're not used yet, but not as much.
Camera follows the player/targets more smoothly and with less glitches.

Added poh. It stands for pressed or held. I think. Returns true if the passed value equals 1 or is greater than 16 (with intervals) ; it's supposed to replicate the "Repeat the action if held long enough, or do it just once if briefly pressed".

Extracted the code for map transitions into its own function.
