more consistent sizing of TitleMenu logo assets

They each have their own problems: suicidal depression, intense anxiety
manifesting as constant tremors, eating disorders, borderline, and so
on. Collectively, they are human people struggling with mental health,
and they talk about the difficulties – both day-to-day and more broadly
– during each initial check-in.

There is a break halfway through the day, and then they come back and do
an exercise or game. The game that day was charades. Check-in had been
more strained than usual, and the group leader felt something fun was
needed.

It seemed surreal to see them put aside their trouble for a moment and
play charades. They smiled and laughed and seemed to genuinely have a
good time, as though they were able to become different people. Is that
possible?

One is so anxious she has trouble controlling her hands, but she smiled
and goofed around for a few moments, acting out various scenes. Another
is so painfully thin but she got so into the moment, even gently
encouraging me to, too, not hesitating to fall on me and expect me to
catch her when the prompt was "crowd surfing."

Surreal is the only word I have, as though I were statically observing a
dynamic scene that I was supposedly part of. But I was elsewhere, far
away, not part of the play.

I must be just clinging to woe at this point.

Split server role into docker/kvm roles

There is a very real chance "dev-desktop" becomes "dev-laptop" and
"full-desktop" becomes "battlestation" or something and learns KVM...
I'd love to make a real boss machine and run KVM VFIO on it.

Docker is much easier to work with on laptops, which is why it is
still installed 'everywhere'

Also removed whatever software was there that allowed "virtual
networking" -- it never got used.  It just didn't spark joy, sorry!
