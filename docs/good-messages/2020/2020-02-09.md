WARNING! This is not a joke! Carry on reading or you will die! Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten years old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the government decided that the best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humanely as possible but it went wrong. The machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she finally died. Now every week on the day of her death, she returns to the person that reads this chain letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death.

31.3.Form Type Extension{Registering the Form Type Extension; The form.type_extension Tag & autoconfigure}

Registering the Form Type Extension
The only new method is getExtendedType() - we'll talk about that in a second. To tell Symfony that this form type extension exists and to tell it that we want to extend the TextareaType, we need a little bit of config. This might look confusing at first. Let's code it up, then I'll explain.
Open config/services.yaml. And, at the bottom, we need to give our service a "tag". First, put the form class and below, add tags. The syntax here is a bit ugly: add a dash, open an array and set name to form.type_extension. Then I'll create a new line for my own sanity and add one more option extended_type. We need to set this to the form type class that we want to extend - so TextareaType. Let's cheat real quick: I'll use TextareaType, auto-complete that, copy the class, then delete that. Go paste it in the config. Oh, and I forgot my comma!
As soon as we do this, every time a TextareaType is created in the system, every method on our TextareaSizeExtension will be called. It's almost as if each of these methods actually lives inside of the TextareaType class! If we add some code to buildForm(), it's pretty much identical to opening up the TextareaType class and adding code right there!

The form.type_extension Tag & autoconfigure
Now, two important things. If you're using Symfony 4.2, then you do not need to add any of this code in services.yaml. Whenever you need to "plug into" some part of Symfony, internally, you do that by registering a service and giving it a "tag". The form.type_extension tag says:

  Hey Symfony! This isn't just a normal service! It's a form type extension! So make sure you use it for that!

But these days, you don't see "tags" much in Symfony. The reason is simple: for most things, Symfony looks at the interfaces that your service implements, and adds the correct tags automatically. In Symfony 4.1 and earlier, this does not happen for the FormTypeExtensionInterface. But in Symfony 4.2... it does! So, no config needed... at all.
But then, how does Symfony know which form type we want to extend in Symfony 4.2? The getExtendedType() method! Inside, return TextareaType::class. And yea, we also need to fill in this method in Symfony 4.1... it's a bit redundant, which is why Symfony 4.2 will be so much cooler.

 Tip

Since Symfony 4.2 getExtendedType() method is deprecated in favor of getExtendedTypes() but you still need a dummy implementation of getExtendedType()

31.6.Form Type Extension{Adding a new Field Option; How CSRF Protection Works}

But, in TextareaSizeExtension, we can invent new options. Do it down in configureOptions(): add $resolver->setDefaults() and invent a new rows option with a default value of 10.
Now, up in buildView(), notice that almost every method is passed the final array of $options for this field. Set the rows attribute to $options['rows'].
Done. The rows will default to 10, but we can override that via a brand, new shiny form field option. Try it! Refresh, inspect the textarea and... yes! The rows attribute is set to 15.

How CSRF Protection Works
This is the power of form type extensions. And these are even used in the core of Symfony to do some cool stuff. For example, remember how every form automatically has an _token CSRF token field? How does Symfony magically add that? The answer: a form type extension. Press Shift+Shift and look for a class called FormTypeCsrfExtension.
Cool! It extends an AbstractTypeExtension class, which implements the same FormTypeExtensionInterface but prevents you from needing to override every method. We also could have used this same class.
Anyways, in buildForm() it adds an "event listener", which activates some code that will validate the _token field when we submit. We'll talk about events in a little while.
In finishView() - which is very similar to buildView() - it adds a few variables to help render that hidden field. And finally, in configureOptions(), it adds some options that allow us to control things. For example, inside the configureOptions() method of any form class - like ArticleFormType - we could set a csrf_protection option to false to disable the CSRF token.
Next: how could we make our form look or act differently based on the data passed to it? Like, how could we make the author field disabled, only on the edit form? Let's find out!

32.1.Tweak your Form based on the Underlying Data

New goal team! Remember this author field? It's where we added all this nice auto-complete magic. I want this field to be fully functional on the "new form", but disabled on the edit form: as wonderful as they are, some of our alien authors get nervous and sometimes try to change an article to look like it was written by someone else.
This is the first time that we want the same form to behave in two different ways, based on where it is used.
Let's see: on our new endpoint, the form creates the new Article object behind the scenes for us. But on the edit page, the form is modifying an existing Article: we pass this to the form.
So, hmm, in the buildForm() method of our form class, if we could get access to the data that was passed to the form - either the existing Article object or maybe nothing - then we could use that info to build the fields differently.
Fortunately... that's easy. The secret is the $options argument that's passed to us. Let's see what this looks like: dd($options) and then go back and refresh the edit page.
Wow! There are a ton of options. And all of these are things that we could configure down in configureOptions(). But, the majority of this stuff isn't all that important. However, there is one super-helpful key: data. It's set to our Article object! Bingo!
Now, open another tab and go to /admin/article/new.
Oh. This time there is no data... which makes sense because we never passed anything to the form. That's great! We can use the data key to get the underlying data.

32.5.Tweak your Form based on the Underlying Data{Conditionally Hiding / Showing a Field}

So... we'll add it! Copy the option name, go into ArticleFormType and, down in configureOptions(), add include_published_at set to false. This is enough to make this a valid option... with a default value.
Now, up in buildForm(), the $options array will always have an include_published_at key. We can use that below to say if ($options['include_published_at']), then we want that field. Remove it from above, then say $builder paste and... clean that up a little bit.
I love it! On the edit form, because we've overridden that option to be true, when we refresh... yes! We have the field! Open up the profiler for your form and click on the top level. Nice! You can see that a passed option include_published_at was set to true.
For the new page, we should not have that field. Try it! Woh! An error from Twig:

  Neither the property publishedAt nor one of the methods publishedAt(), blah blah blah, exist in some FormView class.

33.3.Form Model Classes (DTOs){Validation Constraints}

Validation Constraints
Mission accomplished! Right? Wait, no! We forgot about validation! For example, check out the email field on User: we did add some @Assert constraints above this! But... now that our form is not bound to a User object, these constraints are not being read! It is now reading the annotations off of these properties... and we don't have any!
Go back to your browser, inspect element on the form and add the novalidate attribute. Hit register to submit the form blank. Ah! We do have some validation: for the password and agree to terms fields. Why? Because those constraints were added into the form class itself.
Let's start fixing things up. Above the email property, paste the two existing annotations. I do need a use statement for this: I'll cheat - add another @Email, hit tab - there's the use statement - and then delete that extra line.
At this point, if you want to, you can remove these annotations from your User class. But, because we might use the User class on a form somewhere else - like an edit profile form - I'll keep them there.
One of the really nice things about using a form model class is that we can remove the constraints from the form and put them in the model class so that we have everything in one place. Above $plainPassword, add @Assert\NotBlank() and @Assert\Length(). Let's pass in the same options: message="" and copy that from the form class. Then copy the minMessage string, add min=5, minMessage= and paste.
Finally, above agreeTerms, go copy the message from the form, and add the same @Assert\IsTrue() with message= that message.
Awesome! Let's celebrate by removing these from our form! Woo! Time to try it! Find your browser, refresh and... ooook - annotations parse error! It's a Ryan mistake! Let's go fix that - ah - what can I say? I love quotes!
Try it again. Much better! All the validation constraints are being cleanly read from our model class.
Except... for one. Go back to your User class: there was one more validation annotation on it: @UniqueEntity(). Copy this, go back into UserRegistrationFormModel and paste this above the class. We need a special use statement for this, so I'll re-type it, hit tab and... there it is! This annotation happens to live in a different namespace than all the others.
Let's try this - refresh. Woh! Huge error!

  Unable to find the object manager associated with an entity of class UserRegistrationFormModel

It thinks our model class is an entity! And, bad news friends: it is not possible to make UniqueEntity work on a class that is not an entity class. That's a bummer, but we can fix it: by creating our very-own custom validation constraint. Let's do that next!

33.1.Form Model Classes (DTOs){Creating the Form Model Class}

I want to talk about a different strategy that we could have used for the registration form: a strategy that many people really love. The form class behind this is UserRegistrationFormType and it's bound to our User class. That makes sense: we ultimately want to create a User object. But this was an interesting form because, out of its three fields, two of them don't map back to a property on our User class! There is no plainPassword property or agreeTerms property on User. To work around this, we used a nice trick - setting mapped to false - which allowed us to have these fields without getting an error. Then, in our controller, we just need to read that data in a different way: like with $form['plainPassword']->getData()
This is a great example of a form that doesn't look exactly like our entity class. And when your form starts to look different than your entity class, or maybe it looks more like a combination of several entity classes, it might not make sense to try to bind your form to your entity at all! Why? Because you might have to do all sorts of crazy things to get that to work, including using embedded forms, which isn't even something I like to talk about.
What's the better solution? To create a model class that looks just like your form.

Creating the Form Model Class
Let's try this out on our registration form. In your Form/ directory, I like to create a Model/ directory. Call the new class UserRegistrationFormModel. The purpose of this class is just to hold data, so it doesn't need to extend anything. And because our form has three fields - email, plainPassword and agreeTerms - I'm going to create three public properties: email, plainPassword, agreeTerms.
Wait, why public? We never make public properties! Ok, yes, we could make these properties private and then add getter and setter methods for them. That is probably a bit better. But, because these classes are so simple and have just this one purpose, I often cheat and make the properties public, which works fine with the form component.

Can finally set "no autopickup types"

That was ANNOYING!!! If I disable them all because I want to autopickup only thrown items, it should - damn it all - autopickup only thrown items! What the hell were you thinking? If I want to autopickup everything, I'll check all the item types! It makes NO sense that unchecking them all also picks them all!

34.2.Custom Validator{Configuring the Annotation; Configuring your Annotation Properties}

Configuring the Annotation
Ok: let's bring this generated code to life! Step 1: make sure your annotation class - UniqueUser - is ready to go. In general, an annotation can either be added above a class or above a property. Well, you can also add annotations above methods - that works pretty similar to properties.
If you add a validation annotation above your class, then during validation, the value that's passed to that validator is the entire object. If you add it above a property, then the value that's passed is just that property's value. So, if you need access to multiple fields on an object for validation, then you'll need to create an annotation that can be used above the class. In this situation, I'm going to delete @UniqueEntity and, instead, add the new annotation above my $email property: @UniqueUser. Hit tab to auto-complete that and get the use statement.
Nice! Now, go back to your annotation class, we need to do a bit more work. To follow an example, press shift+ shift and open the core NotBlank annotation class. See that @Target() annotation above the class? This is a special annotation... that configures, um, the annotation system! @Target tells the annotation system where your annotation is allowed to be used. Copy that and paste it above our class. This says that it's okay for this annotation to be used above a property, above a method or even inside of another annotation... which is a bit more of a complex case, but we'll leave it.
What if you instead want your annotation to be put above a class? Open the UniqueEntity class as an example. Yep, you would use the CLASS target. The other thing you would need to do is override the getTargets() method. Wait, why is there an @Target annotation and a getTargets() method - isn't that redundant? Basically, yep! These provide more or less the same info to two different systems: the annotation system and the validation system. The getTargets() method defaults to PROPERTY - so you only need to override it if your annotation should be applied to a class.

Configuring your Annotation Properties
Phew! The last thing we need to do inside of UniqueUser is give it a better default $message: we'll set it to the same thing that we have above our User class: I think you've already registered. Paste that and... cool!
If you need to be able to configure more things on your annotation - just create more public properties on UniqueUser. Any properties on this class can be set or overridden as options when using the annotation. In UserRegistrationFormModel, I won't do it now, but we could add a message= option: that string would ultimately be set on the message property.
Before we try this, go to UniqueUserValidator. See the setParameter() line? The makes it possible to add wildcards to your message - like:

  The email {{ value }} is already registered

We could keep that, but since I'm not going to use it, I'll remove it. And... cool! With this setup, when we submit, this validator will be called and it will always fail. That's a good start. Let's try it!

34.1.Custom Validator{Generating the Constraint Validator}
Unfortunately, you can't use the @UniqueEntity() validation constraint above a class that is not an entity: it's just a known limitation. But, fortunately, this gives us the perfect excuse to create a custom validation constraint! Woo!
When you can't find a built-in validation constraint that does what you need, the next thing to try is the @Assert\Callback constraint. We use this in the Article class. But, it has one limitation: because the method lives inside an entity class - we do not have access to any services. In our case, in order to know whether or not the email is taken yet, we need to make a query and so we do need to access a service.

Generating the Constraint Validator
When that's your situation, it's time for a custom validation constraint. They're awesome anyways and we're going to cheat! Find your terminal and run:

php bin/console make:validator
Call the class, how about, UniqueUser. Oh, this created two classes: UniqueUser and UniqueUserValidator. You'll find these inside a new Validator/ directory. Look at UniqueUser first: it's basically a dumb configuration object. This will be the class we use for our annotation.
The actual validation is handled by UniqueUserValidator: Symfony will pass it the value being validated and a Constraint object - which will be that UniqueUser object we just saw. We'll use it to read some options to help us get our job done. For example, in the generated code, it reads the message property from the $constraint and sets that as the validation error. That's literally reading this public $message property from UniqueUser.

"2:05pm. Done with both breakfast and the book. It was brutal, I loved it. If this is anything to go by, Astrid's story (it is by the same author) is going to be sick.

Ok...here is the plan. More chilling, then chores, then I will resume work. I needed today as a reward.

Sure, I could read stuff past 6pm, but leisure is not nearly as fun when you are tired.

2:10pm. Today, rather than starting work on the typechecker, what I will do is go from the other end and investigate how VSCode plugins work. I'll take a look at a few tutorials. I know nothing about it at this point, hopefully I won't have to write JS wrappers by hand. VSCode is pretty popular and made by MS so there should be a .NET bridge somewhere.

3:10pm. Done with chores. Finally, I can do a bit of work. I am in high spirits. That story was just what I needed. I actually had high expectations and they were met.

3:15pm. On the subject of typechecking, I've been thinking of trying out TAPL again, but I've learned from my experience well enough by now. Books, especially PL books are pretty useless. PL aspires to be math, but it really should be more algorithmically inclined in order to be useful.

Algorithms are the true science. Everything of value in the world can be found in algorithms. Even before the age of computers and before science got overtaken by charlatanism of the current age, the search for algorithms is what drove development.

I really got taken for a hard ride by the math meme, and I won't fall for the same trick again.

3:20pm. I got sidetracked. Today let me just do some research on VSCode itself. I'll take it easy until I am ready, and then go all in.

How to Create a VSCode Extension

I guess I'll start with these baby videos and go from there."

35.1.Setup: For Dependent Select Fields{Adding the First Select Field}

We're going to tackle one of the most annoying things in Symfony's form system, and, I hope, make it as painless as possible... because the end result is pretty cool!
Log in as admin2@thespacebar.com, password engage and then go to /admin/article. Click to create a new article. Here's the goal: on this form, I want to add two new drop-down select elements: a location drop-down - so you can choose where in the galaxy you are - and a second dropdown with more specific location options depending on what you chose for the location. For example, if you select "Near a star" for your location, the next drop-down would update to be a list of stars. Or, if you select "The Solar System", the next drop-down will be a list of planets.

Adding the First Select Field
This is called a "dependent form field", and, unfortunately, it's one of the trickier things to do with the form system - which is exactly why we're talking about it! Let's add the first new field. Find your terminal and run

php bin/console make:entity
Modify the Article entity and create a new field called location. Make it a string field with yes to nullable in the database: the location will be optional. Now run:

php bin/console make:migration
and open the Migrations/ directory to check out that new file.
No surprises here, so let's go back and run it:

php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
Perfect!

36.2.Form Events & Dynamic ChoiceType choices{Dynamically Changing the Options}

Dynamically Changing the Options
The first step to get this working is not so different from something we did earlier. To start, forget about trying to use fancy JavaScript to instantly reload the specificLocationName drop-down when we select a new location. Yes, we are going to do that - but later.
Hit "Update" the save the location to "The Solar System". The first goal is this: when the form loads, because the location field is already set, the specificLocationName should show me the planet list. In other words, we should be able to use the underlying Article data inside the form to figure out which choices to use.
I'll add some inline documentation just to tell my editor that this is an Article object or null. Then, $location = , if $article is an object, then $article->getLocation(), otherwise, null.
Down below, copy the entire specificLocationName field and remove it. Then only if ($location) is set, add that field. For choices, use $this->getLocationNameChoices() and pass that $location.
Cool! Again, no, if we change the location field, it will not magically update the specificLocationName field... not yet, at least. With this code, we're saying: when we originally load the form, if there is already a $location set on our Article entity, let's add the specificLocationName field with the correct choices. If there is no location, let's not load that field at all, which means in _form.html.twig, we need to render this field conditionally: {% if articleForm.specificLocationName is defined %}, then call form_row().
Let's try this! Refresh the page. The Solar System is selected and so... sweet! There is our list of planets! And we can totally save this. Yep! It saved as Earth. Open a second tab and go to the new article form. No surprise: there is no specificLocationName field here because, of course, the location isn't set yet.
Our system now... sort of works. We can change the data... but we need to do it little-by-little. We can go to "Near a Star", hit "Update" and then change the specificLocationName field and save that. But I can't do it all at once: I need to fully reload the page... which kinda sucks!

Can you Hack the Options to Work?
Heck, we can't even be clever! Change location to "The Solar System". Then, inspect element on the next field and change the "Betelgeuse" option to "Earth". In theory, that should work, right? Earth is a valid option when location is set to solar_system, and so this should at least be a hacky way to work with the system.
Hit Update. Woh! It does not work! We get a validation error: This value is not valid. Why?
Think about it: when we submit, Symfony first builds the form based on the Article data that's stored in the database. Because location is set to star in the database, it builds the specificLocationName field with the star options. When it sees earth being submitted for that field, it looks invalid!
Our form needs to be even smarter: when we submit, the form needs to realize that the location field changed, and rebuild the specificLocationName choices before processing the data. Woh.
We can do that by leveraging form events.

#### Sunday 2020-02-09 18:32:01 by Christopher Haster

Fixed more bugs, mostly related to ENOSPC on different geometries

Fixes:
- Fixed reproducability issue when we can't read a directory revision
- Fixed incorrect erase assumption if lfs_dir_fetch exceeds block size
- Fixed cleanup issue caused by lfs_fs_relocate failing when trying to
  outline a file in lfs_file_sync
- Fixed cleanup issue if we run out of space while extending a CTZ skip-list
- Fixed missing half-orphans when allocating blocks during lfs_fs_deorphan

Also:
- Added cycle-detection to readtree.py
- Allowed pseudo-C expressions in test conditions (and it's
  beautifully hacky, see line 187 of test.py)
- Better handling of ctrl-C during test runs
- Added build-only mode to test.py
- Limited stdout of test failures to 5 lines unless in verbose mode

Explanation of fixes below

1. Fixed reproducability issue when we can't read a directory revision

   An interesting subtlety of the block-device layer is that the
   block-device is allowed to return LFS_ERR_CORRUPT on reads to
   untouched blocks. This can easily happen if a user is using ECC or
   some sort of CMAC on their blocks. Normally we never run into this,
   except for the optimization around directory revisions where we use
   uninitialized data to start our revision count.

   We correctly handle this case by ignoring whats on disk if the read
   fails, but end up using unitialized RAM instead. This is not an issue
   for normal use, though it can lead to a small information leak.
   However it creates a big problem for reproducability, which is very
   helpful for debugging.

   I ended up running into a case where the RAM values for the revision
   count was different, causing two identical runs to wear-level at
   different times, leading to one version running out of space before a
   bug occured because it expanded the superblock early.

2. Fixed incorrect erase assumption if lfs_dir_fetch exceeds block size

   This could be caused if the previous tag was a valid commit and we
   lost power causing a partially written tag as the start of a new
   commit.

   Fortunately we already have a separate condition for exceeding the
   block size, so we can force that case to always treat the mdir as
   unerased.

3. Fixed cleanup issue caused by lfs_fs_relocate failing when trying to
   outline a file in lfs_file_sync

   Most operations involving metadata-pairs treat the mdir struct as
   entirely temporary and throw it out if any error occurs. Except for
   lfs_file_sync since the mdir is also a part of the file struct.

   This is relevant because of a cleanup issue in lfs_dir_compact that
   usually doesn't have side-effects. The issue is that lfs_fs_relocate
   can fail. It needs to allocate new blocks to relocate to, and as the
   disk reaches its end of life, it can fail with ENOSPC quite often.

   If lfs_fs_relocate fails, the containing lfs_dir_compact would return
   immediately without restoring the previous state of the mdir. If a new
   commit comes in on the same mdir, the old state left there could
   corrupt the filesystem.

   It's interesting to note this is forced to happen in lfs_file_sync,
   since it always tries to outline the file if it gets ENOSPC (ENOSPC
   can mean both no blocks to allocate and that the mdir is full). I'm
   not actually sure this bit of code is necessary anymore, we may be
   able to remove it.

4. Fixed cleanup issue if we run out of space while extending a CTZ
   skip-list

   The actually CTZ skip-list logic itself hasn't been touched in more
   than a year at this point, so I was surprised to find a bug here. But
   it turns out the CTZ skip-list could be put in an invalid state if we
   run out of space while trying to extend the skip-list.

   This only becomes a problem if we keep the file open, clean up some
   space elsewhere, and then continue to write to the open file without
   modifying it. Fortunately an easy fix.

5. Fixed missing half-orphans when allocating blocks during
   lfs_fs_deorphan

   This was a really interesting bug. Normally, we don't have to worry
   about allocations, since we force consistency before we are allowed
   to allocate blocks. But what about the deorphan operation itself?
   Don't we need to allocate blocks if we relocate while deorphaning?

   It turns out the deorphan operation can lead to allocating blocks
   while there's still orphans and half-orphans on the threaded
   linked-list. Orphans aren't an issue, but half-orphans may contain
   references to blocks in the outdated half, which doesn't get scanned
   during the normal allocation pass.

   Fortunately we already fetch directory entries to check CTZ lists, so
   we can also check half-orphans here. However this causes
   lfs_fs_traverse to duplicate all metadata-pairs, not sure what to do
   about this yet.

41.4.A bit of Security Cleanup{Fetch EXTRA_LAZY}

Using the @method in BaseController
Ok, one more thing - and it's also unrelated to forms. Open BaseController. By extending AbstractController, this class gives us all the great shortcut method we love but it also overrides getUser() so that our editor knows that this method will return our specific User class.
After we did this, a wonderful SymfonyCasts user pointed out that the getUser() method on the parent class is marked as final with @final. When something is final it means that we are not allowed to override it. Symfony could enforce this by changing the method to be final protected function getUser(). Then, we would get an error! But, Symfony often uses the softer @final comment, which is just documentation, either to prevent breaking backward compatibility or because it's harder for Symfony to unit test code that has final methods.
Anyways, the method is intended to be final, which means that we're not supposed to override it. So, delete the method in our class. There's another nice solution anyways: above the class add @method User getUser().
That's it! That does the exact same thing: it hints to our IDE that the getUser() method returns our User object. Back in ArticleAdminController, if we delete getArticles() and re-type... yep! It works!
Phew! Amazing job people! That was a huge topic to get through. Seriously, congrats!
The Symfony form system is both massively powerful and, in some places, quite complex. It has the power to make you incredibly productive or just as unproductive if you use it in the wrong place or the wrong ways. So, be smart: and follow these two rules.
One: if your form looks quite different than your entity, either remove the data_class option and use the associative array the form gives you to do your work or bind your form to a model class. Two: if your form has a complex frontend with a lot of AJAX and updating, it might be easier - and a better user experience - if you skip the form and write everything with JavaScript. Use this tool in the right places, and you'll be happy.
Let me know what you guys are building! And, as always, if you have any questions, ask us down in the comments.
Alright friends, see ya next time.

38.1.PRE_SET_DATA: Data-based Dynamic Fields

On our form class, we're creating the specificLocationName field in two places: it's up in buildForm() and duplicated down inside of setupSpecificLocationNameField(). Because duplication is a bummer, let's fix it by calling $this->setupSpecificLocationNameField() from buildForm().
Except... hmm, there's a minor mismatch: in buildForm(), we're working with a form builder object, but the method expects a FormInterface object. It's a weird situation where these two objects happen to have the same add() method, but they are two totally different classes.
We're going to work around this by leveraging another form event. Remove the block where we first add the specificLocationName field. Oh, and we can remove the $location variable now too.
Let's think about how we could re-add this field using events: we basically want Symfony to call our callback, the moment the underlying "data" is set onto the form - the Article object. Use $builder->addEventListener() and listen on an event called FormEvents::PRE_SET_DATA. Two things: first, this time, we're attaching the event to the entire form, which means our callback will be passed info about the entire form. That's usually want you want: listening to a single field like we did before was a bit of a hack to allow us to remove and re-add the field at just the right moment.
Second, how do we know to use PRE_SET_DATA? When exactly is that called? Open ArticleAdminController: in the edit() action, we pass createForm() an Article object. When that happens, Symfony dispatches this PRE_SET_DATA event. In general, the FormEvents class itself is a great resource for finding out when each event is called and what you can do by listening to it. I won't do it here, but if you hold Command or Ctrl and click the event name to open that class, you'll find great documentation above each constant.
Add the callback with the same FormEvent $event argument. Then, get the underlying data with $data = $event->getData(). We know that this must be either an Article object or possibly null. If there is no data, just return and do nothing: we don't want to add the field at all for the new form.
If there is data, call $this->setupSpecificLocationNameField() and pass it $event->getForm(). This time, $event->getForm() will be the top-level form, because we added the listener to the top-level builder. For the location, pass $data->getLocation().
Cool! This code should work just like before. But actually, while events are nice, if I need to tweak my form based on the underlying data - like we're doing here - I prefer to avoid using events and just use the $options['data'] key. It's just a bit simpler. But, both solutions are fine.
Anyways, let's try it! I'll hit enter on the address bar to get a fresh page. And... yep! Because "Near a star" is selected as the location, the next field loaded with the correct list of stars.
We are now fully ready for the last, fancy step: adding JavaScript and AJAX to dynamically change the specificLocationName select options when the location changes. And... that's probably the easiest part!

"4:10pm. Focus me, focus. Read the documentation, not Twitter posts.

4:25pm. Focus, focus...

There is a bunch in the documentation on language plugins. That is what i need to study.

4:50pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features
"The process seems more complicated, but it provides two major benefits:

The Language Server can be written in any language
The Language Server can be reused to provide smart editing features for multiple editors"

So LSP is what I need.

4:55pm. I've come to a design decision.

I think that for the real segment, I will just disallow let statements due to their awkwardness there.

There is just no need to bother with them there.

5:05pm. https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide
"However, while implementing support for language features in VS Code, we found three common problems:

First, Language Servers are usually implemented in their native programming languages, and that presents a challenge in integrating them with VS Code, which has a Node.js runtime."

Yeah, this is the thing I've been wondering all this time. So far all the examples I've seen have been in Typescript. I certanly cannot reimplement all the necessary stuff in TS.

5:30pm. Done with lunch. Let me resume this.

6:05pm. Usually at this point I would stop for the day, but since I slacked so much earlier in the day, I will just continue for a while longer.

https://martinbjorkstrom.com/posts/2018-11-29-creating-a-language-server

This is what I am reading now.

Creating a LSP will really be a pain in the ass it seems, at least in the beginning.

http://www.omnisharp.net/
"OmniSharp is a set of tooling, editor integrations and libraries that together create an ecosystem that allows you to have a great programming experience no matter what your editor and operating system of choice may be."

I guess I will try installing this.

https://www.nuget.org/packages/OmniSharp.Extensions.LanguageServer/
"You can use this package to create a language server, that will be consumed by many clients"

Definitely sounds like what I need.

6:40pm. https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharp-language-server/blob/master/src/FSharpLanguageServer/Program.fs

I am currently looking at the stuff here. I hadn't realized LSP communicates using JSON.

6:50pm. https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharp-language-server

Ok, this is interesting. I might want to clone this and use it as a template.

I'll leave studying it as plan B.

Plan A will be to go with...

https://martinbjorkstrom.com/posts/2018-11-29-creating-a-language-server

I will study this in the depth and try to get something basic running tomorrow. Something that highlights some keywords in red, or basic autocomplte a -> abc. Something dumb like that to serve as hello world icebreaker.

6:55pm. I need to do this. Eventually I am going to figure out how to deal with all the type system features that Spiral requires, so it makes sense to start from the other end. Typechecking is not a big challenge by itself.

Unless I constantly want to jump back and forth between scripts like I did in v0.09, I need to write my own tooling. I can't leave this for later or to some adoring fan of Spiral. I can't leave the tough and dirty stuff to others. I need to do it myself.

7pm. The language that I am creating here is my own power that will sustain me.

It is a much bigger and better fishing net than v0.09.

7:05pm. All in all, I am glad I decided to go down this route. The question of designing let statements gave me a lot of consternation, but it seems leaving it out is the right answer.

The vast majority of Spiral code is going to be in the inferred segment, so I should kill myself trying to put special syntax into the thing.

I already mastered partial evaluation aspects with 0.09. Once I do the tooling and the typechecking, I will have mastered the low style of programming. The low style is the best style.

The higher (dependently typed) style is more expressive, but dependent types are a productivity wreck. They also necessitate dynamic runtimes so that makes the kind of use cases I am trying to hit with Spiral out of reach.

...Ah, damn it. I should studied physics in 2019 instead of type theory.

...I do not really mean it. I really did need to go through this once to form a proper view on math itself.

Well, things will go quietly.

It is really a pity RL is broken, but that will give me time to give Spiral another chance. This time I will do things right.

7:20pm. I won't abandon it again. This time for sure, I will turn it into power.

Without a doubt, better, newer hardware will uncover new vistas of research just like GPUs have.

I was just a bystander in the 10s. I was there when Hinton announced his breakthrough results in the Coursera course back in 2012. If possible, the next time that happens I want to be in the thick of things having anticipated what is to come.

The story of AI won't end here. It won't petter out here only to resurface 50-100 years from now.

The story of the coming Singularity will play out right here and in my lifetime. The true players are those actively trying to grasp the future.

They are never those who are making noise and just talking about it."
