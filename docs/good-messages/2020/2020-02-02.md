Javadoc generation also java9ified

The maven-javadoc-plugin (at the current release, 3.1.1) still lives
in a mostly pre-JPMS world, and boy does it show. Javadoc 9 introduces
handy new options to control what should be documented for a module,
based on what is declared for export in the module descriptor, all
of which can be figured out by javadoc itself. The maven-javadoc-plugin
forces all of that not to work right, by passing an explicit list of
packages, computed the wrong way, which overrides whatever convenient
selection option was passed to javadoc.

Interestingly, though the plugin has not been updated to handle the
new options specific to javadoc 9 (they just have to be passed as
<additionalOption>s), it does have a getPackageNamesRespectingJavaModules
method, which tries to duplicate what javadoc itself would do if passed
--show-packages exported—which would be ok, more or less, as long as
'--show-packages exported' was what you wanted, and if it were done right.
Alas, it doesn't seem to understand you might export a.b and not a.b.c,
so it can end up forcing the documentation of packages that were not
intended as API.

There seems to be one (maybe only one?) roundabout way to get the plugin
not to supply the list of package names, and thereby let javadoc just do
the right stuff it can already do. A fix for a reported bug MJAVADOC-365
tweaked the plugin's executeReport method to suppress the package list
if sourceFileExcludes or sourceFileIncludes are active. So it becomes
necessary to use one of those options.

Even that must be done with care. The list of includes or excludes can't
be empty, or the trick is ignored, but also can't include too much, lest
it once again override javadoc's efforts to do the right thing.

When the includes/excludes are not used, the plugin generates an argfile
by default that names only one source file, the module-info.java. So an
obvious idea would be to add sourceFileIncludes naming only that file.

That doesn't incur any reported errors; it just prevents javadoc from
running at all. Maven simply completes all the other 'site' activities,
says nothing at all about javadoc, and calls it success.

So the other almost-as-obvious workaround idea is to add
sourceFileExcludes, and specify some file that wasn't going to be
included anyway. But that causes a full enumeration of the other source
files to be generated and passed to javadoc, overriding its efforts to
do the right thing.

So it becomes necessary to use sourceFileExcludes with a wildcard pattern
to exclude everything (except the module-info.java file), producing the
same list of files (just one file) that was produced by default, while
also suppressing the list of packages. The pattern used here just excludes
all .java files under org/ (which is where all of them are, except for
module-info.java at top level).

That does the needed trick, but ends up leaving javadoc not finding any
classes to document at all; that is easily fixed with a --module option.

In passing, clean up three errors in javadoc comments that were flagged
by javadoc, once the excitement of just getting it to work died down,
and fix a comment that still referred to Java pre-9.

"9:40am. I am up. Let me chill for a while and then I will start. Today I will just focus on wrapping the parser and the partial evaluator (again).

9:50am. Yeah, again. Making a few steps forward and then back was a frequent occurrence back in 2017, and now that I am dealing with language design issues, so it will be now. The task is no longer to race to the finish line, so things are going to take longer.

10:10am. Let me just start. I should do some work in the morning. First let me take care of the parser.

10:20am.

```
        match d.SkipSpecial SpecRec with
        | Ok _ ->
            if is_global then
                let name_pats_body d = name_pats_body (fun _ d -> d.FailWith ExpectedFunction) d
                (name_pats_body .>>. (many (if_ (and' >>. name_pats_body))) >>= handle_inl_rec_block) d
            else
                d.Skip'(-1); d.FailWith RecNotAllowedLocally
```

```
| RecNotAllowedLocally -> "Recursive functions and blocks must be global."
```

Hacking the parser was even easier than I thought it would be.

10:30am. Enough resting, let me move to the next step.

The next step is definitely to put hash consing back in.

10:35am.

```
and RData =
    | RTyB
    | RTyPair of ConsedNode<Data * Data>
    | RTyKeyword of ConsedNode<KeywordTag * Data []>
    | RTyFunction of ConsedNode<Expr * StackSize * Ty [] * StackSize * Data [] * bool>
    | RTyRecord of ConsedNode<Map<KeywordTag, Data>>
    | RTyLit of Literal
    | RTyV of ConsedNode<Tag * Ty>
```

Thankfully there is only a tiny number of language primitives.

10:35am.

```
let data_to_rdata'' call_data =
    let m = Dictionary(HashIdentity.Reference)
    let m' = Dictionary(HashIdentity.Reference)
    let call_args = ResizeArray()
    let rec f x =
        match m.TryGetValue x with
        | true, v -> v
        | _ ->
            let memo r = m'.Add(x,r); r
            match x with
            | TyPair(a,b) -> memo <| TyPair(f a, f b)
            | TyKeyword(a,b) -> memo <| TyKeyword(a, Array.map f b)
            | TyFunction(a,b,c,d,e,z) -> m.Add(x,TyRR m.Count); TyFunction(a,b,c,d,Array.map f e,z)
            | TyRecord l -> memo <| TyRecord(Map.map (fun _ -> f) l)
            | TyV(T(_,ty) as t) -> m.Add(x,TyRR m.Count); call_args.Add t; TyRV ty
            | TyLit _ | TyB -> x
            | TyRV _ | TyRR _ -> failwith "Compiler error: TyRV and TyVV should not appear here."
    let x = Array.map f call_data
    call_args.ToArray(),x
```

Now...let me start by doing this one from scratch.

10:40am.

```
/// Unlike v0.1 and previously, the functions can now have cycles so that needs to be taken care of during memoization.
let data_to_rdata'' (hc : HashConsTable) call_data =
    let hc x = hc.Add x
    let m = Dictionary(HashIdentity.Reference)
    let call_args = ResizeArray()
    let rec f x =
        memoize m (fun _ ->
            match x with
            | TyPair(a,b) -> RTyPair(hc(f a, f b))
            | TyKeyword(a,b) -> RTyKeyword(hc (a, Array.map f b))
            | TyFunction(a,b,c,d,e,z) -> RTyFunction(hc(a,b,c,d,Array.map f e,z))
            | TyRecord l -> RTyRecord(hc(Map.map (fun _ -> f) l))
            | TyV(T(v,ty) as t) -> call_args.Add t; RTyV(hc (v,ty))
            | TyLit v -> RTyLit v
            | TyB -> RTyB
        ) x
    let x = Array.map f call_data
    call_args.ToArray(),x
```

Everything is immediately 100x easier, now that I do not have to worry about cycles in the pevaller.

10:50am.

```
let rdata_to_data' i (R call_data) =
    let m = Dictionary(HashIdentity.Reference)
    let r_args = ResizeArray()
    let rec f x =

Interesting project. I have few questions :

* Why are the compilation times so slow?

* Are all the extra keywords really needed? Couldn't a smart heuristic infer them?

I am designing a language with a rather similar type system, although I did not plan to target GPU. My main interest are efficient Futamura projections.
```

Let me bask in the joy for a bit here, and then I will take a break after I reply to this.

The next thing on the list of things that need to be doing is the codegen. Maybe I'll put macros back in while I am at it."

This is how I imagine the feeling of living and seeing the world under the impacts of global warming of 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
Introducing distortions to the normalized version of planet Earth in 2020 with 2°C above pre-industrial levels, slices of time and space are not fully recognizable but say something about both past and future.
The animal-like hand ripping the canvas' skin speaks of instincts and certain features of different bodies that evolved for protection, such as nails, teeth, thorns, etc. Characteristics that can both protect and harm.
The crawling hand represented in this piece can be seen just about enough to question if that is a human hand or an animal claw. A curved pointed horny nail has no beginning as if it has merged with the skin. Such a feature, that is not recognized as possible in our bodies today, suggests an evolution of the body; whilst the earthy color reveals that this transformation has happened under warmer conditions.
Through painting, I investigate how art-making operates concerning the decolonization of thought and the forming of a different relationship between humans and the earth, animals, and plants that inhabit it. 
The visuals I create are drawn from my personal experience, ecological issues, and Latin American colonial history. I believe craft making is a form of creating change and processing the absurdity of life.

Create Chandu_And_GF_Returns.c

In the previous problem Chandu bought some unsorted arrays and sorted them (in non-increasing order). Now, he has many sorted arrays to give to his girlfriend. But, the number of sorted arrays are very large so Chandu decided to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array. But he is too lazy to do that. So, he asked your help to merge the two sorted arrays into one sorted array (in non-increasing order).

Input:
First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M, denoting the size of the two sorted arrays.
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers, denoting the first sorted array A.
Third line of each test case contains M space separated integers, denoting the second array B.

Output:
For each test case, print (N + M) space separated integer representing the merged array.

33.5.Adding a Custom Voter{@IsGranted with a Subject}

But... what about using the @IsGranted() annotation?
Hmm... now there's a problem: can we use the annotation and still, somehow, pass in the Article object? Actually, yes!
Add @IsGranted(), pass it MANAGE and then a second argument: subject="article".
That's it! When you use subject=, you're allowed to pass this the same name as any of the arguments to your controller. This only works because we used the feature that automatically queries for the Article object and passes it as an argument. These two features combine perfectly. But, if you're ever in a situation where your "subject" isn't a controller argument, no worries, just use the normal denyAccessUnlessGranted() code. But, remove it in this case.
Let's... try it! Access granted! That was too easy. Go back to the voter and comment-out the author check again - let's really make sure this is working.
Now... yes! Access denied! Go put that code back.
Oh my gosh friends, we did it! We killed this tutorial! We have a great authentication system that allows both login form authentication and API authentication! We have a rich dynamic roles system and a voter system where we can control access with any custom rules. Oh, I love security! I hope you guys are feeling empowered to create your simple, complex, crazy, whatever authentication system you need. As always, if you have questions, ask us down in the comments.
Alright people, seeya next time!

5 games made in Python

A game - januar 2020

I have spend the month learning Python by building 5 games – 4 small classic games and 1 online multiplayer game.

The games are:
PONG
The classic game is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. You get points when your opponent doesn´t return the ball. Player A uses the arrow keys UP and DOWN and player B uses the w and s buttons to move up and down.
 

Snake
 In the game of Snake, the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board.  The snake starts at the center of the board and can move left, right, up and down and through the walls. The snake moves at a constant speed. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger.  The game ends when the snake moves into itself.  The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.
 

Connect4
To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time. The player uses the mouse or mousepad to play.
 

Tetris
Tetris has very simple rules: you can only move the pieces in specific ways; your game is over if your pieces reach the top of the screen; and you can only remove pieces from the screen by filling all the blank space in a line. You use the arrow key UP to turn the piece the way you want it (4 ways), arrow key LEFT to move it to the left and arrow key RIGHT to move it to the right. If you want to speed it up you can use the arrow key DOWN to set the piece much faster. 
 

Online Multigame (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
 

This is the way it is supposed to look like but I can´t get it to work so mine looks like this so far:

 

After finishing the tutorials for the 5 game I made  my own game called Dropping hearts
 

The player uses the arrow keys to move the girl (paddle) from left to right. She is going to catch as many hearts as possible. If a heart is not cauth she will loose a life. She starts with 3 lifes and after loosing 3 lifes she will die.
The game needs another version of  PyCharm to function so I have made a new repository for that game alone.

[2hr]Moving some asset files around a bit so it's a bit more organized. Create a clocking icon/animation to show all the timer task and a warning icon to so emergency timer. It's work in progress. Kind of works, but there is some bug and refactor needed.
Today, I played Overcooked 2 with my wife, it was pretty fun and challenging, which is perfect game, as I have tried some other coop game, such as Tools up, a overcooked like game but for moving house, which is okei, too easy, so we got bored after a while, and the main reason is that there is not much variant between rounds I guess. And Unrailed, which we also dislike, but because the game is too stressful, taxxing. Not super hard, but really stressful, which isn't nice.
Also, the dog got like health issue, like last week (last Sunday) I was playing with her and throw the floor ball into her face (we were playing catching), it looks fine at first, but then I think because she kept scratching her eye, it got some serious infection, so it got quite bad. We have put the collar of shame to her and wipe her eyes every few hours, but it got tired really fast because the dog kept waking us up mid night because her eye was really itchy, so we have to wipe her face for her. 4/10, not recommended, but an experience, nonetheless.
